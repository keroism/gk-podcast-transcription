1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,980
Rym: It's Thursday, October 6th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,261
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:13,768
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,557
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:18,650
Rym: Tonight we talk about Scott's shoes and handbag.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,190
Scott: Rym's handbag.

7
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,308
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,870
Rym: So many years ago, we were traveling from Otakon in Baltimore to Wildwood.

9
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,370
Scott: Why are you jumping to the main bit?

10
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:36,699
Rym: This is just, I'm talking about an anecdote.

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,270
Rym: I'm not talking about shoes and handbags specifically.

12
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,430
Rym: It is just an anecdote.

13
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,649
Scott: No, this is definitely main bit material.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,510
Scott: Somewhat related.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,990
Rym: So, Scott's trying to cover up for the fact that me and Pete were ready to go to the beach.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,690
Scott: Why don't you save the shit for the main bit when it's relevant?

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,979
Rym: It's Thursday, it's the lounge.

18
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:54,290
Rym: Whatever we want.

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,920
Scott: Yeah, okay.

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,229
Scott: Shove the lounge up your ass.

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,810
Rym: Basically, Scott made us wait for him to go to a mall and look at shoes.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,748
Rym: You're already in the mall.

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,370
Scott: Before we could go to the beach.

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,997
Rym: We were ready to leave.

25
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,609
Rym: I'm like, "Scott, let's get in the car and drive to the

26
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:09,730
Rym: beach.".

27
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,241
Rym: She's like, "No, I need shoes.

28
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:12,087
Rym: Right the fuck

29
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:12,409
Rym: now.".

30
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,730
Rym: Then he goes to the mall and dicks around.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,809
Scott: We were already in the mall.

32
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,830
Rym: Because none of the shoes match his handbag.

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,290
Scott: And you couldn't save this for the main bit.

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,961
Rym: Me and Pete are like, "We're going to go to GameStop.

35
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,947
Scott: Tell us what you've done with the

36
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:22,129
Scott: shoes.".

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,610
Scott: What are we going to say during the main bit now that we spent it all in the early bit and this is already in a previous episode?

38
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,409
Rym: I'm going to talk about your taste in shoes because it took you so fucking long and you didn't even buy any because none of them matched.

39
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:36,490
Rym: Did you buy shoes?

40
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,250
Scott: Fine, let's get past your moronic opening bit.

41
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,546
Rym: Did you buy shoes that day?

42
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,229
Scott: I don't even remember.

43
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:42,806
Scott: No, you didn't.

44
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:48,709
Scott: So, right now we've got some problems in this country.

45
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:49,326
Rym: We do.

46
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,349
Scott: Hurting everybody.

47
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:52,650
Scott: Deep in every people.

48
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:55,728
Scott: They took her germs.

49
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,270
Rym: They took her germs.

50
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,710
Scott: All the germs taken by the foreigners.

51
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,947
Scott: Taking their germs.

52
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:09,229
Rym: What would happen, and you see stories like this every now and then, if we just had people who were out of work in America.

53
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:14,330
Rym: Natural-born citizens do all this work that supposedly these immigrants are stealing.

54
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,729
Scott: Right, it's kind of like, you know, people always wonder, "Well, what if you opened a shoe factory in the US?

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,943
Scott: Would anyone work at

56
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:22,065
Scott: it?".

57
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:26,210
Scott: Or, you know, would it actually be economically feasible?

58
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,070
Scott: How would it work out if you had a shoe factory here?

59
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,370
Rym: Never mind the fact that there actually is a lot of manufacturing in America.

60
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:39,329
Rym: The problem is, for employment, that higher-end manufacturing is more skilled labor that requires fewer actual people.

61
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:39,868
Scott: Yep.

62
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:40,589
Rym: But I digress.

63
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:47,470
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, this question keeps being brought up, and people argue about it, but I've never seen anyone actually do it.

64
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,165
Scott: Like, open up, like, the textile mill in the US.

65
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:52,390
Scott: recently, you know?

66
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:57,910
Scott: I've seen a lot of, like, some guy move the candy factory to Canada where the sugar tariff is cheaper.

67
00:02:58,072 --> 00:02:59,289
Scott: I've seen that go on.

68
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:05,730
Scott: But I've never seen anyone try to, you know, get low-end labor in the US and not use illegal immigrants and whatever.

69
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:06,649
Scott: So, here's the story.

70
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:09,030
Scott: This farmer, right?

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:17,690
Scott: He goes, and he's trying to figure out how many people he needed to hire to harvest his thousand acres of corn and onions in Colorado.

72
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,719
Scott: So he's like, "Well, you know what?

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,425
Scott: Gosh darn

74
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:20,506
Scott: it.".

75
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,790
Scott: Maybe he's probably not a gosh darn it guy, but anyway.

76
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:24,122
Scott: Yeah.

77
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,210
Scott: He's just, you know, and he goes, he's like, "Look, I'm gonna try to hire Americans, right?

78
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,226
Scott: And pay them the wage that they should

79
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:31,407
Scott: get.".

80
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:38,149
Scott: So he's gonna pay him $10.50 an hour, right, to work on this farm, harvesting the corn and the onions.

81
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,389
Scott: So he goes out and he hires people, and you know what?

82
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,179
Scott: They fuckin' lined up.

83
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,629
Scott: He got plenty of people to show up.

84
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,170
Scott: Six hours later, right, what happens?

85
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,259
Scott: Well, they all quit.

86
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,110
Scott: Or at least the vast majority of them quit.

87
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,010
Scott: Most of them just left and never said anything.

88
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,129
Scott: Twenty-five of them said specifically, according to farm records, the work was too hard.

89
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,230
Scott: So he shipped in another truckload of Mexicans to get the job done.

90
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:11,610
Scott: And they were just happy to finish doing all that work, despite it being so hard.

91
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,211
Rym: Yeah?

92
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:16,589
Rym: Now, not to say that there is plenty of employment for everyone in America.

93
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:16,894
Rym: No.

94
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,550
Rym: Because I know that's not true.

95
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,050
Scott: Of course.

96
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,050
Rym: But someone on FARC, very, you know, in the middle of all the discussion about this article, said something very simple and I think very poignant.

97
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,250
Rym: They said, "I think tomatoes and onions should probably be a lot more expensive than they

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,330
Rym: are.".

99
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,430
Scott: Well, that's a separate issue of subsidies, and there was a big issue of slave labor to pick crappy Florida tomatoes.

100
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,102
Scott: Go read about Florida tomatoes.

101
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:38,930
Scott: This is fucked up shit.

102
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,546
Scott: Basically, they're growing tomatoes at a season in Florida.

103
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:44,470
Scott: It really sucks.

104
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,140
Scott: The tomatoes taste like nothing.

105
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:47,450
Scott: They pick them when they're green.

106
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,490
Scott: Well, you know, in New York even, Scott- They use chemicals to change the color to red, but they still don't taste like anything.

107
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,946
Rym: Scott, they do use chemicals to prevent the ripening of apples and bananas, too.

108
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:55,730
Rym: That's a common thing.

109
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:04,390
Scott: In fact- And we're going to spray chemicals to change the color, but they don't taste like anything.

110
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:05,997
Rym: Um, I don't know.

111
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,328
Rym: I'd have to read something about that.

112
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,410
Scott: Yeah, at least that's what I read.

113
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,150
Rym: I'm dubious, Scott, of your claim.

114
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,710
Scott: Anyway, that's what I read.

115
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:12,929
Rym: Okay, I'm just saying.

116
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,754
Rym: It's not a record.

117
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:14,740
Rym: Public record.

118
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:15,384
Rym: R.I.M.

119
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:16,350
Rym: is dubious.

120
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,886
Scott: It's some guy on the internet who's not dubious, right?

121
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:20,469
Scott: I mean, come on.

122
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,690
Scott: But, you know, the slave labor picking those tomatoes is a huge problem, so here you go.

123
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,110
Rym: Scott, I can tell you who's not dubious.

124
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,930
Rym: The guy- Who wrote the article?

125
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:37,246
Rym: The guy at the protest, you know, the Wall Street protest, who I walked past today, getting lunch, who is holding up a sign that said, "Frankenfood

126
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,850
Rym: kills.".

127
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:38,969
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,190
Rym: Yeah, dude.

129
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,703
Rym: Yeah.

130
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,106
Rym: Okay.

131
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:43,818
Rym: Kills what?

132
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:44,769
Rym: I mean, Wall Street?

133
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,810
Scott: Kills non-Frankenfood?

134
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,528
Rym: I don't know.

135
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,364
Scott: I don't know.

136
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:48,590
Scott: Anyway.

137
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,030
Scott: Uh, yeah, that would have been a better opening bit.

138
00:05:51,110 --> 00:06:00,950
Rym: Well, there was that, uh, the Mike Rowe TED Talk that we bring up kind of often, because it's a great TED Talk, where he basically says that Americans are allergic to and afraid of hard work.

139
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:12,790
Rym: And, personally, I think we have a really messed up world where the jobs that are the shittiest, that hurt you the most, that are the most mind-numbing, the most tedious, also pay the least.

140
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:23,490
Rym: Right, and it's like, you know, those people- And yet the most fun jobs, like race car driver, a professional hockey player, pay the most.

141
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:27,530
Scott: Well, I mean, I can sort of agree with those also paying a lot.

142
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:36,669
Scott: I mean, they probably pay more than they should, but they should still pay a lot, you know, because it's incredibly hard to do, and people are willing to pay to see it.

143
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,830
Scott: You know, part of how much you get paid is how much people are willing to pay for you to do it, right?

144
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,670
Scott: So maybe the answer is that people should be willing to pay more- How much are you willing to pay to have someone remove the trash from the sidewalk?

145
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:48,913
Rym: All the money.

146
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:55,510
Rym: I will give up on every luxury I have rather than face the prospect of the poop and trash not disappearing.

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,410
Scott: That's correct.

148
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,129
Rym: That is probably my number one thing.

149
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,530
Scott: But the sanitation guys are willing to do it for whatever they are currently getting paid?

150
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,309
Rym: Except when they strike.

151
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,090
Scott: Right, but they're not striking right now, which means they must be happy with their current deal, which means everything's cool, right?

152
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:09,909
Rym: I guess.

153
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,819
Scott: They're not demanding baseball player money.

154
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:13,689
Scott: They want their trash to get removed too.

155
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:19,650
Rym: Yeah, of course we have the problem where if people are desperate enough for work, they will do shitty jobs for very little money.

156
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,769
Rym: But what's interesting is that despite all the claims that our economy is, uh, fuck the fuck up.

157
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:26,560
Rym: Yeah, fuck the fuck up.

158
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:26,863
Rym: Still.

159
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:27,226
Rym: Still.

160
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:28,085
Scott: It is still.

161
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:37,244
Rym: That, uh, a guy can't pay people almost eleven bucks an hour to work six hours a day doing something that's easy.

162
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:40,370
Rym: if, uh, mind-numbing and body-crushing to do.

163
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,701
Scott: Yeah, well, it's not easy.

164
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:42,630
Scott: I'm not gonna say that.

165
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:43,389
Scott: It's not easy.

166
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,172
Scott: But you know what?

167
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:46,239
Scott: If I had to, I would do it.

168
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,150
Scott: And even if I passed out, I would just force myself to do it.

169
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,628
Scott: I... If that was the job that was available to me...

170
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,630
Rym: I think I might just resort to crime.

171
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:54,909
Scott: Oh, okay.

172
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,030
Rym: Because I remember at RIT that one summer when I, uh, I didn't work at DiBella's again.

173
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,910
Scott: You worked in the pie factory?

174
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,372
Rym: I worked for a temp agency.

175
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:06,380
Rym: So every day, like, they'd call me and be like, "Hey, we got a gig for today.

176
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,901
Rym: Do you want

177
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:06,981
Rym: it?".

178
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,890
Rym: I worked a machine that fed pie tins into another machine that made apple pies.

179
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:19,209
Scott: Did you get any pies?

180
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,574
Scott: No.

181
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,970
Scott: Not even one pie?

182
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,810
Rym: One of the most horrifying things... They're frozen apple pies.

183
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,230
Rym: Oh.

184
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,064
Rym: The most horrifying thing about this was that, basically, the way the machine worked is.

185
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,730
Rym: I loaded in pie tins.

186
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,110
Rym: I probably loaded in a hundred thousand pie tins.

187
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:34,898
Scott: That many?

188
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:35,708
Scott: There's no way.

189
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:48,430
Rym: Seriously, literally, what I would do is I'd take a box that had, like, a thousand pie tins in it, cut it open, take all the pie tins out, climb up a ladder, and throw them into a machine.

190
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,183
Scott: It didn't matter how they went in the machine?

191
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:50,850
Scott: It sorted them out?

192
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,191
Scott: Well, no.

193
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,375
Rym: They were, like, stacked.

194
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,202
Rym: I had to put them in these big, like, tracks.

195
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,410
Rym: There were four tracks that I'd keep all the tracks full.

196
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:56,870
Scott: All right.

197
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:03,770
Rym: And as fast as I could do this, someone else was bringing more boxes, each with a thousand pie tins in it.

198
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,069
Scott: Did the pies come out that fast?

199
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:05,589
Scott: Yes.

200
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,076
Scott: Wow.

201
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:14,530
Rym: So, down the line, other stuff happened, and there was a cooker and a freezer and all this stuff, but there was the apple pie slurry.

202
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,888
Rym: It was a tank bigger than you can possibly imagine, filled with a horrifying mixture of apple pie.

203
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,170
Scott: Did it smell like apple pie at least?

204
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,850
Rym: It smelled like burning cinnamon chemical, as far as I could tell.

205
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,569
Scott: That's not too bad.

206
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,950
Rym: And sickly sweet apple.

207
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:32,809
Scott: That's pretty good.

208
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:33,330
Rym: And syrup.

209
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:38,570
Rym: And basically, the slurry was going blorp, blorp, blorp, blorp, blorp into all these pie tins.

210
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,630
Rym: But every now and then, it would get clogged, and an engineer would come over with a stick and shove it into the slurry mixer.

211
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,630
Scott: Was it a clean stick?

212
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,394
Rym: I guess.

213
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,790
Rym: It was covered in apple.

214
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,272
Scott: Okay.

215
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,189
Scott: That's fine.

216
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,708
Rym: And it was soul-crushing and mind-numbing and paid, I think, $6.75 an hour.

217
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:56,098
Scott: This is $10.50.

218
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:57,250
Scott: This is significantly better than that.

219
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,438
Scott: Yeah.

220
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,083
Scott: There hasn't been that much inflation since then.

221
00:09:59,124 --> 00:09:59,770
Scott: This pays more.

222
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:08,629
Rym: And the worst part is, I was doing the job way fast, and the guys who worked there full-time were like, "Slow down, man, or they'll send half of us

223
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:08,870
Rym: home.".

224
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:10,641
Scott: Whoa.

225
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,417
Rym: Because they didn't even need all those employees.

226
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,970
Rym: The guys worked slow, because otherwise half of them didn't need to be there.

227
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:16,130
Scott: Okay.

228
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,172
Rym: And you know what?

229
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,440
Rym: I don't know what I would do.

230
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,950
Rym: If that was my life, I wouldn't resort to crime right away.

231
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:27,209
Rym: But I would do anything to not have to do that.

232
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:32,090
Scott: But someone has to do it, otherwise society won't function.

233
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,330
Scott: I know, but at the same time- So who's gonna be that someone?

234
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,707
Scott: At the same time, six whatever an hour- But if everyone agrees with you and says, "I'm not doing it,".

235
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:39,070
Scott: then what?

236
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,247
Rym: Well, then the- No one eats.

237
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,967
Rym: No, then the hourly rate has to go up.

238
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:42,518
Scott: Okay.

239
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,071
Rym: You pay.

240
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,998
Rym: And what did Adam Smith say in Wealth of Nations?

241
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,930
Rym: That any job that is not worth paying a living wage to do- Isn't worth doing.

242
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,490
Rym: Is not valued enough by the society to be done.

243
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:53,837
Scott: Yep.

244
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,096
Rym: Anyway, we're not economists.

245
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:56,558
Rym: We're just-.

246
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:58,950
Rym: I don't think we have a point here.

247
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,036
Scott: The point is, Americans are pussies, right?

248
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,221
Scott: And there are jobs out there.

249
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:08,170
Scott: I have seen places that are hiring, but people just don't want those jobs.

250
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,409
Rym: Dude, in New York right now, it is so hard to get good tech workers, despite the fact that Wall Street just laid off like 10,000 people.

251
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,790
Rym: Right.

252
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:21,370
Scott: There's plenty of empty jobs if you A, have skills, or B, are just willing to suck it up and do a job you don't think you want to do.

253
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,169
Rym: It's not just that.

254
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:30,127
Scott: There's so many people, they had a job playing solitaire all day, they got laid off, and now they don't want to work at Home Depot, which is hiring, and so what do they do?

255
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:30,548
Scott: Nothing.

256
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,450
Scott: They sit at home and cry.

257
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,110
Rym: So, the other trouble is that most people are not willing to relocate.

258
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:35,950
Scott: That's also true.

259
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,530
Rym: I mean, look at people who graduated from RIT.

260
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,821
Scott: You can go work on this farm if you move to western Colorado.

261
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:41,830
Scott: You'll pick corn and onions.

262
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:51,870
Rym: All these people we knew at RIT who got the same degree as we did, but they stayed in Rochester, where the job pool's not that great because every RIT student also wants to stay in Rochester.

263
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,641
Rym: If they move anywhere, they can get a job.

264
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,730
Rym: Well, anywhere real.

265
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:03,230
Scott: Well, people are willing to relocate to sit in the street and protest, but they're not willing to relocate to work.

266
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,330
Rym: Oh my god, I could not get out of my office because the protest came up to surround my block.

267
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:22,170
Rym: There's a park across the street, which I think they put in gaslights, but I literally had to shove the door of my building open into people, like pushing them physically out of the way, and push and shove my way through a crowd just to get home.

268
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:24,769
Rym: And I got a lot of dirty looks.

269
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,090
Scott: For once, I'm kind of glad that I'm in the touristy area and not in the Wall Street area.

270
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,444
Rym: But it wasn't the angry yelling kid protesters with no shirts smelling of incense.

271
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,490
Rym: It was all old union guys.

272
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,250
Scott: Old union guys, what's up?

273
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,111
Scott: And you know what?

274
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:57,169
Rym: While I'm pessimistic because the protests don't seem to have any goal other than saying we're discontent, they've got old people on their side now, and seeing that gigantic march of 30 to 50 year old union guys, it looks like an actual movement now.

275
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,030
Rym: Looks like.

276
00:12:58,951 --> 00:12:59,612
Scott: See, here's the thing.

277
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,374
Scott: We've got to measure it by how far it goes.

278
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:04,840
Scott: When it gets to the streets with numbers.

279
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:07,063
Scott: Streets with numbers, not avenues with numbers.

280
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:11,350
Scott: When it's so big it's touching streets with numbers, then I'll go down there every day.

281
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,134
Rym: Actually, you know what I'd like to see?

282
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:18,530
Rym: If they formed a council or something and made a list of demands that was reasonable?

283
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,652
Scott: That's not necessary.

284
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:23,216
Scott: I think it's better to just keep it the Internet way.

285
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:26,442
Scott: Don't try to bring it into the realm of the old people.

286
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:27,685
Scott: Don't go down to their level.

287
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,129
Scott: Force them to come and interact the Internet way.

288
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:30,610
Scott: Don't go.

289
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,668
Rym: What I'd love to see is some Democratic senators should just go down and be like, all right, I'll talk to you.

290
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:37,249
Scott: What's he going to say?

291
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,852
Rym: I don't know.

292
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,402
Rym: Just get them to talk to him and then he'll get a lot of good PR.

293
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,270
Rym: And that will give the movement legitimacy.

294
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,430
Scott: Legitimacy because someone came and talked to you?

295
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,590
Rym: Yeah, if the government comes and talks to you, that actually counts for a lot of senators like, all right, that doesn't mean he's going to do anything.

296
00:13:49,890 --> 00:14:00,830
Rym: No, but it means that if the left wing or centrist or objective media had even one testicle between them, they could report on it with some air of legitimacy.

297
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:01,473
Scott: No, no.

298
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:01,995
Rym: Yeah.

299
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:02,860
Rym: Anyway, they could.

300
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,730
Scott: You got any news over there?

301
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,151
Rym: I do.

302
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:11,710
Rym: So speaking of legitimacy, there's been a movement lately and Reebok and all these shoe companies.

303
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,995
Scott: Why don't you save this for the fucking main bit?

304
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:19,910
Scott: You're like, we're using all your shoe bits now and you're not going to have any shoe bits when it actually comes time for the real show.

305
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,909
Rym: Scott, I think you underestimate how many shoe bits I have.

306
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,068
Scott: Clearly too many.

307
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,090
Rym: I got a lot to say about shoes.

308
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,549
Scott: Well, you can just carry the whole show then.

309
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:37,330
Rym: Because unlike you, when I go to buy shoes, I don't prevent other people from getting to the beach and I don't dither forever debating which shoe looks better.

310
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,819
Scott: Right.

311
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:38,147
Scott: OK.

312
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,589
Rym: Captain took forever to not buy shoes.

313
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,031
Scott: Sure.

314
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,819
Rym: So there's all these shoes lately that are like.

315
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,424
Rym: they make claims like, oh, they make your balance better.

316
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,947
Rym: They tone your muscles better.

317
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,370
Rym: They put they do stuff.

318
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:54,930
Scott: And it's like they just have a giant soul that's sort of rounded to force you to walk in a weird way.

319
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,291
Rym: Yep.

320
00:14:56,014 --> 00:15:00,290
Rym: And I know a lot of people who've said, oh, I'm wearing these shoes for various reasons.

321
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:04,290
Scott: I've seen I saw ads for the shoes months and months, maybe over a year ago.

322
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,570
Rym: Straight up claims like we have science that says these shoes.

323
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,510
Scott: The first time I ever saw one of those ads, I saw the ad before I ever saw the shoe.

324
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,270
Scott: The first time I ever saw one of those ads in the subway, I looked at it.

325
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,145
Scott: And two seconds later, I'm like, there's no way.

326
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:16,670
Scott: That's bullshit.

327
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,229
Rym: I was like, that is complete bullshit.

328
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,770
Scott: And then I saw people doing it and I was like, all right, whatever, dude.

329
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:22,588
Scott: That's bullshit.

330
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,930
Rym: I know some people who are wearing them, but I just said, like, you know, I'm dubious.

331
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,108
Rym: I don't think these do what you think they do.

332
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,749
Rym: But, you know, if you believe the.

333
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,045
Rym: You spent your money on them.

334
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,172
Rym: Well, guess what?

335
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:41,910
Rym: The FTC came down like a ton of bricks on Reebok, and they have to refund $25 million in these shoes because every claim they made is complete bullshit.

336
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:42,455
Rym: No.

337
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:44,778
Rym: Good job, FTC.

338
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,450
Rym: Now, if you just go after the homeopathy.

339
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:48,175
Scott: Yeah, FTC.

340
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:52,510
Scott: FTC is weird because, like, once in a while, they hammer someone for false advertising, right?

341
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,230
Scott: But they either don't do a complete hammering and they don't hammer enough.

342
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,094
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

343
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,305
Rym: They did a complete hammer of Reebok.

344
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:03,150
Rym: Yeah, which is a unit of Adidas, if you didn't know that.

345
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,559
Scott: I didn't know Adidas bought them.

346
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,690
Scott: I thought Reebok was number three.

347
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,625
Rym: Basically, the FTC was like, yeah, your claims are all bullshit.

348
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:09,249
Rym: Fuck you.

349
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,150
Rym: And they also made a general statement saying all you other people selling similar shoes.

350
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:15,750
Rym: Yeah, we're coming.

351
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:26,010
Rym: So Skechers is probably also going to get shut down by this because as far as I can tell, there is no legitimate evidence that any of these funny shoes have any benefits.

352
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,490
Scott: Well, I mean, maybe you personally just think they're more comfortable.

353
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,092
Scott: That's fine.

354
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:34,950
Rym: But anyone claiming that they, you know, increase muscle tone or help with back problems.

355
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,990
Scott: Yeah, walking with wearing weird shoes does not give more exercise than walking.

356
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:42,503
Scott: You know what gives more exercise?

357
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:43,650
Scott: More walking.

358
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:51,230
Rym: I have seen some studies talking about if you walk around barefoot, your muscles grow faster and some stuff.

359
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:52,338
Rym: But that's barefoot.

360
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,689
Rym: That's not a funny looking shoe.

361
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:59,030
Rym: And also, while walking around barefoot may have some benefits.

362
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:05,450
Rym: At the same time, if you're running a race, running shoes will make you faster than running barefoot, probably.

363
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,269
Scott: Otherwise, the Olympians wouldn't fucking wear them.

364
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,990
Scott: If going barefoot was so great, then Olympians, you know, it's like people always like, oh, what's the best?

365
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:21,030
Scott: And I'm just like, well, if you're ever wondering what the best is, look at the people who are the best in the world and whatever they're doing is probably what it is.

366
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,480
Scott: Like, what's the best bathing suit?

367
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,990
Scott: That one that the Olympians use.

368
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,156
Scott: What's the best car?

369
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,426
Scott: The F1 car that Michael Schumacher used to drive.

370
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,316
Scott: You know, what's the best shoe?

371
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:34,290
Scott: Whatever shoe that, you know, Usain Bolt is wearing, that's probably the best shoe there is.

372
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,154
Scott: You should get that one.

373
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:36,138
Scott: Right.

374
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,369
Scott: It's not hard to come up, figure out what the best shoe is.

375
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:53,110
Rym: So anyway, once again, if you trust anything you see in an advertisement that doesn't have science behind it, you can pretty much assume that as soon as you saw that ad, I appear behind you and said, it's probably bullshit.

376
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,350
Scott: Yeah.

377
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:58,221
Scott: In fact, you can just take and get an MP3 of us saying that's bullshit.

378
00:17:58,362 --> 00:17:59,706
Scott: Yeah, probably bullshit.

379
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,270
Scott: Most definitely bullshit.

380
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,174
Scott: We are dubious.

381
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:02,897
Scott: That is bullshit.

382
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,670
Scott: Just keep it on repeat and have it on all the time on your headphones.

383
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:05,991
Scott: Yep.

384
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,469
Scott: Just all day.

385
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,891
Rym: So things of the day.

386
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:16,716
Rym: I like cupcakes.

387
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,359
Rym: You like cupcakes?

388
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,508
Scott: Cupcakes.

389
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:21,848
Rym: So nothing's better than epic cupcakes.

390
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:26,420
Rym: This is a cooking video of how to make epic cupcakes and it's pretty great.

391
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,197
Scott: Pretty great?

392
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,462
Rym: It's pretty great.

393
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:35,199
Rym: I laughed at this and even if you don't like the content of this other than the fact that it's about making cupcakes, I think you'll enjoy it.

394
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,033
Scott: Uh huh.

395
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:42,500
Rym: Also, it was a collaborative project and it was poking around and I found what looks like the animatic for the people who made this thing.

396
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,119
Scott: This is an animated cupcake.

397
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,533
Scott: It is.

398
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,496
Scott: This is smelling of pony.

399
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,920
Rym: You suggested I use this as a thing of the day.

400
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,039
Scott: I did not suggest it.

401
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,517
Scott: You did.

402
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,265
Scott: Seriously.

403
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:52,720
Scott: I suggested it sarcastically.

404
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,349
Rym: Uh huh.

405
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,056
Scott: Uh huh.

406
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:59,780
Scott: And then you legitimately used it and you have thus destroyed the streak of keeping the pony out of the show.

407
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:00,317
Rym: Pony?

408
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:01,399
Scott: That's right.

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,619
Rym: Regardless, this is pretty great.

410
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:04,920
Scott: It is pretty great.

411
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,580
Rym: The voice acting.

412
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,958
Scott: Keep it out of, keep the pony out of the show.

413
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:10,240
Rym: The voice acting is surprisingly.

414
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,739
Scott: It's not the original voice actors, but it might as well be.

415
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,060
Rym: It's really great.

416
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:15,557
Scott: Yep.

417
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:20,680
Scott: Okay, so, you ever seen that sign that says keep calm and carry on with the picture of the crown?

418
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,080
Rym: Yep.

419
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,560
Scott: And you see it on t-shirts and you see it on all kinds of shit all over the place.

420
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,979
Scott: Well, you ever wonder where the fuck that came from?

421
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:29,179
Rym: Uh, not until just now.

422
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,720
Scott: Well, I did wonder- Because you wouldn't bring it up unless there was some story here.

423
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,578
Scott: I did wonder where the fuck it came from, but I never found out until finally this article showed up randomly and I was like, "Oh, finally I found out where the fuck this thing came

424
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:39,760
Scott: from.".

425
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,140
Scott: And actually, it's sort of an incredible story.

426
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,860
Scott: Basically, to sum it up, you can read this to get all the details.

427
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:50,460
Scott: Some guy in a used bookstore or something found the poster.

428
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,239
Scott: It was an old British war poster that never got used.

429
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,740
Scott: They just, they made them, but they never used them and there are only, like, not many remaining.

430
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:06,567
Scott: They used these other ones instead that were not as cool, such as the other ones that they did use said, "Freedom is in peril.

431
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,414
Scott: Defend it with all your

432
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:07,656
Scott: might.".

433
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:23,540
Rym: And- See, it's funny because when I saw, when I first saw this- When I first saw Keep Calm and Carry On, I thought it was kind of- A protest against people flipping out about this terrorism BS.

434
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,876
Rym: I thought it was like, "Just

435
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:25,140
Rym: relax.".

436
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,860
Scott: No, it was a legitimate World War II Hitler's bombing us, but Keep Calm poster that never got used.

437
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,700
Rym: So, a question for you, Scott.

438
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,859
Scott: It just got printed, yeah.

439
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,900
Rym: How come we as a society can't go back to that mindset when we have enemies?

440
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:49,340
Rym: Because, remember in those days- How come we can't just say, you know, stiff upper lip- We can't even pick fucking onions.

441
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,640
Scott: How are we supposed to Keep Calm and Carry On when Hitler is fucking bombing us?

442
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,112
Scott: Scott, to be fair, it's really hard to pick onions.

443
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:58,579
Rym: 25 people said so.

444
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,183
Scott: Pussy, pussy.

445
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,260
Scott: Alright, so some guy found this poster.

446
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,309
Scott: He hung it up in his store.

447
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,320
Scott: Everyone thought it was cool.

448
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:09,699
Scott: So, he started making merch with the thing on it and he said, "Listen, I don't care if anyone else uses this sign because I didn't even make it.

449
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,536
Scott: Just give me credit for discovering

450
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:11,657
Scott: it.".

451
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,800
Scott: You know, because he sort of rediscovered it, right?

452
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,139
Scott: It was lost to history.

453
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:19,699
Scott: But then some other people basically took it and made merch to sell.

454
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,678
Scott: Didn't give him credit for discovering it.

455
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,419
Scott: And tried to trademark it.

456
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,579
Scott: And the guy even asked the crown, you know, if he could use it.

457
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,559
Scott: You know, the British crown.

458
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:29,612
Scott: And they were like, "Yeah, sure.

459
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:29,733
Scott: Go

460
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:30,179
Scott: ahead.".

461
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,700
Scott: It's sort of this big, sordid tale.

462
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:37,880
Scott: And it's best summed up by this one post here, this Metafilter comment.

463
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:41,880
Scott: "Worried about your livelihood printing these posters that you didn't create?

464
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,536
Scott: Keep calm and fuck

465
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:43,759
Scott: off.".

466
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:55,171
Scott: So yeah, you should read this thing because it's a pretty fascinating history of something that is a pretty popular slogan and... I guess, logo?

467
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:56,057
Scott: Slogan thing?

468
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:56,400
Scott: I don't know.

469
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,819
Rym: Very briefly, in the meta moment, we'll be at the New York Comic Con as press and professionals only.

470
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,680
Rym: If you want to hang out with us, email us or tweet us and we will possibly be able to hang out with you a little bit.

471
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:07,900
Rym: The Book Club book was The Ear, The Eye, The Arm.

472
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,820
Rym: The episode about it will be up shortly!

473
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:13,920
Scott: Go visit us on the internets and all the internet places.

474
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,600
Scott: Look for GeekNights or Front Row Crew on the Facebooks, Twitters.

475
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,240
Rym: Yes, our YouTube channel, which is actually my YouTube channel.

476
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:30,920
Rym: GeekNights Rym, which we link to periodically, has all of our lectures from PAX East 2011, a bunch of other videos from us, and another show we launched called Radio Free Equestria.

477
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,540
Scott: And next year, MAGFest.

478
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:34,059
Rym: Oh my god.

479
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,560
Scott: Oh, and this Saturday is Nerd NYC Recess, but we probably won't go...

480
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,978
Rym: We might not go, because it's going to be really warm outside, but...

481
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:42,440
Scott: Nerd NYC Recess is this Saturday.

482
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,480
Rym: Yes, in New York.

483
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,368
Scott: As in Saturday, October 8th.

484
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:50,400
Rym: Burning Apocalypse Con is on 11/11/11.

485
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,589
Rym: We will be there!

486
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:52,980
Rym: I will be running a game.

487
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,438
Scott: Yeah, October 8th is recess.

488
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:57,080
Rym: In fact, everyone who goes will be running a game.

489
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,680
Scott: That's how it works.

490
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,900
Rym: Even though, as much as I love you, Luke Crane, your math on how many games need to be run is not correct.

491
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,680
Scott: That's correct.

492
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:08,800
Rym: And I foresee trouble toward the evening on the last day.

493
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,830
Scott: Yeah, no kidding.

494
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:10,620
Scott: Anyway.

495
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:24,615
Rym: That aside, I'll just tell you all now, I know many times we get invited to conventions, and we often don't go, usually because we have other commitments, but if you want us to attend a convention that you attend, or you just, you know...

496
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,379
Scott: Or you run.

497
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,750
Rym: Or you're some weirdo, and you're trying to get us to attend some con that you've never actually been to, contact the con rather than contacting us, because you tell us, "Hey, you should go to

498
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:35,275
Rym: X-Con.".

499
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,739
Rym: I'm not going to take any action on that.

500
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:44,055
Rym: But if you say, "Hey, X-Con, the GeekNights guys are awesome, get them as guests," and X-Con comes to us and says, "Hey, would you like to be

501
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:44,338
Rym: guests?"

502
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,060
Rym: It is much more likely we will say yes.

503
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,520
Scott: Because it is much more likely they'll give us transportation and lodging.

504
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,001
Rym: Yes.

505
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:55,206
Rym: Now, if you want to get us transportation and lodging, I mean, for PAX.

506
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,457
Rym: one year, we paid to fly John St.

507
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:58,080
Rym: John to PAX.

508
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:08,236
Scott: So if you want to pay for us to fly wherever the hell and give us a hotel room, I'll go fucking Madagascar for a convention.

509
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:08,860
Scott: I don't give a shit.

510
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,558
Rym: And you know what?

511
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:16,697
Rym: I'll hang out with you personally for at least one of the dinners, and then the rest of the time I'm going to disappear, because that's what guests do.

512
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:20,199
Scott: But yeah, it can happen.

513
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,238
Scott: Do you have monies?

514
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,960
Rym: So, do you ever find shoes, Scott?

515
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:27,759
Scott: To match that handbag?

516
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,386
Scott: Okay.

517
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,155
Rym: Seriously, he just took for fucking ever, and me and Pete are just standing there like, "Scott, come on, let's

518
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:34,256
Rym: go.".

519
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,670
Scott: You're greatly exaggerating.

520
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,594
Scott: this five-minute incident has become this epic--.

521
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,912
Rym: Scott's like, "No, I really need

522
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:39,378
Rym: shoes.".

523
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,291
Rym: And Pete's like, "To match your handbag?

524
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:41,935
Rym: God, we'll be in

525
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:42,519
Rym: GameStop.".

526
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,760
Scott: You're greatly exaggerating this ten-minute incident.

527
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:49,940
Rym: that it was this epic-- You mean the ten minutes when you couldn't decide what shoe to get?

528
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:50,420
Scott: Right.

529
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,680
Rym: Because it didn't fit, and it didn't match your handbag?

530
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:53,115
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:54,568
Scott: Okay.

532
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:55,260
Scott: Is that enough?

533
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,480
Rym: Why did you even need shoes like that desperately?

534
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,500
Scott: I don't even remember.

535
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:00,620
Scott: When the fuck was that?

536
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,580
Scott: It was at least '09, if not earlier.

537
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:03,274
Scott: Perhaps '08.

538
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,580
Rym: '09?

539
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,170
Rym: That was like '04.

540
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:06,635
Scott: It was a long time ago.

541
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,080
Rym: That was before GeekNights.

542
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,259
Scott: You're going to the beach, I might have needed new sandals, I think.

543
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,600
Rym: Wow, I realized '04 was technically before GeekNights, but not that much before GeekNights.

544
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:19,540
Scott: I don't remember when the fuck this was.

545
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:23,560
Scott: I think it was during GeekNights, because we came back and then you complained about it on GeekNights.

546
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:24,780
Scott: I complained about it a lot.

547
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,830
Scott: I think it might have been '06, '07, '08.

548
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:28,740
Scott: Anyway.

549
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,115
Rym: So anyway, shoes.

550
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,659
Rym: Oh my gosh.

551
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:39,277
Rym: I don't want to stereotype, but many of the girls I know personally in the front row crew, I'm making fun of you all right now.

552
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:42,820
Scott: Many girls I know, period, regardless of front row crew or not.

553
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,039
Rym: Own so many shoes.

554
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,480
Scott: Too many shoes.

555
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:49,299
Scott: I don't care.

556
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,200
Scott: It's like, you know, okay, women's fashion, whatever, whatever, whatever.

557
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,580
Scott: You do not need more.

558
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,160
Scott: No human being needs more than the following.

559
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,880
Scott: A, a boot for the snow and the dirt.

560
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,259
Rym: No, Scott, I have multiple kinds of boots.

561
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,239
Scott: That is crazy.

562
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Rym: Two.

563
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,059
Rym: Scott, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

564
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:03,819
Rym: So boots, right?

565
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:07,220
Rym: One, I need winter snow boots.

566
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,640
Rym: As in they go up around my ankles.

567
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:09,320
Rym: They're waterproof.

568
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,958
Rym: They're warm.

569
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:12,440
Rym: They don't slip when I walk on ice and snow.

570
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:12,880
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:13,456
Rym: I need those.

572
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:19,119
Rym: I also need hiking boots, which are very different from waterproof.

573
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:19,838
Rym: Same boot.

574
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,194
Rym: No, that's really stupid.

575
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,040
Rym: to use the same boot for both.

576
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,579
Scott: No, it's not stupid.

577
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:24,139
Scott: Same boot.

578
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:26,536
Rym: No, I have an Overland low cut.

579
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,820
Rym: It looks like a shoe, but it's actually a boot.

580
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,419
Scott: That's not a boot if it looks like a shoe.

581
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:31,118
Rym: It's a boot.

582
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,840
Scott: It's not a boot.

583
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,700
Rym: It's a hiking boot.

584
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,480
Scott: You know, it's a boot like the trunk of your car is a boot.

585
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,173
Rym: What?

586
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,640
Rym: That doesn't make any sense.

587
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,318
Scott: How not?

588
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,900
Rym: Because they're not related in any way, nor are you British.

589
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,860
Scott: I said it's a boot like the trunk of your car is a boot.

590
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:48,140
Scott: As in the trunk of your car is not a boot.

591
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,659
Scott: Therefore, it is also not a boot.

592
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,020
Rym: Scott, the trunk of my car is a boot.

593
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,579
Scott: It's not.

594
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:53,358
Rym: Okay.

595
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,880
Rym: Anyway, I also have fancy boots.

596
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:00,499
Scott: Conclusion.

597
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:01,400
Scott: Rims a woman.

598
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,296
Rym: At least I didn't take for fucking ever to get shoes to match my handbag on the way to the beach.

599
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,680
Scott: You need a boot, a slipper, an everyday shoe, which is also a sneaker.

600
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,160
Rym: What's an everyday shoe?

601
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,827
Rym: A sneaker.

602
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:15,719
Scott: An athletic shoe.

603
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,900
Rym: Scott, what do you mean by sneaker?

604
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,438
Rym: Because for one, you realize in most of the country, like the entire middle of the country, they say tennis shoe to mean- They're retarded.

605
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,539
Rym: Generic shoe.

606
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,619
Scott: Only the east coast is the real place.

607
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,660
Scott: Every other place is not a real place, right?

608
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,858
Scott: They can shut the fuck up.

609
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,859
Rym: But that aside, so I have running shoes.

610
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:35,360
Rym: I can't just wear those walking around.

611
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,159
Rym: They'll wear out and they also have holes in the bottom, so I've stepped in a puddle, you know, my foot gets wet.

612
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:40,951
Scott: Okay.

613
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,260
Scott: Are these like specialized Usain Bolt sprinting shoes?

614
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:45,040
Rym: Actually, yeah.

615
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,240
Rym: They're really nice running shoes that I replace every year because I wear them out.

616
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:48,828
Scott: Okay.

617
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,420
Scott: Whatever.

618
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,739
Rym: Because I run all the fucking time.

619
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,040
Scott: Most normal people just buy a sneaker, like a Nike shoe.

620
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,200
Rym: Well, what kind of Nike shoe, Scott?

621
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,939
Rym: Like a cross trainer?

622
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Scott: Whatever kind you like.

623
00:27:58,402 --> 00:27:58,899
Rym: A tennis shoe.

624
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,480
Scott: All that differences are all just bullshit, except for basketball, which needs to be a high top because you hurt your ankle.

625
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
Rym: Scott, they actually are all different.

626
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:06,499
Scott: It's bullshit.

627
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,800
Rym: Scott, what is a cross trainer?

628
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,797
Rym: Do you know what that is?

629
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:11,620
Scott: It's just a word they use to sell fucking shoes.

630
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,719
Rym: Scott, so you actually believe that?

631
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:14,196
Rym: Yes.

632
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:15,900
Rym: As opposed to a running shoe?

633
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:17,739
Scott: The shoe is a shoe.

634
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:18,180
Rym: Nope.

635
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,200
Rym: Running shoes are lighter.

636
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,960
Rym: They tend to be narrower.

637
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:24,180
Rym: They tend to have a more forward, like pronated posture.

638
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,818
Scott: You know what?

639
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,760
Scott: You can run in any fucking shoe.

640
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,080
Scott: You're not a professional runner.

641
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,040
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter.

642
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,019
Rym: It does matter, Scott.

643
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,760
Scott: People fucking run in like the marathon wearing like dress shoes.

644
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,440
Rym: No, that not many people do and the people who do, one, ruin their dress shoes.

645
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,407
Scott: Like for example- There are dress shoe companies that advertise that you can run the marathon in the dress shoes.

646
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,240
Rym: And maybe they're running shoes instead.

647
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:44,709
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,311
Rym: Uh-huh.

649
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,620
Rym: Plus dress shoe is not the same kind of class as cross trainer.

650
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,140
Rym: You could have a cross trainer that looks like a dress shoe or a running shoe that looks like a dress shoe.

651
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,239
Scott: None of that shit matters.

652
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,899
Scott: It's just bullshit to sell you more shoes to women like you.

653
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,880
Rym: Scott, what's the longest distance you've run in the last decade in one go without stopping?

654
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,619
Scott: Probably when we were at RIT and we did that thing.

655
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,940
Rym: Oh, the Chase Corporate Challenge?

656
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:12,480
Rym: How long was that?

657
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:15,300
Rym: Scott, I recall beating you by like a half hour.

658
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Scott: That has nothing to do with what shoe we were wearing.

659
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,259
Scott: If I wore Usain Bolt's shoe, I would still have been losing by a half hour.

660
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:37,059
Rym: So Scott, what I'm saying is that when I run like 10 miles, if I ran 10 miles in say my fencing shoes when I was fencing before or like a tennis shoe or a high top, that would suck ass and I'd have blisters and it would suck.

661
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:38,180
Scott: Uh-huh.

662
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:38,997
Scott: Have you done this?

663
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:40,078
Rym: Uh, yes.

664
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:42,060
Rym: I've run long distances and high tops before.

665
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:42,477
Rym: You know what?

666
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,078
Scott: But high top is a different shoe.

667
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,639
Rym: Yes, a different kind of shoe.

668
00:29:46,002 --> 00:29:47,160
Scott: So I have a running shoe.

669
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,939
Scott: There is no difference between like a running shoe and a cross trading shoe.

670
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:52,540
Scott: They're low top sneakers.

671
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:53,660
Scott: They're all the same.

672
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,060
Rym: Cross trainers are less like foreign- You're not a professional Olympian.

673
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,920
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter.

674
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,080
Scott: Just like getting to different golf clubs doesn't matter because you're not Tiger Woods.

675
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,013
Rym: So Scott, why don't you buy a shitty old bike?

676
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:03,880
Rym: because it doesn't matter.

677
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,188
Scott: Because it actually doesn't.

678
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:08,877
Scott: if you just have the gears are what matters more than anything else.

679
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:09,759
Rym: Uh, no.

680
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,919
Rym: Other things matter too.

681
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Rym: A steel frame bike is way slower than an aluminum frame bike.

682
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,260
Scott: It matters very little if you're not Lance Armstrong.

683
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,138
Rym: Uh, actually it matters a lot more than you think.

684
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,576
Scott: No, it's psychological.

685
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,369
Rym: Okay.

686
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,579
Rym: Anyway- Mister doesn't do any sports.

687
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,999
Rym: Uh- Doesn't know anything about them.

688
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:25,572
Scott: Yeah.

689
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,780
Scott: Mister woman who has too many shoes.

690
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:28,360
Rym: Okay.

691
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:44,600
Scott: Like I was saying, any normal person needs a boot, a sneaker, that is your everyday shoe, a dress shoe for the dressy times- Actually Scott, my every- My everyday shoe- A handle- Is usually, because I wear the kilt all the time, a boot that I wear.

692
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,380
Rym: Because wearing tennis shoes with a kilt looks fucking stupid.

693
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,180
Scott: It's alright.

694
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:49,499
Rym: Uh, no.

695
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,039
Rym: It looks crazy bad.

696
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,799
Scott: Who gives a shit?

697
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:52,717
Rym: I don't know.

698
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,920
Rym: I kind of care about my appearance.

699
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,759
Rym: I like to look good.

700
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:55,257
Scott: You're a woman.

701
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:56,198
Rym: Okay.

702
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:57,680
Scott: That's all you need.

703
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,900
Scott: Those are the only shoes anyone needs.

704
00:30:59,021 --> 00:30:59,359
Scott: One of each.

705
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,884
Scott: And when one wears out, as in it has holes in it and it is destroyed, then you may replace it.

706
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,860
Rym: What do you wear biking?

707
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,319
Scott: Uh, the shoes that I wear every day.

708
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,900
Rym: Alright, so you're not going to get like clipless shoes to go on clipless pedals?

709
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,819
Scott: Well, that is a different situation because- So now you need another shoe?

710
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,128
Rym: No.

711
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,080
Scott: I thought it didn't fucking matter.

712
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,499
Scott: Because if you get SPD, you can get regular shoes that also happen to have the built-in clamp bracket thingy.

713
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:30,520
Scott: Yes, but so- It's also a regular shoe, as opposed to the ones that have like the big clamp that sticks out where you can only use it for biking and you cannot use it for any non-biking activities.

714
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:41,740
Rym: But Scott, I will point out to you that really, if you get a shoe that's good for biking, where you clip in with the little clipless things, I like how I can clip into something that is called a clipless pedal.

715
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:42,478
Rym: But I digress.

716
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,380
Scott: Well, because the clips are the ones that go over the foot.

717
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,080
Rym: I know, but I can still, most people call it clipping in.

718
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,978
Scott: It's not a clip.

719
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,180
Rym: It's- I know, but you say clipping in or unclipping.

720
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:52,340
Scott: Anyway.

721
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,040
Rym: Which, it means something entirely different if I type ID clip.

722
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,139
Scott: IDDQD is what you really need.

723
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,179
Rym: IDKFA is pretty fun too.

724
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,559
Rym: Or just IDFA.

725
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,616
Scott: Well, I don't know why they had IDFA when IDKFA existed.

726
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,800
Rym: Here's the difference.

727
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,100
Rym: IDKFA is, I just want it fucking all.

728
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,340
Rym: IDFA is, I want all the weapons, but I still want to have to go through the whole mission.

729
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,079
Rym: That's the reason.

730
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:18,020
Scott: Anyway.

731
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,540
Rym: Anyway, that's very important.

732
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:19,873
Rym: No.

733
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,760
Rym: You need an IDFA and an IDKFA.

734
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:23,440
Scott: You don't.

735
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,218
Rym: Yes, you do.

736
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,139
Rym: They're different things.

737
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,080
Scott: Could have just done the K. They are different, but you could have just kept the K one.

738
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,540
Rym: So Scott, biking shoes that are good for long distance, like hardcore biking?

739
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,059
Scott: Yeah, of course.

740
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:34,854
Scott: If you are a specialist in a thing.

741
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Rym: Scott, even biking like 50 miles, if you're going to use a clip shoe?

742
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,380
Scott: No one who bikes 50 miles is not a specialist.

743
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,420
Rym: Scott, 50 miles is not that far.

744
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,413
Rym: I have biked 50 miles.

745
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,920
Scott: Then you are a specialist.

746
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,479
Scott: What percentage of the population do you think bikes 50 miles in their lives?

747
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,340
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

748
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:58,440
Rym: So, you're saying that because of the way I bike, I'm a specialist, so I'm allowed, I get like a waiver to get one additional kind of shoe.

749
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:58,979
Scott: Exactly.

750
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,920
Scott: If you are a specialist.

751
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,680
Rym: Scott, I argue that I am also, by your definition, a specialist at running.

752
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,079
Rym: I run a lot.

753
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,280
Scott: I do not believe you are a specialist in running.

754
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,960
Scott: There are many, the percentage of the population that runs, you are far from.

755
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,420
Rym: Wait, Scott, so what is the criteria for a specialist runner?

756
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,480
Rym: Because you already said that if I bike 50 miles, I'm a specialist biker.

757
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,096
Scott: At once.

758
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,840
Scott: I mean, 50 miles, if you add up your whole life, that's not enough.

759
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,477
Rym: 50 miles at once is not that far.

760
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,060
Scott: I didn't say it's that far, but what percentage of the population do you think has ever or will ever bike?

761
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,580
Scott: I'm not talking about other people.

762
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,359
Scott: 50 miles in one go.

763
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,177
Rym: I'm talking about me.

764
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:39,520
Scott: I'm saying, what percentage of the population of the world do you think will ever or has ever biked 50 miles at once?

765
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,739
Rym: Oh, Scott, that rounds down to zero.

766
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:41,640
Scott: Right.

767
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,620
Scott: It's almost nobody.

768
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:42,836
Rym: I know.

769
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,018
Scott: That's beside the point.

770
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,320
Scott: Therefore, anyone who is in that class is a specialist.

771
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,939
Rym: So, Scott, what is the line for a specialist runner?

772
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,619
Scott: You have to be whatever that same percentage of the population is.

773
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,289
Scott: Scott, I probably run- Translated to running.

774
00:33:59,122 --> 00:33:59,998
Rym: I run 99% of people.

775
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,320
Scott: Then you may be a specialist at running.

776
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,600
Rym: Yes, I'm saying I am.

777
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,760
Rym: I have a running shoe, which is separate from my walk around shoe because otherwise I have.

778
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,780
Scott: You're also a specialist at ego increasing by pretending you're a specialist at everything.

779
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,940
Rym: Scott, I do not want to claim I'm a specialist.

780
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,620
Rym: This is your stupid definition.

781
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Scott: Regardless, if you are a specialist at something that requires a shoe, then you are permitted the extra shoe for your specialty.

782
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,440
Scott: For example, if you are a skiing specialist, you can buy a skiing boot.

783
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,639
Rym: I have a ski boot right there.

784
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,139
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:35,920
Scott: If you are a skateboarding specialist, you need a skateboarding shoe, the flat ones.

786
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,679
Scott: Otherwise it's not, you know, try skateboarding without the stupid skateboarding shoes.

787
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,260
Rym: I guess rollerblades count.

788
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,739
Scott: Rollerblades, ice skates.

789
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,737
Rym: Yep, ice skates.

790
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,659
Scott: All specialized shoes that are allowable if you are a specialist.

791
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:48,380
Rym: All right.

792
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,780
Scott: Because otherwise, if you're not a specialist, it is not economical to actually buy the thing.

793
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:59,880
Rym: So Scott, going back to the first point of contention, my overland hiking boot is specialist equipment.

794
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:03,179
Scott: I don't think you know if you're a specialist hiker.

795
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:20,920
Rym: The last time I went hiking, it was 18 miles over the mountains and we hiked down a mountain in driving range where there was six inches of water pouring through me as I'm going down a steep, muddy, rocky, disastrous decline into a valley of death.

796
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:25,520
Scott: I did much hiking and I always used the same boot I used in winter and it was never a problem.

797
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,479
Rym: I don't think you've done the kind of hiking that I do.

798
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,960
Scott: I hiked in many places, up and down mountains in the olden days before the year 2000.

799
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,839
Rym: Some years ago I went with our friend James and some other people up in the Adirondacks and we hiked 26 miles and climbed four mountains in one go.

800
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,496
Rym: The fourth mountain was almost a mile high and we had to rappel down like, anyway, it was crazy.

801
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,718
Rym: It took all day.

802
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:48,940
Rym: It was grueling.

803
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:52,679
Scott: I walked through an entire desert for two days.

804
00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:01,558
Rym: So I wore, I had two pairs of brand new tennis shoes on me, like pretty good, like $80 brand new tennis shoes.

805
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,040
Rym: By the end of this hike, they were both destroyed.

806
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,060
Scott: I think there is something also wrong with the way you walk because I have walked great distances in other shoes.

807
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:16,399
Rym: Scott, you have not walked great distances over sharp rocks and through six inch deep sucking mud and snow.

808
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:16,822
Rym: I

809
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:31,308
Scott: have walked through nasty shit in the olden days and you know what, the shoes that I started with were just fine at the end, except for one time when I was wearing boots and I literally marched in a river, I guess it wasn't a river because you didn't drown in it, but it was a heavy stream.

810
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:33,279
Scott: that was white waters, but maybe a foot deep.

811
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:42,359
Scott: So your basic feet were completely submerged as you were walking and that was able to destroy the shoe from water damage, but never from tread wear in a single go.

812
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,440
Rym: Scott, walking through water like that has happened on every major hike I've ever done.

813
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,720
Scott: Well, water damage is completely different from the tread is disintegrated.

814
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,060
Rym: The tread will disintegrate if you hike over sharp rocks.

815
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:54,137
Scott: I have hiked over sharp rocks and down.

816
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,319
Rym: You clearly have not.

817
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,159
Scott: I have and my shoe is still alive at the end.

818
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,140
Rym: Anyway, I have.

819
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:03,579
Scott: I think you walk a weird way.

820
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,239
Scott: Did anyone else have this problem?

821
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,240
Rym: They all had specialist hiking boots.

822
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:12,300
Rym: I was the only one who was not wearing specialist hiking equipment on that trip.

823
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,540
Scott: So the next trip, if I bought a specialist hiking boot, you could also use that boot as your winner.

824
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,040
Scott: It's snowing.

825
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,640
Rym: No, I couldn't because it's not high enough.

826
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,319
Rym: So it would be very snow would get into it.

827
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:24,160
Scott: They make hiking boots that are high.

828
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:33,240
Rym: No, but I did not want it to be high because for the overland hiking, I wanted to have all the benefits of a running cross trainer shoe with also having the durability.

829
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,839
Scott: You're thinking too much about it.

830
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,260
Scott: It would not make that much of a difference.

831
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,340
Rym: It makes a huge difference.

832
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,020
Scott: It's psychological.

833
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:39,560
Rym: Uh, no, mister.

834
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,319
Rym: Doesn't do sports.

835
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:41,240
Scott: Okay.

836
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:41,653
Scott: Yeah.

837
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,045
Rym: Yeah.

838
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:46,300
Scott: Anyway, so how many shoes do you have in your closet?

839
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,820
Rym: So Scott, let's go over my shoes.

840
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,877
Rym: I have one pair of running shoes, one pair of everyday boots that I wear under that kilt all the time.

841
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:57,579
Rym: I have one pair of overland hiking shoes.

842
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:02,480
Rym: I have one pair of specialized climbing shoes that are only good for climbing rocks.

843
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:04,400
Rym: They can't walk in them.

844
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,320
Rym: They're so uncomfortable.

845
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,960
Rym: I have my V brooms, which I also run in.

846
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,499
Rym: If I want to be barefoot and I wear all the time, I have window.

847
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:18,520
Scott: You started off by complaining about women who have too many shoes and now you have more shoes than them.

848
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,419
Rym: Scott, the women I'm talking about have an order of magnitude more shoes than me.

849
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,700
Scott: See, I know that they have hundreds of shoes.

850
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,593
Scott: Perhaps even Kate.

851
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,352
Rym: I love Kate, but her shoot, we have to remove.

852
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:39,258
Rym: at one point the number of shoes that she had was like like it was startling to the point that I was standing there in awe.

853
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,496
Rym: I did not know what to say.

854
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:50,700
Scott: The thing that's even worse is like people who have like money problems yet they have all these shoes or people have shoes that they just never wear.

855
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:59,515
Scott: It's like it's one thing if you if you're like Rym and you're yuppie and you're going to buy ten thousand shoes, you can buy ten thousand womanly shoes and you wear them each in the back.

856
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,999
Scott: You know, you actually use all those shoes.

857
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:02,522
Rym: I do.

858
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:05,680
Rym: In fact, at least once a year, my dress shoes are so fucked right now.

859
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,404
Rym: I need a new pair.

860
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:08,339
Scott: Use them at least once a year, at least.

861
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:08,804
Scott: Right.

862
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,139
Scott: You ski at least once a year.

863
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:10,822
Scott: Right.

864
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:11,083
Rym: Yeah.

865
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:14,719
Scott: To have a shoe that you've like never used and to keep it.

866
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:22,720
Scott: It's like just know if you haven't used you use the shoe in three and sixty five days, it's out right to have to the same shoe in two different colors.

867
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:23,582
Scott: What the fuck?

868
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:35,379
Rym: Well, seriously, but many men, many men, I'd say the majority of men, if pair of brown dress issues, just wear the black ones all the time.

869
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:41,840
Rym: Uh, no, because some people, for whatever reason, like to wear brown dress shoes or loafers, even though I think they look stupid.

870
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,324
Scott: They're women.

871
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:43,299
Scott: You know, it's really stupid.

872
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,383
Scott: Here's some.

873
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,880
Scott: Let's talk about shoes that should not exist and they have no purpose.

874
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:48,392
Scott: You're right.

875
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:48,495
Scott: No.

876
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:49,988
Scott: Well, yes.

877
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:51,060
Scott: But here's my first one.

878
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,501
Scott: Right.

879
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:55,720
Scott: Those men dress the male dress shoes that have little tassels on them.

880
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:56,769
Rym: What the fuck?

881
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:57,980
Rym: Those are silly.

882
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,024
Scott: Who the fuck wears?

883
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:07,459
Rym: what I see, you know, it's like why would you ever wear one guy and packs wearing those shoes, ironically, and it looked great.

884
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,425
Scott: Really?

885
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,278
Rym: It worked with the kilt.

886
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,899
Rym: OK, I'll give him that one.

887
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:12,016
Rym: It's like, dude, you win.

888
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:12,260
Rym: You get.

889
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,272
Scott: But it's like they're so like.

890
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:15,439
Scott: why do those even exist?

891
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:19,160
Scott: I'm sure someone is like some fashion expert is going to say why they exist.

892
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,379
Rym: Well, seriously, when I was a kid, you know, it's really popular at the Catholic school with the uniform penny loafers.

893
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:27,727
Scott: Well, if you're a little kid, you're a little, you know, you're a little ten year old boy.

894
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:28,379
Scott: That's great.

895
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:29,772
Scott: If you're wearing a uniform.

896
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:30,460
Scott: Sure.

897
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,041
Scott: Yeah.

898
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:35,056
Rym: No wonder why there's one kid who put dimes in his nice shit.

899
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,299
Rym: He walked around with those dimes and he'd call attention to him.

900
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:39,740
Rym: He'd be like, check out my shoes.

901
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Scott: Should have put some half dollars in there.

902
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,880
Scott: I don't think they'd fit now.

903
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,920
Scott: But yeah, but yeah, that's that's fine.

904
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,058
Scott: But if you're over the age of twelve, no, that should not.

905
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:49,520
Scott: that you did.

906
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,350
Scott: They shouldn't even make it.

907
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,979
Scott: Oh, my God.

908
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,420
Rym: Scott, why aren't the hipsters wearing penny loafers?

909
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,529
Rym: We got to get out of them.

910
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:55,679
Rym: Do I have not seen this?

911
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:56,826
Scott: OK, I've seen some.

912
00:40:57,851 --> 00:40:59,419
Rym: I feel like I can make money on penny loafers.

913
00:40:59,840 --> 00:40:59,961
Rym: OK.

914
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:00,323
Rym: Yeah.

915
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:03,179
Scott: What other shoe should not exist besides the high heel?

916
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,740
Rym: The thing is, the high heel has one purpose.

917
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,401
Rym: I can't.

918
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:12,982
Rym: There are times when uncomfortable dress clothes look good for a photo or an opportunity.

919
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:24,799
Rym: My only complaint about high heels is that if you ever wear them and you have to walk more than 50 feet at a time and you complain even once, you should not have worn the high heels in the first place.

920
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:25,928
Scott: And you deserve it.

921
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:27,400
Rym: You should actually come to New York City.

922
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,119
Rym: Don't fucking wear high heels here.

923
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,064
Rym: It does not work.

924
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,352
Scott: I don't.

925
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:32,760
Rym: even women do not wear high heels.

926
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,302
Scott: But it is.

927
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:35,160
Scott: the thing is like people say, oh, but they look so good.

928
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,683
Scott: You know what?

929
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:43,060
Scott: I'm sure that, you know, they're clearly there are dudes out there who like that shit because many hoes be wearing gigantic heels and dudes be picking them up.

930
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,583
Scott: But you know what?

931
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:46,238
Scott: I have not once ever thought a high heel was hot.

932
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,359
Scott: I think it's just sort of really kind of freaky and not hot in any way, shape or form.

933
00:41:53,902 --> 00:42:00,959
Scott: You know, it's you know, it's way hotter, a regular fucking everyday sneaker with a really thick, tall, scrunched up sock.

934
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:02,344
Scott: It doesn't matter.

935
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:07,307
Scott: Just, you know, a regular fucking shoe, because that means you're a regular person.

936
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:08,520
Rym: Let's talk about something more important.

937
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:11,859
Rym: If you wear shoes without socks, the fuck's wrong with you?

938
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:20,659
Rym: Well, everyone I know who does this, unless you're wearing climbing shoes or like Vibram or sandals or sandals shoes, their sandals.

939
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,620
Scott: A sandal is a shoe, shoes, not subset of shoe now.

940
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,248
Scott: Yes.

941
00:42:24,494 --> 00:42:24,780
Rym: Anyway.

942
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:25,523
Rym: All right.

943
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:25,704
Rym: Yeah.

944
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,640
Rym: Well, you can't wear socks with sandals.

945
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,383
Scott: That's correct.

946
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,600
Scott: But unless of those Japanese ones with the two sticks at the bottom.

947
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,499
Rym: But everyone occasionally in my life, I have been in a hurry and put on like tennis shoes without having socks in them.

948
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,580
Rym: Your foot smells like a butt at the end of the day.

949
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,620
Rym: Your shoes smell like a butt forever.

950
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:45,869
Rym: It's uncomfortable.

951
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,160
Rym: What the fuck's wrong with you people?

952
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:47,766
Scott: I don't know.

953
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:48,939
Rym: How can you do that?

954
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:49,442
Scott: I don't know.

955
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:55,920
Scott: Now, climbing shoes, you can always get the socks that are just incredibly short and like stop below the ankles and know what it looks like.

956
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,674
Scott: You don't wear a sock, but also climbing shoes.

957
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,164
Rym: You pretty much can't.

958
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,908
Rym: You don't want to wear socks in them because otherwise it's like they don't work as well.

959
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:02,700
Rym: They're not as comfortable.

960
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,340
Rym: They're they're more uncomfortable.

961
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:07,179
Rym: I can't say that they're comfortable.

962
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:13,120
Rym: They basically mash your toes into a point and they have like a funny little ballet shoe.

963
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,986
Scott: The specialized shoe.

964
00:43:14,732 --> 00:43:15,740
Scott: Another shoe that shouldn't exist.

965
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,464
Scott: The clog.

966
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,080
Rym: What's wrong with clogs?

967
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,064
Rym: They shouldn't exist.

968
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:22,420
Rym: I have seen hipsters wearing legit clogs.

969
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,610
Scott: What the fuck, dude?

970
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:24,440
Rym: Actually, you know what?

971
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,098
Rym: That's kind of cool.

972
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,520
Rym: Plus, Scott, think about a time before we had mass manufacturing.

973
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,639
Scott: Clog is not that bad of a shoe.

974
00:43:32,103 --> 00:43:32,918
Scott: Not in those days.

975
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,258
Scott: Nowadays, it's an awful shoe.

976
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,840
Rym: But you don't see anyone but hipsters and traditionalists.

977
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,240
Scott: But here's the thing is people be wearing this shit and like for fashion's sake.

978
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,004
Scott: Well, you know what?

979
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:44,440
Scott: Yeah, tell the podiatrist for fashion's sake.

980
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,533
Scott: Now, who's laughing now?

981
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:45,696
Scott: Mr.

982
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:47,740
Scott: Foot is fucked up beyond belief.

983
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,119
Scott: Bunions and all kinds of other.

984
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:56,080
Rym: I think most of the people who have these problems just don't wash their feet because I read no bunions are not from unwashed.

985
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,980
Scott: Oh, no, I'm saying it's what is from unwashed.

986
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:08,180
Rym: I'm saying in general, I saw some study that said, like, two thirds of Americans have major fungal related problems in their feet and like serious foot odor.

987
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,820
Scott: You ever see those people like toenails that are like a half inch thick?

988
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:12,126
Scott: It's like, what the fuck?

989
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,324
Rym: But but like a surprising majority of people seem to have these problems.

990
00:44:15,424 --> 00:44:27,898
Rym: And you'll notice those are the people who always want to wear their shoes inside or they never take off their socks in public and their feet smell like a. but when they actually do that, the people where they take off their shoes in your car and you like put that shit back on.

991
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:29,667
Scott: Yeah.

992
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:30,400
Scott: What the fuck, dude?

993
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:32,440
Rym: But I really don't understand it.

994
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,059
Rym: But I mean, you know what I do when I come home and if I wash my feet.

995
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,659
Rym: In the shower, I just wash my feet.

996
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,600
Scott: I just wash my feet whenever I shower.

997
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,460
Rym: Sometimes I wash my feet when I get home, like if I'm running barefoot, I wash my feet.

998
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,300
Scott: Well, I wash my feet as something nasty gets on.

999
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,640
Scott: I'm like, I was walking barefoot through the slime.

1000
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,085
Scott: Then I'll wash my feet.

1001
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,445
Scott: But yeah, I'm talking about like bunions and hammertoes and that kind of fucked up shit.

1002
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,940
Scott: It's like, you know, I guess flat footed is genetic, right?

1003
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:59,700
Scott: But a lot of these other ones are not genetic.

1004
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,420
Scott: A lot, you know, it's from wearing fucked up shoes and not walking properly.

1005
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:04,244
Scott: It's like.

1006
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,400
Scott: this is why you don't choose shoes for fashion.

1007
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,344
Scott: You choose for comfort.

1008
00:45:07,384 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: primarily, even if it's, you know, you can find a shoe that is sufficiently comfortable and then get some more fashion in there without any expense of decreasing comfort.

1009
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:23,820
Scott: But to go for full on fashion and disregard comfort, it's like you're fucking up your foot, an incredibly important part of your body.

1010
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:28,520
Scott: You're going to permanently ruin it and cause yourself pain for the rest of your days.

1011
00:45:28,822 --> 00:45:31,380
Scott: For the sake of fashion, you're retarded, right?

1012
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,040
Scott: You know, regardless, you know, whatever you want to say about, well, fashion is, you know, whatever you fucked up your foot permanent beauty before duty.

1013
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:39,525
Scott: Right.

1014
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:40,333
Scott: That's insane.

1015
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:40,697
Scott: Right.

1016
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:42,620
Rym: Like a culture before comfort.

1017
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,796
Scott: You know, it's like both.

1018
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:44,020
Scott: Right.

1019
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:44,804
Scott: It is a line.

1020
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,520
Scott: It's like, OK, you want to wear that T-shirt because it's fashionable.

1021
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:47,844
Scott: Great.

1022
00:45:47,884 --> 00:45:49,140
Scott: It's a T-shirt, but it's fashionable.

1023
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:49,441
Scott: Cool.

1024
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:53,080
Scott: You want to fucking inject fucking Botox into your face.

1025
00:45:53,241 --> 00:45:54,598
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1026
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:55,326
Scott: Right.

1027
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:56,219
Scott: It's the same shit.

1028
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:59,440
Scott: Don't fuck up your body permanently for that shit.

1029
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:00,004
Rym: All right.

1030
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:00,670
Rym: So what's the line?

1031
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,759
Rym: I mean, I have an ear piercing.

1032
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:02,926
Scott: Yeah.

1033
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:03,779
Rym: Is that bad?

1034
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,100
Scott: Is it fucked up your body beyond recognition and cause you pain for the rest of your days?

1035
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:09,499
Rym: It causes no pain.

1036
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,704
Rym: I used to have.

1037
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,680
Scott: Does it hurt you in any way, shape or form?

1038
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,720
Rym: When I first got it, OK, for like a week, it really hurt.

1039
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:16,651
Rym: And then it stopped hurting.

1040
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:17,279
Rym: It never hurt again.

1041
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:17,822
Scott: All right.

1042
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:22,943
Scott: But I mean, has it caused you any permanent, irrevocable negative consequence damage?

1043
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:26,501
Rym: No, other than that, when I don't wear an earring, there's a little hole in my ear.

1044
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:27,205
Scott: All right.

1045
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:27,648
Rym: See, I can.

1046
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:28,152
Rym: you can stick.

1047
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:29,359
Rym: I can stick like a pencil lead through it.

1048
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,621
Rym: Yeah.

1049
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:32,680
Scott: Is that as bad as, say, it hurts to walk forever?

1050
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:33,803
Scott: No.

1051
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:34,449
Scott: Yeah.

1052
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,540
Scott: You can see the difference there.

1053
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,626
Rym: I got a piercing on the upper part of my ear once I got rid of it because it didn't stop hurting after a week.

1054
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,720
Rym: Yeah, I was like, yeah, it's done.

1055
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,935
Scott: This is what I'm talking about.

1056
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:44,097
Scott: Right.

1057
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,539
Rym: I'm thinking about doing that again, though, because I like the way that looks.

1058
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:48,004
Scott: Do whatever you want.

1059
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:52,880
Scott: As long as you don't fuck up your body forever in a painful way that is permanently damaging.

1060
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:54,079
Rym: So what about handbags?

1061
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:55,727
Rym: What do you want?

1062
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,320
Rym: I have a Timbuktu messenger bag.

1063
00:46:57,922 --> 00:46:58,406
Scott: And me too.

1064
00:46:58,507 --> 00:46:59,960
Scott: I also have a camelback mule.

1065
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:05,022
Scott: I also have a camelback and I have an old L.L.Bean regular backpack that can carry a ton of shit.

1066
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:11,140
Rym: I have a generic briefcase messenger bag that I use for things when I need just like a bunch of generic crap independent.

1067
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,399
Scott: I have a giant L.L.Bean duffle bag for luggage.

1068
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:16,340
Rym: I have many different luggages, depending on where I'm going.

1069
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,550
Scott: You have womanly luggage.

1070
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:17,934
Scott: How?

1071
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,080
Rym: I have one really big luggage.

1072
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,013
Scott: Does it have wheels on it?

1073
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:21,380
Scott: Yes.

1074
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,864
Scott: You're a woman.

1075
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:22,939
Rym: Scott, you know what?

1076
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,961
Rym: Every time we travel, you're like, yeah, I guess I guess it'd be sexist to call you a woman.

1077
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:29,485
Scott: You're a little boy.

1078
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:31,981
Scott: And yet you're like a three year old boy who can't carry his luggage.

1079
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:39,764
Rym: Scott, you're the one with the heavy duffle bag who slams into obstacles because you can't see where you're going because it's so heavy and you're so like burdened by this thing.

1080
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,119
Scott: Yeah, but I'm carrying it.

1081
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,481
Scott: Yeah.

1082
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:42,228
Scott: And you know what?

1083
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,380
Scott: And do I get where I'm going?

1084
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,679
Rym: Scott, so why are you using a GUI?

1085
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,936
Rym: Just command line all the way.

1086
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:47,159
Rym: Why?

1087
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:47,822
Rym: Why use?

1088
00:47:47,902 --> 00:47:51,440
Rym: you should use links because it's clearly the more manly way to get the job done.

1089
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:53,519
Scott: You can't see the pictures.

1090
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,513
Rym: All right, so download that shit separately and open it up.

1091
00:47:57,554 --> 00:47:58,499
Rym: in fact, it doesn't work.

1092
00:47:58,981 --> 00:47:59,486
Rym: Yeah, it does.

1093
00:47:59,506 --> 00:48:00,900
Rym: It doesn't open them up in fact.

1094
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,540
Scott: How would you know where they belong on the page?

1095
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,199
Scott: So you go to fag, you download it.

1096
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,320
Scott: It's an image of like the logo for the website.

1097
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:09,260
Scott: OK, the next one is a red line.

1098
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,979
Rym: Did you really need to see all that stuff?

1099
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:12,529
Rym: Does it really matter?

1100
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:13,699
Scott: Yeah, kind of.

1101
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:19,183
Rym: I see no problem with wheels on luggage because they're nothing but a convenience for sissies.

1102
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:21,060
Rym: OK, you know what?

1103
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,040
Rym: I don't care what you say because it's comfortable.

1104
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,300
Rym: This is I just want everyone to remember.

1105
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,459
Rym: Carrying Scott about aesthetics or fashion or all that BS.

1106
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,220
Rym: I use what's comfortable.

1107
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,799
Scott: Yeah, I use what's comfortable carrying my own shit.

1108
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,500
Rym: Yeah, except you're slow as shit when you're carrying your shit.

1109
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,680
Scott: I just want to point out that in the beginning of the show, right, I was the one who was going to pick the onions if I had to and Rym is the one who's going to resort to crime.

1110
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,284
Rym: Jesus sissy.

1111
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:49,360
Scott: You'd rather rob people than do hard work.

1112
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,456
Rym: Robbing people is so fun, though.

1113
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:54,463
Scott: Sure.

1114
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:56,460
Scott: You know what?

1115
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,980
Scott: When I rob people, I carry that money on my own bag.

1116
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,260
Scott: I don't put it in a wheelie bag.

1117
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,200
Rym: I get a wheelie bag with a dollar sign on it.

1118
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,522
Rym: You know what?

1119
00:49:02,582 --> 00:49:05,280
Scott: If I'm going to steal a bar of gold, I'm going to fucking carry that shit.

1120
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:06,880
Rym: I'd like to see you carry a bar of gold.

1121
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,580
Scott: I could carry half a bar of gold if I had to in a bag.

1122
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:19,320
Rym: So one thing I've noticed, a lot of people on the Internet say something to the effect of what is the deal with your New York people in your messenger bags?

1123
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,380
Rym: It's fashion bullshit.

1124
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,339
Rym: Uh, what do you mean?

1125
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,900
Rym: A lot of people seem to hate on messenger bags.

1126
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,665
Scott: What's wrong with the mess?

1127
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:27,900
Rym: They always say, why don't you just have a backpack?

1128
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:30,719
Scott: Uh, OK, why?

1129
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,720
Rym: I see this a lot and it's weird.

1130
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,240
Scott: So I've never seen this really.

1131
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:34,988
Scott: It's strange.

1132
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:35,740
Rym: I see it all the time.

1133
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:36,759
Scott: Why would you even think that?

1134
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:38,138
Rym: So I want to rebut it right now.

1135
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:44,000
Rym: You can't get into your backpack without unbackpacking it and opening it.

1136
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:45,270
Rym: A messenger bag.

1137
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:46,299
Rym: You just go, whoop.

1138
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:47,379
Rym: And now it's in the front.

1139
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:56,625
Scott: That's the reason messengers use that bag, is that when they arrive and they're delivering their message, they can just go swing it around, grab the message, hand it to the person and get on their way.

1140
00:49:56,645 --> 00:50:05,040
Scott: If you have a backpack with the two arm straps, yes, it distributes the weight more evenly across the back and such, but you have to bring it out, unzip it.

1141
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,821
Scott: It's much harder to get things in and out of it, even if you keep it in the front like a dork.

1142
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:16,140
Scott: Now, the other thing, backpacks do have more carrying capacity, but you don't need that fucking carrying capacity because you're not carrying that much shit.

1143
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:17,838
Rym: And if you are, yeah, backpack.

1144
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,017
Scott: That's why I have both.

1145
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:19,903
Scott: Nothing.

1146
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:20,557
Scott: I have a backpack, too.

1147
00:50:21,262 --> 00:50:21,788
Scott: Why not?

1148
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:22,779
Scott: Sometimes you need that shit.

1149
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,420
Rym: So, Scott, here's a very important question.

1150
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:32,220
Scott: When you were a kid and you know what, if you need to distribute the weight evenly, you can hike your messenger bag up and attach the extra through the front strap.

1151
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,479
Scott: And now it's going full on.

1152
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,160
Rym: So, Scott, when you were a kid, let's say middle school, high school.

1153
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:37,584
Rym: Yeah.

1154
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:38,819
Rym: You had a backpack, I assume.

1155
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:39,509
Scott: Yeah.

1156
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:39,979
Rym: For books.

1157
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,024
Scott: Yeah.

1158
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,079
Rym: Was it over one shoulder or both shoulders?

1159
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,487
Scott: Depended.

1160
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:46,220
Rym: On what?

1161
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:47,388
Scott: The day.

1162
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:47,449
Scott: OK.

1163
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,920
Rym: What made you choose one over the other?

1164
00:50:50,101 --> 00:50:51,560
Scott: How many books are fucking in there?

1165
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,840
Rym: So why did you ever put it over just one shoulder?

1166
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,878
Scott: Because there was barely nothing in it.

1167
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,023
Rym: But why?

1168
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:03,699
Rym: Two shoulders doesn't take any more effort and it's more stable because one shoulder more you occasionally have to go.

1169
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:06,460
Scott: It was it was more comfortable with the one shoulder.

1170
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,060
Rym: You sure you didn't just do it because all the cool kids did it that way?

1171
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:10,839
Scott: I didn't even think about it.

1172
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,281
Scott: Really?

1173
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:26,547
Rym: Because I noticed very pointedly throughout all of my life, the kids who were hip or in the know or popular or just not picked on invariably almost always had their backpack on one shoulder, even

1174
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:27,391
Scott: if it was full of books,

1175
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:29,140
Rym: even if it was full of books,

1176
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,960
Scott: like so many books, all the books.

1177
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,040
Rym: Well, one, those kids generally books didn't have that many books in their back.

1178
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,258
Scott: OK, well, that's for sure.

1179
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:43,783
Rym: But to invariably the kids who were picked on never use just one shoulder, even when there was nothing in it.

1180
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:48,643
Rym: It's anecdotal, but I've seen this through the eyes of many different people.

1181
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:54,020
Scott: I think it's just that when a backpack, you know, if it's not heavy, putting on both shoulder straps.

1182
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:54,602
Scott: Right.

1183
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:57,400
Scott: And it sort of leans back because, you know, even if you pike it up.

1184
00:51:57,803 --> 00:51:58,006
Scott: Right.

1185
00:51:58,066 --> 00:51:58,899
Scott: It's sort of like the chafe.

1186
00:51:59,522 --> 00:51:59,744
Scott: Right.

1187
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:01,040
Scott: But there's not so much weight on them.

1188
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,619
Scott: So they're sort of bouncing and hitting your neck.

1189
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:03,343
Scott: Right.

1190
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:07,167
Scott: So if you do the one shoulder, it's more like just a messenger bag because you didn't bring your messenger bag with you.

1191
00:52:07,187 --> 00:52:11,618
Scott: But if there's a ton of stuff in there, you got to go both shoulder to carry the weight.

1192
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,458
Scott: No, that's how I roll.

1193
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:14,649
Rym: It is how you roll.

1194
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:15,619
Rym: What about the fanny pack?

1195
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:17,860
Scott: Fanny packs should never be used ever.

1196
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,640
Rym: I actually used to occasionally use a fanny pack.

1197
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:21,346
Scott: You're a dork.

1198
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:22,155
Rym: You know where I used it?

1199
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:24,359
Rym: At amusement parks.

1200
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,139
Scott: I used a fanny pack at amusement park once.

1201
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:27,909
Scott: And you know what?

1202
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:28,759
Scott: Then I switched it up.

1203
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,018
Scott: There's a better thing you can use.

1204
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,704
Rym: What's your thing?

1205
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:32,920
Scott: The necklace cylinder.

1206
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:37,580
Rym: The necklace cylinder is the stupidest looking crap thing.

1207
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,200
Scott: The necklace cylinder is the key at water parks.

1208
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,003
Scott: Wait, Scott.

1209
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:43,060
Rym: What do you put in your necklace cylinder?

1210
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,099
Scott: Money and credit cards.

1211
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:46,420
Rym: So what do you do with your wallet?

1212
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,520
Scott: The rest, everything else goes into the locker that you rent.

1213
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,480
Rym: So more importantly, you had a necklace cylinder big enough to hold a credit card.

1214
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:56,560
Rym: That's so stupid looking.

1215
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,560
Scott: It actually had like a little credit card sort of slot.

1216
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:07,560
Rym: I learned the real secret a long time ago when I used fanny packs at amusement parks.

1217
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:14,440
Rym: Then one day I realized, why don't I just not fucking bring anything to the amusement park except one credit card and some cash?

1218
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:15,769
Scott: That's exactly the thing.

1219
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:17,260
Scott: That's why the cylinder is so great.

1220
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,065
Scott: No, pocket.

1221
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:19,320
Scott: It's in my pocket.

1222
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,003
Scott: You can't.

1223
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:22,378
Scott: OK, what's going to happen on the water slide, Mr.

1224
00:53:22,419 --> 00:53:22,620
Scott: Pocket?

1225
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,560
Rym: Scott, water slide is in a water park.

1226
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,319
Rym: If I'm in the water park, I have nothing on me but swimsuit.

1227
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,973
Scott: See that if you have the cylinder, right.

1228
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,559
Rym: Why would I ever want to carry anything but my swimsuit in the water park?

1229
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:38,400
Scott: Because when you get off, you're going down the slide.

1230
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,640
Scott: You get to the bottom of the slide.

1231
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,760
Rym: I go right back up to go down the slide again.

1232
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:43,380
Scott: And while you're waiting in fucking line.

1233
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,800
Rym: There's no fucking line unless you go to a shitty water park.

1234
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,980
Scott: All the water parks are made of lines.

1235
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,966
Scott: You get to the bottom.

1236
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:49,680
Scott: You buy a fucking hot dog.

1237
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,640
Scott: You wait in line eating the hot dog.

1238
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,542
Scott: You work it.

1239
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:56,000
Rym: But I already ate a hot dog before I put my swimsuit on.

1240
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,251
Scott: Oh, that was a mistake.

1241
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:58,060
Scott: See, I'm saving time.

1242
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:03,600
Scott: I actually got on the slide earlier because I just went straight for the slide and I'm eating the hot dog in line riding more slides.

1243
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,140
Rym: The real key was Cedar Point shut down at like eleven o'clock.

1244
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:09,019
Rym: As in they shut off all the lines.

1245
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,546
Rym: Ten fifty eight.

1246
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:12,960
Rym: Buy as much food as you can all carry.

1247
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,546
Rym: Ten fifty nine.

1248
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:17,340
Rym: Get in the longest ass line.

1249
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,600
Rym: One am be the last kids on the roller coaster.

1250
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,840
Rym: Everyone in the park who's an employee hates your fucking guts and wants you to die.

1251
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:29,781
Scott: OK.

1252
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:38,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1253
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,538
Rym: Special thanks to D.J.

1254
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,540
Rym: Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1255
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,939
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1256
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1257
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,640
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1258
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1259
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:04,440
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1260
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
