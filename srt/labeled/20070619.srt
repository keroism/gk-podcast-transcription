00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,720
Rym:

2
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:11,907
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 19th.

3
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:13,031
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:16,944
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:19,720
Rym: what's wrong with Dungeons and Dragons?

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:37,700
Scott: if you recall last week, we told that we went to the amazing millennium game store and Purchased a whole mess a new board game.

8
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,470
Rym: for the first time in our entire lives.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:48,090
Rym: we went to the board gaming shop and usually we'd either not buy anything or One of us would buy a game usually saying I'm not buying the next one.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,876
Rym: It's all you this time.

11
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:54,150
Rym: We didn't hold back and we bought everything that took our fancy at all.

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,470
Scott: No, no, there are plenty of things that took my fancy that I did not buy.

13
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:03,146
Rym: I bought every game that I have wanted that they had every game I physically saw that I had desired in the past.

14
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:03,548
Rym: I bought.

15
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:09,810
Scott: We bought let's see a total of I guess four and a half games and Alex bought a fifth game.

16
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:13,704
Scott: So we bought a lot of games and this weekend we played all those games.

17
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:15,030
Rym: it felt really good.

18
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:20,824
Scott: What felt even better was against all odds every single one of those games was good.

19
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,950
Scott: They were not bad games at all.

20
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:32,050
Rym: Yeah I mean the worst of the games and I'm still not sure which one that is But I got a few candidates is still better than a lot of games out there by far and is still playable.

21
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:44,299
Scott: Yeah There are a lot of games that we own from way back that we just don't play anymore and I said learn I see these Being played for a very long time and also Providing much to talk about on the show.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,941
Scott: Yes.

23
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:53,488
Rym: I actually can't wait to talk about Gloria Mundi and the Interesting experiment we ended up going through because I didn't pay attention when I went through the rules.

24
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,050
Scott: Good job.

25
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,990
Scott: But yeah, we've talked about Gloria Mundi before though because we did play it.

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,490
Rym: Well, yeah, but I'd like to do a whole show on it someday in the future.

27
00:01:59,651 --> 00:01:59,953
Scott: We will.

28
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,390
Rym: we will suffice to say it was a good weekend.

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:15,733
Scott: Yeah, also we have talked for perhaps for I don't know how many years maybe six years Setting up some sort of computerized database system to record who wins and loses in the board games We play.

30
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:28,084
Rym: usually whenever someone would propose this idea It was always whoever had just won a bunch of board games recently and they'd usually say something like I don't want you people to Forget that I'm the one in charge here.

31
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:28,749
Rym: I'm the business.

32
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:30,256
Scott: You mean me?

33
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,220
Scott: I'm always the.

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,164
Rym: I mean me.

35
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:38,110
Scott: Yeah anyway We have proposed And we had never implemented this system.

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,730
Scott: Well board game geek actually implemented the system and you can go and report board game sessions there.

37
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,210
Scott: But we never actually bothered to do that either.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,295
Rym: We kept saying we would.

39
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:55,370
Rym: at one point on the inside of one of my computer cases I used to mark every time I won a game of air hockey against Scott and that was the closest we ever got.

40
00:02:55,956 --> 00:03:02,603
Scott: so finally Alex got off his horse and Said aha and he made a real.

41
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,920
Scott: he didn't make you know The perfect ultimate finished product got off.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,703
Rym: his court wouldn't be.

43
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,330
Rym: got on his horse and went and did something.

44
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,112
Rym: You don't get off your horse to be High horse.

45
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:11,593
Scott: I don't know.

46
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:12,817
Rym: It was not a high horse.

47
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,020
Rym: Maybe you saw horse.

48
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:15,083
Scott: Maybe maybe.

49
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:20,246
Scott: anyway, I couldn't think of a better Turn a phrase or idiom.

50
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,543
Scott: So he got off his ass and he made one.

51
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,607
Scott: He didn't make it perfect.

52
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,135
Rym: Wait a minute That works perfectly.

53
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,810
Rym: got off his ass but an ass like a mule kind of like a horse.

54
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,296
Scott: That's why getting off the horse works.

55
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,384
Rym: So it does I concede the point.

56
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,929
Rym: So I'm not gonna let you finish.

57
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:43,455
Rym: It's hot out if you haven't been if you listen to Dave and Joel lately They like to talk about how hot it is.

58
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,278
Rym: luckily.

59
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:47,590
Scott: I'm today warm yesterday even warmer today.

60
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:52,990
Rym: Luckily, I have the solution to the heat in my hands my favorite summertime drink lemonade and southern comfort melonade.

61
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,441
Scott: Anyway anyway We made it and it works.

62
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,090
Scott: We're not putting on board game geek.

63
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:08,701
Scott: I guess maybe that could be in the future and it doesn't have all the features we would like yet but we've been keeping track of who wins and Rims not doing too.

64
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,687
Rym: Well, I did.

65
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:14,459
Rym: Okay Okay Plus I do point out that I did win the last game.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,950
Rym: we played in a very closely run affair where Alex almost won.

67
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,609
Scott: That was because you both had prior experience with the game and I played it just fine.

68
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,289
Rym: Wait a minute Wait a minute.

69
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:37,850
Rym: You were claiming my prior experience in a game where I denied having played it because I didn't think that I had Until the last minute when I recognized one graphic on one of the cards on the board and said maybe I did play this game.

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,258
Scott: Yeah, you said you definitely played it anyway, and you did.

71
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:48,382
Scott: Oh I did but I didn't realize it regardless Because I was inexperienced and I was forced to go first.

72
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:50,870
Rym: plus I also won the broken game of Gloria Mundi.

73
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:59,450
Scott: Yes, I was forced to go first and I made an incredibly horrible opening play and My plays after that were just fine.

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,810
Scott: But my opening play was so poor that it ruined my entire game and that will not happen in the future.

75
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:13,443
Rym: Of course the system we put in place fails to take into account my 80 to 85 percent victory.

76
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:16,133
Rym: rated Carcassonne As well.

77
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,478
Scott: it should all right.

78
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,827
Scott: Let's make some news happen.

79
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:20,730
Scott: news a yep.

80
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,504
Scott: So Rym you like it to guitar heroes.

81
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:30,664
Rym: I While I've only played probably an hour's worth of guitar heroes I played more than an hour's worth of not so much more.

82
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:36,950
Rym: a few hours I mean if you count the time where I stand around with other people playing guitar heroes waiting to play guitar heroes.

83
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,188
Scott: But I'm saying you know playing one song takes almost like more than five minutes.

84
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,843
Rym: sometimes I played less than 20 songs.

85
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,090
Rym: I don't think so.

86
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,270
Rym: I didn't play it as much as you guys did every time we were over at someone's house.

87
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,123
Rym: I woke up late real late, and you guys were always playing anyway.

88
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:53,925
Rym: I went to a con.

89
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,310
Rym: I end up not playing anyway.

90
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,943
Scott: Everyone's talking about this rock band that they're making.

91
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:00,112
Rym: I don't know how I feel about it But I'm excited.

92
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:05,288
Scott: everyone has you know you get a bunch of different instruments going on and today they're released.

93
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,080
Scott: were pictures of the rock band guitar.

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,989
Scott: now if you I'm not you know some guitar Fanboy or something you know or a guitar geek.

95
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:32,627
Scott: But I must say that I am aware that there is a company that produces Guitars that is known as fender and there is a company that produces guitars known as Gibson And I know that the guitars and guitar hero are Gibson guitars, and I must say that I prefer the way the fender guitars look.

96
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,867
Rym: just looking at him I think looks are the only thing we have to go on.

97
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:42,470
Scott: yes You know the and fender makes like you know the Stratocaster and the Telecaster and Gibson makes the Les Paul.

98
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,464
Rym: And you know the difference between a Telecaster and a Stratocaster.

99
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:49,460
Scott: They look slightly different They sound slightly different, but they're electric.

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,790
Scott: so I guess I would assume that if you plug it into some amp Then you could make them both sound the same with the electronics.

101
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,142
Rym: I hadn't heard both of those terms until I started listening to meatloaf.

102
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:06,288
Scott: Yes, I was barely 17 and I once killed the boy with a fender guitar.

103
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:16,310
Scott: I Don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel.

104
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:24,290
Scott: I Don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster, but I do remember that it wasn't at all easy.

105
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:32,430
Scott: It required the perfect combination of the right power cords and the precise angle from which to strike.

106
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:41,713
Scott: Anyway In Guitar Hero the guitars in the game as well as the plastic guitar are all Gibson's in Rock band.

107
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:49,130
Scott: the guitar you are going to use is a fender Stratocaster made of plastic Too shabby, and I gotta tell you this picture of it.

108
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,490
Scott: It looks pretty cool, but that's not the only difference.

109
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,114
Scott: They have changed other things about this guitar.

110
00:07:55,595 --> 00:08:05,510
Scott: first of all instead of putting the colors of the buttons on The surface of the guitar you know on the surface of the buttons they put them on the side of the buttons.

111
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,169
Scott: So looking at the side of the guitar you can see what color you're pushing.

112
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:15,274
Scott: So you don't have to hold the guitar like face up to see the colors Which is pretty good.

113
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:27,982
Scott: the second thing they have done is they have added a second set of five buttons Way down at the bottom of the neck The meadley meadley meadley's as well as the Squeed Lee's?

114
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:29,307
Rym: I don't know.

115
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,170
Rym: I feel about that.

116
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,530
Scott: I want to know is that how is that gonna come into play in the game?

117
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:42,409
Scott: I mean is it just gonna be for you know your personal feelings like here comes a Squeed Lee part of the song I'm gonna go way down and play down there, or maybe here's here's what I would do.

118
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:49,281
Scott: I would just have it say in the game There would be some sort of visual cue that says switch to the other half Back to the other hand.

119
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:50,370
Rym: you might do something like that.

120
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,189
Rym: But I'd say they both work and they play the same notes.

121
00:08:53,651 --> 00:09:01,433
Rym: Just if you're playing on the Squeed Lee's it makes Squeed Lee's and if you're playing on the meadley's it makes meadley's and you Could just kind of screw around That.

122
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:06,570
Scott: see actually I think maybe the ultimate solution is to have different play modes.

123
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:12,456
Scott: You know like the normal play mode you know you're only gonna use like three buttons And you could use either.

124
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:13,947
Scott: set it doesn't matter you know.

125
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,290
Scott: and yes It would sound different if you used one of the other.

126
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:24,516
Scott: But I think there should be an advanced play mode that says use these now use these now use these and also if you use I guess in the normal play mode.

127
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:31,349
Scott: if you were to use the Squeed Lee's at the right time even though you weren't required to That you would somehow get bonus points.

128
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:38,297
Scott: I think that would be a good play mode, but I do kind of feel that It really shouldn't matter which ones you use.

129
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,079
Scott: for another reason.

130
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,918
Scott: that reason would be if you already own guitar hero guitars You don't have to replace them all.

131
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:46,666
Rym: are you sure you might not have to anyway.

132
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,550
Scott: That's what I'm wondering.

133
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:48,974
Rym: I imagine you will see.

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,990
Scott: I'm really hoping that these guitars are backwards compatible and old guitars are forwards compatible.

135
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:58,930
Rym: Otherwise the last thing I need is a collection of fake instruments to go to all of the other things.

136
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,670
Scott: I know it's like people already have enough.

137
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:12,534
Scott: You know plastic you know instruments, and if they're doing this rock band We're going to assume they're gonna need drums of some sort yeah, and then They're gonna make ska van.

138
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,362
Rym: we're gonna have these remote trumpets coming out.

139
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:23,270
Scott: Yeah, we want to minimize the Plastic musical equipment in the house so make everything as compatible as possible.

140
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:39,569
Scott: And if I'm looking at the picture here, and it is five buttons green red yellow blue orange So that's guitar here right there, so it should be alright But I definitely want to use that thing more than I want to use any of the existing guitar hero guitars Just because that's my personal flavor.

141
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:49,810
Rym: so in much more depressing news the Barbarians living over on the great old island of Albion have decided that they don't like free speech.

142
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:51,938
Scott: Well, they don't like a lot of freedom.

143
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,350
Scott: I mean they got those freaking security cameras all over the place.

144
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:56,230
Rym: Oh, yeah, like we don't in New York City.

145
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,644
Scott: And you know it took them a lot longer to get rid of their kings than we did.

146
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,696
Rym: their kings have been impotent for a Long time.

147
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:04,815
Rym: we kicked their ass 1776. we can kick him in 19.

148
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,882
Rym: I guess we already did in 1996.

149
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:07,002
Rym: Yes.

150
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:08,849
Scott: There's a reason we did that.

151
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:15,350
Rym: yeah But I know it looks like Britain for the first time in a decade according to this article here on BBC.

152
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,064
Rym: I guess that's where the news comes from an Albion.

153
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,170
Rym: I don't know what the B stands for.

154
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,310
Rym: You know I realized we've gotten a lot of new listeners.

155
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:36,490
Rym: I'm just gonna let you all know that we call Britain or Great Britain or United Kingdom or England or any of those places?

156
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:39,526
Rym: Albion because that's the only word we could come up with.

157
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,105
Rym: that Encompasses all that we mean without meaning things.

158
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:43,809
Rym: We don't expect.

159
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:49,850
Scott: yeah It's like if we just sit like when we're talking about a subset of Albion like if we're talking about just Scotland or just Wales.

160
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,408
Scott: We can do that because we know what those are.

161
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:54,820
Rym: yeah But what's the difference between the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Britain?

162
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,842
Scott: and yeah if we try to just you know say like UK And it was actually only England or something like that.

163
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:04,150
Scott: I don't know I could be wrong right now already getting yelled at.

164
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:07,015
Scott: I Just get yelled at.

165
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:12,272
Scott: so we say Albion to avoid being yelled at and always will never be wrong if we just say Albion every Time.

166
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,849
Rym: yeah, you know what someday the Romans are coming back, and this business will be sorted out.

167
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,619
Rym: Yeah, my homies know who done it all right, so sorry I love the barbarians and Albion did what.

168
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:34,192
Rym: so uh my parents say what man I'm - is a somewhat violent video game And they decided that this video game is so abhorrent that it is banned from the island Period.

169
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:38,703
Scott: huh, that's uh anti freedom to quote.

170
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:39,746
Scott: is it fascist over there?

171
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:45,995
Rym: David cook director of the BBFC I guess that should be the Albionic equivalent of the FCC.

172
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:53,435
Rym: man on two is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and Callousness of tone.

173
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:57,410
Rym: there is sustained and cumulative casual say - I like that alliteration.

174
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,485
Rym: Cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed and encouraged in the game.

175
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:05,350
Rym: the game is morally irresponsible.

176
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,203
Scott: It's it's a horror game now.

177
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,710
Scott: It's supposed to be like that.

178
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:10,969
Rym: How is this worse?

179
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,330
Rym: Then I don't know reading a book about Jack the Ripper murdering people or I don't know reading a book about anything the Bible.

180
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:20,550
Scott: I don't think we need to make an argument.

181
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:25,628
Scott: Violent video games don't hurt people because it's made a thousand times and we're right and they're wrong.

182
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:26,310
Scott: and that's the end of that.

183
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:27,715
Rym: I just it bothers me that.

184
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:32,210
Rym: well it bothers me on one level that people treat video games differently.

185
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,445
Rym: But then again, they used to treat music differently rock and roll.

186
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:43,860
Rym: now that they blame hip-hop It seems like people always want to have an excuse to blame For whenever their kids stray when bad things happen.

187
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,923
Rym: and currently video games.

188
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:45,645
Rym: is that scapegoat?

189
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,350
Rym: I mean, I look at Hillary Clinton.

190
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:57,529
Rym: She's running for president of the United States and one of her platforms is yeah I got to stop those evil video games ruining our kids and I know she's an intelligent woman and she doesn't believe that.

191
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,693
Rym: but Well, I hope.

192
00:13:58,773 --> 00:13:59,777
Scott: I don't know she might.

193
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,242
Scott: I get the feeling that but

194
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:12,603
Rym: a lot of politicians are on this boat because it's really Easy to say that video games caused the problems and that by getting rid of them You'll solve the problems because we all know that when they stopped letting people play rock and roll.

195
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,327
Rym: There was no more crime.

196
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:23,052
Rym: No Now the reason this really bothers me isn't so much that they banned it because whatever the people on the island of Albion can do Whatever they want.

197
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:27,890
Scott: I think what it's time to do is get a whole bunch of copies and start shipping them over there in disguise.

198
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,358
Rym: Here's the part that bothers me the second half of the article.

199
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:32,080
Rym: quote.

200
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:38,970
Rym: the original Mad Hunt game caused huge controversy and Was blamed for the murder of Stefan Pachira.

201
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,549
Scott: Did did the game just jump out and stab him?

202
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,422
Rym: Apparently the kid was walking through the albionic equivalent of Walmart.

203
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:51,423
Rym: So all Mart are ye olde Mart and The cartridges jumped out and stabbed him in the eye.

204
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:52,810
Scott: It's a cartridge game.

205
00:14:54,754 --> 00:15:06,490
Rym: No, what actually happened was he was randomly stabbed and beaten to death by a mugger and in some albionic town in 2004 and His parents believed that he was the killer was inspired by the game.

206
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,890
Rym: I don't think there was any evidence of that whatsoever.

207
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:16,570
Rym: But a lot of people jumped on this bandwagon and apparently the parents have been campaigning against violent video games since.

208
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:36,490
Scott: but at least like At least some of the other people who blame violent video games like the people who blame violent video games on Columbine At least those guys played doom little yeah, but obviously, you know They probably were still crazy fuckers and they probably would have killed him even if they hadn't had doom.

209
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,397
Scott: They would have killed him if it was the year 1832 and we had schools like that.

210
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,726
Scott: and you know, those kids were the same kids they were.

211
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:43,710
Scott: it was there.

212
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,343
Scott: You know, they're nuts, but at least there were video games there here.

213
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,870
Scott: Is there was there any evidence at all?

214
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:51,836
Rym: I mean, I don't know.

215
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,289
Rym: This is just in the article.

216
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:54,336
Rym: It seems to be.

217
00:15:54,356 --> 00:16:05,490
Rym: the BBC likes to a lot always have two related story like they always have the first half of the story and then the second half of the story is related but only kind of and There's not enough info and I didn't feel like looking it up.

218
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:12,537
Scott: Here's the other thing is that this game apparently got an adults only rating in the u.s right and The people at who made the game were like.

219
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,070
Scott: so upset they were like, oh we thought we were making it a mature game.

220
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:21,210
Scott: Hey man, hunt one was an M game and we made it in line with man hunt one and we're very sad.

221
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,579
Scott: We got adults only and I'm like, what wait, wait, wait.

222
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:24,880
Scott: What?

223
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,246
Scott: why are you sad you freaking?

224
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,490
Scott: it's an adults only game.

225
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,277
Scott: now It's like who.

226
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,088
Scott: everyone wants it.

227
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:34,990
Rym: Well the last game that they did like how South Park had the MA and everyone wanted to watch it.

228
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:42,623
Rym: the last game that they did this to was Carmageddon in 1997 a decade ago and apparently that was.

229
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:44,188
Scott: I played the demo of Carmageddon.

230
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:44,630
Scott: You know what?

231
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,784
Scott: It's not really adults only all you do is drive a car around it.

232
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:50,309
Scott: There's a little pixelated people go squish.

233
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:54,786
Rym: Well, they apparently overturned that on appeal and the Albion's got to play this game.

234
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:05,653
Scott: Uh-huh so we'll see what happens if this gets appealed or whatever, but I think the problem here is that the games industry itself seems to be like They're not.

235
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:06,337
Scott: they don't have the.

236
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:07,723
Scott: they have some balls.

237
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,010
Scott: They're definitely on the right side.

238
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,540
Scott: They're on our side saying, you know, video games don't hurt people etc.

239
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,021
Scott: Etc.

240
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,224
Scott: They don't cause violence.

241
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:23,416
Scott: You're all just a bunch of crazies But they also don't have the balls to say yeah, we believe this so much that we're you know, yeah Okay, rate the game adults only.

242
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:25,444
Scott: we're still gonna sell it in the goddamn stores.

243
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:26,409
Scott: What are you gonna do about it?

244
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,834
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

245
00:17:28,396 --> 00:17:30,710
Rym: Well, apparently the Albion's will just ban the game entirely.

246
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:37,070
Scott: They can do that but in the US if GameStop and EB and Amazon had balls they could still sell this game.

247
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:41,980
Scott: Adults only doesn't mean illegal to sell Yeah, but ban does.

248
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,804
Scott: yeah, it does.

249
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:44,170
Rym: I don't know the exact detail.

250
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,590
Rym: I don't know what kind of time you'll do if you illegally import this horribly seditious material into Albion.

251
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,169
Scott: I wonder should we do some smuggling action?

252
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,273
Rym: That would be awesome.

253
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:58,050
Scott: and solo bringing a whole bunch of like burn DVDs into Albion.

254
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,450
Rym: We got our friends over movies.

255
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,013
Rym: You should see.

256
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:03,470
Rym: we should just mail them a crate of the game and a note that says do what you will.

257
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:10,830
Scott: Well, we'd have to somehow like disguise the game Like we take the DVD cases and disguise them as like some other sort of like region to DVD.

258
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,390
Rym: Oh, well, you know the perfect disguise.

259
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:17,590
Rym: What we do is we mail to everyone in Britain one of those guy Fox masks and inside of it is this game?

260
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:28,468
Rym: Oh, obviously Things of the day now.

261
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:31,180
Rym: originally Scott had a thing of the day and I had a thing of the day and they were kind.

262
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:40,480
Rym: It was like a theme day not quite a theme week, but a theme day and Scott then discovered something so cool that we there's no way we could pass up.

263
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:44,320
Scott: I discovered it this morning, but I remembered it as I browse the internet.

264
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:48,180
Rym: Yeah, but suffice to say we couldn't push it off another week because it was a chance we'd forget.

265
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,272
Rym: So we'll let Scott go last.

266
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:51,499
Rym: but the original things of the day.

267
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:54,314
Rym: We really like a band you might have heard of.

268
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,380
Rym: they're called Daft Punk.

269
00:18:55,641 --> 00:19:00,659
Scott: They're two French guys who remain anonymous, but I think you can see pictures their faces on the internet.

270
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,440
Scott: But they usually wear like robot masks and they make awesome musics.

271
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:35,960
Rym: Their music is some of my favorite kind of music and one of their songs is fairly iconic to us partly because at RIT Someone I'm not sure who I think it was Scott Johnson, but I don't actually remember offhand showed us this flash video Made to this music and the flash video is the River City Ransom guy the narc guy Yeah, Ryan the narc guy the blue one Barbie and Boy from a boy and his blob not the blob just boy.

272
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:38,044
Scott: Yeah the blob does not appear now.

273
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:46,204
Rym: this video was one of those things much like the leak spin that ended up consuming all of us for about a week and To this day.

274
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,328
Rym: I really like this video.

275
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:49,980
Rym: I think this is the kind of clever shit that I like to see on the internet.

276
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:52,440
Scott: Yeah, this is definitely a classic thing of the day.

277
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:55,714
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's not been a thing of the day before even if it hasn't.

278
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,140
Rym: I figure you got to see this.

279
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,180
Rym: This is part of front row crew culture.

280
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:05,960
Rym: This is from that old era before YouTube when people would go to flash websites and watch animations that were usually pretty piss-poor.

281
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,233
Rym: Something like this was amazing back then.

282
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,399
Scott: Yeah, it was good stuff.

283
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:10,905
Scott: Well, uh, you need to see

284
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:24,225
Rym: we only thought to do this because we were reminded by my actual thing of the day which is on dig right now and I saw it and I clicked on it only because I thought it was gonna be one of those horribly lame things and if anything I was gonna make fun of it on the show.

285
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:27,720
Rym: It's the song and there's someone's hands.

286
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Rym: It looks like a girl's hands and it's called like the Daft Punk hand job whatever and the hands just kind of stand there if the cameras just zoomed in on them and She kind of dances with her hands to the song and it's kind of cute, but it's also kind of lame.

287
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,442
Rym: You wonder what's going on?

288
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:48,340
Rym: All I want to say and I'm not going to say more is Keep watching until you realize why it's awesome.

289
00:20:48,924 --> 00:21:00,551
Scott: just keep playing and if you Know how the song goes and you will if you watch the first flash video first before you watch this YouTube You will be able to figure out where it's going.

290
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:01,435
Scott: and it goes.

291
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:02,379
Rym: it goes all the way.

292
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,991
Rym: Scott when we were watching it when I showed it to Scott He pretty much said is she gonna do the?

293
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:07,775
Rym: and then she did.

294
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:08,900
Rym: it was perfect.

295
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,940
Rym: Yep, and I get a lot of respect for this because it's quite a bit more than I expected.

296
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,820
Scott: Alright, this thing today is so cool.

297
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:30,580
Scott: I didn't even like my brain can comprehend it because it's sort of like a bunch of pieces that were put together and I could have eventually figured out Hey, this could be possible, but I didn't think that it was done and apparently it was done many times.

298
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,740
Rym: Yeah, I mean the real thing is that I know about the two components that make up Scott's thing of the day.

299
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:43,980
Rym: I knew about the one thing I knew about the other thing But the idea that someone had combined them and done something this awesome is still a little bit staggering to me.

300
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:53,299
Scott: Yeah, and the fact that it was done so long ago yet not discovered on by the Internet's until just now By at least discovered widely on the Internet's until just now is is also amazing.

301
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,536
Rym: God We need internet archaeologists to find things of the day for us.

302
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:13,400
Scott: Yeah, we do alright, so whether you know it or not back in the day before we had magnetic media like floppy disks or we had Optical media like CD roms or anything like that Computers used a lot of them at least personal computers.

303
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,847
Scott: Well, I mean think about the really big computers that you know, the big old mainframes They use like two reels of tape.

304
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:30,059
Scott: right they would go from reel to reel and then eventually They when you bought a personal computer instead of having a big reel of tape you had a little cassette tape to the same kind you would put in your stereo.

305
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,369
Scott: and If you ever used a dial-up modem here those noises it makes.

306
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,979
Scott: well if you took a tape with digital data on it and Put it in a cassette player.

307
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:44,497
Scott: It would sound like a modem or a fax machine or whatever because that's what those things do.

308
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,734
Scott: is they send Digital data over an analog phone line and that an analog phone line?

309
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:51,500
Scott: that it's noise and you can hear it.

310
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:57,854
Scott: So early pcs used cassette tapes to store data regardless of that.

311
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:05,887
Scott: But my dad has a lot of vinyl records cuz he lived in a time when vinyl records with a shit and he had a Turntable and he liked music.

312
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:07,655
Scott: and he's got a lot of vinyl records.

313
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:17,187
Scott: and as a kid I listen to many of those vinyl records on my big bird turntable now, which was later replaced with a non-sesame street turntable.

314
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:20,136
Scott: and what are the vinyl records I enjoyed listening to?

315
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:23,890
Scott: and perhaps my Early preteen teenage years.

316
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:39,439
Scott: I was a Monty Python album Which contained the audio of many my Monty Python sketches without the video Which you which doesn't make sense now that you can buy all of it on DVD But it made sense in the 70s when VHS did not exist.

317
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:47,719
Scott: so On one of these Monty Python albums the vinyl record There was a secret track.

318
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:56,440
Scott: The way it worked if you know how record works is you have this vinyl disc with grooves and the needle goes in the grooves And the groove is a big spiral.

319
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:08,816
Scott: so when you spin the record around the needle goes around the entire groove getting closer and closer to the middle of the record until Eventually, the entire record is played and in the groove are bumps which bump the needle around it.

320
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:11,387
Scott: when the needle is moved around It makes noise you.

321
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:16,840
Scott: that's why when you put your finger on like a needle on a record player You can hear you know scratch it and it makes noise.

322
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:21,100
Scott: That's why when you move a record back and forth it goes wicker wicker wicker, right?

323
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:28,360
Scott: So someone had the genius idea on this Monty Python album of making a groove in the grooves.

324
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:32,611
Scott: If you were really careful on you had a really pointy record need.

325
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,135
Rym: it was practically impossible.

326
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:35,560
Scott: I was never able to do it.

327
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:46,826
Scott: You put this needle between the tracks so there's a groove going around the record and then there's a second smaller groove that is in between the Existing the main the normal groove.

328
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:56,134
Scott: and if you balance the needle on this second smaller hidden groove There would be more data it on the record that normally there would be.

329
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,280
Scott: there's hidden hidden audio, right?

330
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:10,344
Scott: apparently back in the day on certain albums people put a Hidden groove on a record and in that hidden groove they put digital data.

331
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:31,059
Scott: and if you put your needle on that hidden groove and played it and had a tape player a tape recorder and Recorded that hidden digital data on the vinyl record to a cassette tape and then if you put that cassette tape in Your Sinclair Spectrum personal computer you would get a video game

332
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:33,586
Rym: That is so

333
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,048
Scott: hot.

334
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:53,190
Scott: it's unbelievably hot and on this website here They've got screenshots and I think you can even play one of the games online and like a little st Claire emulating thing and one of them's like a text adventure with low-resolution girls on the beach and another one is like Flying trains and all sorts of weird stuff.

335
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:53,511
Scott: There's one.

336
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:55,096
Rym: I don't care if it's clusters revenge.

337
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,580
Rym: The concept is just so cool.

338
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,274
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't matter what the hell game this is.

339
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:02,526
Scott: Holy crap There were video games that people made.

340
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:06,277
Scott: look this one says like hail Satan lick his cloven hoof.

341
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:11,835
Scott: Oh And there's the basic code and it's all kinds of crazy stuff going on here.

342
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,280
Rym: Check this business out.

343
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,150
Rym: They let their homies know who done it.

344
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:22,473
Scott: This is crazy-ass business and It's kind of sad that since our technology now is just completely digital in every way.

345
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:26,140
Scott: that fun stuff like this doesn't happen anymore We don't you know?

346
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,560
Scott: We're not forced to do crazy hacks like this and the hacks we do do are most of them are far less interesting.

347
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:34,480
Rym: Well, we're seeing that in video games anyway.

348
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,636
Rym: I mean even back then when they were digital video games are still a mystery like you see

349
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:40,603
Scott: like you go to the minus world In mario

350
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:47,480
Rym: 1 and it was amazing and you couldn't understand why it was there and you'd explore the game Looking like you like in Castlevania.

351
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:57,080
Rym: I once got on top of One of the castles where you shouldn't be and there's all this water and it was scary up there and I remember this feeling of As a kid when I got into areas, I shouldn't have gone.

352
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,207
Rym: It was this land of mystery.

353
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:01,119
Scott: and now like Metroid with all its crazy wall Are you here?

354
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,897
Rym: like I heard there's a. if you walk back and forth in front of the Tower of whatever a Thousand times and then fight a dinosaur General Leo will join your party.

355
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,468
Rym: now I can just dump the ROM and see clearly that there's no code for that.

356
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:16,860
Scott: Yes, and You know why everything happens?

357
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:25,148
Scott: It's total demystification, you know, and now not only is the minus world not a mystery in mario 1 But also we can just make mods for games.

358
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:26,633
Scott: And yeah, it's the end.

359
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:31,637
Scott: but how we can make our own games Yeah, but this this is pretty awesome right here.

360
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:32,079
Scott: Check it out.

361
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:34,900
Rym: So we haven't talked about role-playing games in a while.

362
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:44,299
Rym: We figured it was about time to bring it back up and I was also reminded even before when our friend Ken was arguing with us about World of Warcraft and we haven't actually gotten a Chance to respond in detail to that yet.

363
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:52,219
Rym: But one of the points he made was that how dare we basically said that we shouldn't impinge upon the awesomeness that is Dungeons & Dragons?

364
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:54,848
Rym: And we're huge fans of role-playing.

365
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:57,880
Rym: We played D&D a lot in our lives and we continue to play.

366
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,340
Rym: We have a campaign with much of the front row crew that runs once a month.

367
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,460
Rym: That's the only time we have but I mean we played all through college.

368
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:08,354
Scott: I played all through high school in middle school and played it a lot in summer camp and such.

369
00:28:08,836 --> 00:28:18,760
Rym: and despite all that I'm gonna come straight out and say it Dungeons & Dragons Is all things considered a pretty piss-poor system of role-playing and I rather dislike it

370
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:27,560
Scott: For a game of role-playing tabletop role-playing where your goal is to play roles Dungeons & Dragons is not so great.

371
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,540
Scott: It has its benefits and its upsides, but for the most part you can do a lot better very easily.

372
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:38,681
Scott: So, I mean, I'm not even talking like go all out and do burning wheel There.

373
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:44,380
Scott: there are a lot of there many many other systems that are better than Dungeons & Dragons that no one plays now.

374
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,602
Rym: We're not.

375
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:46,740
Rym: I don't really want to get into all the other systems.

376
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,880
Rym: We're trying or the systems that are out there any of that.

377
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,924
Rym: We talked about them before.

378
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:57,320
Rym: if you're interested in alternative systems check out an old show We did where we interviewed Luke Crane the creator of burning wheel.

379
00:28:57,882 --> 00:29:01,619
Rym: That man is a role-playing genius and I respect his opinion very highly.

380
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:11,470
Scott: Anyway, the reasons why Dungeons & Dragons is not so hot as a role-playing system go all the way back to when it was created By Gary Gygax in the 70s.

381
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,260
Rym: Yeah, there were other people involved.

382
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:25,576
Rym: We're not gonna talk about the history in terms of you know, this man did this and this man did this because it's incredibly boring Yes, but basically there's a man named Gary Gygax and he is credited with creating dungeon dragon.

383
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:26,679
Rym: He's kind of scary, too.

384
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,934
Rym: Yeah, he's a scary gamer, but at the same time I got some respect for him.

385
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:31,320
Scott: He's a famous geek person.

386
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,271
Scott: You should know who he is.

387
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:32,940
Rym: You should you did.

388
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,266
Rym: He's pretty recognizable.

389
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:37,671
Scott: His name is Gygax.

390
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,173
Scott: Think about that.

391
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:38,916
Scott: What coincidence.

392
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:45,032
Scott: a guy named Gygax You know Ended up making dungeon dragons.

393
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:54,580
Scott: anyway, he He basically, you know was a fan of the miniature war games like chainmail and other such games, you know games like Warhammer.

394
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:11,023
Scott: You have miniatures and you move them around a map and they fight right and from that he spawned the first edition dungeon dragons, which While you know, it had the role-playing capacity that you know where you can pretend to be whoever you are For the most part.

395
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:16,720
Scott: It was a game of walk around the dungeon hit the monster collect the treasure, you know.

396
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:21,672
Scott: Oh, you know Search for traps, you know, you basically play it a lot.

397
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:24,140
Scott: the way you play hero quest only more complicated.

398
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,840
Rym: Yeah, the game was basically just a set of rules for combat and dungeon exploration And if you role-played beyond that it was entirely your prerogative.

399
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:41,100
Scott: yeah, I mean the original Dungeons and Dragons was so tied into the Concept of dungeon crawling that there wasn't experience points.

400
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,654
Scott: It was when you get to the next level of the dungeon you get a level.

401
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:45,979
Scott: That's how it was.

402
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:50,837
Scott: It was that crazy like net hack where it has levels of the dungeon and you go down one level.

403
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,926
Scott: Oh stairs Let's go down the stairs real quick.

404
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,739
Rym: Yeah, I always wanted to go down never wanted to go up.

405
00:30:56,001 --> 00:31:00,879
Scott: Yeah, because as soon as you went down you got more powerful and the monsters got more powerful and you got closer to the end.

406
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:03,289
Rym: So fast forward.

407
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,679
Scott: fast forward to second edition and third edition.

408
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:12,260
Scott: Dungeon dragons change quite a bit between first edition and now I guess three and a half edition and a potential upcoming.

409
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:19,660
Rym: Yeah, because I'm buying fourth edition not but dude I didn't buy three and a half edition until I had to because my players handbook fell apart.

410
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:31,338
Scott: Yes but they did change dungeon dragons quite a bit from its first edition roots as a simple dungeon crawler and they added all sorts of Rules to do this and rules to do that and they expanded it quite a bit.

411
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:46,100
Scott: and There's a lot more to help you do role-playing and there's a lot more to help you do all sorts of things and role-playing is Definitely more feasible and a lot more scenarios besides just crawling down a dungeon and killing all the monsters are possible and encouraged.

412
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:58,240
Scott: however, many remnants of the original tabletop Miniatures war game remain and actually a lot of them have been brought back somewhat especially in the more recent version.

413
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:01,389
Rym: So thus what's wrong with D&D today?

414
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:09,960
Rym: because I will say that and I used to talk about this quite a bit Especially back at RIT when you know third edition came out just about before we went to college.

415
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:14,179
Rym: So well, like I played it a little bit we converted characters in it and all that.

416
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:22,764
Rym: but I remember griping a lot about things I didn't like in third edition and how I thought third second edition was a Superior role-playing system.

417
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:27,520
Rym: and that was really partly due to the fact that I didn't know much about all the alternatives out there.

418
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:38,340
Rym: So I'd always complain Yeah, second had handled this better second had handled this better and I guess now that I'm older and wiser and more well informed I realized that second edition didn't really handle things better.

419
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:49,584
Rym: It was just that second edition had a lot of gaps in the rules where the Dungeon Master and the players were forced to just kind of Go with it and make something up or handle it somehow.

420
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:55,475
Rym: a lot of it was very subjective and As a result it encouraged a lot of creative play and a lot of role-playing.

421
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:56,560
Rym: third edition.

422
00:32:57,062 --> 00:33:01,680
Rym: They fixed that because they got rid of a lot of the complicated stupid rules like that co.

423
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:06,379
Rym: Not that I still can't calculate a fat co like that and not that I can't that co.

424
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,727
Rym: well You didn't play a lot of second head.

425
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:08,029
Rym: Did you?

426
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,820
Scott: I played it maybe ten times?

427
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:10,683
Rym: Yeah, I play.

428
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,713
Rym: I've still played more second head than I have third head.

429
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:14,139
Rym: Oh, no, it's kind of scary.

430
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,889
Rym: It's very when I really think about it.

431
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:20,165
Rym: and I used before that I played Dungeons and dragons.

432
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,153
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to play have that but you don't play.

433
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,261
Rym: Yeah, I had the rules Cyclopedia that I spilled Dr.

434
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:24,944
Rym: Pepper on once.

435
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:28,880
Scott: they almost cried about the three boxes at the Goodwill the red the blue and the whatever.

436
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:29,664
Rym: Oh, I had.

437
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:30,427
Rym: well after that.

438
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:37,860
Rym: I just dungeons and dragons the rules Cyclopedia Yeah, and then I bought advanced Dungeons and Dragons because advanced I'm older now I can take it.

439
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:56,020
Rym: But yeah, so it seems like everything that I liked about second edition Really just had to do with the fact that second edition was so convoluted and hacked together and full of gaps That within those gaps I had done all the things that superior role-playing systems do as part of the rules.

440
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,707
Scott: Yes, I mean it wasn't really.

441
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:01,040
Scott: it's not really an aspect of second edition to have good role-playing.

442
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,560
Scott: I'm pretty sure the vast majority of second edition play is not with the high quality role-playing action.

443
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:08,918
Scott: It's up to the players to fill it in.

444
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,900
Scott: So if you're playing with role players and you play second edition, you're gonna fill in the gaps with good role-playing.

445
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:21,011
Scott: But if you play second edition with normal guys, you know, just people who played first edition They're gonna do the dungeon crawl just as always.

446
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,476
Scott: It's now system doesn't help you out.

447
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:23,199
Rym: third edition.

448
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:34,513
Rym: they fix that by fixing all the rules and making everything very calculated and precise and accounted for and Balanced and as a result you lost all those gaps wherein.

449
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,639
Rym: look a combat example in the second edition.

450
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:38,947
Rym: Maybe you're in combat is your turn to fight.

451
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:42,058
Rym: You might say something instead of just I attack the ogre to the left.

452
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,967
Rym: I try to jump up and Blah blah blah do something crazy.

453
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:48,670
Rym: and the DM.

454
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,635
Rym: there's no rule for that.

455
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:58,104
Rym: the DM would usually say Make two decks checks and if you passed in both you'd say all right Roll for damage.

456
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:02,457
Rym: it worked or now you fell on your ass or something fun like that.

457
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:03,580
Rym: in third ed.

458
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:17,548
Rym: There's usually rules for what you tried to do and it's really difficult to just say I Try to do X because that doesn't fit into the system of you know partial action for move action full action all the things you can do on a turn in combat.

459
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:31,518
Scott: if they've basically got a rule covered for basic for almost anything you would want to do and Even though you could potentially, you know play it fast and loose and deviate from those rules It is usually to your detriment to deviate from the rules.

460
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:48,900
Scott: Yeah following the rules in the book and doing what they say and Selecting your options from among the words in the players handbook is the way to get the best You know results I guess the most desirable results for your character in terms of beating up bad guys.

461
00:35:49,602 --> 00:36:12,120
Rym: And the other thing is that despite all that all the things they added to make the game more good if you look at what it takes to make a character in D&D or what you put into it or There's no role-playing at all inherent if you make a character 80% of what you do is setting up the characters combat ability 10% is figuring out all the numbers and then maybe you write a little bit of backstory or

462
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:19,280
Scott: This thing is any sort of backstory or anything else you do is completely outside of the role-playing system.

463
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,309
Rym: Yep, there's no color in the game.

464
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,800
Rym: any skill you take is a appraisal.

465
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,532
Rym: I get to appraise the Rings that we find or diplomacy.

466
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:30,140
Rym: I get to smooth talk the dragon or bluff.

467
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:31,544
Rym: I get to lie to people.

468
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:32,487
Rym: there's no.

469
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:42,929
Scott: just I Will make the the argument that hey I don't want any of the role-playing in the system.

470
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:45,820
Scott: the system doesn't need to have any role-playing in it.

471
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:50,093
Scott: I can just role play on my own and I just need this system to figure out.

472
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:54,792
Scott: you know when things happen and what people Are able to do and what they're not able to do etc.

473
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:55,234
Scott: etc.

474
00:36:55,777 --> 00:37:04,640
Scott: as sort of you know We always talk about you need the restriction on your creativity because yeah sitting around the table Just saying whatever you want and being allowed to do whatever you want doesn't work.

475
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:21,006
Rym: Now I think the problem that I see with that is that when you play D&D Because none of the role-playing is part of the system at all It is very easy to get off track with the role-playing which can have very profound if subtle effects on gameplay For example.

476
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:23,500
Rym: indeed because all this stuff is outside of the rules.

477
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:29,280
Rym: It doesn't matter and it's very easy to forget or lose track of things that you set up in your character.

478
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:39,484
Rym: You might have written a little backstory thing But you might just forget about things your character believes in or you might forget that your character has a flaw or whatever because there's No reason to remember it.

479
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:43,802
Rym: There's no rule to remember it and also because it's outside of it It's.

480
00:37:44,023 --> 00:38:04,080
Rym: there's no force other than everyone's Willingness and ability to keep the role-playing interesting and on track and it's really easy for a game to get bogged down in a bunch of characters talking and talking and arguing or Deciding what to do in combat or doing things that feel like role-playing, but are actually just procedural.

481
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:16,540
Scott: Yes The only the thing is is when you take the role-playing out of the game system itself Then you sort of run out of ways to encourage the role-playing and to make the role-playing matter.

482
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,063
Scott: It becomes.

483
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:20,200
Scott: it's out of the system, which I guess doesn't really matter.

484
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:27,220
Scott: You still have the ability to role-play But now you don't have the mechanism to integrate the role-playing with the things that happen.

485
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,659
Scott: Yes, and thus can't you all you can really do.

486
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:42,140
Scott: I mean the best you can do in Dungeons and Dragons is if the DM gives XP to people who role-play or Recognize who role-plays and then you know completely separately from that, you know gives them more treasure.

487
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:48,320
Scott: But if you do stuff like that You don't make that connection with my role-playing got me that you need the direct connection.

488
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,547
Scott: I like you know that you do.

489
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:59,340
Scott: you act something and then directly that what the thing you did Results in the good stuff as opposed to you know separate non-associative rewards.

490
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:03,654
Rym: so as a result it's very difficult to keep everyone on track.

491
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:17,300
Rym: role-playing in character and as and to play D&D with good role-playing takes a lot of discipline among everyone involved both the DM and the players and That amount of discipline can often be stifling or difficult to maintain over many hours.

492
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:38,080
Scott: And while it is possible for I'm sure plenty of people role-play awesomely with the d20 system all over the world It could be you could and I have seen systems burning wheel where you can get people who are not Experienced role-players to role-play awesomely because the system is designed in such a better way.

493
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:45,645
Rym: I mean when we played these burning wheel games with Luke Crane at uber con and I we played in several he people.

494
00:39:45,665 --> 00:40:01,416
Rym: there are people who have never role-played before who will sit down at this and not know what to expect and They'll within a half hour be role-playing better than a lot of people who have played D&D for much of their lives And they'll be fully into it and they'll just they'll grasp everything and they'll be playing their character.

495
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:14,800
Rym: and in D&D You don't see that because a lot of well not often I mean we brought some people who haven't played a lot of D&D into our current game and Luckily, well, it's not really a good example because we've been using a lot of burning wheel mechanics in our D&D game.

496
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:33,140
Rym: Yeah, we've slowly been turning D&D into burning wheel But in normal cases someone who hasn't played D&D before gets so bogged down in the rules and the procedure of play that it's very easy to lose track Of actually role-playing because you're too busy trying to figure out whether you have a plus 15 or a plus 16 in your diplomacy check.

497
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:39,499
Scott: Now, let's let's actually talk about some of the specific mechanics in D&D that I think really hinder it.

498
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:40,604
Rym: All right I got a big one.

499
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:41,508
Rym: I'm gonna save till the end.

500
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,116
Scott: Yeah, the first are you gonna talk about?

501
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:43,940
Scott: combat takes forever?

502
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,130
Rym: Oh, no, no the one at the end.

503
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,747
Rym: I want to talk about Reward and failure.

504
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:48,992
Scott: I want to talk about that too.

505
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:49,333
Scott: All right.

506
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:51,280
Rym: Well that will we'll talk about All right.

507
00:40:51,340 --> 00:41:00,540
Scott: So the first thing that's obviously wrong with D&D is that if you look in that in the rule book The vast majority of the rules deal with one thing and one thing alone and that is fighting.

508
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:06,039
Scott: Combat between characters between you and monsters mostly but fighting in general.

509
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:16,140
Rym: now I liked combat a lot more in second ed than I do in third ed Despite the fact that the system of combat in third ed is very well put together and is a wonderful combat system.

510
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:17,700
Rym: It takes care of everything.

511
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:29,960
Scott: you can have fairly large battles that are very Interesting and somewhat tactical in third ed D&D and there are a lot of interesting options open to you Even if you don't have magics, but however, you have magics is even more interesting.

512
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:42,160
Rym: However in second ed because the system was so limited in scope and kind of broken You ended up being very creative in combat and combat tended not to take as long and it was much more abstract.

513
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:47,060
Scott: Regardless in both D&D systems combat does take too long.

514
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:50,040
Rym: I think it takes twice as long in third ed as it did in second ed.

515
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,543
Scott: It's still.

516
00:41:50,563 --> 00:41:53,720
Scott: that means it takes a half hour in second ed in an hour in third.

517
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,887
Rym: Well part of it is that second ed was the combat.

518
00:41:55,927 --> 00:42:01,560
Rym: in second edition D&D was designed so that you can play with miniatures But it is not necessary.

519
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:18,195
Rym: it can be abstracted very easily to where you just you choose who you are attacking with just a general sense of who's where in the room or what's going on and who you can target with spells and as a result you can Kind of imagine and just roleplay with it and roll with it a lot easier.

520
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:25,140
Rym: in third ed You have to worry about all right If I walk 15 feet to the right and then I cast magic missile.

521
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:36,394
Scott: Even so the emphasis on combat in all Dungeons & Dragons is and in fact most other role-playing games like the GURPSES and all the White wolves and things is way too much.

522
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:37,660
Scott: I mean think about it.

523
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:47,960
Scott: You're role-playing okay, so there's some sort of world And you're a character with some sort of goals and unless you're a boxer or perhaps in an army Oh, you mean like a fighter?

524
00:42:49,041 --> 00:43:00,640
Scott: Yes, or unless you're in an army that is at war even if you're an army at war in a fantasy setting How often are there actually battles, but when you play D&D it's just constant battles all over the place.

525
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:21,760
Rym: Yeah, you gotta have a fight in every game where people get restless because and I hate that and luckily we've shied away from that But even our really good games we played in college Every session there was at least one fight because otherwise at the end of the session while you might have a good role-playing session You'd feel like you wasted having this character because almost everything on your character sheet is for combat and combat alone.

526
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:32,991
Scott: Yeah, it's like even if you try to make the least combat character in D&D you end up making an Ineffective character like let's say you're role-playing right you're?

527
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:40,000
Scott: you have some sort of role-playing goal That is outside of beating people up or winning a war or fighting monsters or getting treasure, right?

528
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,760
Scott: So you make a D&D character with many non-combat skills and abilities and stuff like that.

529
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,305
Scott: You know of what there are available.

530
00:43:49,008 --> 00:44:06,980
Scott: if you do that you're going to make a largely ineffective character who is not going to be able to physically achieve their goals according to the rules because Someone else who made a character for combat will work be much more powerful within the system and they will stop you.

531
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:08,124
Rym: I mean I tried it once.

532
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:12,722
Rym: I tried to make a pacifist scholar and I put all my points into knowledge skills and all these Things.

533
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:16,760
Rym: and thus whenever the party got into combat everyone took part except me.

534
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,950
Rym: You just kind of fell asleep and didn't bother because there's nothing I could do.

535
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:27,460
Rym: and outside of combat while I could role-play Most of my interaction with the game in terms of my character was the party.

536
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:29,288
Rym: Oh, well, what do we know about X?

537
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,100
Rym: Rym rolls a d20 based on his knowledge skill?

538
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,174
Rym: Oh Rym knows X the DM reads what rims knows.

539
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:37,004
Rym: play continues It.

540
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:39,799
Rym: it made it unfun to play the character and just wasn't worth it.

541
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:48,847
Rym: If you've character can't engage in combat in standard D&D your character is often very difficult to play effectively At least within that system.

542
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,820
Rym: Yeah now this because we've already gone a little long.

543
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,480
Rym: This is the thing that really rankles me about D&D in most systems.

544
00:44:55,741 --> 00:45:01,480
Rym: Oh and it really plays into what Scott just brought up about the combat and the combat taking forever and the combat being the focus.

545
00:45:01,763 --> 00:45:07,131
Rym: Yeah, D&D Rewards success and punishes failure and that is it.

546
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:09,658
Scott: Well, it doesn't really punish failure.

547
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:11,483
Rym: Well, you die I guess.

548
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:23,199
Scott: yes, but the thing or you don't get XP the thing in D&D is look look even not the d20 system Previous systems, right you're rolling this 20-sided dice, right and some numbers are failure and some are success.

549
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:30,999
Scott: but in general you always have a 5% chance of guaranteed success and a 5% chance of failure.

550
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,512
Scott: and Usually success means you got what you wanted and what you expected.

551
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:43,379
Scott: the monster died you were able to jump over the cliff You were able to climb up the wall, whatever.

552
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:54,650
Rym: Failure in D&D basically means either you died or At most you don't progress the plot You don't progress the role-playing or the story or anything.

553
00:45:54,851 --> 00:46:01,178
Scott: the game just stops until you can find another method way to succeed by rolling a different number or somewhere else.

554
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:06,075
Scott: or You have to go and do something else in a large tree blocks your path.

555
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:07,520
Rym: Yep, like oh, we're at a door.

556
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:09,115
Rym: We got to get into this room pick the lock.

557
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:11,690
Rym: I fail Crap what do we do now?

558
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,200
Rym: We have to figure out how to pick this lock.

559
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,186
Scott: Well, we bash the door down we fail.

560
00:46:15,587 --> 00:46:16,971
Scott: All right, what do we do now?

561
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:43,333
Rym: that and that's really the the crux of the matter Is that in D&D if your characters fail at something that sucks always and if your character succeed That's awesome always but in it in a better role-playing system because in the real world or in a fantasy world or anything Sometimes people fail and I think that a good role-playing system or a good role-playing session is one Whereby you play your character as that person.

562
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:48,329
Rym: if they succeed or fail You still have the same amount of enjoyment.

563
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,111
Scott: Yes.

564
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,300
Scott: See you got to remember that in D&D, right?

565
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:56,900
Scott: It seems like you're the character that you are playing is separate from you, right?

566
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:03,119
Scott: And a lot of people are like all to have the really good role-playing you have to make them one in the same To be your character and you do in some ways.

567
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,271
Scott: But at the same time you're playing a game.

568
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:12,759
Scott: if you're any game you're playing board game video game Whatever, you should be having fun the whole time and no matter what happens.

569
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:31,855
Scott: All right, if you'd be playing a video game and you just can't beat it It's not good if it's not enjoyable the whole time and a D&D when your character succeeds it's enjoyable and when your character fails, it is not enjoyable for you the human being playing Dungeons and Dragons an Ideal role-playing system

570
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:33,178
Rym: how Bernie will burn?

571
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,044
Scott: you should be fun.

572
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:37,130
Scott: whether your character succeeds or fails.

573
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,316
Scott: It should be fun if you die.

574
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:41,230
Scott: if your character dies, it should be fun if your character falls off a cliff.

575
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:43,150
Scott: It should be fun if your character gets stabbed.

576
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,962
Scott: It should be fun if your character gets into a fight and gets beat up.

577
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:52,049
Scott: It should be fun if your character gets Captured by the evil wizard no matter what happens.

578
00:47:52,592 --> 00:47:56,003
Scott: It should be fun for the human being pretending to be that character.

579
00:47:56,204 --> 00:48:03,126
Rym: now to clarify that a little bit I mean it should be fun but what that really means is that let's take an example from burning wheel versus D&D.

580
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:16,260
Rym: if You in D&D you get to the door and you attempt to get through the door by the means you have available and you fail now the game bogs down into a procedural how to get past the door or do we avoid the door or whatever?

581
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:32,506
Rym: and Anytime you see it's like you're climbing a ladder and any toward the plot goals or your characters goals and anytime you roll Well, you go up a rung and anytime you roll poorly You're stuck on that rung until you roll well or do something to make yourself get past it.

582
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:35,134
Rym: in burning wheel There's no ladder.

583
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:40,750
Rym: There's just a sea of possibilities and if you fail at something you failed at it.

584
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:41,900
Rym: You don't procedurally.

585
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:42,142
Rym: Yes.

586
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:42,950
Rym: Well, what if I do this?

587
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,391
Rym: What if I do?

588
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,198
Scott: the rule is let it ride.

589
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:49,875
Scott: if you roll it opening the door and you fail to open the door You fail to open the door.

590
00:48:50,016 --> 00:49:02,833
Rym: period myself Scott and Pete played a very good short demo of burning wheel with Luke once where it was three characters who all have goals and we all want this one McGuffin in this place and we're Arguing over and whatever.

591
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:06,603
Rym: Scott grabs the McGuffin and fucking runs away.

592
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:09,928
Rym: So Pete and I say alright, we're in this together Let's get that little prick.

593
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,261
Rym: So Scott tries to escape and we try to get away.

594
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,956
Rym: now when D&D this would go on forever Scott tries runs away.

595
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:18,061
Rym: we chase him run chase him.

596
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,066
Rym: There's rules for chasing.

597
00:49:19,488 --> 00:49:22,039
Rym: if we catch him Alright now maybe I can get away this other way.

598
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,410
Rym: maybe I can get away this other way in burning wheel.

599
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:27,119
Rym: The way we resolve that was we did the thing.

600
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,343
Rym: We've rolled the dice.

601
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,670
Rym: will Scott be able to get away or not?

602
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,209
Rym: There is no procedural bullshit.

603
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:37,209
Rym: It's just will the plot go in direction Scott escapes or direction Scott does not?

604
00:49:37,651 --> 00:49:40,279
Rym: Scott rolled and it ended up that he was not able to escape.

605
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:43,730
Rym: what that meant was that that plot point was done.

606
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:44,835
Rym: It was settled.

607
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:46,543
Rym: Scott did not escape from us.

608
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,150
Rym: We are going to catch him now.

609
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,287
Rym: We can skip the procedural bullshit and get on to the role-playing of the real situation.

610
00:49:52,307 --> 00:49:53,010
Rym: That's interesting.

611
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,878
Scott: Yeah, so now we move directly to.

612
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,123
Scott: Scott is caught.

613
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,408
Scott: they have caught up to Scott.

614
00:49:57,549 --> 00:49:58,493
Scott: now What do you do?

615
00:49:58,513 --> 00:50:02,510
Rym: and it's this idea of by skipping the procedural crap?

616
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:07,935
Rym: It's so much easier to get into character because you don't have to worry about the meta You don't have to worry about.

617
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,204
Rym: but what if my character dies?

618
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:11,810
Rym: you just look at your character.

619
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:15,141
Rym: This is what my character wants and this is what he is willing to risk.

620
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:16,967
Rym: I am also willing to risk that.

621
00:50:17,308 --> 00:50:17,749
Rym: let's go.

622
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:21,910
Scott: And as you play the game the game never stalls no matter what you do.

623
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,840
Scott: The game is always moving forward.

624
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,368
Scott: who knows where it's moving forward.

625
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:27,017
Scott: I don't know It could be going left right up down.

626
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:29,790
Rym: who knows you skip the boring parts and get to the dramatic.

627
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:37,150
Scott: Yes The game always moves forward towards wherever it's going and in D&D the game a lot of times stops.

628
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,810
Scott: I mean it stops when you have a combat that might in-game take five minutes of time.

629
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:45,703
Scott: You spent like two hours moving miniatures around and rolling a billion dice.

630
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:51,085
Rym: Yeah and playing all this meta game because combat in D&D is so meta.

631
00:50:51,426 --> 00:51:04,790
Rym: it's a tactical miniatures game and you can't think in terms of what your character is thinking because you have to think in terms of Five footsteps and attacks of opportunity in burning wheel and a lot of other good systems like burning wheel particularly combat.

632
00:51:05,335 --> 00:51:12,350
Rym: While it can be very complex It is still from the perspective of the character as opposed to from the perspective of the player.

633
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:20,934
Rym: You're not manipulating the five footsteps and doing the rules and figuring out if my fireball will be able to engulf all the goblins But not engulf Scott.

634
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:26,416
Rym: you say alright, I try to stab him because he's in front of me I try to hold back.

635
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:27,139
Rym: I try to faint.

636
00:51:27,481 --> 00:51:29,570
Rym: it's all from the perspective of the character.

637
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,350
Rym: It's like a first-person view instead of a third-person view.

638
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:35,550
Rym: It's really hard to explain what I mean by that, but I hope you get the point.

639
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,075
Scott: You just buy the book and find out.

640
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:40,887
Rym: yeah, you can get into the characters head in combat and in role-playing.

641
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:49,649
Rym: in D&D It's very hard to stay in the character's head and still do the combat Especially since the combat takes an hour to resolve what takes a minute of game.

642
00:51:50,278 --> 00:51:50,907
Scott: It's in the end.

643
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:59,362
Scott: D&D is a role-playing a tabletop role-playing system and it is possible to have excellent role-playing while using yes Don't come to us and say but we play D&D.

644
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,930
Scott: Well, it is possible But yes, but D&D is not conducive to role-playing.

645
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,156
Scott: It is not a catalyst of awesome role-playing.

646
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:11,589
Scott: don't in fact the opposite of a catalyst don't pretend of a catalyst than anti-catalysts hindrance.

647
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:17,095
Rym: D&D does not assist your role-playing in any real Tangible way.

648
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:28,203
Rym: D&D can be played well and with good role-playing But it takes so much discipline and you can't pretend that it's easy to maintain Good role-playing throughout an entire game or campaign of D&D.

649
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,569
Scott: It's not I can't do it.

650
00:52:30,371 --> 00:52:37,891
Scott: But yeah, if you're looking for you know D&D doesn't also have the advantage that it's available everywhere and easily accessible Where it's.

651
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:45,224
Scott: pretty much every other RPG is much harder to find requiring a game store or worse or the Internet's or something or to get the books even.

652
00:52:45,346 --> 00:53:05,465
Scott: but regardless D&D as a system for tabletop role-playing like you're trying to play roles and act and such is not so great and other things like burning wheel and even inspectors and It's a primetime adventures and all those other all those other games.

653
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:06,710
Rym: Listen to the Luke crane interview.

654
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,721
Rym: He talks about every game you should play.

655
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:10,350
Scott: They are much better at it.

656
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,063
Scott: They are conducive to role-playing and are not like D&D.

657
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:15,688
Rym: So why do we play D&D?

658
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,070
Rym: Personally, the only reason is that it is the lowest common denominator.

659
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:27,489
Rym: everyone knows how to play D&D or at least enough to where you've got the critical mass to just go with it and not Worry about teaching someone a new system.

660
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:34,728
Rym: but we're working very hard to eventually drop D&D entirely and just use burning wheel or a similar system.

661
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:40,170
Scott: and also if You're we are starting with people who have already been playing D&D for years.

662
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,950
Scott: We're already D&D geeks and we already own the books.

663
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:46,629
Scott: So it's actually it's very cheap for everyone to play it if you wanted to play something else.

664
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,314
Scott: Basically, it's not.

665
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:52,550
Scott: it would be easy if we had one person who already knew something else and could teach it to us.

666
00:53:52,610 --> 00:54:04,790
Scott: But we're all sort of learning it together and it's quite difficult especially on a once a month basis to learn a new system because learning any role-playing system even a tiny one is Not as simple as like learning a board game.

667
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,599
Scott: We just learn the rules and then you follow the instructions.

668
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:08,281
Scott: Yeah, it's.

669
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:14,389
Scott: it's a whole big learning experience and It's a lot of work and it takes time.

670
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,688
Scott: But if you haven't learned any systems already.

671
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:20,578
Rym: Go right to the burning wheel.

672
00:54:20,598 --> 00:54:22,426
Rym: it it seems complicated.

673
00:54:22,446 --> 00:54:23,049
Rym: just go with it.

674
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:28,548
Rym: I See the question in this show that we're just concluding right now was what's wrong with D&D?

675
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,547
Rym: And I think the answer Scott and I just came to was it's not burning wheel.

676
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:34,234
Scott: Yeah I'd wanted to.

677
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:40,700
Scott: I started out the episode not wanting to mention burning wheel so much and just keep mentioning what's wrong with D&D.

678
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:47,923
Scott: and but it's kind of hard once you've Seen the burning wheel and experienced it to get away from it.

679
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:52,973
Rym: Yeah, and it's not just burning wheel It's just that burning wheel was the first system We ran into.

680
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:58,110
Rym: that solved all the problems that we hadn't even realized were problems in D&D for the most part.

681
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,002
Rym: I mean all the problems I thought were with third ed.

682
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:01,665
Rym: that second ed did.

683
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:02,067
Rym: Okay.

684
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:02,810
Rym: I was just stupid.

685
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:10,870
Scott: I'm sure there are plenty of other awesome systems out there that are akin to burning wheel and you know if I Experience them I would say oh, this is just as amazing.

686
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:14,212
Rym: I think part of it was the sheer force of Luke cranes Personality.

687
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:19,150
Scott: yes that and the fact that I do think that burning wheel is the biggest of these role-playing systems.

688
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:26,630
Scott: You know, it's sort of like, you know D&D gurps and all those big ones and then on the top of the indie pile is like burning wheels.

689
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,150
Scott: It's like the king of the indie RPGs and there's a reason it's the king of the indie RPGs.

690
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:33,889
Rym: So in this case, we don't say anything like this often.

691
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:37,763
Rym: But there's gonna be a forum thread about this show like there always is.

692
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:41,577
Rym: but I want to hear what you guys have to say About D&D and whether or not you agree with us.

693
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:43,845
Rym: I want to hear about your experiences.

694
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,070
Scott: We want that for every episode.

695
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:50,669
