1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,820
Scott: It's Wednesday December 14th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,799
Scott: We're not really gonna talk about much because today sucked, but there is some anime news.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,446
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:27,080
Rym: So, uh, we've been sitting here for the last hour and There's nothing to talk about today at all.

5
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:28,820
Scott: He ain't kidding.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,640
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's anime day.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,780
Rym: Normally, we have a lot to talk about but we haven't gotten any Netflix's in to watch yet because we've been busy doing other things.

8
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,448
Scott: Netflix has been a little slow.

9
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:41,633
Rym: Yes, suddenly.

10
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:45,609
Rym: I don't know if anyone else is having trouble But Netflix suddenly just slowed the fuck down.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,897
Scott: Yeah, hopefully they'll pick back up soon.

12
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,387
Rym: Yeah But anime news.

13
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:57,560
Rym: we got a bunch of that because it's anime day and we can talk about it But there's really nothing else that either we have interesting commentary on or that you would care about.

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:08,220
Scott: I mean if you don't believe me go look at the headlines on the geek news sites for Wednesday, December 14th and You're gonna see some pretty dumb crap.

15
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:09,986
Rym: Mean, all right here.

16
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:12,360
Rym: Let's all look through some of these headlines on slashdot.

17
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,729
Rym: So IBM promotes Linux partners to highest here.

18
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,040
Rym: Well, I work for IBM and that stuff doesn't really mean anything.

19
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:24,319
Scott: Yep, let's let's find another one that has a whole lot of comments.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,224
Scott: Alright, here's one new object found at edge of solar system Great on Pluto.

21
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:35,176
Rym: So, uh, people have been saying that off and on a lot for a long time.

22
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,766
Rym: Mm-hmm And we're not gonna get there anytime soon.

23
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,052
Scott: No, it's just a rock means nothing.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:48,431
Scott: Oh, here's one of the whole lot of comments Cyberattacks on us linked to Chinese military, huh?

25
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:51,460
Rym: China would have a vested interest in attacking u.s.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,683
Rym: IT infrastructure.

27
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:53,827
Scott: Yeah, they do.

28
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:54,369
Scott: Huh?

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,500
Rym: Fancy that I never would have guessed me either.

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,860
Rym: Oh Star Wars galaxies.

31
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:04,735
Rym: Apparently Lucas arts broke it and the fans are all complaining.

32
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,040
Scott: I would complain too.

33
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,789
Scott: They friggin changed the game.

34
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:09,074
Scott: It's not the same game you bought.

35
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:09,960
Scott: It's like come on, man.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,904
Rym: the thing is I have no sympathy for the people playing it because if you like if you're playing a game you're paying for it and They change it.

37
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:17,788
Rym: You don't like it anymore.

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,115
Rym: Stop paying.

39
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,140
Scott: Oh, yeah keep paying.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,040
Scott: You're just rewarding them for hurting you know, wait Lucas seems to have a trend of making things and then changing them later.

41
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,592
Rym: Oh who shot first?

42
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:28,579
Scott: I don't know.

43
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:33,240
Scott: I forget because he changed every copy of the film except for the ones that we have.

44
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:39,900
Rym: You cannot take them and let this go down into posterity in case you're centuries or millennia from now.

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,440
Rym: Archaeologists discover this show and they listen to it no matter what evidence you find to the contrary.

46
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,468
Rym: Han Solo shot first.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,583
Scott: not only did he shoot first Greedo didn't shoot at all He just slumped over.

48
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:56,456
Scott: Yep, and there was an explosion of smoke from under the table to signify this.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,795
Rym: Oh The Dungeons & Dragons online MMO moved from alpha to beta.

50
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:06,429
Rym: Yep exciting Almost everyone who plays it says it sucks.

51
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:07,272
Scott: Oh my god.

52
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,035
Scott: I just had a vision.

53
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,059
Scott: we had to go back a little bit.

54
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,106
Scott: Uh, you know, who's that guy?

55
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:19,218
Scott: Charlton Heston, right and he holds the gun and he says from my cold dead hands Yeah, replace a gun with with a Star Wars DVD.

56
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:19,680
Scott: That's correct.

57
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,419
Rym: We should do that we should.

58
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:31,176
Rym: But uh the D&D online MMO, I mean I was really excited about it when I first heard.

59
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,300
Scott: I wasn't excited at all.

60
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,145
Rym: I know there's like.

61
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,834
Rym: I was excited in an optimistic.

62
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:35,960
Rym: if they do this, right?

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,844
Rym: It would be awesome.

64
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,130
Rym: And you know what they didn't do it, right?

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,120
Scott: I don't think it can be done, right?

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,436
Rym: Yeah, I could if you said because there were services a long time ago.

67
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:53,127
Rym: We're basically Yeah, there was a bunch of dungeon master types who ran the game and they just played NPCs and ran content for all the players And it was just this role-playing thing.

68
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,151
Rym: That's not a D&D MMO Why not Dungeons & Dragons?

69
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,440
Rym: and it's massively multiplayer.

70
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:09,939
Rym: Yeah, if you have a thousand DMS playing NPCs and just running plots for whatever players are in the game all the time And you happen to use the D&D rules can't make that work.

71
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,206
Rym: Yeah, you could.

72
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,759
Rym: the problem is it'd be expensive because you have to hire all those DMS.

73
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,447
Scott: Even so it wouldn't work.

74
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:16,909
Rym: Actually.

75
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:17,430
Rym: It did work.

76
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,057
Rym: There are a lot of games like that in the 90s.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,334
Scott: Yeah, each game was like five people now.

78
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:27,120
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, actually I'll if you want since I don't have the rest.

79
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:32,620
Rym: I don't have it handy now But I'll because I used to play a bunch of them and the more popular ones had a couple hundred people.

80
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,152
Scott: All right, now do that with 50,000 people.

81
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,512
Rym: Well 50,000 altogether means you have a lot more money.

82
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,360
Rym: So you hire a lot more dungeon masters.

83
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,700
Scott: Alright, but now what you're gonna do is you're gonna raise any to pay those dungeon masters.

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,579
Scott: You're not gonna be able to compete with other MMOs and charge a reason.

85
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,252
Rym: Oh Well, yeah, the thing is it'd be so much better.

86
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,498
Rym: Maybe people be willing to pay.

87
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,868
Rym: No, it wouldn't work, yeah, you don't know.

88
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,233
Scott: you know what.

89
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:02,520
Scott: even if people are willing to pay There won't be enough people willing to pay that much money.

90
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,000
Scott: You won't recruit the development cost of developing the game in the first place.

91
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,180
Rym: There might not be so much to develop other than things that we could just do here in our spare time.

92
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,240
Scott: No making a game that you can sell these days like millions and millions of dollars At least if you wanted to be published by a major publisher.

93
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:23,659
Scott: Sure that if you're gonna have a D&D license which costs a lot of money you're gonna need to do.

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,370
Rym: You know that alone doesn't have to be specifically D&D.

95
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:26,952
Rym: I use D.

96
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:27,876
Scott: Well, there's the problem.

97
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,820
Scott: It's a D&D MMO.

98
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,683
Scott: That's what it is.

99
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:30,686
Rym: No, it's not.

100
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,349
Rym: It's it's nothing.

101
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,018
Rym: It's just a crap MMO that happens to be attached to D&D.

102
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,220
Scott: That's what I said.

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,040
Scott: That's why I said it was crap in the first place with other people because it had the D&D license thought it was so great.

104
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,332
Scott: Well, I said because it has the D&D licenses.

105
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,700
Rym: Oh, doesn't that make you special?

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,430
Scott: It does because I know what's crap and what's not see.

107
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,820
Rym: the thing is you said it was crap before we knew anything about it.

108
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,684
Rym: I said, I don't know.

109
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,227
Rym: I hope it's good.

110
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,499
Scott: I knew it had a D&D license and I knew there was an MMO.

111
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,151
Scott: That's all I needed to know.

112
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,360
Rym: So I hoped it would be good.

113
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,794
Scott: There is no way to make an MMO with the D. hoped hoped wait.

114
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:00,937
Rym: So you're saying there's no way.

115
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:01,800
Rym: you're absolutely sir.

116
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,355
Scott: There is no way to make an MMORPG with the D&D license.

117
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:07,860
Scott: That also does not suck.

118
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:08,404
Rym: You know.

119
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:11,065
Rym: once again because he didn't listen to me I meant D&D.

120
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,637
Rym: when I say D&D I mean role-playing is a generic sense.

121
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:14,320
Rym: I use that word there.

122
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,186
Rym: I use Kleenex our band-aid.

123
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,750
Rym: Yeah, you'd use GURPS.

124
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,880
Rym: you could use any number of a million systems that work just fine.

125
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:26,217
Scott: But we this one we knew that had the D&D system and therefore I knew that it would suck.

126
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:30,492
Scott: Okay And I was right great.

127
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:31,820
Scott: That's what I was saying.

128
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:39,965
Scott: Fear appear anyway, there's other crap news Here this one.

129
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,133
Scott: This is like the second most commented.

130
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,679
Scott: slash that story the tip of the day.

131
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,100
Scott: What makes a good web font?

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,743
Rym: Splendid.

133
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:54,979
Scott: yeah today The news tap had just like molasses coming out.

134
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,434
Rym: Well, there's real news in the real world, but you guys know all about that.

135
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:02,314
Scott: Anyway, yeah We don't want to become a real news show.

136
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,545
Scott: Yeah All right.

137
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,639
Scott: So let's get right on into it.

138
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:08,562
Scott: Things of the day.

139
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:18,598
Rym: All right.

140
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:21,046
Rym: So my thing of the day This isn't a cool thing.

141
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:26,219
Rym: Like I usually have or a cute thing or an interesting thing Something that ticked me off a lot.

142
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:32,619
Rym: Now actually if you read the site, it's it actually is interesting because you'll wonder how could people believe this.

143
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,731
Rym: but basically about.com and it's good this is good.

144
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:42,579
Rym: This is all over dig and it's all over delicious and It just it frightens me that people are so interested in this.

145
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:55,840
Rym: but basically this article is the ten most puzzling ancient artifacts and It brings up all these Supposedly unexplained weird phenomena all over the world that prove like aliens exist or whatever.

146
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,455
Scott: Well, if it's just an artifact, no, no, no, they're not.

147
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,258
Rym: I'll get I'll explain All right.

148
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:17,540
Rym: So one of them are these grooves fears that people claim they've been finding in like South African mines like inside of fossils and inside of ancient rocks recently and They claim that they're dated to you know, 2.8 billion years ago, but they look man-made.

149
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,594
Rym: The problem is they don't say that they've never been tested.

150
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,260
Rym: No one's ever actually touched these things.

151
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,839
Rym: They're described as composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white.

152
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:35,419
Rym: Because I'm sure if a scientist, you know tested one of these things He couldn't tell you that it was just a piece of metal or what kind of metal it was.

153
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,630
Scott: Hmm, and they've never actually done a carbon test.

154
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,220
Rym: You can't carbon test inorganic Scott.

155
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,505
Scott: Oh, I didn't know.

156
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,539
Rym: carbon-type dating is actually kind of crappy for most things.

157
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:49,756
Rym: Yeah, but they're just or like these dropa stones.

158
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,519
Rym: these are even worse.

159
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:21,099
Rym: Basically to some of these are some spirits like disc shaped stones that have some markings on them and this crackpot Scientists claims that they the the markings on them which are almost microscopic are actually this ancient alien language that he was able to translate and apparently it depicts Alien ships that crashed on earth of these people called the dropa and whose descendants left them in this cave Except that one.

160
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,969
Rym: These were totally debunked, you know dozens and dozens of times.

161
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,124
Rym: and to the guy who talks about him sells them Sells them sells them.

162
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:31,066
Rym: you can buy them from him.

163
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,309
Scott: Does he have an infinite supply?

164
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:32,850
Rym: I don't know.

165
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:40,900
Scott: the only Because if it was like if it was really Stones from aliens you imagine there's only a few of them and he doesn't have so many.

166
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:49,600
Rym: Oh, we've got a whole bunch of them hundreds of stone discs Hundreds of me buried in the dust of ages on the cave so we can somehow buy them all and then he wouldn't have anymore.

167
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:56,120
Rym: The only other person who has ever even made reference to these things in a positive light is the scientist who?

168
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,270
Rym: Surprisingly enough also sells them.

169
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:10,378
Rym: Oh Only of the ten things on this site seven of them have been 100% fully and beyond a reasonable doubt debunked by science.

170
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,963
Rym: Wow And what?

171
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,933
Rym: the only one that's even legitimate is the Baghdad battery, which?

172
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,097
Scott: what's the Baghdad battery?

173
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:16,980
Rym: It was a battery.

174
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:22,467
Rym: Well, it was a an artifact that was found a while ago in Around where Baghdad is today.

175
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,120
Rym: All right, and it was basically a battery.

176
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:36,980
Rym: It was a clay pot with a rod through it and it basically if you fill it with an acidic or an alkaline liquid It generated a small current and it looks like they used it in ancient times to electroplate things with various metals like gold.

177
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:38,245
Scott: That makes sense.

178
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:42,140
Scott: Yeah, why is that an unexplained artifact?

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:52,220
Rym: Because they talk about oh, how come humans had batteries so long ago And then they didn't have many more than they rediscovered them because they didn't realize that it was electricity in a battery.

180
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,860
Scott: And they they just knew that it was a way to plate things and they didn't realize that.

181
00:10:57,026 --> 00:11:00,569
Rym: The issue was that in the Middle Ages They didn't have electroplating or anything.

182
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:10,167
Scott: The knowledge was lost, you know Dark Ages Maybe the knowledge is lost but also it could have been that just people didn't want to plate things anymore So they didn't do it in those forgot.

183
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:14,782
Rym: No, most likely the knowledge was just lost during the Dark Ages Hmm.

184
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:21,560
Scott: Yeah, but oh it could have been like one asshole came up with electroplating because we've only found one battery, right?

185
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:23,687
Rym: I believe they found more since then.

186
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,756
Rym: There's actually a lot of cool articles on these batteries.

187
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:31,922
Scott: No, that's pretty cool Alright, but if it was like just a few it could have been like one asshole figured it out and didn't tell anyone and then He died.

188
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,916
Rym: Well considering the preponderance of electroplated artifacts from that era.

189
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,668
Scott: Oh All right, then.

190
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,989
Rym: Yeah mine and Similar things have been found in other older ancient cultures.

191
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,494
Scott: Just just guessing possibility.

192
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,300
Rym: Yeah, but pretty much everything else on this website.

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,524
Rym: It's just complete bullshit.

194
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:51,020
Scott: I'm sure Randy will find out about it and make a nice little yeah on Friday.

195
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,153
Rym: So I urge all of you out there who use delicious.

196
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:58,280
Rym: if you see things like this You know, that's just obviously false.

197
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,859
Rym: Tag it with the flim-flam tag.

198
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:01,420
Scott: Yeah.

199
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:06,197
Scott: And if you want to see a list of things that are false just go to delicious slash tag.

200
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:10,090
Scott: slash flim-flam One word all one word FLIM FLAM.

201
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:13,080
Scott: Yep, and you'll see all kinds of things that are bullshit.

202
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,164
Scott: So if you see something and you're not sure if it's quite right or not You can ask Randy.

203
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,780
Scott: you can go search his site or you can check delicious flim-flam and see if we've found it.

204
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:35,179
Scott: Also because we might have and tagged it now Randy of course being James Randy the founder and leader of the James Randy Educational Foundation, which is the premier organization for finding complete bullshit like this and pointing it out.

205
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:40,411
Rym: We're going to do a whole show on Randy at some point And actually we're gonna try to interview him if we can.

206
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,240
Rym: but that's down the road way down the road.

207
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,314
Scott: All right, my thing of the day.

208
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:49,838
Scott: Yeah If you're in prison, they don't let you have so much stuff.

209
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:58,407
Scott: They really only let you have what your clothes Like some plastic Utensils in the kitchen.

210
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,431
Rym: prison ain't so bad.

211
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:03,772
Rym: You can make sangria in the toilet Of course, it's shank or be shanked.

212
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:13,439
Scott: Oh, of course Yeah, if you drama anyway You know you get a towel get a roll of toilet paper Maybe a plastic bag.

213
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:15,477
Scott: You know, you don't get a lot of stuff.

214
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:31,049
Scott: so Prisoners who need things or want things And having a lot of time to think about things are really good at finding ingenious ways to combine normal everyday items into other objects.

215
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:44,635
Scott: and there is in fact websites and other things devoted to collections of interesting and intuitive and ingenuity prisoner inventions and Some of them are actually really cool.

216
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,914
Rym: Then you give us an example.

217
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,848
Scott: Well, some guys made a chess set by carving out pieces of soap into pieces.

218
00:13:53,289 --> 00:14:09,132
Scott: All right another guy took a roll a plastic bag and he rolled some You know a towel around it and he turned it into sort of like Like a love buddy Great.

219
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,705
Rym: Yeah, I need you to steal a banana from the cafeteria.

220
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:20,665
Scott: I Don't know Because it's shank or be shanked, of course, of course All right, here we go.

221
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:25,770
Scott: They also made a cigarette lighter out of almost nothing.

222
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,095
Rym: What do you mean?

223
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,480
Rym: almost nothing like out of the air?

224
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:29,323
Scott: All right.

225
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:33,788
Scott: Well, it's a couple paper clips, right and You know.

226
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:58,310
Scott: he took some ice cream spoons and he glued them together with paper clips in them to make a plug that can go into the outlet in the wall and Then he you know, he had more paper clips coming out going into a saltwater solution and Get the electricity and use that to light cigarettes, you know, because there was a little where the paperclip came out.

227
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:58,752
Scott: There was a little.

228
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,740
Scott: he made a little coily bit and it heated up.

229
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:06,790
Scott: He could also plug devices into it if he had a you know, something that plugged into the wall.

230
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,394
Scott: That's pretty cool.

231
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:08,976
Rym: Aha.

232
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,690
Scott: I mean I wouldn't have the balls to stick paper clips into the outlet in the wall.

233
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:20,786
Rym: Trying to make a thing to light cigarettes In power devices and being shocked by a hundred and ten volts isn't so bad.

234
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,990
Scott: Isn't it 120?

235
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,784
Rym: Actually, there's a lot of it's 110 and it's 120. awesome.

236
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:38,656
Rym: it can be anywhere between because it's actually neither and Depending on what school electricity you went to or just where you live people say 110 220 or 120 240 Not bad.

237
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,514
Rym: It's pretty much 50/50 Half.

238
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,409
Rym: maybe we'll do a show about that if we get bored enough.

239
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,037
Scott: Yeah, but that's pretty crazy.

240
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:54,345
Rym: making a cigarette lighter that plugs into the wall out of paper clips Wow, so I guess prisoners aren't stupid or at least they're canny like animals.

241
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:58,036
Scott: Well, some of them are Not stupid.

242
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,070
Rym: well considering that most people in prison in the u.s.

243
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,250
Rym: Today are in there for nonviolent crimes that didn't hurt anyone but themselves.

244
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:10,098
Rym: yeah, it's you know smoking a little bit of marijuana or Being a dissident everything sucks.

245
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:11,163
Rym: Yeah.

246
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,134
Rym: Yeah sucks looks like Mostly just cuz.

247
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,869
Rym: we got nothing to talk about today and this is like the worst show we've done yet.

248
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,964
Scott: Yeah, now I see why a lot of people don't do the daily shows.

249
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:26,574
Rym: I Promise we'll have better tomorrow at least guaranteed, yeah Really?

250
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,110
Scott: Cuz something has to happen tomorrow.

251
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:33,649
Scott: But I guess I never really thought about like this, you know, it feels like there's always something happening.

252
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,130
Scott: So I never really imagined that there would be a day where nothing happened.

253
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:40,970
Rym: At least nothing happened that we can really talk about on the show that you'll care about.

254
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,919
Rym: Yeah, I mean lots of stuff happened.

255
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,410
Rym: Iran said the Holocaust didn't happen.

256
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:47,656
Rym: Tookie Williams got executed.

257
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,522
Rym: There's riots all over Sydney.

258
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:57,365
Rym: There's the riots in France were going on, but They're still going on in France not per se but there's still a lot of racial violence going on.

259
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,050
Rym: is the aftermath great?

260
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:00,688
Scott: Yeah, great.

261
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,817
Rym: So anyway, it's anime day Mm-hmm.

262
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,898
Rym: Any new anime except mushishi, which we're still watching.

263
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,185
Scott: She's great waiting for episode eight.

264
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:10,747
Scott: I think now.

265
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,574
Scott: Yeah Mmm.

266
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:13,780
Scott: All right.

267
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,890
Rym: So, uh remember Shinsen subs.

268
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,817
Rym: We talked about them last anime day.

269
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,388
Scott: how funimation went and harassed them and said hey stop torrenting.

270
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,976
Rym: Well, we got a follow-up as to why that happened.

271
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,520
Scott: Well it bears.

272
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:32,202
Scott: apparently Shinsen was actually still distributing many licensed Available things.

273
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,888
Scott: Oh So they deserve what they got.

274
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:41,201
Rym: Yeah, I Mean, I guess it's one of the standpoints of the anime community.

275
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,910
Rym: Is that the piracy is there?

276
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:51,539
Rym: There's a lot of piracy But ever there's kind of this code of honor where most people stop distributing or stop Downloading and the DVDs still get bought.

277
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,670
Rym: everyone makes their money and no one goes after anyone.

278
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:58,010
Rym: When a group like Shinsen kind of breaks the code bad things happen.

279
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,494
Scott: Mm-hmm.

280
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:02,809
Rym: It's a delicate balance and frankly I want to keep getting my fans up.

281
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:05,037
Rym: so Bad fans arbors out there.

282
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,600
Rym: Stop it.

283
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,450
Scott: It's like the code of the schoolyard.

284
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:12,531
Scott: Yeah, you know you you might be able to break the code of the schoolyard and you know You'll.

285
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,649
Scott: you'll screw things up and you might get ahead on that but later everyone will come and destroy you.

286
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:23,337
Scott: So I highly don't recommend Doing that though actually some cool news.

287
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:28,955
Rym: Viz is putting out their signature collection of manga in other words The manga that Scott likes.

288
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:30,321
Rym: Yeah, they cut.

289
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,893
Rym: they say it's going to be a more sophisticated Mature manga.

290
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:46,130
Scott: so they used to have the editors choice manga and that would be all the really cool mangas that Weren't crazy popular or well-known, but they were like the ultra high quality, you know kind of like Citizen Kane.

291
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,360
Scott: No one really likes to watch it, but it's really good.

292
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,566
Rym: I like to watch it.

293
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,249
Rym: What's wrong with you?

294
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,582
Scott: It's not really as entertaining as like the matrix.

295
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:55,170
Scott: I could watch the matrix a hundred times.

296
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,058
Scott: I could not watch citizen Kane nearly as many times.

297
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,630
Rym: I could probably watch citizen Kane more than I could watch the matrix.

298
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,056
Scott: We not that.

299
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:07,027
Scott: well, I'm talking about the first one only here All right, but I mean I could watch the first matrix a bajillion times and every time.

300
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:09,798
Scott: yeah Well, that's you know, that's how it is.

301
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:16,231
Scott: But anyway, these are like the high quality mangas of awesome like Phoenix.

302
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,650
Scott: Oh, yeah, I got the first volumes of Phoenix from the editors choice printing.

303
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,477
Scott: I'm kind of disappointed that they're gonna reprint it.

304
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,170
Scott: I'm wondering if they're gonna reprint the Phoenix that was never printed yet.

305
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:31,350
Scott: Cuz I've got five volumes and I know there's more Phoenix than in those five volumes.

306
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:39,652
Scott: hmm, so if they reprint the more of Phoenix in a different like size or shape or Cover.

307
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:50,355
Rym: that's like a look good on my shelf, but this could be really good because I mean not too long ago We discovered a type of manga that really didn't what we'd known about it But we discovered it as in.

308
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,460
Rym: we got it and read it all.

309
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:59,190
Rym: Manga that we'd never really known like mature Yakuza The kind of manga we like, you know, we didn't really know existed.

310
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,179
Rym: It's pretty the opposite of the popular manga out now.

311
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:06,362
Rym: Yep, like sanctuary Eagle.

312
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,070
Rym: Mm-hmm.

313
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:12,937
Scott: Yep, apparently they're gonna put Golgo 13 in this new long and I might buy that.

314
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:20,080
Rym: because yeah for those of you Don't know Golgo 13 take Lupin and James Bond and put them together and then make it more serious.

315
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,790
Scott: Yep, it's very serious and not funny.

316
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:28,112
Scott: I mean and there's a whole lot of Golgo 13 stuff There's animes and video games and all kinds of video games.

317
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:28,795
Rym: all suck.

318
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:29,177
Rym: Yeah.

319
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:32,192
Scott: Oh my god The manga is the real deal or so I've heard.

320
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,520
Rym: Yeah, we haven't actually read it.

321
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Scott: So when that comes out, I'll definitely be buying it at least the first volume to see if it's good.

322
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:45,420
Rym: But I think this is gonna be a really good thing mostly because a lot of these manga They either never came out in the US or some things like they were released here.

323
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,840
Rym: They're out of print and they're really rare and hard to find.

324
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,231
Rym: It took us for freaking ever to get all the sanctuary together.

325
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,098
Scott: Yeah now I finally it's now.

326
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:54,780
Scott: it's easy to find.

327
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,615
Scott: I know where it's at.

328
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,636
Scott: But You know, it's not.

329
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:06,944
Scott: It's thing is back in the days When anime was still new and that was sort of what the popular thing was before Tokyo pop Discovered like little girl.

330
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,128
Scott: shojo was the way to go.

331
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,038
Scott: then those are the kinds of mangas they were bringing over.

332
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:18,760
Scott: you would get your Crying Freeman and your sanctuary and your eagle and all that stuff and they didn't sell that well Just because the market wasn't that big back then.

333
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,020
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:30,764
Scott: And then when they switched up the market and Tokyo pop came around a couple years ago and they started doing what they're doing now They didn't really reprint those things and they've been out of print and no one cared about him and forgot about him Except for the people like us.

335
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:31,346
Rym: Yep.

336
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:35,500
Rym: We kind of discovered them and they were awesome and we could never find him.

337
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:43,287
Rym: I remember we'd be digging through discount or bargain whatever bins in the middle of conventions looking for like one random episode Or one random issue or something.

338
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,914
Scott: Yeah, like first president of Japan.

339
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,018
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

340
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:52,429
Scott: all right, so Ghibli Is making a new movie Ghibli.

341
00:21:52,529 --> 00:22:04,418
Scott: now, there's two bits of news about this movie - yeah The first bit of news about this movie is that it's being directed by his son Miyazaki son, huh?

342
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,720
Scott: Goro Miyazaki and Miyazaki supposedly is not so happy because he doesn't want his son to be a director.

343
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,232
Rym: Why?

344
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:17,922
Scott: It doesn't say Hmm.

345
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,105
Rym: Oh, well, we'll see how it turns out.

346
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:22,755
Scott: It just says Miyazaki senior does not want his son to become a director.

347
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:29,107
Scott: I Don't know what that's about But alright, just just keep that in mind.

348
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,333
Scott: great to the movie.

349
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:40,116
Scott: a lot of Ghibli movies are based on books and things What was I wasn't how based on some book children's but based on a book called howl's moving castle.

350
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:45,639
Scott: All right, okay This is actually based on a book that I've heard of and read.

351
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:53,796
Scott: I've actually read all of the series of books except for one which I have and I just didn't read yet the earth sea series By Ursula K Le Guin.

352
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,050
Rym: I've always been meaning to read though.

353
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,175
Scott: It's real easy to read.

354
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,439
Scott: if you haven't read it Just go get all the volumes.

355
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:07,600
Scott: You could read them all in like double days because they're not written at the highest reading level You know in terms of big words, and it's really fast to read.

356
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:14,872
Scott: You know a teenager could read it in like a week, you know all of them But it's very deep in its meaning.

357
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:17,360
Scott: So even someone who's old can get a lot out of it.

358
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,615
Scott: I didn't even find it until like, you know, three or two or three years ago.

359
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:22,859
Rym: In fact, didn't you know?

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,767
Scott: Yeah, I bought all of them wild.

361
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,192
Rym: Would you leave one out in the rain?

362
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,215
Scott: No, that was.

363
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:37,322
Scott: that was kidnapped by the guy who wrote Treasure Island, ah It was a pirate book.

364
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:41,963
Rym: Oh, yeah I just remember that because you you were like we all went inside and there's.

365
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:45,095
Rym: you saw this book laying out and you thought It was my book.

366
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,230
Rym: So you left it outside, you know, haha screw Rym.

367
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:50,284
Rym: And then you went out the next day and it was your book and it rained.

368
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,389
Scott: the rain was the problem.

369
00:23:52,272 --> 00:24:00,745
Scott: Anyway, so the book the name of the movie is called ghetto Senki tales from Earthsea ghetto.

370
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,477
Scott: I Know this because I could figure it out.

371
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,562
Scott: the name of the main character in Earthsea is GED GED so calling it ghetto Senki.

372
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:08,964
Scott: It's like.

373
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:12,699
Scott: I think it's the story of GED Something like that and I don't know.

374
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:21,036
Scott: Well can ask Emily somebody Japanese tales from Earthsea which is the universe that the World that the book is written in.

375
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:34,889
Scott: and there's actually a poster for the movie available online that I can see and it shows who GED Obviously staring up and looking at this dragon, right and looking at it I can go.

376
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,416
Scott: Yeah, that's about.

377
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:41,820
Scott: you know, having seen many Ghibli movies and read all the books I can look at that and I say yeah, that's pretty accurate.

378
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:46,667
Scott: You know, that's about what I expected and That means it's probably gonna be really good.

379
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:59,346
Scott: however, the one thing that bothers me is that GED at least as far as I can see him in this picture is really white and A big part of the story is that he's not really white.

380
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,069
Scott: He's like dark.

381
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:01,356
Rym: So what's this?

382
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:01,860
Rym: I hear about?

383
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:02,930
Rym: a Naruto marathon?

384
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,950
Scott: Well, you know how like on New Year's like the TV channels tend to do big marathons of things.

385
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:11,241
Rym: Yeah, I remember watching all bond last year.

386
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,767
Scott: Oh, I like the all bond ones.

387
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:16,077
Scott: I like the all Twilight zones on sci-fi channel.

388
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,925
Rym: Yeah, the outer limits sometimes.

389
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:21,870
Scott: Well Cartoon Network They used to do like these cartoon cartoon things.

390
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,390
Scott: They would show the cartoon the cartoons that were only on Cartoon Network.

391
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,870
Scott: They would just keep showing those all day for like the whole weekend even sometimes and I liked it.

392
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:45,669
Scott: I remember the when I first got Cartoon Network, that's what they had on and it was like, ooh, all right but it looks like you can really tell that things are changing in this country because December 31st is gonna be eight and a half hour.

393
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:52,833
Scott: Naruto marathon gray 17 straight episodes That's cool.

394
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:56,190
Scott: If you like Naruto, yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of Naruto.

395
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,149
Scott: I think I watched the first 13 episodes and then I realized that The last like eight of them were a single fight.

396
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:05,781
Rym: The show is much better when they were in ninja school.

397
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:06,304
Rym: It was just funny.

398
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:07,510
Rym: ninja school antics.

399
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,659
Scott: I know it's like you watch the first few episodes like.

400
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,523
Scott: this is the greatest show.

401
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,266
Scott: ninja school.

402
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:13,155
Scott: You read the first manga You're like ninja school.

403
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:17,296
Scott: Yes, the rest of the thing isn't about ninja school It's just fighting.

404
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,546
Scott: they should just made a ninja school manga.

405
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,430
Scott: It would have been the greatest.

406
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:21,739
Scott: I would have be still be buying it.

407
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,418
Scott: Oh Well, it's gonna make some people happy.

408
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,040
Rym: Yeah.

409
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,035
Scott: Yep, and it definitely shows that anime is Seriously on the move.

410
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:42,350
Scott: and the last thing isn't really so important Sunrise, you know the animation studio that does like cowabeebop and all those other good shows, you know usually under bandai.

411
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:48,030
Scott: They're making a new robot show which means potential new good anime.

412
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:50,119
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

413
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:57,003
Scott: I'm not saying it is good But it shows more potential than most of the shows that I've seen in the past couple years.

414
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:02,696
Scott: So it's called zega pain Zega pain zega pain.

415
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:04,183
Rym: So it's a robot show.

416
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,633
Scott: I Think I'm not sure.

417
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:10,150
Scott: it looks like it might be a one robot show which is the good kind.

418
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:11,483
Scott: So we're gonna have to find out.

419
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:15,446
Rym: Could be I mean Gundam seed wasn't a one robot show.

420
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:16,090
Scott: that's true.

421
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,779
Scott: I'm not saying only the one robot shows are good.

422
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:21,890
Scott: I'm saying this looks like it has serious potential for good.

423
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:26,469
Rym: Yeah, also I point out that you hate giant robo, which is the quintessential one robot show.

424
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,155
Scott: I don't like giant robots.

425
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,941
Rym: a giant robo is awesome.

426
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,550
Rym: I like Gigant or in fact, it's in the Netflix queue.

427
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,235
Rym: We're gonna watch it.

428
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:34,645
Scott: No, I'm not gonna watch it.

429
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:35,290
Rym: I'm fine.

430
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,440
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:44,410
Rym: so, huh, basically We had nothing today, this is probably probably the low point.

432
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,989
Rym: I mean you gotta we got off days every now and then you got to give us that.

433
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:56,741
Scott: Yeah, at least we're not like, you know, not every penny arcade comic is equal But they come out with one even if they come out with it at 4 p.m Now,

434
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:11,668
Rym: hey, man, no Today's penny arcade mostly because Scott and I have basically had that exact conversation multiple times only with different words and different bits, but the same idea.

435
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:16,930
Scott: Yep It's always scary how comics and things mirror real life.

436
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:20,520
Rym: Yeah, or maybe real life mirrors comics and things.

437
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,000
Scott: Dun Dun Dun BB OCS always did the best job of that God Bastard.

438
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,719
Rym: Yep All right.

439
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,929
Rym: Anyway, we got nothing.

440
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:34,249
Rym: Rather than forcing ourselves to talk for a lot longer You'll get an extra long episode tomorrow with good stuff.

441
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,282
Rym: Yes, I'm sleep and hopefully stuff will happen in the world that we can complain about.

442
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:40,550
Scott: Mmm visit our website.

443
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:50,837
Rym: actually, yeah visit the forums because the show from Monday is still generating a lot of arguments and feedback and yelling and Screaming and it's fantastic

444
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,414
Scott: which gives high hopes for next Monday show Which is a continuation

445
00:28:54,755 --> 00:29:00,313
Rym: because our how to buy or how to build a computer series looks like it's gonna be our most popular Series ever.

446
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,728
Scott: Yeah, I guess the informative does work and we were trying to shy away from it.

447
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:05,229
Scott: What do we know?

448
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,944
Scott: Yeah, so front row crew calm.

449
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:11,413
