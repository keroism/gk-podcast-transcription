1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,052
Rym: It's Tuesday May 7th 2019.

2
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,155
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:14,721
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,910
Rym: Are you playing to win or are you playing to just play it?

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,966
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,642
Rym: So yesterday I was playing some beat saver in VR.

7
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:25,846
Rym: that game is crazy fast.

8
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,970
Scott: that VR rhythm game, right?

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,556
Rym: Yep, the only weird thing I guess.

10
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:28,938
Scott: what do you do?

11
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,610
Scott: You just like swing as you swing the VR sticks to the rhythm.

12
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:36,950
Rym: Yeah You basically have two lightsabers and blocks will have arrows on them and they'll be red or blue.

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:43,756
Rym: Gotta hit the red ones in the direction of the arrow with your left hand and the blue ones in the direction there with The right hand and they match music.

14
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:44,097
Scott: do?

15
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:49,020
Rym: they put blue ones on the left and sometimes they'll swap and move around and big walls will appear.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,743
Rym: they got a Yep, and you're like stepping around.

17
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:54,265
Rym: you gotta move.

18
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,990
Rym: you gotta move quite a bit.

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,156
Rym: It's actually very just.

20
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:59,710
Scott: you're swinging virtual sticks to the beat.

21
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:11,297
Rym: Yeah, but what's weird about it is it's super fun But it feels wrong if you've ever actually fenced because holding two swords like this Just a metaphor.

22
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,023
Scott: It's move your hands to the rhythm.

23
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:19,790
Rym: It is you got to get a Train yourself into not thinking of them as swords, but it has a mode.

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:29,470
Rym: You know DDR has all that because it's the songs are well-crafted like in good DDR Like the arrows feel right and they do clever stuff like they'll be arrows in a pattern if you recognize the matter.

25
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,848
Scott: How much movement can I just be like?

26
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,718
Rym: Yeah, you're just a lightsaber.

27
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:34,450
Rym: it goes right through the block as it's coming at you.

28
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:37,270
Scott: I mean, you know do I have to like get up and move a lot?

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,355
Scott: Can I just be like me me me me.

30
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:42,898
Rym: you'll have to be standing because sometimes a big wall will be coming and you have To like stand to the side.

31
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,804
Scott: I just roll my chair.

32
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:46,981
Rym: you could There might be one too high to hit.

33
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:50,689
Rym: some of you got a stab Mmm, but and they're all over the place.

34
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,964
Rym: But it has a saber mode where you only use one stick.

35
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:58,938
Rym: that sounds like baby mode except It's kind of like DDR challenge mode.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,890
Rym: it has you know, it is like like medium-heavy like a similar thing.

37
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:04,977
Rym: It's the equivalent of it a number of hands instead of feet.

38
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,508
Rym: No, it's actually just like Easy medium hard expert extreme like something like that.

39
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,659
Rym: But if you put it in saver mode, it's expert.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,206
Scott: only is there song.

41
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:14,990
Scott: is there some song?

42
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,946
Scott: That's the equivalent of like the impossible song.

43
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:23,148
Rym: Yeah And I was like, nope, no Matt Morgan's fairly really good at it.

44
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:29,090
Rym: But as I was playing and then Emily was like imagine when it gets really fast.

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,462
Scott: It's similar to like just drumming right only drums all over the place.

46
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:33,847
Rym: Well, here's an example of clever errors.

47
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:34,389
Rym: now DDR.

48
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:43,275
Rym: There's arrow combinations like in our favorite song music where if you don't know like notice the pattern and learn to like do the spin Or the torso torso twist.

49
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:43,937
Rym: It's really hard.

50
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:44,840
Rym: same thing.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,562
Rym: You notice a pattern.

52
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:45,822
Rym: you're like.

53
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:51,020
Rym: that pattern is just swing the sword like this Like twirl it like that.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,169
Rym: kind of figure this out.

55
00:02:52,712 --> 00:03:02,267
Rym: So I'm playing and then Emily taps me on the shoulder which is always terrifying in VR and it's like hey I got to do my I got to do a thing on my computer and I can't just be here like swinging around swords with a blindfold on.

56
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:08,829
Rym: So, uh, I get her up to leave and then Emily's is down and then she says whoa What the fuck's wrong with my computer?

57
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,662
Rym: You notice her surface laptop is not sitting there right now.

58
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,410
Scott: She just take it with her to do work.

59
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:19,467
Rym: So the top of it the surface is a pretty cool device because the top part is the computer and it.

60
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:22,379
Rym: you can use it As just all computer the pro surface.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,810
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if they still make the pro one like that or not.

62
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,199
Rym: I haven't had which has the newest the second newest one.

63
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,866
Scott: It's I haven't looked at the newest newest ones.

64
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:29,307
Rym: Basically.

65
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:32,760
Rym: It's the laptop I would buy if I had to buy a laptop today.

66
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,041
Scott: Actually.

67
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:36,077
Scott: I have a spare AC adapter for a surface Just lying around.

68
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:36,945
Scott: Oh you want it?

69
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:37,390
Scott: Maybe.

70
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,330
Rym: But so the top part is like a pretty good serve like tablet computer like really powerful.

71
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:48,590
Rym: But if you plug it into the bottom half, then it's a laptop with a real ad.

72
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,157
Rym: It's got a 1050 bottom card.

73
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:52,690
Scott: bottom part is pretty much just a video card.

74
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,961
Scott: Video card like a black card video card.

75
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,590
Rym: I just a 1050 which is not a terrible video card.

76
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,099
Scott: It's not a 10 10, but he didn't exist.

77
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:05,139
Rym: when the yeah, it's a 1050 You get a 950 or a 1050.

78
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:05,300
Rym: Mmm.

79
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:07,166
Rym: It's a pretty good video card.

80
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:15,011
Rym: Like it'll play overwatch It'll render video like better than my previous computer with the 760.

81
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:20,409
Scott: I was a 1050 doesn't sound right, but if the last one was it is a GPU in there.

82
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,230
Scott: Yeah It's pretty much a GPU a keyboard and some connectors and more battery.

83
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:38,206
Rym: Yeah, so what what you we saw was that the whole bottom had just like bowed down Like they're like the bottom was about to like pop off and you couldn't push it back up.

84
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:47,406
Rym: and I peeked inside the entire battery pack had expanded mmm and because And because now the computer still worked just fine.

85
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:51,686
Rym: the top part Yeah, the top part not the bottom part though plugged into the bottom part.

86
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:55,957
Scott: It still worked fine But but the bottom part wasn't doing anything though.

87
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:56,960
Scott: It was just operating.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,529
Rym: as I imagine if we did anything that invoked the video card It would have been a problem.

89
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,970
Rym: Anyway, so, uh, he's had to take it to the Microsoft Store and they were like, yep batteries fucked.

90
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,440
Rym: We will give you an entire new surface for free.

91
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:10,204
Scott: That sounds good.

92
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:13,510
Scott: The newest a newer one or the same one Same one, which is still pretty new.

93
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,722
Scott: I'm always surprised at how like I've been to the Apple Store for like Apple care stuff They will have like the exact models of things.

94
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,510
Rym: Yeah, they'll never be like, oh you're going way back.

95
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,358
Rym: Your one-year-old iPhone is like.

96
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:33,940
Scott: well in like and then and not only that but they'll have them in like this Non-retail clearly meant for replacing things packaging.

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,160
Rym: Yep.

98
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,516
Scott: So it's like oh, yeah this old thing that we don't sell in the store anymore But yours broke.

99
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,249
Scott: we have that exact one in the back.

100
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,381
Scott: Yeah, here it is, but you don't get it extra.

101
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,559
Scott: You don't get all the retail packagings You don't get extra cables or anything.

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,550
Scott: You'd get just the thing that you're replacing.

103
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,997
Rym: Meanwhile cameras really like every time I gotta get a camera or something repaired or I know people who have had to deal with They want to repair it.

104
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:55,300
Scott: They don't.

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,276
Scott: actually they don't want to give you a new one Fix the one you got because

106
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:05,710
Rym: they can't give you the same one you have because I usually don't do that long of a production Run of any particular camera and they don't want to give you the next one up.

107
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,905
Scott: Even if they do they want to repair the one you have.

108
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:09,869
Scott: they don't want to make anything.

109
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,824
Rym: I'm still waiting for him to fix my lens, but they did find the problem.

110
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:13,547
Rym: So they'll fix it.

111
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:13,909
Rym: Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:21,290
Rym: And so yeah The laptop just expanded the battery in the bottom half of that probably because it has to power a video card.

113
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:22,256
Scott: He didn't start a fire.

114
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:23,322
Rym: Yeah, we are really lucky.

115
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,550
Rym: It didn't start a fire explode.

116
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:25,554
Scott: It was.

117
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:26,678
Rym: it was like puffed.

118
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:31,056
Rym: if you if you've ever seen of naked lithium-ion cell Yeah, I seen it puffed like that.

119
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,888
Scott: It was that I had little tiny GoPro batteries that puffed.

120
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:34,896
Scott: Yep Got rid of those.

121
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,070
Rym: I had a GoPro battery puff.

122
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,970
Rym: I was skiing and I was videoing and then I saw the GoPro to stop.

123
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:46,235
Scott: I was like, how come I can't get the back onto the battery cover onto this old GoPro hero - oh the battery is puffed Goodbye.

124
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,810
Rym: I took the big GoPro out of the case.

125
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,530
Rym: This is the old one that had like the case and then you had to open the camera itself separately from the case.

126
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:59,686
Rym: Now GoPro's are just waterproof on their own But I open the back and the back just pops off and the battery just goes whoop.

127
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:02,635
Scott: and I'm like, oh shit Yeah, my new my GoPro.

128
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,562
Scott: I guess I have a GoPro 5 now.

129
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,347
Scott: I think the newest one is like 7 or so.

130
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:13,215
Rym: Yeah Yeah, the new GoPros are great like I feel like Newer than 5.

131
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,962
Scott: the benefits are only incremental.

132
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:25,179
Scott: They're all yeah that the newer GoPros You only need if you're doing like really high FPS Like when I got the 2 I was like when when I replace this and then I was like, oh, yeah I got the 5. it's like alright now.

133
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,488
Scott: I'm really not gonna replace this.

134
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,062
Scott: Yep I mean, I'm in a definitely a no replacement mode.

135
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,450
Scott: My iPhone 7 is still going.

136
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:38,170
Rym: Yeah, dude, not only is my two-year-old Xperia like awesome phone still going but I do own another identical phone.

137
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:42,189
Scott: I'm sure if I want to I can get an iPhone 7 that is new and unused.

138
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:48,250
Rym: Yep So when this phone finally dies, I'm just going to swap my sim into an identical phone that I own that's never been used.

139
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,859
Rym: Hmm cuz it's the last good Android phone.

140
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,225
Rym: I'm not I'm not replaced.

141
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:53,610
Rym: I'm just trying to keep everything I got.

142
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,219
Scott: Oh, there's a new Android phone.

143
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:55,943
Scott: They announced today.

144
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,511
Scott: This seems okay pixel 3.

145
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:01,830
Rym: It's the 3a the pink camera and that thing is bullshit compared to the camera on this phone.

146
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,564
Scott: The 3a supposedly has like an amazing camera on it.

147
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:04,986
Rym: We'll see.

148
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:05,810
Rym: I saw mixed review.

149
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:12,030
Rym: Well when you when you were talking about that in the discard, I looked at some reviews and they were all over the place.

150
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:13,595
Rym: Anyway, we'll see.

151
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,750
Rym: We'll see in the news.

152
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,258
Rym: If you didn't know there's a game called Uno.

153
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,230
Rym: that's really popular among I guess families.

154
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,337
Scott: It's actually been coming up a lot recently.

155
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:23,980
Scott: what hat there was?

156
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:32,361
Scott: a there's a. there's a great Twitter account bootleg stuff that post bootleg stuff mostly anime bootleg stuff And they posted a picture of a bootleg Pokemon Uno.

157
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:38,102
Scott: and I replied and I was like, you know That is a bootleg you posted but there is a real Pokemon Uno.

158
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,828
Scott: There's a real Mario Uno.

159
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:44,044
Scott: There's a whole bunch of themed Unos that are whole totally legit and nerdy and awesome.

160
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,410
Rym: Uno is basically Monopoly.

161
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,715
Scott: Uno is a better game than Monopoly.

162
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:52,490
Rym: Yeah, but in terms of there's a monopoly for every conceivable thing that is licensed.

163
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,860
Rym: There's a monopoly for like every damn city every movie franchise.

164
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:57,422
Rym: Oh, yeah.

165
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:57,582
Rym: Yeah.

166
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:09,373
Rym: Yeah, there's a Uno has a similar thing going on, but The Uno the official Uno Twitter account tweeted something and I was confused by it because it said it was a rules Clarification.

167
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:16,690
Rym: it said if someone puts down a plus four card, I'm just assuming you know how Uno works You must draw four and your turn is skipped.

168
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,077
Scott: Yeah, that's the rule.

169
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:28,900
Scott: if Rym is sitting to my right or left Well depend and the play is going clockwise and Rym plays a plus four I draw four because he attacked me and you skip your turn.

170
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,370
Scott: fucking the next person on the other side of me is now.

171
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,433
Scott: It is now their turn.

172
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:34,196
Scott: that is correct.

173
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:34,657
Scott: to Uno.

174
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:35,460
Scott: play the next.

175
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,409
Scott: apparently some people just made up rules of Uno.

176
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:39,793
Scott: Yeah Out of nothing.

177
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:43,649
Scott: to where Rym would play an attack card making me draw say four or two.

178
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:51,902
Scott: Then I would be able to play another attack card and thus both Attack cards would apply to the person to my left.

179
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:53,147
Scott: That is bullshit.

180
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:53,850
Scott: You made up.

181
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:55,496
Rym: Here's the thing.

182
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:58,615
Rym: I played Uno a lot as a kid with That ever.

183
00:09:58,756 --> 00:09:59,638
Rym: I'd never heard of that.

184
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,278
Rym: the fact that the official Uno account is like you can't put down a plus two to make The next person draw six.

185
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,163
Rym: Well, you know, you've tried.

186
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,170
Rym: who has tried that?

187
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,476
Rym: Who are these fucking people?

188
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,410
Rym: and the answer is look at the people replying to this account.

189
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,005
Rym: Apparently everyone plays Uno in this ridiculous made-up nonsense way.

190
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,869
Scott: I do love that.

191
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,523
Scott: The Uno account is defending the rules.

192
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,590
Rym: There's a tweet here.

193
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,450
Rym: Someone responded with a screenshot of the rules and said guys it's right in the rules.

194
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:33,505
Rym: I went out inside and bought another deck to make sure like Apparently people believe this nonsense rule and here is the genius part.

195
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,990
Rym: This is why I love this Twitter account.

196
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,913
Rym: All these responses are wait What about blah?

197
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:39,916
Rym: What about blah?

198
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:40,839
Rym: What about blah?

199
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,564
Rym: and the Uno account just keeps responding.

200
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:48,735
Rym: No, no Nope No You cannot.

201
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:49,921
Rym: that is stacking.

202
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:50,544
Rym: Nope.

203
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,710
Rym: You cannot stack.

204
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:55,686
Rym: Yes, one person was like, can I win by using a wild card?

205
00:10:55,706 --> 00:11:01,630
Scott: and they're like, yes Yeah, if you're if you have Uno and your last card is wild you're just gonna win and you play it you win.

206
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,995
Scott: That's how Uno works.

207
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:07,090
Scott: you go down to one card you say Uno and then you empty your hand and you win.

208
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:14,870
Rym: Yep, so apparently people just play Uno with made-up nonsense rules props to whoever runs the Uno account props for being pro rules.

209
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,978
Scott: I want to see the Monopoly Uno now, I feel like I want to.

210
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:18,622
Scott: I don't have an.

211
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,030
Scott: I don't think I have an Uno currently.

212
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,057
Scott: I've had one in the past.

213
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,260
Rym: Well, cuz if I want to play that kind of game I'm just gonna play like Shaquille or something.

214
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,128
Scott: Yeah, but I kind of want to find the bet.

215
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,442
Scott: It's so cheap to buy an Uno so that's fine.

216
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,850
Rym: I'll probably have an Uno deck.

217
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,289
Rym: I gave my mom just mail to me.

218
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,474
Scott: I have probably have one to somewhere.

219
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:37,669
Scott: but I kind of want to find the best themed Uno and buy just that Uno.

220
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,280
Scott: Right, maybe there's like a Mega Man Uno or something.

221
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,365
Rym: Oh Mega Man Uno.

222
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:41,827
Scott: I don't know.

223
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:42,510
Scott: there could be anything.

224
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,670
Rym: We could just make it Uno and I could just get it printed.

225
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,439
Scott: Yeah, but you're gonna find a better one.

226
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:46,720
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,690
Rym: Well if I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna make a clod.

228
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:55,850
Rym: So in some other news, uh Sports are games and we'll talk about this briefly.

229
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:04,682
Rym: But in the sport of horse racing, which is more a sport for the horses than the jockeys, but the jockeys play a role lot of Things we could talk about is

230
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:11,326
Scott: one positive thing I can say about the about horse racing is that they treat the horse as the champion.

231
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:15,173
Scott: Yeah, like this horse one They don't put too much emphasis the horse They do.

232
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:19,450
Scott: they do interview the jockeys and and and they get money and stuff and they're well.

233
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,850
Scott: I mean the owners are also right but most of the attention is on the horse.

234
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,736
Scott: They consider the horse to be the winner.

235
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:30,213
Scott: the horse won the Triple Crown not the jockey not the owner Like.

236
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:35,162
Rym: that's why I know the name Far Lab But I have no idea who the hell rode Far Lab.

237
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,750
Scott: Right, the name of the movie is Secretariat.

238
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,450
Scott: The name of the movie is not something else.

239
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:46,850
Rym: And regardless of your controversial feelings about exploiting animals in this way at least the animals are getting the fame?

240
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:59,902
Rym: Not there are worse ways to exploit animals Yes, but if you didn't watch the Kentucky Derby a horse won by a lot and then someone who did not win issued a challenge because that horse broke a rule?

241
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:08,774
Scott: that is disqualifying and According to people are experts in horse racing cuz I'm sure as hell not I know That.

242
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:14,010
Scott: yes, indeed that horse did break a rule and therefore should not have won.

243
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:18,961
Scott: So here's even though if that horse didn't break the rule It probably still would have won because it was the fastest horse.

244
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,690
Scott: people said it was the fastest horse before the race.

245
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,716
Scott: It has the shortest odds.

246
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:30,450
Rym: if you're the best hockey team and you keep hitting people in the face with your sticks You're not gonna win the Stanley Cup, even if you are in fact the best at hockey.

247
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,771
Rym: But

248
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:47,690
Scott: I do actually want to congratulate the sport of horse racing whoever officiates it because you know They have done the right thing the same thing that bicycle racing did right because bicycle racing does a lot of things wrong Cycling right in that when someone cheated or broke a rule the penalty was losing.

249
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:56,610
Scott: Unlike football or in someone cheats or breaks a rule the penalty is like you get a fine you get a suspension You lose some draft picks, but you're still the Super Bowl champions.

250
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,160
Scott: Yeah, the penalty for cheating must be losing.

251
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,270
Scott: Otherwise cheating is just an avenue for pay to win.

252
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:08,430
Rym: Yep, or in the context of hockey because you get a two-minute penalty for slashing.

253
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,403
Rym: Slashing is part of the game.

254
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:11,249
Rym: You can just slash.

255
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:19,598
Scott: Yeah, if someone's about to score you it's a good idea to like say, you know interfere do some interference or cross-check them Or whatever

256
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,349
Rym: and then hope you win

257
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:26,441
Scott: Right hope if they're gonna score a goal on a breakaway You're better off knocking them over even though they get a penalty shot.

258
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:29,031
Scott: because well now you got a chance to block that penalty shot Right.

259
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:33,310
Scott: Oh if they're gonna score a goal, okay, you might be able to kill a two-minute power play, right?

260
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,513
Scott: It's part of the game.

261
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,901
Rym: Yeah now that part of the game.

262
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,529
Rym: Maybe you should change a little bit, but maybe it should.

263
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,230
Rym: I Mean, what do you make a team?

264
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,415
Rym: That's just a bunch of monsters and you have the best penalty killing squad in the league Like you could.

265
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,399
Rym: that could be a strategy.

266
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,143
Rym: It is a strategy.

267
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,027
Rym: I know it shouldn't be.

268
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:50,529
Scott: why not?

269
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:59,219
Rym: So anyway, even better the attorney for maximum security the horse that was disqualified Or is that that would have won if it didn't break the rules?

270
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:07,924
Rym: filed an appeal and the Racing Commission responded denying the appeal saying that Stewards decisions are not subject to appeal.

271
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:09,230
Rym: There is no appeal process.

272
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,534
Scott: well I mean that's a problem.

273
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:13,349
Scott: but the thing is even whether it was an appeal process or not.

274
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:18,866
Scott: As I said everyone who knows about horse racing seems to be mostly in agreement.

275
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,390
Scott: Well, this is a correct ruling.

276
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,342
Scott: Here's what's extra from what I have gathered.

277
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,770
Scott: Maybe someone else gathers differently.

278
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,211
Scott: Let me know.

279
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:28,526
Rym: horse racing is one of the earliest sports to use the photo finish meaning.

280
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,770
Rym: Hey cameras exist.

281
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,890
Rym: We're gonna fucking use this to know exactly.

282
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,337
Scott: You know why?

283
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:35,830
Scott: because fucking money's on the line, yep soccer.

284
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,590
Scott: That's why all these other sports have gotten away with all kinds of bullshit.

285
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:43,767
Scott: And as soon as we betting is at least, you know, they legalize sports gambling.

286
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:44,370
Scott: that will suck.

287
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,155
Scott: But at least they're gonna start.

288
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:50,648
Scott: but that'll force the replay to come into everything so that people who bet don't sue dude.

289
00:15:50,689 --> 00:16:03,188
Rym: last night In the Bruins game where they limited the eliminated the cabbages the CVJs From from the playoffs The first goal scored in the game was actually under review in Toronto for a while at least.

290
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:03,790
Scott: they review it.

291
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,398
Rym: They were watching that replay over good over.

292
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,983
Rym: It's over a playoff goal.

293
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:12,861
Scott: You better be fucking watching that in an elimination game Yep, and the chat like it was just.

294
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,288
Rym: they disallowed the goal in the end.

295
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:14,690
Scott: Good job.

296
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:19,026
Rym: It was interesting because that goal in the 90s would not have been disallowed.

297
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:19,547
Scott: Hell no.

298
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:23,182
Rym: Yeah In the 90s, it was only goalie interference.

299
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:24,970
Rym: if you like punch the goalie out.

300
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:35,090
Scott: Well, there was the arrow where it was goalie interference if any part of any offensive player's body was in the blue paint And it was also while the goal was scored even if it wasn't interfering with the goalie in any way whatsoever.

301
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,230
Scott: And then there was a situation I remember reviewing it every time and disallowing all the goals.

302
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,276
Rym: I remember being at a Red Wings game where Sergei Fedorov skate was like in the edge of the crease Nowhere near the action.

303
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:46,517
Rym: Yep.

304
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:57,570
Rym: So the goal was disallowed even though it had nothing to do with the play Yep, so yeah Props to horse racing for following their own rules and not bowing to public pressure or all this nonsense.

305
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:03,916
Rym: And that sucks, but them's the rules In some other news right.

306
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:12,001
Scott: so scrabble a game that we're not big fans of because it is a game of mostly Memorization and not a game of any of the other.

307
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:23,281
Scott: right if you play it with people who haven't memorized the scrabble dictionary Then it is a good game because it's about positioning And You know sort of creativity with words sort of like banana grams.

308
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:33,670
Rym: right if you replace the letters with Like squares that have four different colors on the sides, and there's rules about like matching colors to play things it would also work.

309
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:42,663
Scott: Yeah, a banana grams forces you to use speed to sort of eliminate the memory problem But in the end pro scrabble ends up being a game of memory.

310
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,230
Scott: how much of the scrabble dictionary?

311
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,901
Scott: Have you memorized and then you win?

312
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,130
Scott: so then my news is actually pretty interesting.

313
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:54,872
Scott: They just added a fuck ton of words to the scrabble dictionary 2862

314
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:55,555
Rym: new words

315
00:17:55,755 --> 00:18:11,329
Scott: including lots of two-letter words that were previously not legal like okay And you like EW as well as words that are very Modern like genderqueer or the gender neutral pronouns a or words like fleek.

316
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:23,510
Scott: All right, so I think that's pretty cool that scrabble despite being a meh memory game is actually willing to a Challenge the pros by forcing them to memorize 2,000 more fucking words.

317
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,092
Rym: Here's the thing.

318
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:30,490
Scott: you might also make itself more accessible to people who are probably not playing with the scrabble dictionary.

319
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,190
Scott: Handy are gonna put in fleek and then be like argue about it.

320
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,808
Scott: And there's gonna be like a grandma who's like that's not a word and the kid is like it totally is.

321
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,521
Scott: and then look up The word and grandma's wrong, and that'll be the best.

322
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:42,445
Scott: quid you bow.

323
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:49,718
Rym: That's right Perfectly chromulant word.

324
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:50,200
Scott: quid you bow.

325
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:56,760
Scott: my way to a triple word school a Big dumb balding hairless a.

326
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,349
Rym: yeah with I mean with a with a fat head.

327
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,715
Rym: in the meantime I forget the quote.

328
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:01,739
Rym: you know anyway.

329
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,970
Rym: That was a long time ago, but different.

330
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:14,176
Rym: Actually understand How much of a change does adding about 3,000 words to a game that already has 276,000 words matter?

331
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:17,745
Rym: it matters a lot and completely changes the meta of the game.

332
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,090
Rym: scrabble is now a completely different game.

333
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:25,929
Rym: I'm gonna read a quote from this article Quote one of the most impactful changes to the game.

334
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:35,329
Rym: One of the words some of the words they added because it ends with the letter K. It used to be that if you put a K down you knew your opponent couldn't play across the top of it.

335
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,049
Rym: It'll be a change of mindset.

336
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,284
Rym: He said he predicted the inclusion of the word would outrage some fans, but and here's the money shot quote.

337
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,949
Rym: That's the joy of it.

338
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:50,802
Rym: So the fact that these extra words exist Really changes the strategy of scrabble.

339
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:59,070
Rym: It's not just memorize the words It's consider how each and every one of these words opens up Potential new play strategies.

340
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,750
Scott: It's basically a new meta for scrabble, which is news for any nerd game.

341
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,077
Scott: It's like oh a new meta for magic.

342
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,083
Scott: Yeah, that happens all the time.

343
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,330
Scott: Yeah a new meta for hockey.

344
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,221
Rym: There's a new meta for ice hockey right now.

345
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:14,379
Scott: Yeah, no matter for overwatch alright Oh scrabble finally got a new meta.

346
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,945
Scott: welcome to nerd world boys.

347
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,435
Scott: Yeah Welcome to nerd.

348
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:21,046
Rym: Oh total aside before we get to the things of the day.

349
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,130
Rym: I learned something interesting.

350
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,987
Rym: You know we had an expansion draft and the NHL recently.

351
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:30,782
Rym: yeah Yeah There's another kind of draft that hasn't happened in a long time.

352
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:36,300
Rym: when a team is shut down There's a reverse draft for everyone to steal those players.

353
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,005
Scott: No team is gonna get shut down.

354
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:42,018
Rym: so it almost happened To a team in the 70s.

355
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,550
Scott: there are teams that like didn't draft because there were issues.

356
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:56,989
Rym: Yeah No There was a team that was so performing so poorly Financially that it almost shut down mid-season And there was a plan to have a reverse draft to steal all the players from this team into the rest of the NHL.

357
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:07,638
Rym: but anyway it is time for It's time for things of the day.

358
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:08,099
Scott: what he got.

359
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,936
Rym: so I'm sure people most people know the word culvert right But I don't think most people do because when we had up when scojo moved to his new house that was next to that culvert.

360
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,438
Rym: I said well, you're next to a culvert and Half our friends were like a what?

361
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:30,570
Scott: so if you don't know what a culvert is Basically in situations where there's water and it might say flood right you don't want a flood.

362
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:37,348
Scott: I don't know on a road that cars have to drive through right and then go sploosh Yeah So what you do a culvert is pretty simple.

363
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:44,475
Scott: is you maybe just put a bunch of fucking pipes under the road so that the water when it comes to the road goes up under The road and out the other side?

364
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:47,446
Scott: and now your road is dry and the water continues to flow.

365
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,410
Rym: so back up a little bit.

366
00:21:48,510 --> 00:22:04,215
Rym: So when you have roads that don't have rainwater drainage systems on them like old roads rural roads often what you'll have our ditches Mmm rainwater systems are basically just covered ditches like you cover the ditches turn them into pipes And then you put drains in the road.

367
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,422
Rym: mm-hmm where do those drains go?

368
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:16,629
Scott: they go down the hill yeah down somewhere Yeah, so especially if you like a mountain road You know you don't want to have like a grill in the mountain road that then you have to put a pipe under.

369
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:23,881
Scott: you know You get the idea anyway, so this kid I don't know if it's a kid or whatever But he's talking about riding around with his dad.

370
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:26,175
Scott: so it must be someone who lives with their dad Or it needs.

371
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:44,050
Scott: it needs a ride from their dad at least anyway Noticed that this drain in a small lake slash large pond kind of place Was all clogged up and The culvert wasn't really flowing and the lake level was kind of high.

372
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:48,350
Scott: And you can see that the drain was like all clogged up with all kinds of garbage.

373
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:53,970
Rym: Yep, because there's a cage there to prevent the clog from getting into the culvert right because that's a lot harder to clear out.

374
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:55,830
Scott: Yeah, you didn't get to go in the pipe clearing shit out.

375
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,315
Scott: You don't do that.

376
00:22:56,395 --> 00:23:00,802
Rym: go find any culvert like a big one And you'll see like a big metal cage under the water usually anyway.

377
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:01,545
Scott: He tells his dad.

378
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:02,770
Scott: Hey bring me back there later.

379
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,728
Scott: I want to clear that out.

380
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:13,904
Scott: so he goes back there with a whole bunch of gear to make himself dry and protected from dangerous bits and Also a camera to post a video on YouTube that you're gonna watch.

381
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,410
Rym: it's a real satisfying video.

382
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,980
Scott: It's one of those like real satisfying things.

383
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:27,590
Scott: or this dude who doesn't seem you know I guess he seems slightly like a weird dude cuz he's spent his time doing this I mean if you're in the covers also sort of like an unsung hero.

384
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:35,116
Scott: right as he goes and he removes all the garbage from the top of this drain and The water starts off flowing.

385
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,079
Rym: That's a good feeling.

386
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,144
Scott: He's good, and you could keep.

387
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:39,428
Scott: just don't stop watching this.

388
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:42,542
Scott: you might think oh Whatever, but no it keeps going.

389
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:47,862
Scott: anything like he comes back later And you can see the water level went down overnight like multiple inches.

390
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:56,430
Scott: this video is the definition of wait for it And he shows you like where the water flew like went to deck in a swamp way below the road down the hill somewhere.

391
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:59,761
Rym: So my thing of the day f1.

392
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:07,850
Rym: if you don't know one thing about f1 cars Is that the steering wheels are like 20 to 30 thousand dollar pieces of technology?

393
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:13,450
Scott: Car you're in a really tight space right and you've got pedals down by your feet.

394
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,830
Scott: You maybe got some levers to your side, but you can't really move around too much right in a little tiny cockpit.

395
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:25,162
Rym: Yeah, you're also experiencing extreme g-forces And you can't really look around much and you can't.

396
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:26,226
Scott: you got to wear this helmet.

397
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,691
Scott: you wedge yourself in there Right.

398
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:39,387
Scott: so you got this really expensive really fancy car with all sorts of crazy features Right on it that you need to control and since you don't have a giant Dashboard like whatever SUV you're probably driving you suburban.

399
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,294
Scott: What was All?

400
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:45,016
Scott: the controls go on the steering wheel mostly yep, and they have to be.

401
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:50,473
Rym: they have to be usable by someone driving a car at high speed under pressure and They have to do a lot.

402
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:53,983
Rym: Yeah, they literally cost 20 or 30 thousand dollars to make.

403
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:56,890
Scott: they're all custom-made for the car for the driver whatever.

404
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:01,963
Scott: I've seen lots of videos in the past of Drivers showing off their steering wheels being like this button.

405
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:02,806
Scott: does this this button?

406
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:03,650
Scott: does that right?

407
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:05,864
Scott: Remember one with Kimi Raikkonen specifically?

408
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:06,650
Scott: I watched the whole thing.

409
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,663
Scott: Yeah, he told every single part of the steering wheel he explained.

410
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:10,346
Scott: What the hell it did.

411
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:18,570
Rym: so One driver takes an older steering wheel from some years ago back when traction control was still allowed.

412
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:24,506
Rym: Oh, and he walks you through in detail what every one of the fucking buttons does.

413
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:31,749
Rym: and it's fascinating especially because a few of them are blanked out and A few of them are not legal anymore.

414
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,970
Rym: Like traction control is not allowed in f1 not anymore.

415
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:40,230
Rym: Yes, you can't have like controls to enable and disable like different types of traction control.

416
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,720
Rym: Somebody walks through like what everything does but then he does something.

417
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,039
Rym: I've never seen before because usually when he watched these videos The person asks hey, so what's on the back?

418
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,646
Rym: and the answer is always I can't show you the back.

419
00:25:51,666 --> 00:26:00,110
Scott: and they like studiously Like the camera, I don't know why but they never show you the back and they're basically like yeah, it's proprietary trade secret.

420
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,901
Scott: We can't show you the back of the steering wheel.

421
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:03,330
Scott: I'm like what the fuck could be on there.

422
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:11,844
Scott: There's just some shifting paddles and like some sort of cylinder where it connects to the the drive shaft Connecty thing like sorry doesn't what could possibly be back there?

423
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,089
Scott: a gun to shoot the other?

424
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:17,086
Scott: You're hiding, you know, I don't like performance enhancing drugs.

425
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,170
Scott: What the hell you hiding back there.

426
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:26,186
Rym: So I'm half watching this video and I'm playing some overwatch and then it gets to a point like around eight minutes in where he's like, okay now I'm gonna show you the back and I'm like what what the fuck?

427
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:36,180
Rym: finally and You get to see the back and they talk about it in detail and there's eight paddles back there but Says something interesting.

428
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,030
Scott: Does he tell you why no one else wants to see the back?

429
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:48,092
Rym: No, he says usually we can't show you the back And then he turned but I can show you this one because it's a few years old and I think okay That's still cool.

430
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:50,099
Rym: And then he says something fascinating.

431
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,330
Rym: He says and I removed the top-secret stuff.

432
00:26:55,743 --> 00:27:06,800
Rym: So now you see the back and there's eight paddles back there and they're like Customizable and like you just get to see like the details of the back and he explains what all the paddles do and like this Fancy connector you can even see inside the connector.

433
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:11,639
Rym: But he did say there is something top-secret that they removed before they let us see it.

434
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,220
Scott: What the fuck are they keeping on the back of these wheels?

435
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,073
Scott: And if every team no team will show you the back.

436
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:21,273
Scott: so they all know their secret Team has secret stuff on the back of their wheel.

437
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,559
Scott: What the fuck is back there?

438
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:24,544
Rym: Here's the thing.

439
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:27,080
Scott: the next time possibly be the next.

440
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:33,820
Rym: The next time a driver has that hissy fit where they crash and they get out of the car and they throw the steering wheel.

441
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:37,240
Rym: I want to analyze frame by frame every video angle of that.

442
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,381
Rym: I

443
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:46,319
Scott: want to bring the zoomiest zoom zoom fucking lens to an f1 race with the Ultra slow-mo camera to zoom in on the back of some steering wheel when a guy gets out of the car

444
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:51,340
Rym: Because he literally is like, oh, yeah, we removed the top-secret stuff and he's like dead serious about that.

445
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,231
Rym: Is this just a long-running prank where there's nothing secret back there?

446
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,434
Rym: and they all agreed to pretend

447
00:27:56,595 --> 00:28:02,813
Scott: every single formula one team as Since they invented fancy wheels and instead is having normal steering wheels

448
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:15,200
Rym: like imagine if everyone who plays competitive Smash Brothers all agreed that there's a special controller they use when they're playing it in tournaments and No one's allowed to see the back of it because there's something secret there.

449
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,003
Rym: That's only for pros.

450
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,160
Scott: and if this is an old-ass wheel then like what the fuck?

451
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,190
Scott: I mean there are people who have purchased old.

452
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:22,813
Scott: no, right.

453
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:24,340
Scott: f1 cars change every year.

454
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:29,580
Scott: There are people who purchased old cars and who are not associated with the teams or the drivers.

455
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,408
Scott: Surely they know what's on the back of the wheel.

456
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:34,300
Scott: or did they give those people a wheel that they could drive the car with?

457
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,408
Scott: That does not have top secret stuff on it.

458
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,760
Scott: Yeah, so they get less than the original car.

459
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,199
Scott: They just get like some replacement wheel.

460
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:41,484
Rym: I have no idea.

461
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:46,932
Rym: but I'm like I'm even more invested in what the hell is on the back of those wheels now that I've ever been.

462
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,451
Scott: It's like it's not even valuable information to me.

463
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:52,340
Rym: No I did means nothing to me.

464
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:56,044
Rym: I just that's the kind of thing where if it wasn't secret I would go.

465
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:58,878
Rym: I find one YouTube video that explains what the deal is and I'd go.

466
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,260
Rym: oh.

467
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:05,360
Scott: And then I just remember that drivers and other employees of Formula One teams move from team to team.

468
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:07,212
Scott: Right they don't have like.

469
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,139
Scott: no they debrief them.

470
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,934
Rym: They're like listen if you talk about what's on the back of this fucking wheel.

471
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:12,020
Rym: We will kill your family.

472
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,280
Scott: It's like the driver knows what's on the back, and they don't have some sort of no compete.

473
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,909
Scott: They move from team to team all the time.

474
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,985
Scott: It's like I Don't know.

475
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:20,910
Rym: I want to know.

476
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,625
Rym: I want to know more than anything And once I find out.

477
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:26,953
Rym: I know what it would happen probably disappointing and lame.

478
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:33,584
Rym: yeah, I would go oh, okay cool And I would just proceed to never care again In the meta moment.

479
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:37,136
Scott: the gig nights book club book is a painful pages.

480
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:47,776
Rym: Troy Dennings Planescape branded novel pages of pain Which is one of two books that introduced most people to the deal with the planescape setting.

481
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,180
Rym: it's a painful book.

482
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,679
Rym: I just got to the part there in the maze.

483
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,768
Rym: They're following the thread they.

484
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,880
Scott: I just got to a part where you like cut off some giant finger in the maze.

485
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:57,643
Scott: I'm right.

486
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:01,817
Rym: I'm so I'm not at that part yet in the reread, but I remember that part.

487
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:04,299
Rym: okay I remember that part from a kid.

488
00:30:04,641 --> 00:30:09,100
Rym: What's weird is I didn't remember the fact that the thread existed at all.

489
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,610
Rym: Okay, cuz this new this book just goes like here's a scene.

490
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,899
Rym: that's happening and then something hard to explain happens.

491
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,850
Rym: now They're in a different place and a different thing is happening.

492
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,100
Rym: mm-hmm that that seems to just happen.

493
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:24,651
Rym: I like how the elf is like what Dabu.

494
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,032
Rym: What do you mean?

495
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:25,354
Rym: a wall?

496
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:25,996
Rym: who built a wall?

497
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:29,780
Rym: We're not in the maze Mm-hmm, so yeah, we'll be doing this book pretty soon.

498
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:33,031
Scott: Wow the paperback I'm about halfway done.

499
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,900
Rym: Yeah, I'm a little bit behind Scott.

500
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:40,500
Rym: I'm just at the part where they're in the hot part of the maze with the hail and they froze it.

501
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,664
Rym: They turned his foot to stone.

502
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:44,012
Scott: I'm past that yeah, but I remember.

503
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,460
Rym: I remember some stuff past that also.

504
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,120
Rym: He is clearly Theseus.

505
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,710
Rym: It is ham-fisted Lee just telling us hey.

506
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,054
Rym: Here's all these hints.

507
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,680
Rym: Maybe you can face Theseus.

508
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,385
Rym: They're saying that it's fucking.

509
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:59,315
Rym: Theseus came to the pages of pain.

510
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,000
Rym: Theseus is just in Planescape.

511
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,838
Rym: Yeah, that is what it is saying.

512
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,731
Rym: otherwise a bunch of our recent panels are on YouTube.

513
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:11,194
Rym: you can just go watch them and Let's go right into it.

514
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:16,540
Rym: So the reason we want to do this show is partly because we talk about this a lot.

515
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,520
Scott: Well, this is some idea that I've been espousing for years now.

516
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:28,790
Scott: I feel like I must have talked about on the show at least once and it applies to a much broader Like, you know, hey, it's it's.

517
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,720
Scott: it's a huge issue that applies to I guess all communities.

518
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:33,867
Scott: Yeah, right and not just gaming.

519
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:40,300
Scott: but it is most prominent and recognized in gaming Whereas in other areas is not recognized so much.

520
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,487
Scott: But people are seeing this.

521
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:48,199
Scott: the gaming is the area where people are seeing it and simply not Recognizing it and zooming out.

522
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:56,392
Scott: Yeah, but I think gaming is where it actually matters more because it doesn't matter more in gaming Which is also why I think people recognize it there.

523
00:31:56,753 --> 00:32:03,340
Rym: because there's an example say Game of Thrones like it's had a final season or whatever is happening right now and people are watching that.

524
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:08,620
Rym: Some of the people watching it are just watching it because yeah medieval fighting and stuff.

525
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:09,725
Rym: I wonder what happens.

526
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:22,780
Rym: cool and some people are like Trying to analyze the allegory and symbolism and details and figure stuff out and look at the Cinematography and like there's all these different communities who are watching Game of Thrones for different reasons.

527
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:29,800
Rym: Those communities don't actually have to interact and do not actually affect each other in any meaningful way.

528
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:43,933
Scott: Well, it's like I said, uh, you know in the world we organize, you know, at least in our Western capitalist societies We organize our communities especially fan communities But also all communities in general right based on the wrong things.

529
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:47,082
Scott: Star Wars fans will get together at Star Wars Celebration.

530
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:54,808
Scott: there will be people there who like making robot r2d2s that are like perfect replicas and there are people there who like Writing Star Wars fan fiction.

531
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:03,540
Scott: those people actually have almost nothing in common Whereas if the Star Wars fan fiction writer got together with say a Harry Potter fan fiction writer.

532
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:08,939
Scott: They would even though the Harry Potter person might not like Star Wars at all And the Star Wars person might like Harry Potter at all.

533
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:28,135
Scott: those people have more in common than the Star Wars person does with the r2d2 robot person because We're not more organizing our communities based on what actually makes people like each other and get along right, but even look at We're organizing people based on brands or properties.

534
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:29,560
Rym: or here's a great example.

535
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,624
Rym: look at an anime con.

536
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:37,469
Rym: we go to an anime con and we want to like do panels and learn stuff about the Industry and learn stuff about animation and that kind of thing.

537
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:47,093
Rym: and some other people go because they want to cosplay as Dragon Ball Z and watch Dragon Ball Z and Neither one of us actually interfere with each other's fun.

538
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:50,967
Scott: for the most part we can also choose But we also have nothing in common.

539
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:51,309
Scott: Well.

540
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,938
Scott: We have a lot less in common than you would think.

541
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:58,840
Rym: but Fortnight and games like it overwatch any gaming this problem.

542
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:05,590
Rym: You have to play the game with other people and all the people who play the game Play the game together.

543
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,220
Rym: yep, so here's the problem.

544
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,461
Rym: We're.

545
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:11,059
Rym: we'll start with the fortnight story because the fortnight story is the linchpin of all this.

546
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:14,560
Scott: For now it's just the latest incident that has brought this to light again.

547
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,949
Rym: Yeah But it brought us to light and probably the big like writ large.

548
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,199
Rym: yes because more people play fortnight than anything.

549
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,360
Rym: Yeah, fortnight like this affected a lot of people who don't think hard all right about games.

550
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,266
Scott: So here's what I've gathered from the story.

551
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:34,565
Rym: right it was hard to figure out which update it was because there's anger about literally Some sort of patch to fortnight.

552
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:41,060
Scott: and what the patch did is it changed the game so that when you killed someone They would drop loot of some kind.

553
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,386
Scott: I don't know if it was the loot they had or additional loot but you do be loot and This was not true before.

554
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:51,891
Scott: it used to be that you had to do like pub G where you have to go around Collecting loot and then start shooting people with the loot you gathered.

555
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:57,566
Scott: yeah, right, but you would kill people They would drop their loot and or maybe new loot I don't know the point is.

556
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:58,570
Scott: it was such.

557
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:07,460
Scott: it was enough loot that you could at the start of the game Just start killing people and you didn't have to go and farm for any stuff or search for anything.

558
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,966
Scott: You can just start killing people and if you just kept killing people with your good shooting skills You could win the game.

559
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,075
Scott: and that was actually the strategy to win the game.

560
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:28,131
Scott: because of this patch They made they may it ended up making fortnight more of an e-sport more of a real game where you could try to win and Skill was rewarded and people tried to kill each other in order to win.

561
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:38,944
Rym: now the people who play fortnight competitively or wanted to play fortnight can learn very happy with this patch because that changes the game - yes there is like a Very clear path to victory.

562
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:49,377
Rym: if I am better at killing people because it is a you know one man a million people enter one person remains They can play the game to win and their skill will matter.

563
00:35:49,578 --> 00:36:00,440
Rym: yep They by killing more people by doing the thing they're supposed to do They will become better at in the context of that instance of the game doing that thing and eventually it's a snowball and someone will win.

564
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:06,629
Rym: Yep, most of the players of fortnight hated this because the way most people play fortnight They don't actually try to win.

565
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:08,480
Rym: They kind of just like fucking around in fortnight.

566
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:14,500
Rym: Yep, killing people is like the thing that the serious people do at the end, and they don't really care that much.

567
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,221
Scott: Mm-hmm.

568
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:26,533
Scott: yeah people the vast majority of people in general it seems based on you know I guess Experience I've had right are not injured.

569
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:34,620
Scott: there are people who are interested in playing games Competitively to win and treat games that way, but it seems the most majority people just like playing.

570
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,315
Scott: They just like to play which is perfectly valid.

571
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:38,120
Scott: is that right?

572
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,133
Scott: It's not like there's a right or wrong way.

573
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:44,232
Rym: well like I was a kid I'd play Zelda 2 when I was young my kid brain.

574
00:36:44,272 --> 00:36:45,657
Rym: I didn't try to beat Zelda 2.

575
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:46,420
Rym: I just played it.

576
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,389
Rym: I don't know I was doing.

577
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,520
Rym: I just like wandered around.

578
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:49,765
Scott: Maybe you think about.

579
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:51,793
Scott: it's like you play with your action figures.

580
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:53,500
Scott: Yeah, just playing it's fun.

581
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,365
Scott: that's what people do.

582
00:36:54,445 --> 00:37:10,380
Scott: play is great right play is a good thing and Even though there are games that are constructs in which there is some sort of victory condition Right you know even if people don't even recognize that their decisions don't matter like Candyland a lot of adults don't realize.

583
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:13,683
Rym: No, right is oh my god It packs that we were.

584
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:17,315
Rym: we were literally arguing with this dude in line who didn't understand.

585
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:18,720
Scott: Yeah shuffling cards.

586
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:27,287
Rym: Yeah He literally could not fathom the idea that if you shuffle the cards or if you don't shuffle them Or if you shuffle them every turn the outcomes the same.

587
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:31,180
Rym: in a random game of candy like it was it was a weird situation.

588
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:31,900
Scott: anyway.

589
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,759
Rym: the point is I'm still mad about that conversation with that guy.

590
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:41,262
Scott: I don't know there was no way to get through to him because he didn't have the mental capacity to understand what we were Saying.

591
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:47,491
Scott: yep, or at least not in the short amount of time we had Fundamentally did not have a concept of statistics.

592
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:48,153
Scott: No none.

593
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:48,535
Scott: What's it?

594
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:49,599
Scott: most people don't yeah?

595
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:59,660
Scott: The point is most people just like to play and even if they happen to be playing something where there is a way to Win they right they don't really care too much about it.

596
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,889
Scott: They just want to play.

597
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:08,336
Rym: now for most of gaming history This is also fine because if I'm just playing Zelda 2 to win No one else is affected by that who plays Zelda 2.

598
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:20,220
Scott: yeah I mean you would have some occasional Situations where you'd go to an arcade and try to play street fighter And you would lose to someone immediately and then have to walk away But you know you would just wait until there wasn't anyone there.

599
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,736
Scott: But if you weren't good enough right because he was gonna cost you money to fight against that really good guy You're not gonna do it.

600
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:30,618
Rym: I always go play the Mortal Kombat 2 machine when no one was around because I just wanted to play the single-player version.

601
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:33,145
Scott: right yeah So these didn't really.

602
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:38,300
Scott: and even when multiplayer gaming became a thing right it was like Goldeneye in your house.

603
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:39,530
Scott: It was.

604
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:48,741
Scott: you know Even if you if you had to be really smart to be able to play quake online or right multiplayer gaming wasn't really competitive.

605
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:57,585
Scott: you know multiplayer gaming wasn't huge and accessible to most people until like way way later way later back to fortnight.

606
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:19,325
Rym: when this update happened, and he made the game more skill based a Thriving competitive community emerged instantly like the competitive set Double down on fortnight and loved this update because I think serious the fortnight is maybe the first like mega game that is Competitive online multiplayer.

607
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:20,710
Scott: yeah, right, it's like.

608
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,197
Scott: before that you had minecraft which was just playing.

609
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:25,906
Scott: yeah, right There's no competitive minecraft.

610
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:31,127
Scott: and before that all the games that were online multiplayer even the mobas They were niche core.

611
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:38,534
Rym: even League of Legends is small compared to fortnight Yep, lower like even in the old days when like get like one like quake to quake.

612
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:40,300
Rym: one deathmatch was a huge game.

613
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:49,680
Rym: That is among gamers among this tiny subset of human beings who had a computer and a video card Almost nobody right yep.

614
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:57,200
Rym: So the vast majority of players hated this update because now anytime late fortnight people would kill them.

615
00:39:57,381 --> 00:40:02,071
Scott: Yeah, they like right away They couldn't play because they were being murdered and someone else was trying to win.

616
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:05,263
Scott: there was an incompatible play group Right.

617
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:13,588
Scott: so fortnight made a new update Stats that people were like they were losing engagement or whatever ever they measure it and they decided well We got to remove this patch.

618
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:14,720
Scott: It's no good for us making money.

619
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,609
Rym: So they reverted it.

620
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,011
Rym: a2o Undid this competitive change, and they pretty much said they will never bring back these changes.

621
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:21,613
Scott: right.

622
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:30,518
Scott: but meanwhile at a fortnight eSports event The top fortnight players when interviewed at the end after winning or whatever were like yeah, I'm gonna give up fortnight.

623
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,260
Scott: This is bullshit.

624
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,528
Scott: It's not a really an eSport anymore this.

625
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:38,972
Scott: and then they're like okay the interview guy was like alright I'm just gonna go past you and ask the next guy.

626
00:40:39,012 --> 00:40:43,114
Scott: the next I was like yeah I'm also gonna say probably not playing this game anymore.

627
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:44,240
Scott: It's not really competitive.

628
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:49,476
Scott: So even though they're making tons of money playing it, and it's the biggest game on earth.

629
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:51,599
Scott: They were just like nope I'm done.

630
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:55,020
Rym: I'm gonna read this quote because it actually sums everything up about the update.

631
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:59,760
Rym: Everybody enjoyed receiving health and shields for eliminations after we introduced the changes to the core modes.

632
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:10,036
Rym: But there was an unexpected consequence players at large grew more frustrated with fortnight play feeling they had less chance Due to encounters with high skill players with full health and shields.

633
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:23,340
Rym: ultimately Siphon increased engagement for the highest skilled 10% while the remaining 90% of players were more frustrated and Played less yep, so that's because fortnight is so big.

634
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:29,720
Rym: I would say this is the stat 10% of players of any game try to win and the remaining 90%.

635
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,905
Scott: The sample size is enormous right.

636
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:33,234
Scott: so that's the best we've got the remaining the best stats.

637
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:34,560
Scott: We've ever had on this issue.

638
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:37,213
Rym: I actually I thought it was gonna be more 80/20.

639
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:39,802
Rym: I'm actually really surprised Less.

640
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:41,808
Scott: I thought it'd be like 50 95.

641
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:46,141
Rym: so here's the fascinating five 95 that 90%.

642
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:46,905
Rym: What we don't know.

643
00:41:46,926 --> 00:41:50,022
Rym: there are I think two communities in the 90%.

644
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:56,419
Rym: I think group a people who just want to play and they don't want some high skill jackass killing them mm-hmm.

645
00:41:57,221 --> 00:42:04,163
Rym: The other half are people who want to play competitively, but suck mm-hmm, and they don't realize they suck Mmm.

646
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:12,293
Rym: Those are you know basically those are the people the scrubs who complain the most Because those are the people who think they're platinum and overwatch.

647
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:13,660
Rym: They're actually silver.

648
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,691
Rym: They won't admit it if you get rid of that top 10% of players.

649
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:23,979
Rym: those scrubs feel like they're good because Half the people they're playing with aren't even trying to win right.

650
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:28,331
Rym: well I mean there's an old Good enough to frustrate the people who aren't trying to win right.

651
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,880
Scott: the old story about this comes from the magic world right where?

652
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:31,664
Scott: Talk about what.

653
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:33,794
Scott: is it Johnny Timmy and Spike or whatever?

654
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:34,980
Scott: yeah something like that.

655
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,869
Scott: And I you know the model that they use.

656
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,684
Scott: those three models of kinds of players I don't think are exactly right.

657
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:47,829
Scott: no the general the first like series attempt to categorize the general idea though I think is is close to the mark.

658
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:48,150
Scott: right.

659
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,114
Scott: yeah, is that you?

660
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,380
Scott: they have their idea?

661
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,087
Scott: I'm not remembering it exactly right.

662
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,740
Scott: I think spike was the kind of player who just wants to win.

663
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:55,967
Scott: They don't care how they win.

664
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:56,329
Scott: They don't care.

665
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,294
Scott: What kind of evil bullshit.

666
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:57,877
Scott: They got to do.

667
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:58,299
Scott: That's me.

668
00:42:58,521 --> 00:42:59,809
Scott: They'll play channel fireball.

669
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:05,045
Scott: They don't give a fuck dude when overwatch first easiest nastiest way to win They're gonna do it.

670
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:11,980
Rym: when overwatch first introduced deathmatch I chose Bridget because she had this stun ability and you know what is bullshit.

671
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:18,753
Rym: So in a one-on-one fight like where there's no one else around It's just me and someone else I could 100% of the time kill another person.

672
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:20,760
Rym: okay, so I just I only played Bridget.

673
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:25,299
Scott: Now they say they nerf that and then I forget which Johnny or Timmy or whatever.

674
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:27,720
Scott: Johnny I don't know, but there was one where it's like.

675
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,320
Scott: They just want to play big stuff like they just want to summon the classes of sardia.

676
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,226
Rym: It's a fucking 1212 bitches And then the force of nature 8/8.

677
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,457
Scott: eat it a trample and the other kind of player.

678
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:40,565
Scott: the third one Was the kind where it's like.

679
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:45,302
Scott: I just want to do this really clever fancy magic woo combo Right.

680
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:49,740
Rym: it's like a cycle through my entire magic deck in one turn because I got this really clever thing.

681
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,434
Scott: I just want to do it right.

682
00:43:51,958 --> 00:44:00,471
Scott: and The fundamental problem is that no matter what game you are making no matter what the rules of this game are These players are incompatible.

683
00:44:00,612 --> 00:44:08,200
Scott: even though they're playing the same game Them being in the same community and playing against each other is simply just gonna create conflict.

684
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:10,550
Scott: It is not those people shouldn't even be.

685
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,759
Scott: it's like yeah, okay, you both play magic But actually you have the guy playing spike.

686
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:16,523
Scott: Magic.

687
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:20,660
Scott: where he just tries to win has more in common with Rym playing Bridget and overwatch.

688
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:25,474
Scott: Then he has with the other person playing magic to just summon the biggest creature.

689
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:33,260
Rym: Oh, yeah, it looks like Rudicron our good friend actually posted a link that I will bring up the Bartle taxonomy of player types.

690
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,932
Scott: I guess that's what it was killers achievers socializers and explorers.

691
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:37,554
Scott: Okay.

692
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,838
Rym: I've seen this chart before.

693
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:44,264
Scott: yeah I don't agree necessarily with those four you know Categories.

694
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,857
Scott: well the general idea is is correct.

695
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:50,649
Rym: well They're on an axis of do you want to act versus interact?

696
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,660
Scott: and there's also obviously people who are mixes of all the the few.

697
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:59,340
Scott: But I also like doing stuff, but here's the stat that matters.

698
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,589
Rym: Here's the focus of what we're gonna talk about in this panel.

699
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:08,620
Rym: I Think this 90/10 number is going to be the most important discussion in the next few years of multiplayer gaming.

700
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:11,040
Scott: I mean I've been having the discussion, but no one else seems to want to have it.

701
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:13,000
Scott: Yeah, but I'm having it with myself.

702
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:21,690
Rym: I think there is literally no way to make a game that caters to a competitive community and The remaining 90% of gamers?

703
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:25,050
Scott: no I think you got to go for one of the other and abandon the other.

704
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,620
Rym: I think overwatch needs to abandon the casual players.

705
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:30,309
Rym: I think fortnight needs to abandon competitive play.

706
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,999
Scott: yeah a lot of these companies that are They're making games.

707
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,214
Scott: They're trying to be everything to everyone and you.

708
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:39,038
Scott: they all like.

709
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:42,131
Scott: hearthstone Basically just made all the eSports people.

710
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:44,020
Scott: they've always been angry all the time.

711
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:46,079
Scott: They've always said something to complain about all the time.

712
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:51,014
Scott: They keep staying for some reason or another right for but some of them don't.

713
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,000
Scott: a lot of them keep quitting and falling off.

714
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:58,640
Scott: But you know they hearthstone people have always gone towards the 90 and not the 10.

715
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,840
Rym: But I think short of only playing games with individual people who together all agree to play a certain way.

716
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,740
Rym: This is an intractable problem and no game can solve it.

717
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,400
Scott: I think it is mathematically basically impossible to make a game that just makes everyone happy.

718
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,846
Rym: I mean look at look at old Starcraft or Command and Conquer.

719
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:28,223
Rym: when I used to play command and conquer online with a fucking modem There were two kinds of people the people who played seriously to win and the people who made you agree in advance 10 minutes No rush

720
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:29,067
Scott: yep, because

721
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,699
Rym: they wanted to build a base first there is literally.

722
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,894
Scott: no I always wanted to make a game for those people which was also me cuz I. yeah It's funny that in RTS is I'm that guy because I'm bad.

723
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:45,415
Scott: at RTS because I'm bad I'm not any good, so it's like well I can't compete, but it's still fun to build a base.

724
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:49,896
Scott: yep, right Which is sort of why the games are fun even for the people who are really good.

725
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:56,860
Scott: because yeah They're really good, and they build the base in the winning way, but building the base is still fun to do in the winning way.

726
00:46:57,202 --> 00:47:02,400
Scott: Yep, I'm just not good enough to do in the winning way But I still want to be able to have that fun of building the base.

727
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,360
Scott: So I want to play against someone who isn't gonna just destroy me in five seconds.

728
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:10,856
Rym: So let's I'm gonna zoom into an overwatch example to really show how impossible this is.

729
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:18,159
Rym: so in overwatch There's a character Torbjorn or Torb the dwarf guy and one of his main thing is he can make it like her.

730
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:19,344
Scott: is he from Warcraft or something?

731
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:19,706
Rym: no.

732
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:20,310
Rym: He's just a dude.

733
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:20,853
Scott: Okay.

734
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:22,140
Rym: He's just he's a dwarf.

735
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,652
Scott: I thought all the overwatch characters are from other Blizzard shit.

736
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,260
Scott: No they're from overwatch.

737
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:28,212
Scott: I thought they were like from other blizzards.

738
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:29,380
Rym: No they got their own universe.

739
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,049
Rym: They got their own overwatch universe with nonsense in it.

740
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:32,431
Rym: No.

741
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,060
Scott: I thought it was like a warcraft character fights a Starcraft character.

742
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:36,348
Rym: No, it's not bad.

743
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:38,140
Rym: Oh, you should really play overwatch.

744
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,619
Rym: You would love the hell out or just not you would really when it's free to play you should play it.

745
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:43,166
Scott: Yeah, anyway auto chess.

746
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:46,920
Rym: so here's yeah, I'm I'm starting to fade on auto chess.

747
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:48,382
Scott: Oh, they made a good patch though And he did.

748
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:51,236
Rym: that patch is night and day night and day.

749
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,020
Rym: good guy anyway.

750
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:57,760
Rym: So in Fortnite in Fortnite in Overwatch this character's thing is they make a turret.

751
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,219
Rym: You know like in all those FPS's you put a turret down like near the flag room.

752
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:05,570
Rym: All these complicated FPS's have the concept of a turret.

753
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:06,012
Scott: Yep.

754
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,577
Rym: It shoots on its own.

755
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:17,815
Rym: so The way the game is if you make the turret really strong It matters more than the player who's playing the character right.

756
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:19,000
Scott: well if you think about it, right?

757
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:29,113
Scott: So let's say if you're playing an FPS And you're good at aiming right any sort of Automatic turret that you just put somewhere if it's better than the best players.

758
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,420
Rym: it will kill everyone and no one can stop it.

759
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:35,716
Scott: It has aimbot power where it just automatically shoots at anyone and kills them.

760
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:36,840
Scott: then it's too good.

761
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,839
Scott: Everyone will just use that and there's no point in shooting the gun you're holding.

762
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:50,840
Scott: but if you make it less good than the top 10% of players and the top 10% of players have no use for it because The gun they're holding and their awesome aim skills are better than this worthless turret.

763
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:55,213
Rym: But that turret is an undefeatable god to the rest of the player base.

764
00:48:55,353 --> 00:49:00,629
Scott: right if you're bad at aiming and everyone playing the game Is bad at aiming but you just switch to turret guy.

765
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:10,060
Scott: if that turret aims better than you do and better than all the other Players do that turret is now the best player on the map and it requires no aiming skill to deploy the turret.

766
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,266
Scott: You just push a fucking button

767
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:26,040
Rym: so you can make that turret anywhere between Better than 0% of players at aiming and better than 100% of players at game at aiming and there is no place you can Put it where it will be where everyone below that line will always use it and

768
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:27,863
Scott: Never

769
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:28,164
Rym: use

770
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:28,244
Scott: it.

771
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:31,458
Scott: a mechanic itself is unbalanceable.

772
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,867
Scott: Unless you you.

773
00:49:34,128 --> 00:49:42,119
Scott: the only way to do it would be to automatically Scale the skill of the turret to be in alignment with the skill of the player that deployed it.

774
00:49:42,861 --> 00:49:45,168
Rym: So it gets more complicated, which is impossible.

775
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:50,522
Rym: No one's even tried that Overwatch is on both PC and on Consoles.

776
00:49:50,622 --> 00:49:53,772
Rym: yes, so they did pick about because there are other factors.

777
00:49:53,812 --> 00:49:56,119
Rym: the character can do other things than just make the turn.

778
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,247
Scott: obviously Otherwise be really hella boring to be that character.

779
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:01,079
Rym: Yeah, so Torb's actually really fun to play behind the turret.

780
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:12,592
Rym: wait yeah, so Torb's really fun to play and is in like the general meta of the game and Pretty much in the PC game does work Except it is like to power like if you play with silvers.

781
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:14,740
Rym: Torb is an undefeatable fucking god.

782
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:21,125
Rym: Like cuz I'm good at aiming so I can shoot with Torb with really good aim while simultaneously Using the turret.

783
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:27,620
Scott: that itself is better than like having an extra player on your team Who's better than most of the other team, but you're also better than most of the other team.

784
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,462
Scott: Yeah, so that's really strong, but console players Cannot we?

785
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:35,234
Rym: if you have a controller you can not fight that turret right.

786
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:37,360
Scott: most console FPS is right.

787
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:42,697
Scott: Don't lots of games these days allow console players to play against PC players like rocket league or whatever.

788
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:43,720
Scott: right cuz it doesn't really matter.

789
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:51,160
Scott: You're using a gamepad to play rocket league in your PC anyway alright, but for FPS is whether they want to keep fighting this fight or not.

790
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,589
Scott: PC keyboard and mouse is vastly superior to gamepad.

791
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,715
Scott: for FPS control it is undebatable.

792
00:50:58,216 --> 00:51:11,880
Scott: every console FPS implements lots of Significant but invisible to normal people changes that make the game playable with a gamepad Because aiming with a gamepad is less precise and less good than aiming with a mouse.

793
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:17,836
Rym: While they even the characters play the same no matter what skill you are.

794
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:23,114
Rym: if you're ranked like Platinum or you're ranked wood tier the characters all work the same way.

795
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:26,544
Rym: It's the same game at every level Except on the console.

796
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:32,319
Rym: they had to make the turret way shittier because no console gamer could deal with that turret.

797
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:33,819
Scott: otherwise Yeah, they all stop.

798
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,993
Scott: There's also lots of auto aim like not not perfect auto aim But like aim help right like sort of light snapping.

799
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:44,064
Scott: and there have been lots of things I've read about that.

800
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:48,842
Scott: different FPS games have done on the console to make the games Playable.

801
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:55,804
Scott: and if you were to say if you were somehow able to play like the console version with your mouse and keyboard you would Be a god because it's helping you so much.

802
00:51:55,824 --> 00:52:02,787
Rym: Let's back away say Oh epic brought back these changes that made the game more competitive But they did edit.

803
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:06,400
Rym: a ranking system like overwatch does some sort of matchmaking system.

804
00:52:06,721 --> 00:52:09,312
Rym: You only get matched with people who are around your same skill level.

805
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:19,945
Rym: that still doesn't solve the problem Because the matchmaking system has to converge and players will more likely than not encounter good players At various points.

806
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:25,160
Rym: any game that has even one good player in it will devolve into that good player fucking murdering everybody.

807
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,565
Rym: That happens in overwatch.

808
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:27,528
Rym: that happens in every game.

809
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:28,511
Scott: one person who's?

810
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:29,876
Scott: imagine you're playing a board game.

811
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:34,009
Scott: if you're playing seven wonders Right with yup, seven people sitting around a table.

812
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:39,376
Scott: if everyone else is like la la la and one person is trying to win They will ruin everyone's fun.

813
00:52:39,396 --> 00:52:41,766
Rym: Yep They will win and you can.

814
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:51,720
Rym: there is no way to detect that a player is good at the game or not Except with a very powerful matchmaking system, which can be circumvented by a player making a new account.

815
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,228
Scott: It's not even just that the player wins.

816
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:58,160
Scott: It's that the way most games are constructed.

817
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:02,260
Scott: It's that when someone else is playing well, right?

818
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:06,920
Scott: Even if you don't care about winning you just want to play and have fun, right?

819
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,120
Scott: It's just playing like let's say I want to play fortnight.

820
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:11,956
Scott: I just want to build a cool base because that's the thing you can do, right?

821
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:18,494
Scott: Yep Actually I want to explore the map and build a cool base.

822
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:20,500
Scott: I don't care if someone kills me, right?

823
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,550
Scott: Well, the way the game is made someone kills me.

824
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,220
Scott: I can't explore anymore and I can't build my cool base.

825
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,614
Scott: they just destroyed my cool base and I lost all my stuff.

826
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:33,333
Scott: and it's like It's like it prevents me from playing.

827
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:35,180
Scott: your play is ended or cut short.

828
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,612
Scott: They're like netrunner decks magic decks right where it's like.

829
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:41,020
Scott: hey, that's a deck that wins games.

830
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,362
Scott: You know what?

831
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:41,723
Scott: It does.

832
00:53:41,824 --> 00:53:45,080
Scott: It makes you discard your entire deck and there's nothing you can do about it.

833
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,434
Scott: It prevents you from.

834
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,671
Scott: It's like I don't care if I lose this game of netrunner.

835
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:51,440
Scott: I just want to play my cards and then lose.

836
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,285
Scott: It's like nope Their deck is so good.

837
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:56,740
Scott: you lose before you can play your cards and none of the cards you can play.

838
00:53:57,102 --> 00:54:00,967
Scott: Not only will they not help you win, which I can accept They won't actually do any.

839
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:03,480
Scott: every single card in your deck is now ineffective and useless.

840
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:05,493
Scott: It's like there's no point in playing any of them.

841
00:54:05,735 --> 00:54:06,440
Scott: They do nothing.

842
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:09,360
Scott: You're just shut down right and magic like try play.

843
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,042
Rym: Here's an example.

844
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:13,733
Rym: try playing Carcassonne with me or Scott or our friend Anthony.

845
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:15,498
Scott: in the earliest days of magic.

846
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,625
Scott: in the early 90s There was a card called stasis.

847
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:18,889
Scott: Yeah, stasis.

848
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:19,812
Rym: Oh boy.

849
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:21,057
Scott: There were stasis decks.

850
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:21,980
Rym: I played blue decks.

851
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,603
Rym: Do you know why?

852
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:23,949
Rym: because fuck you bring up?

853
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,435
Scott: Let's read the text of stasis.

854
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:26,480
Scott: God, right?

855
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,098
Scott: It was like you can only untap if you like.

856
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:31,919
Scott: You basically can't untap anything, right?

857
00:54:32,663 --> 00:54:33,747
Scott: I forget the exact text.

858
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:36,700
Rym: each player skips his or her untapped face.

859
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:38,920
Scott: You don't get to normally in magic, right?

860
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,894
Scott: If you don't know the game of Magic the Gathering for any I'm sure most people do.

861
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,924
Scott: when you use a card That's on the table.

862
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:48,800
Scott: You have to tap it that card now once it's tapped You can't do anything with it until it's untapped.

863
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:55,562
Scott: But at the start of your turn you get to untap pretty much everything for free and then you can use everything again Right.

864
00:54:55,783 --> 00:54:59,260
Scott: So basically use all your stuff once per turn or you save it on your turn.

865
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,806
Scott: Don't tap it and use it during your opponent's turn right and then at the start of your turn everything resets If someone plays.

866
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:09,579
Rym: I'm looking at all the different versions of this card because I love the art on it.

867
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:10,718
Rym: Yeah, that's really good.

868
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,194
Rym: But at the beginning of your upkeep sacrifice stasis.

869
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:15,620
Rym: unless you play pay blue mana.

870
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:19,153
Rym: Then they updated to during your upkeep pay blue mana or bear.

871
00:55:19,294 --> 00:55:20,900
Rym: they keep changing the second sentence.

872
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:32,421
Scott: the point is if you play stasis, it just stays there and Nobody untaps Anything like no and no one can use their cards anymore because they don't get to untap them for free at the start of their Turn.

873
00:55:32,722 --> 00:55:34,949
Scott: so the game just locks and you just have to.

874
00:55:35,029 --> 00:55:40,076
Scott: as long as you can keep paying that blue mana to stasis It's not cumulative.

875
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:40,781
Scott: update right.

876
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:48,005
Scott: as long as you can keep paying that one from somewhere and of course you have a somewhere because you built your deck around This card to lock your opponent in.

877
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:49,749
Scott: Yep, then you're.

878
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,015
Scott: they can't untap anything and you play.

879
00:55:52,376 --> 00:56:11,492
Scott: of course when you play a stasis deck you play lots of cards that don't require tapping like creatures that can attack without tapping and spells from your hand that just do a shit ton of damage and sources of mana that don't really need to be tapped or other cards that let you untap things outside the untap phase and Now your opponent no matter what the hell their deck is.

880
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:12,980
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter, right?

881
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,959
Scott: They cannot do anything because it almost certainly unless they're playing a stasis deck also.

882
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:20,688
Scott: Yep, all their cards are they.

883
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:24,740
Scott: you play them they tap them now they're locked and they can't untap them no matter what.

884
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,446
Scott: There's no card in their deck that will help them.

885
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,374
Scott: They might as well just quit immediately.

886
00:56:28,414 --> 00:56:29,980
Scott: They can't even play and have fun.

887
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,407
Scott: It's not even that they will lose.

888
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:33,659
Scott: they cannot play and have fun.

889
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:43,879
Rym: So to get back to the matchmaking a matchmaking system only works if all players try hard to win so that their skill can be appropriately determined.

890
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:48,356
Rym: if Even one person is trying hard to win it ruins the fun for 90% of players.

891
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,887
Scott: one person is playing a stasis deck.

892
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:52,494
Scott: it ruins the fun for every opponent.

893
00:56:52,735 --> 00:57:03,595
Rym: and even worse if you have a Matchmaking system and there's any sort of ranking the scrubs who are at least half of that community that 90% They will be mad that their rank is too low.

894
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:12,639
Rym: if you show them the ring Yep And if you hide it from them They will say that the ranking system is bullshit because it's putting them with the wrong players because they keep losing Because they're scrubs and they suck.

895
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:23,167
Scott: So it's also the problem that at least with online play as opposed to say real-world play like in real-world play for ranking systems Let's say the tennis ranking system.

896
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,800
Scott: There is a world tennis ranking system, right?

897
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,336
Scott: The number one players are people like, you know, Roger Federer Serena Williams, right or whoever.

898
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:31,320
Scott: I don't know who's number one now.

899
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,363
Scott: Yeah, you can look it up.

900
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:41,818
Scott: if you go to your local tennis club, right and you start playing real tennis You get put on the same exact fucking ranking chart as those people you can just like.

901
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:42,180
Scott: they'll be like.

902
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,174
Scott: Yeah, you're ranked like a million, right?

903
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:48,080
Scott: Whatever it is You're on the same chart and the professionals are at the top of the chart.

904
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:57,100
Scott: and if you keep playing tennis in your local tennis places and maybe bigger places and someone You could like go to like the US Open US Open is open, right?

905
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,806
Scott: You're high enough rank like you can go.

906
00:57:58,887 --> 00:57:59,429
Scott: you can play.

907
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,417
Rym: as opposed to an invitational right.

908
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,860
Scott: if you win It's like you'll go way up in rank.

909
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,999
Scott: It's like a real thing, but there's no way for you to fake it.

910
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:08,664
Scott: They know who the hell you are.

911
00:58:08,745 --> 00:58:09,567
Scott: you're right there.

912
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:16,411
Rym: if Tiger Woods shows up at like my like the high school tournaments They'll be like you're Tiger Woods.

913
00:58:16,612 --> 00:58:17,800
Scott: You're the best golfer.

914
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:20,114
Scott: We know who you are and this is easily solved.

915
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:27,066
Rym: you're playing among friends Like if our group of friends is like, oh, we want to play a light game like we might all agree like, okay Let's just play this game for fun.

916
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:29,839
Rym: or a Rym and Scott are not allowed to play in this game right now.

917
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,649
Scott: They recognize their Rym and Scott are coming to the table.

918
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:34,897
Scott: If you're playing an esport in the eSports League.

919
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:35,740
Scott: They know who you are.

920
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:36,687
Scott: Oh, it's overwatch League.

921
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:38,580
Scott: I see you sitting right there in this LAN party.

922
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:44,080
Rym: That's why if a professional player gets caught smurfing they get in trouble because that's free for free online play.

923
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:51,940
Scott: Smurfing is a serious problem if you're good But now your matchmaking is putting you against people who are also good and you're not winning so much.

924
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:56,620
Scott: But you care about rank and you care about winning because you're the kind of player who cares about winning.

925
00:58:57,163 --> 00:58:58,731
Scott: That's why you you're carrying right?

926
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,220
Scott: It's why you're up there in the high ranks.

927
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,460
Scott: So you just make a new account even if it costs you money.

928
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:20,720
Scott: It's rank zero and now you're playing as people who suck and you're winning because now it's more fun for you to play and beat Up and bully around people who are way less good than you because at least you win because you care about winning Right, and then when you get to high rank again You make a new crappy account because you can't compete against people really.

929
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,708
Rym: But even if you're not smurfing if there's a matchmaking system your honor bound to try your hardest to win And that ruins the game.

930
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:28,714
Rym: You'll stop.

931
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,189
Rym: so I think there's an even worse implication of this.

932
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:47,199
Rym: if the split is 90/10 then The only money you can make by selling your game Really is to cater to the 90% and make sure that 10% of competitive players won't play your game.

933
00:59:48,066 --> 00:59:57,201
Scott: Or you need to make the game Completely segregate them in all ways To like just split your player base 90/10 and make sure those 10 never interact with those 90.

934
00:59:57,201 --> 01:00:00,540
Rym: Yep, which is difficult for a lot of reasons, but I don't think it's difficult.

935
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,072
Scott: I think people just aren't willing to implement Scott solutions.

936
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,740
Rym: Well, what Scott's a little bit overwatch.

937
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,182
Rym: It's just it.

938
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:07,594
Rym: you log into overwatch and say I want to play.

939
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:08,660
Scott: No, I have a solution.

940
01:00:08,941 --> 01:00:12,679
Scott: All right solution is if you want to play to win.

941
01:00:13,362 --> 01:00:17,113
Scott: Right, there is no ranking on just but you click I want to play.

942
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:17,655
Scott: none.

943
01:00:17,755 --> 01:00:18,558
Scott: None whatsoever.

944
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:20,484
Scott: There's no rank There's no matchmaking.

945
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:21,106
Scott: There's no nothing.

946
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:27,249
Rym: Okay, every game is just play around whatever but in that situation I would still try to win every game.

947
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,791
Rym: I joined.

948
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:29,680
Scott: Well, here's my solution.

949
01:00:30,508 --> 01:00:37,625
Scott: the competitive play Will be much like competitive play in the real world Actual fucking tournament.

950
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,676
Scott: you open up overwatch and it's like alright, here's an overwatch tournament.

951
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,563
Scott: It costs $5.

952
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:44,046
Scott: Join it.

953
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:46,580
Rym: that doesn't sound fun though, cuz I want to just play overwatch.

954
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:50,080
Rym: I want to sit down after the show and just jump into a game overwatch.

955
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:55,636
Scott: If you win you get the $5 from everyone else who joined that turn.

956
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:56,880
Rym: I don't want to deal with a tournament.

957
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,513
Rym: I just want to join a game of overwatch where I can try to win.

958
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:01,577
Rym: That's all I want to do.

959
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:04,509
Rym: Well That's what I want to do in board games.

960
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:05,113
Scott: I want to play.

961
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:09,240
Scott: when I play netrunner It's like when you go to the local netrunner, you know meet up every week.

962
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:13,560
Scott: You just play a netrunner, but then you go to the netrunner tournament and you try to win.

963
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:15,680
Scott: It's a different setting at the tournament.

964
01:01:16,784 --> 01:01:21,120
Scott: Some of the players at the tournament might not be the kind you try to win and end up losing.

965
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,053
Scott: They understand that in the tournament setting.

966
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:26,908
Scott: this is for serious Like here's when I was in middle school.

967
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:27,993
Scott: This is not just playing around.

968
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:32,240
Rym: When I was in middle school playing magic I always tried to win no matter what the context was.

969
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,979
Rym: I'd swap decks and change stuff, but I always wanted to play to win.

970
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,435
Rym: But I didn't want to travel to tournaments all the time.

971
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:38,858
Rym: Mm-hmm.

972
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:41,575
Rym: So every game I played I just tried to win and I won a lot.

973
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:46,472
Scott: my other idea Which is similar is to have a mode that's like serious mode.

974
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:47,957
Rym: That's what Overwatch does you can?

975
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:49,000
Rym: you can say quickplay?

976
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,822
Scott: No, no, no.

977
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:51,890
Scott: serious mode has to be right.

978
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,760
Scott: you play can you know, you click competitive mode?

979
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,546
Scott: But that's not.

980
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:56,900
Scott: I'm talking serious mode.

981
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:04,819
Scott: Like you put huge gates around it to make sure that anyone can you use pay money to get in?

982
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,597
Rym: What to each game?

983
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,420
Scott: May each game or just to get in Huge fines for misbehaving in there or not trying to win.

984
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,913
Rym: So Scott, you know what happened then or surfing?

985
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:19,539
Rym: all the people are pretty good But not good enough to be like pro enough to do that.

986
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,579
Rym: They would just play in the fun mode, but also try to win in the fun mode.

987
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,734
Scott: Yeah, but they're not good enough to make the people who suck upset.

988
01:02:25,815 --> 01:02:26,317
Rym: Yes, they are.

989
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:26,960
Rym: There's the problem.

990
01:02:27,221 --> 01:02:41,307
Rym: It's not a matter of them being that good if anyone in overwatch or in like fortnight even if even if that 10% of high school players quit if Anyone tries hard to win even if they're not that good They will harm the fun of the other players.

991
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:44,980
Rym: and the final aspect of this can't ban people trying hard.

992
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:55,362
Rym: All you can do is reduce the impact of skill on the outcome of the game Which is what overwatch what I keep saying over on that's what fortnight did they got rid of that 10%?

993
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:57,600
Rym: Not by doing anything prescriptive like you're talking about.

994
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,589
Rym: They just removed the thing that made the game skill based.

995
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:04,420
Scott: and here is the final aspect of these of these ideas, right?

996
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,188
Rym: Because I think there's a. I have a final.

997
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:07,714
Scott: you have an even more final aspect.

998
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:08,035
Scott: Yes.

999
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:14,400
Scott: This is the final aspect I have to offer final final AAA final dot P. Anyway, this is the final idea Scott had.

1000
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,660
Rym: Okay, if you look at magic the gathering, I think we can turn this to a panel.

1001
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,544
Rym: We had a lot more to say.

1002
01:03:18,605 --> 01:03:22,623
Scott: magic the gathering has many game modes Right.

1003
01:03:22,643 --> 01:03:25,976
Scott: Yeah, the solution that they've come up with is different modes.

1004
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:27,100
Rym: Scott overwatch did this.

1005
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,571
Rym: They they have the arcade and they have competitive mode.

1006
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:38,234
Scott: You got that like this four-headed ogre, whatever the fuck it is giant Magic the star planeswalker bullshit.

1007
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:38,997
Scott: they got standard.

1008
01:03:39,038 --> 01:03:42,674
Scott: they got legacy They'd always monitor and all these fucking modes right now.

1009
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:44,140
Scott: Some of those modes are competitive mode.

1010
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,224
Scott: They got the cheapo mode.

1011
01:03:45,244 --> 01:03:46,067
Scott: You don't pay a lot of money.

1012
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:49,097
Scott: They got so many variable ways to play the same game.

1013
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:49,559
Scott: Yep, right.

1014
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:55,980
Scott: So if you take my previous ideas of tournaments pay separated pro mode, right?

1015
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,420
Scott: What I would do is I would make the game that is not competitive and unranked would not even be a competitive game.

1016
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,464
Scott: It would be like minecraft.

1017
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:07,560
Scott: It would literally be like if you play fortnight in the non pro mode.

1018
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:13,408
Scott: There is no killing people Scott really just playing around Overwatch does this.

1019
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:16,477
Rym: so they have the quick play the competitive which is like the normal game mode.

1020
01:04:16,718 --> 01:04:17,723
Rym: just like serious They're like.

1021
01:04:17,744 --> 01:04:19,076
Scott: there isn't even winning and losing.

1022
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:19,459
Rym: Aha.

1023
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:23,394
Rym: So then there is the arcade and we're like in the arcade.

1024
01:04:23,454 --> 01:04:25,481
Rym: one of the standard things in the arcade is mr Heroes.

1025
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:29,033
Rym: what it is is who what character you are is random.

1026
01:04:29,194 --> 01:04:34,046
Rym: You can't pick and every time you die Random character again, but is there winning?

1027
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:43,680
Rym: there is but you everyone tries hard to win because it's fun to try hard to win In that context, but no one takes it that seriously because it's fucking random characters.

1028
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:45,373
Rym: You might get four mercies.

1029
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:49,960
Rym: the fuck you gonna do You're just gonna lose and everyone has a good time because no one takes it that seriously.

1030
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:54,806
Rym: But trying to win does not harm the fun of the other players Even if they're not trying to win.

1031
01:04:54,826 --> 01:04:56,212
Rym: mmm that would that like.

1032
01:04:56,534 --> 01:04:58,101
Rym: that's a decent way to go Like.

1033
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,147
Rym: I think there is some area to explore it.

1034
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:04,340
Scott: So I mean part of the mode of the not winning is also handicapping, right?

1035
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,740
Scott: It's like if you're so good, we're not gonna do matchmaking to keep right.

1036
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,520
Scott: We're just gonna make your aim is gonna be all over the fucking place.

1037
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:17,383
Scott: Yeah, so good, right, but you know if you're saying, you know to use the overwatch example Why not have it?

1038
01:05:17,444 --> 01:05:20,556
Scott: Oh, if you're not playing overwatch matchmaking, there's no ranking.

1039
01:05:20,576 --> 01:05:21,118
Scott: There's no winning.

1040
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:21,620
Scott: There's no losing.

1041
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,785
Scott: You just run around and shoot people.

1042
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:23,328
Rym: Yeah.

1043
01:05:23,368 --> 01:05:24,754
Rym: No one wants to play it.

1044
01:05:24,774 --> 01:05:30,960
Rym: They want the structure of the game Even fortnight, they want to just run around and have fun, but they also want someone to get the chicken dinner.

1045
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:32,999
Rym: Mmm, they still want there to be a win.

1046
01:05:34,003 --> 01:05:36,683
Rym: They just don't care that much if they win Here.

1047
01:05:36,744 --> 01:05:38,893
Rym: my final thought is much more on the game industry.

1048
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:42,640
Scott: if this is the 90/10 split But it like if I'm if you fortnight, right?

1049
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,500
Scott: You can have a fortnight where if you're playing you open up fortnight and click play you play fortnight.

1050
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:51,839
Scott: If you click play competitive then it's the kind where when people die then stuff spawns out of them.

1051
01:05:52,341 --> 01:05:55,729
Rym: Right that patches on or off but then it's just two different games.

1052
01:05:55,769 --> 01:05:56,631
Scott: Yes, exactly.

1053
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:57,653
Rym: But there's the problem.

1054
01:05:57,894 --> 01:05:59,839
Rym: Those are two fundamentally different games.

1055
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:04,910
Rym: Yes The problem with that is that but it takes a lot.

1056
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,123
Scott: let it's not to make those two different games takes a lot less Resource, here's the problem.

1057
01:06:09,324 --> 01:06:10,547
Rym: Here's the problem with that.

1058
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:11,730
Rym: I'll get to my final point.

1059
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:30,077
Rym: You I. if you make a game that caters to the high-skill 10% You only make money from a professional eSports system, yep, if you make a game that Prevents the 10% from wanting to play your game Then you make money from selling the game to the remaining 90% of people.

1060
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:50,343
Rym: If you make a game that's aimed at the 10% the skill based people and you want to have a version of that game for The 90% that won't work because if fortnight if there's competitive fortnight and the rest of fortnight The competitive fortnight will not have a serious audience because the audience wants to see the same game They play.

1061
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:52,535
Rym: the four people don't watch overwatch.

1062
01:06:52,716 --> 01:06:57,719
Scott: They're not gonna watch Fortnight, I've heard this argument before and I don't buy it.

1063
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,963
Rym: I don't think we will.

1064
01:06:59,004 --> 01:06:59,184
Scott: here's.

1065
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:07,210
Scott: I've heard this argument because the people right I've heard it from soccer people who say look Soccer is so great when you play soccer as little kids.

1066
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:09,820
Scott: You're playing the exact same soccer that adults are playing.

1067
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:11,851
Scott: That's why we can't add instant replay.

1068
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:15,019
Scott: That's why we can't do all the stuff I would say all those changes.

1069
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:25,065
Scott: Meanwhile, meanwhile kids right who play basketball have lower nets smaller courts kids playing Little League have t-ball Right softball.

1070
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:35,800
Scott: people are playing lots of games that are pale imitations of the real game But they have not lost any interest for the real competitive game that they will never ever ever play in their whole lives.

1071
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:45,796
Rym: I'm however, I would argue that the patch for fortnight is more Structurally fundamentally changing to the meta of fortnight how it looks how it acts how it plays.

1072
01:07:46,056 --> 01:07:49,720
Rym: then every change We've wanted from soccer combined would be to soccer.

1073
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:56,771
Scott: I'm just saying little kids playing ice hockey where they can't hit each other and they're using half the ice have not lost any Interest in real fucking ice hockey.

1074
01:07:57,194 --> 01:08:02,560
Scott: Yeah doesn't matter You can play baby fortnight and get plenty of enjoyment watching big boy fortnight.

1075
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:08,920
Rym: I am pretty confident that the people who want to watch fortnight would rather watch the casual mode.

1076
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:11,452
Scott: And I don't as you can watch a streamer do it.

1077
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:14,448
Scott: You don't have to watch the eSports for yes You can watch a streamer play fortnight.

1078
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:21,500
Rym: I'm saying epic would make No worthwhile money even bothering engaging with that high-skill 10%.

1079
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,370
Rym: Maybe there is no reason to do it.

1080
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:27,608
Rym: if I were the product manager at epic I would literally just say we will not.

1081
01:08:27,627 --> 01:08:28,591
Rym: we don't care about.

1082
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:30,676
Scott: the competitive craft is doing fine without an eSport.

1083
01:08:30,698 --> 01:08:39,404
Rym: Yes All right I think we can definitely turn this into a panel because I got more to yell about but I'm hungry and this shows already gone Along so we're just gonna stop right here.

1084
01:08:39,524 --> 01:08:43,319
Scott: I want to yell more about non gaming things that have the same problem.

1085
01:08:43,421 --> 01:08:45,077
Rym: I think we're gonna make a pax panel out of this.

1086
01:08:51,184 --> 01:08:53,720
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
