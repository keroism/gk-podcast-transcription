00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,052
Rym: It's Monday June 24th 2019.

2
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:15,262
Rym: I'm Rym knows good, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:17,690
Rym: We are talking about computer mice.

4
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,507
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:25,722
Rym: So I actually got my bike back from the shop And it is that you so good.

6
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:26,869
Scott: too much money to fix.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,014
Scott: I don't think I paid too much.

8
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:30,002
Scott: you could have just bought a new bicycle probably.

9
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,130
Rym: uh so I could have bought a new bicycle.

10
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,803
Rym: The parts to replace.

11
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:40,887
Rym: basically I replaced $4,400 worth of parts on my bike to buy the same bike in 2019 dollars.

12
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:41,870
Rym: because I went and looked around.

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,635
Rym: I was at the shop.

14
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:48,630
Rym: so while they were giving figuring out the estimate I went and looked at like equivalent bikes would have been about sixteen hundred bucks.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,403
Scott: No, how much would it cost to buy the same bike?

16
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:52,809
Scott: What year is your bike from?

17
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:58,815
Scott: 2010 ish 2010 by.

18
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,390
Rym: I found a blue book quote like bike site that tracks like who knows if that's accurate for shit.

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,024
Rym: So I looked at it, and it said where do they get their data from?

20
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:08,110
Rym: looks like they scrape it.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:16,448
Rym: So what I found is that my current bike Which is a Trek 7.6 FX you can get that exact same bike like refurbished for around 1,300 bucks.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,127
Rym: No, cuz they stopped making that particular bike a while ago like even when I went to the bike shop.

23
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:28,245
Rym: I went to the Bicycle what a bicycle habitat and the guy was like whoa the Trek FX.

24
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,754
Rym: They don't make those any sounds Don't think?

25
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:31,780
Scott: how could they not?

26
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:32,404
Rym: they do.

27
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,224
Rym: they make similar bikes But they don't think they got rid of the hybrid bike trick.

28
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,470
Rym: their trick makes a bunch of hybrids.

29
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,998
Scott: but point is my the fancy.

30
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:48,298
Scott: the bike I just bought to replace my Trek FX that was all busted was 1,500 new for a brand new 2019 model fancy bike.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,990
Scott: so it makes no sense that your bike would be less money than that.

32
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,896
Scott: I mean close even.

33
00:01:53,917 --> 00:02:04,210
Rym: I mean a hybrid like the nice hybrids Trek has are from 1,000 to 1,600 depending on which models you look at Like four to six hundred dollars yeah.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:13,029
Rym: So instead I spent four hundred dollars in parts to basically make my bike brand new And it'll probably last another eight years and by then who knows what the world will be like mm-hmm.

35
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:26,092
Rym: so Bike to work today, and it felt good felt good to have a chain that is actually not stretched out and actually fits over by Gears that are themselves not completely ruined Mm-hmm.

36
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,770
Rym: so uh I wanna go right into the news cuz there was a big internet outage.

37
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:40,869
Scott: I woke up this morning, and I go and I bring on my iPad and I start reading some internet And the first thing I notice is I try to play my stupid balloon popping game with its little daily challenge.

38
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:45,648
Rym: Wait this sounds like Jerry's game from Rick and Morty.

39
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:46,111
Scott: no It's.

40
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,056
Scott: it's a tower defense game.

41
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,845
Scott: okay with the monkeys the pop balloons.

42
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:53,210
Rym: cuz in Rick and Morty There's a dumb character and his thing is he plays this iPad game all the time.

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,121
Rym: That's just click on balloons to pop them.

44
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:55,423
Scott: No.

45
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:55,624
Scott: No.

46
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:56,287
Scott: This is not that.

47
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:58,902
Scott: okay It's tower defense game if I play it once every morning.

48
00:02:58,962 --> 00:02:59,606
Scott: You know whatever.

49
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:04,850
Scott: anyway There's a screen that loads to show you the daily challenges was just white and not loading.

50
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,025
Scott: I was like huh, I guess they fucked up their daily challenge thing.

51
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:16,560
Rym: It's funny cuz this morning I was getting ready to get in the shower and before I get into the shower I like look at the news and bunch of websites I tried to go to on my phone just like wouldn't load.

52
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,275
Scott: then I open the feed the app and the feed the app we Rss reading thing.

53
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:21,640
Scott: it doesn't.

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,483
Scott: it just doesn't load.

55
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,189
Scott: It's just like hangs on the top screen.

56
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,208
Scott: I'm like huh What's up with that?

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,549
Scott: Yeah I said just start searching Twitter And I search for feed Lee on Twitter and someone's like feed Lee is down.

58
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:36,450
Scott: Then I found one of those websites where people report you know put in manual reports of sites being down.

59
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:41,249
Rym: Yeah Usually I use I type the name of a site on Twitter and be like see if our people are complaining about right.

60
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:47,530
Scott: and this Is that they like aggregate user reports of sites being down and show little graphs of like how many reports there are and there?

61
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,996
Scott: Several sites with spikes.

62
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,587
Scott: I noticed discord was one of them, so I open up this.

63
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,033
Scott: Gordon sure enough It doesn't fucking work.

64
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,499
Scott: Yeah, and I'm like well.

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,190
Scott: I think there is a larger internet problem here.

66
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,329
Scott: That is what my spidey sense tells me.

67
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:14,129
Rym: Yeah and probably some sort of issue with the Internet at large or a large provider like maybe Oz or something like that and for reasons I won't get into but I Was well aware of this because of the nature of my work.

68
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:22,908
Scott: Yeah as soon as I woke up this morning at like 7 I found this I saw things were wrong, and I guessed exactly right within like 10 minutes.

69
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,716
Rym: yep So this article will talk about the details of what happened And it's pretty funny actually right.

70
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:38,141
Scott: so the long and short of it this article is written by someone at Cloudflare Not the hugest fan of Cloudflare although I do use a small number of their things because

71
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:43,813
Rym: I'm a fan of some aspects of Cloudflare like They do good load balancing stuff And they do good like they

72
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:47,407
Scott: have smart people working there and a lot of their technology is legit.

73
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,376
Rym: the problem is one They won't ban Nazis from using their platform.

74
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:54,147
Scott: I thought they slightly did once yeah, but not completely yeah.

75
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,337
Scott: and two Some of the things.

76
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:05,290
Rym: one service they offer them some of the features They offer which granted should only be used by people who already cannot solve their own technology problems kind of defeat the purpose of TLS.

77
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:19,109
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so Regardless this article is written by someone who works at Cloudflare who is obviously a very smart internet engineer Who was able to figure out what was wrong and started calling up the other networks to get things straight.

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,390
Scott: now?

79
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,733
Rym: It's cool.

80
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:19,834
Rym: Is?

81
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:25,587
Rym: this is the kind of problem I went to school to learn how to solve like I learned about this shit at RIT.

82
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,430
Scott: you couldn't have solved it.

83
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,557
Scott: You're not as good as Tom Whatever his last name is pronounced.

84
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:33,990
Rym: I don't know leaked routes are not uncommon inside of corporate network.

85
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:41,770
Scott: Anyway, here's what is what happened in somewhat non-detailed terms because I don't I also did not learn the complete details of BGP.

86
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:54,899
Rym: Right and also to be clear I can talk a big game But I knew well I knew the ins and outs of BGP and excruciating detail, and you don't know any as of 2003 when I took classes on it specifically.

87
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:55,922
Scott: so anyway here's the situation.

88
00:05:55,942 --> 00:06:07,615
Scott: you have the a couple networks right small time networks But still networks on the internet meaning like 10 11 20 dot 0 slash something Network and they have routers.

89
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:15,489
Scott: and those routers you know are routing the traffic of those networks users But also routing other traffic because that's how the internet fucking works.

90
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,590
Rym: now How does the router know where to route a particular packet?

91
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,612
Scott: It's got it.

92
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,941
Scott: just has as this IP addresses go that way.

93
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:25,316
Rym: that is something called a routing T's IP Addresses go that way.

94
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:28,953
Rym: in the old days of the internet our router would literally have Basically a text file.

95
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:34,126
Rym: that said if the IP starts with four send it on this pipe right.

96
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,880
Scott: say it starts with seven Send it on to detail for a news here.

97
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,165
Scott: It's not the whole it's not the main bit.

98
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,089
Scott: save it for the main bit.

99
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:50,136
Scott: Anyway, the point is these tiny networks they fucked the fuck up and they advertised basically putting up street signs that said hey Packets headed for these IP addresses.

100
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:52,261
Scott: This is the fastest way over here.

101
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:55,790
Scott: now those messages were supposed to stay within their network.

102
00:06:56,171 --> 00:07:04,136
Scott: You know those road signs were only for the packets in their network zones because if packets were say in some other network That wasn't the fastest way.

103
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:06,869
Scott: go the fastest way was not through the tiny network.

104
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,985
Scott: Yep the fastest way was through the big networks on the internet until you get somewhere on the other side.

105
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:21,835
Rym: imagine if in your subdivision you had like a bunch of private roads and You put up a little sign inside of your subdivision that says hey to get to the freeway Go this way.

106
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:27,175
Rym: and then someone picked up that sign went out to a different freeway And just stuck it there.

107
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:33,538
Scott: and now people from like a major road are going through your subdivision To get to the freeway because they think that's the way.

108
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:33,919
Scott: Yep.

109
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,966
Rym: That's that's the best way to analogize this.

110
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:52,750
Scott: anyway, so This person for Cloudflare, you know Clearly the people at the small networks did fuck up, but the person who wrote this article Hilariously and perhaps truthfully didn't put too much blame on those tiny networks because they're tiny.

111
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,177
Scott: It's like they should.

112
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:54,518
Scott: you know.

113
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,845
Scott: should they have known better?

114
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:56,608
Scott: maybe?

115
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:03,910
Rym: Well like here's the case in point a freeway has very like the size difficult to put up a fake freeway sign.

116
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,547
Rym: That's convincing.

117
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:17,818
Rym: So if a bunch of drivers see like my hand-painted sign and believe it It's more their fault than anyone else, but what happened in this particular case is Verizon which is basically top of the internet.

118
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,469
Scott: Yeah, right in terms of network like it or not, right?

119
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:30,810
Scott: They Also fucked up and if they had not fucked up These small networks fucking up would not have fucked up the entire internet.

120
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,282
Scott: So this person at Cloudflare puts all the blame on Verizon plus.

121
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:43,529
Scott: it seemed that they were mad that Verizon didn't return their phone Call but luckily one of the smaller networks did return their phone call and fix the problem and saved the internet.

122
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:50,109
Scott: There was like basically 15% of the internet was like fucked for some time this morning at least like an hour.

123
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,342
Rym: There's two like important things going on about this story because again We don't want to get into all these details because you can read this article.

124
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,052
Rym: it goes into more detail than you're probably gonna be comfortable with.

125
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,299
Rym: but the two points that come out are that one.

126
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:07,146
Rym: the Internet's like routing infrastructure is Actually, terrifyingly fragile.

127
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:13,050
Rym: Oh, yeah Like people like to believe that the internet is this massive network that can like route around damage.

128
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:17,885
Rym: The reality is looking at it crosswise can cause it to completely fail.

129
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,650
Scott: It's really good at routing around damage.

130
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,665
Scott: It's really bad it when it says hey send things there when you just give bad directions.

131
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:31,010
Rym: a lot of the routing Protocols that are still in use to this day sort of assume that everyone's competent.

132
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:33,077
Rym: And like there's a lot of.

133
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:40,349
Scott: it's like if those like if Verizon just went down Yeah the packets would route around it and find their way to where they're going as long as they weren't trying to go to.

134
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:45,064
Rym: but if Verizon is just telling people to do the wrong thing because it listened to the wrong person.

135
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:47,050
Scott: Yep, then it's gonna fuck the fuck up.

136
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,740
Scott: Yep, everyone has bad directions.

137
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,270
Scott: Everyone's gonna go the wrong way and get lost.

138
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:50,551
Scott: You know what?

139
00:09:50,572 --> 00:10:00,034
Rym: It's like it's kind of like when you have a disaster disaster recovery situation like you got server a and server B and if server a fucks up you want to be able to route everyone to server B Like that kind of thing.

140
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:00,396
Scott: That's all.

141
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,481
Scott: that's what the Internet's great at.

142
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:08,830
Rym: Yep, but there's a reason why Most serious systems use stoneth methods to make sure that you don't get into a weird situation.

143
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:19,493
Rym: Stoneth is a hilarious acronym that stands for shoot the other node in the head Which means effectively if you're gonna fail over Fucking kill the primary node.

144
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:24,880
Rym: So there's no way it can come up in a bad or non deterministic state and cause weird problems.

145
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:35,650
Rym: So the other thing this raises is that and I'm seeing this just across Networking industries in general people like me went to school and learn this stuff.

146
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,169
Rym: But you'll notice I don't do this as a job.

147
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,909
Rym: Most people who have a degree like what I have do not do this as a job.

148
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:55,770
Rym: Most of the people who do networking as a job did not go to a university and learn like Theory of networking and all these details because anyone who goes to study computers doesn't say I want to be a network engineer.

149
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:56,493
Rym: I did.

150
00:10:56,613 --> 00:11:02,389
Rym: I thought I wanted to be a network engineer and I learned how to be an extremely skilled network engineer And that doesn't pay shit.

151
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,919
Rym: So I never took it as a job.

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,429
Scott: the people who run the internet be paid a lot.

153
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:15,486
Scott: You'd think that like if you're if you're that guy cloud player Tom Sticks should be getting paid big bunnies, you know, we you'd think teachers would get paid a lot.

154
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,490
Scott: Well, that's it like.

155
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:26,757
Rym: But the people who know the most about networking theory are not the people actually doing the day-to-day networking jobs in the world as a whole.

156
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:35,110
Rym: and I feel like this is only getting worse like I'm finding just in my professional life that People entering the industry as a whole doesn't matter.

157
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:47,048
Rym: Any technology industry know less and less about how the internet actually works and they have more and more focused knowledge on how to write JavaScript and They don't understand what a subnet mask is.

158
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:55,550
Rym: or they know like Babies first like they know what a subnet mask is and have no idea what cider is because some of that mass are fucking obsolete.

159
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,470
Rym: And if you think subnet masks are how the internet works, you're wrong.

160
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,458
Scott: But they're not how the internet works, but they are how your little end might work in your house.

161
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,702
Rym: Yeah, I Even ran.

162
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:15,118
Rym: I ran into multiple professionals in recent memory who were really confused when some 172 dot something IP addresses were flagged as internal.

163
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,186
Rym: they were like How do you know these are internal?

164
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:19,014
Rym: and I hit my forehead so hard.

165
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,600
Scott: people heard it begin with 172.

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,305
Scott: Yeah, is that a good reason?

167
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:27,120
Rym: They they thought it was the I know 192 dot something because they were already wrong about that.

168
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,945
Scott: You've never seen 172 Three.

169
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:34,910
Rym: those are only three, uh So Scott your knowledge is out of date.

170
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:35,634
Rym: There's another one.

171
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:36,598
Rym: There are more.

172
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:39,604
Scott: Some of them are new.

173
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:42,595
Scott: I've never seen any more than those three one of them and all my life.

174
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:43,940
Rym: Uh, there are more.

175
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,730
Rym: Okay, there I will pull some up as examples.

176
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,139
Rym: Yeah, but basically I guess you own some IP.

177
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,020
Rym: then These are ranges that are either reserved for nonsense like, you know about multicast like that's a reserve whatever.

178
00:12:56,882 --> 00:13:01,064
Rym: And you know, there's this class II like special reserve nonsense Even though clad.

179
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,417
Rym: there aren't classes anymore because of classes that remain routing or cider.

180
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,600
Rym: but There are ranges that are defined for like carrier grade net.

181
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:10,282
Rym: like.

182
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:17,804
Rym: these are the ranges that are used for the netting that ISPs do as opposed to the I. the netting that like this thing does Is router over here.

183
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:25,899
Rym: and there are other ranges like slash 31 subnets, which if you do the math Involves zero hosts like it's just a network.

184
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:33,320
Rym: Those are used between big routers so they can negotiate their own crap without needing like real IPs to be wasted.

185
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:43,819
Rym: So there are other ranges and it gets complicated and no one learns this stuff unless they go to university for it And most people don't as professors of the university who know it.

186
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:53,170
Rym: Yeah And none of those people end up entering the workforce to be like the person who actually Configures the routers at a company.

187
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,300
Scott: isn't that like Cisco certified whatever supposed to teach you?

188
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,880
Rym: Yeah And in my experience Cisco people know a lot about how Cisco works and they don't know isn't that also how the internet works?

189
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,407
Rym: Yeah, but there's also there's all.

190
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,359
Rym: there's non Cisco technology out there.

191
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:08,860
Rym: GP is a generic

192
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:23,740
Scott: Understand that even if you understand how to configure a Cisco router You should also night by you know Association understand the core concepts of writing Learn how to use a different route or you should still understand the concept, you know what it's like need to learn a new syntax.

193
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:29,860
Rym: It's like the difference between the people who know how to code in several languages versus the people who actually learn computer science.

194
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:31,759
Rym: It's that kind of situation.

195
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,460
Rym: So you can read this article to learn the details.

196
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,780
Rym: But really though the main point is that first fucked up this morning and this particular kind of fuck-up happens all the time.

197
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:50,860
Scott: This one was just a particularly Than usual one Yeah, but how many times for example right does a tiny network fuck up in this way?

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,100
Scott: But the bigger network isn't Verizon and thus we are shielded from its arms.

199
00:14:55,287 --> 00:15:09,340
Rym: Yep like if you really want to see like how this stuff can go wrong run wireshark on like your home network and you're gonna see a Lot of fucked up broken shit even on your own tiny internal network that if it leaked out to the world could cause problems.

200
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:14,576
Rym: You'll see weird stuff like V lands getting appended to package that shouldn't be there.

201
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:15,780
Rym: all sorts of nonsense.

202
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:30,718
Rym: So in some other tech news, there's a. I saw this making the rounds and I just want to address it very briefly But it's a story about how Walmart and Amazon and maybe Google want to quote see inside your house creepy.

203
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:34,915
Rym: The idea is that I'm gonna cool get out my house.

204
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:36,060
Rym: It's even worse.

205
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:49,800
Rym: I'm just gonna quote this article in home cameras and audio sensors would look at the objects in your house Create a detailed profile of your tastes and your potential desires and then serve up ads and content that fit that profile.

206
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,663
Scott: why would I do that?

207
00:15:50,924 --> 00:16:00,114
Rym: in one of the example scenarios a smart video camera sees that you have a paperback copy of The Godfather on your bedside table and then feeds that information back to a local processing hub.

208
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:05,499
Rym: that then tells you that there is a Screening of the movie based on that book today at a theater near you.

209
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:08,652
Rym: That sounds like a recipe for a literal hell.

210
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:09,657
Scott: Why would you get this?

211
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:21,809
Rym: Uh, Yeah, I get the impression that this is the final stage of surveillance capitalism that Walmart seems to be pushing this Amazon seems to be pushing.

212
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:25,600
Rym: is that getting people to opt into intense analytics?

213
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,327
Scott: Oh, what's the benefit for you?

214
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:27,950
Rym: Nothing?

215
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:29,379
Scott: So why would you do it?

216
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,583
Scott: Well, because the better for you is either they will be still up for all the shit in the world They still not.

217
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,810
Scott: don't live in a society where this can be forced to Scott.

218
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,500
Rym: What is the benefit to anyone of seeing an ad?

219
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:48,240
Rym: I Mean, you know you are paying by seeing the ad in order to get access to quote unquote free sir, right?

220
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,447
Scott: But here what are you getting access to?

221
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,379
Scott: You're not even getting access to like a crappy TV show.

222
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,678
Rym: Yeah, so, you know what I feel is gonna actually happen with this.

223
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,589
Rym: most people don't understand how any of this stuff works and they'll get.

224
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:11,280
Rym: they're gonna have a smart TV and like two Amazon echoes and a Bunch of nest cameras like all around their house and They're gonna click through agreements and Google and Amazon and companies are just gonna mind that data and start targeting ads based on that.

225
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:16,579
Rym: Okay, I think it's gonna happen to normal people without their consent and it's not gonna happen to people like us.

226
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:36,822
Rym: I even saw someone we know recently on Twitter say that they jokingly said Amazon changed the channel on their TV and they don't have an Amazon device and the TV change channel anyway Mm-hmm, and then they discovered that they had a smart remote that they didn't realize actually had Amazon integration and they just never looked at It.

227
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:37,491
Scott: Mm-hmm.

228
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,088
Rym: So this is just a terrifying future that we need to.

229
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,287
Rym: if you're listening to GeekNights, you can protect yourself from this and Godspeed to your grandparents.

230
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:50,705
Scott: I did see something that people would think is creepy But actually isn't?

231
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:59,215
Scott: someone in our forum, which you should come and join Received a package because they bought something on Amazon and then there was a photo.

232
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:03,565
Scott: Amazon sent them a photo of The package on their doorstep.

233
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,033
Scott: I like that and they were like, whoa, that's creepy.

234
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,300
Scott: And I'm like that is actually not creepy.

235
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,629
Scott: It's a picture of the outside of my house.

236
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:11,279
Scott: That's a picture of the outside of your house.

237
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,150
Scott: We have no expectation of privacy.

238
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:14,719
Scott: anyone driving by can see that.

239
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,132
Scott: It's a picture of the same thing the delivery person saw.

240
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,020
Scott: they're not seeing anything not creeping in your window.

241
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,340
Scott: They didn't open your house they didn't come inside.

242
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,800
Scott: So now if I come delivering a package that you bought and end they're confirming with that photo that a was delivered.

243
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,291
Scott: B you can see in the photo if that's your house.

244
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,300
Scott: if it's not your house, you know, they deliver the wrong place.

245
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,872
Scott: Yep, if it was maybe stolen or moved, you know, aha.

246
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:39,080
Scott: Here's a photo of that package in that spot.

247
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,439
Scott: I don't need to go hunting for it.

248
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,883
Scott: You know that.

249
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:43,220
Scott: I know it was stolen by someone cuz I came home.

250
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:45,851
Scott: I have a photo from when it was there and it's not there now.

251
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:46,735
Rym: and I know the dance.

252
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:47,679
Rym: you have a delivery.

253
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:51,980
Rym: your Web the website says it was delivered and you didn't see it on your doorstep.

254
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:53,768
Rym: Well, what happened to it?

255
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,500
Rym: Like there's a song and dance you got to go through before you realize it was right.

256
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,020
Scott: Did they bring it to the wrong place?

257
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,364
Scott: Was it actually not delivered?

258
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:03,320
Scott: and maybe it's still at the post office and the post office just marked it as delivered because they're jerks.

259
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,185
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

260
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:08,084
Scott: but if there's a photo like that That's perfectly not privacy.

261
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:16,199
Scott: invading data collecting photo of the outside of your home of a package and whatever a public stuff That's actually pretty great.

262
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:25,668
Rym: Yeah Now if it's a picture of me sleeping in my bed that says we missed you didn't want to wake you up left the package On your doorstop, that would be creepy.

263
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:26,110
Rym: That's no.

264
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,254
Rym: that is now what's happening.

265
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:27,575
Rym: No.

266
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,157
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:29,060
Scott: I thought that was okay.

268
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:30,051
Rym: Yeah, I was 100% okay with that.

269
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:41,400
Rym: so last at least before we get to the main bit and actually not least at all if you happen to live in New York City and More importantly if you happen to live in Queens, I don't know who's running in any.

270
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:51,060
Scott: I don't know what primaries are in any of the buries I don't know any other primary in any other borough or any other Kind of big one going on in Brooklyn - but I think it's only one part of Brooklyn.

271
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:52,719
Rym: I don't live there, so I'm ignoring it.

272
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,034
Rym: I got too much to pay attention to but Queens actually has a really important primary right.

273
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,458
Rym: queen is tomorrow the 25th, right?

274
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,312
Scott: So Queens if you don't know is the most Diverse urban place in the entire United States.

275
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,540
Rym: perhaps world like Queens is a great place.

276
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:17,872
Scott: Two million people over two million people here and the DA of Queens has been the same person for a hell of Fucking long time some crusty old dude.

277
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:19,540
Scott: and he done.

278
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,800
Scott: And now we have to vote for the next DA.

279
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,281
Scott: Whoever is.

280
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:35,077
Scott: the Democratic nominee for DA has like a ninety nine point nine percent chance to win in the general election Which means the election tomorrow is the real election where there are like many several choices to choose from.

281
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:40,080
Rym: so point number one If you live in New York City, I don't care what your politics are.

282
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:40,682
Rym: I don't care.

283
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:46,179
Rym: if you hate the Democratic Party you have to join the Democratic Party because otherwise you can't vote in the primaries.

284
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,846
Scott: and the Best you live in Staten Island.

285
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:49,977
Rym: Yeah, if you live in Staten Island get the fuck out.

286
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:50,460
Scott: That's right.

287
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,217
Scott: But uh or stay the fuck there you piece of shit.

288
00:20:53,338 --> 00:21:01,800
Rym: Yeah, I Just remember seeing this stag years ago that Staten Island generates more trash both per capita and in total volume than any other borough.

289
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:03,553
Scott: I mean it is trash.

290
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:08,389
Rym: Yeah But Just self-replicating like Staten Island.

291
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,036
Rym: It's weird because culturally it's nothing to do with New York City.

292
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,640
Rym: It's like isolated and separate.

293
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:18,102
Rym: It's New Jersey, but it counts as New York for some stupid reason I don't know.

294
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,004
Rym: I feel like we should give it to New Jersey and just let Yonkers be the sixth borough They can have.

295
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,638
Rym: Yonkers is way more, New York.

296
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,415
Rym: Yonkers is basically just Bronx - yeah.

297
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:38,478
Rym: So anyway, uh, if you can't vote in the primary for the Democrats you literally can't vote like nothing matters The primaries all that matters - people tend not to vote in primaries because they don't pay attention.

298
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:39,240
Rym: It's tomorrow.

299
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:40,660
Scott: Yes, I looked up the ballot.

300
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,121
Scott: There's some.

301
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:45,756
Scott: there's a choice of three judges and you must choose the rejudge.

302
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:46,940
Rym: two of them are Democrats.

303
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,127
Rym: One of them is a Republican.

304
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,460
Rym: I'm only voting for the two Democrats and you do that.

305
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,428
Rym: Yeah, okay, you can just choose.

306
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,296
Rym: you can just not vote for a third one.

307
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:55,320
Rym: It's up to three.

308
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,928
Scott: Okay, they're gonna avoid my ballot.

309
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:57,289
Rym: I'm gonna.

310
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,480
Rym: I know you could write in a third person.

311
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:19,660
Scott: The real election is choosing the DA and the person you should choose is Tiffany Kavan Apparently a. I decided way at the beginning when like months ago I looked at all the people and I said up this Tiffany person is clear that the best person you have a public defendant As the D a public defender as the DA

312
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,869
Rym: Prosecutor because there's a prosecutor running - yeah

313
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,591
Scott: anyway.

314
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:30,135
Scott: and Melinda Katz is currently the borough president is running But I've met her several times and she is annoying and fake.

315
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:36,700
Rym: also Elizabeth Warren who GeekNights has endorsed for the presidency of the United States has endorsed Tiffany Kavan.

316
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,219
Rym: So is Bernie Sanders?

317
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,950
Rym: So has AOC so the.

318
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,457
Rym: so has Cynthia Nixon.

319
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:47,271
Scott: the Bar Association of Queens said that she is not qualified.

320
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,455
Scott: the Bar Association.

321
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:50,320
Scott: That is a bunch of old white dudes.

322
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,728
Scott: So that's basically a certified staff of approval.

323
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,103
Scott: So white old guys say your bad must be good Even better.

324
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:03,060
Rym: New York Post which is a fucking rag has this to say Tiffany Kavan would turn Queens to a giant brothel.

325
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:04,487
Scott: That sounds great.

326
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:05,030
Rym: Let's go.

327
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,955
Rym: That's all right.

328
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:10,464
Scott: Let's get rid of Now the thing is.

329
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:24,834
Scott: the only negative thing I can say about our friend Tiffany is that her campaign is Annoying as they've knocked on my door, which is illegal because I live in an apartment Money's long ago before her campaign was even doing anything and give someone money.

330
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:26,459
Scott: that usually says hey, I'm voting for you.

331
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:28,819
Scott: Why are you knocking on my door?

332
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,111
Scott: Mailing me shit in the mail Emailing me texting me.

333
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,719
Scott: It's like back the fuck off.

334
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,708
Scott: You're gonna make me want to not vote for you.

335
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:43,720
Scott: if there was another candidate who was even close to progressive I would have switched simply because your campaign is so fucking annoying.

336
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,686
Scott: But here's the problem.

337
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,391
Scott: there is not.

338
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:48,647
Scott: all the other candidates are garbage But also at least relative guard.

339
00:23:48,687 --> 00:24:01,180
Rym: the fact is you and I and hopefully the GeekNights listener Care enough about politics to where we're gonna vote for the right people But the average common clay of the new west they vote based on.

340
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:09,080
Rym: I don't know when like knocking on doors and bothering people is more effective than anything I knock on the door of the person who is already voting for you.

341
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,315
Scott: Please knock on the door of the cranky old person down the street, you know, we need Scott.

342
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:14,540
Rym: It's a modern Passover.

343
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:16,947
Rym: We just need to all agree.

344
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:21,119
Rym: There's a thing you put on your door that says listen, I know what's up.

345
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:23,026
Rym: I'll bother my racist neighbors.

346
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,660
Scott: I put up like one of those I guess and you know, we can't do those lawn things.

347
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:29,940
Scott: Yeah, they have in the suburbs with the two sticks, right?

348
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,480
Rym: I just need to put a little sign on my door that I'm voting for the most progressive candidate.

349
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,611
Rym: I already gave money.

350
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:36,520
Rym: leave me alone, right?

351
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,831
Scott: It's like if I just put a caban sign on my door.

352
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,480
Rym: some lambsblood just get some lambs.

353
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:43,595
Scott: The problem is they rang the thing at the front of the building.

354
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,549
Rym: Oh See that the difference is my building.

355
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,176
Rym: if you don't live here, you can't come in.

356
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,989
Scott: Mmm We have a doorman and such into mine either.

357
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,451
Scott: You need someone.

358
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:53,400
Rym: Yeah, they got into my building.

359
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,356
Scott: They've been knocking on the door like well, then you could put a caban sign on your door.

360
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,400
Scott: exactly wouldn't knock.

361
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,260
Rym: They'd be like, okay But the reality is the only way to get the common clay of the new west to vote is to bother them and trick them.

362
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:05,644
Scott: Right.

363
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,219
Scott: Just don't bother the person who's already voting.

364
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:10,352
Rym: Yeah, but bothering us is it's not like I'm gonna be like.

365
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,259
Rym: well fucking I'm voting for a Republican now.

366
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,508
Scott: Well, but you could vote for like.

367
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,837
Scott: less accurate basically is a Republican?

368
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:34,020
Rym: yeah, right Yeah, like I'm gonna vote for anyone but Tiffany cabana seriously The only the one good thing is that other than the pseudo Republican running and the fake one All all of them really saying the right things like they're going really far left and progressive.

369
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:45,526
Scott: Well, there was the Lankman guy who was the most the second most progressive candidate, but then he basically bailed out and endorsed The fake one Like.

370
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,411
Scott: wait a minute, but that makes no sense clear.

371
00:25:47,431 --> 00:26:02,959
Rym: There's some backroom shenanigans going on, but seriously Like wherever you live I don't care if it's like the dumpiest primary like you have to vote at all these weird little Elections because that has way more effect on your actual as people vote in them.

372
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:12,480
Rym: Yeah, so your vote matters way more dude you vote in some of these off your elections like You'll be like literally the ninth person to vote in your whole district.

373
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,588
Scott: I know other countries have way better general elections than we do.

374
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:16,791
Scott: do those other cut like.

375
00:26:16,831 --> 00:26:21,872
Scott: are there primaries in like, you know, Spain it parties don't.

376
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,120
Rym: American parties are pretty unique in how we work, right?

377
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,381
Scott: It's like.

378
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:28,211
Scott: do they have extra tiny elections in these other countries?

379
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,159
Scott: or is it just the one and that's it?

380
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,491
Rym: Yeah, most.

381
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:34,789
Rym: I mean You're thinking of our parliamentary systems.

382
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,255
Scott: Yeah, but wouldn't they still have to?

383
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:41,135
Scott: it's like, okay We're gonna have someone from our district go to Parliament and there's like what they got.

384
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,440
Scott: I guess thing in UK.

385
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,547
Scott: It's what Tories and labor.

386
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:49,940
Scott: well Scott, but like you got to choose the labor It's gotten in the Tory person, but no like you don't vote for who's gonna be Prime Minister.

387
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:51,366
Rym: The party decides on their own.

388
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:54,480
Rym: you just vote for the local rep who will then give that party more power.

389
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:57,539
Scott: But I'm the coalition is like three people who want to be the local rep.

390
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,307
Scott: Yeah, I don't know that work.

391
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,300
Scott: They got to have another a smaller election, right?

392
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,646
Rym: Yeah, I have no idea how that works.

393
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:12,000
Rym: or they just compete in the general against each other and Depending on how dire 2020s look and I'm gonna have to learn how Australia Germany in the UK actually do those elections.

394
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:13,758
Rym: I'm gonna have to make a decision about that.

395
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:30,260
Rym: but anyway, it's time for things of the day, so If you didn't see it yet, it's only like five like it's a really short.

396
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,239
Rym: It's like five episodes long, but that HBO series Chernobyl is crazy.

397
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,100
Scott: Good Yeah, I watched a nonfiction documentary in middle or high school.

398
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,580
Scott: I don't feel like I need to watch a fictionalized documentary.

399
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:42,523
Rym: So it's.

400
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:52,900
Rym: it's only fictionalized in the sense that it's like obviously dramatized like detailed events But it doesn't follow the typical like so-called plot of those kinds of dramatized documentaries.

401
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:58,535
Scott: Well, I mean they can't really divert from the plot too much Yeah, but also like a lot of the retone saved it.

402
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,319
Scott: it was a cool guys.

403
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,540
Rym: Here's the big difference.

404
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:08,548
Rym: most of those documentaries are like long and Boring and like Lead up to the accident.

405
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,280
Rym: and then there's the episode about the accident and then they do the aftermath.

406
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:24,635
Rym: This one literally just starts in the actual control room, which you can see pictures of like tourists go to see it and It starts with like the people sitting there covered with like a lead dome or whatever.

407
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:26,380
Rym: The control room is not the reactor.

408
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:30,619
Rym: Also, you realize the other Chernobyl reactors kept running until recently.

409
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:33,430
Scott: Yeah, but they weren't like they were.

410
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:34,796
Scott: you know, they're like a mile away.

411
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:35,740
Rym: no, they're next door.

412
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:38,311
Scott: I thought they were in like, you know, it's a big area of emptiness.

413
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:39,817
Scott: No, they got shit tons of land.

414
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,758
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I remember seeing a photo where there was like one reactor and a bunch of land and then another one.

415
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:47,299
Rym: Go look at the photos that complex.

416
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:53,480
Rym: They build the sarcophagus partly to protect the people who are working like next door at the other reactors that were still.

417
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,760
Scott: Remember seeing guys like hanging out in the parking lot showing you like here's how much radiation is still hanging out in the parking.

418
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,542
Scott: There's like no one.

419
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:00,485
Scott: there was like all deserted.

420
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,494
Rym: Yeah, because right next door people are just working.

421
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:05,079
Scott: Mmm the parking lot.

422
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:14,930
Scott: No cars Yeah Anyway, it looked like a deserted area and they were like, ooh We're going here to you know to see how much radiations left after all these.

423
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:24,640
Rym: the documentary is really good because it really focuses on Sort of the reality of what happens and the real like what like how it affected the actual people who live there.

424
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:25,844
Rym: And it's really good.

425
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:33,878
Rym: and the only part that we're sort of over dramatized was the last episode which is sort of the like Court case that went through what happened right in court.

426
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,178
Rym: it Condensed the events of how the world found out about these flaws in the react Soviet court.

427
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:52,700
Rym: Yeah But this video my thing of the day is a vlog brothers video that because there's this point in the documentary Dramatized and the point gets spread widely.

428
00:29:53,021 --> 00:30:04,089
Rym: But people always talk about the graphite tips at the bottom of the control rods that cause the scram button to fail Which is technically true But it's a little bit misleading.

429
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:15,540
Rym: So this video in about 13 minutes Explains in detail what those graphite tips in the control rods Actually did and it's a little more nuanced.

430
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:27,995
Scott: Also, I just want to you know, take this occasion to remind everyone who might not have you know large, you know knowledge of disasters Chernobyl was the worst human-made disaster in history.

431
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:29,179
Rym: No wasn't I think.

432
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,064
Scott: so What's no?

433
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,519
Rym: first of all unless you count World War two, okay?

434
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,049
Scott: We're talking about disasters which were not wars.

435
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,233
Scott: Yeah, we're just like.

436
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:38,080
Rym: not natural disasters either, right?

437
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,580
Scott: No, not natural disasters by humans directly like a factory exploding or something.

438
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,087
Rym: Bhopal is pretty bad right.

439
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:51,780
Scott: this Bhopal gas disaster is way worse than Chernobyl But that's debatable because Chernobyl affected a huge number of people.

440
00:30:52,767 --> 00:31:05,180
Rym: The number of people who were killed This is like talking about a mass shooting like yes only eight people were killed But the 40 people who were injured but survived their lives are drastically changed regardless.

441
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,229
Scott: Both of those are dwarfed by.

442
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:09,272
Scott: I forget the name of it.

443
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,338
Scott: There was a dam in China.

444
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:20,118
Scott: That was And flooded and killed like some ridiculous number of people in a giant flood and flooded an enormous area.

445
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:23,408
Scott: this hide This what it's called hydroelectric dam.

446
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:24,492
Scott: I forget the name of it.

447
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,740
Scott: Look for Chinese hydroelectric dam.

448
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:31,926
Rym: There's actually a Russian dam that killed Directly more people than Chernobyl.

449
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:36,340
Scott: I have never read a story about anything nearly as bad as what happened with the fucking dam.

450
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,444
Rym: There's a Russian dam that was pretty close where they messed up Started free flooring.

451
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:49,870
Scott: so I bring it up simply because I would like to say hey people who have brought attention to Chernobyl with your Documentary, please make further well fictionalized documentary.

452
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:53,060
Scott: Please make one about Bhopal gas disaster and Chinese dam.

453
00:31:53,654 --> 00:32:04,980
Rym: Yeah I think they should because a lot of people are paying attention because the Chernobyl documentary is please make people more scared of things that Are scarier than nuclear power, but the thing is if you watch Chernobyl, it's not saying nuclear power is scary.

454
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,685
Scott: No, that's fine.

455
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:06,975
Scott: But it's actually really nuanced.

456
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:09,894
Scott: You know what it says But people we won't even see it.

457
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:10,820
Scott: people still get scared.

458
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:18,959
Rym: Yeah But if you watch it It's crazy because what it really puts a fine point on is Other than the fact that the bookshelf behind the guy in this video is almost identical to your bookshelf.

459
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:20,324
Scott: No, not really.

460
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:22,712
Rym: I see I see a couple of overlaps.

461
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,635
Rym: You don't have I see.

462
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:24,920
Scott: I think that looks like Sandman there.

463
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,904
Scott: Which is you watchman hanging?

464
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:27,128
Scott: I don't have Sandman.

465
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,156
Scott: Yeah, I read someone else's Sandman.

466
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,200
Rym: Oh wait, I see wool here.

467
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:31,786
Scott: I don't have a wool anymore.

468
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:33,070
Rym: Yeah, I got rid all my wools.

469
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:35,560
Rym: I found I had three fucking copies of wool.

470
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:36,569
Scott: Luigi.

471
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:37,600
Rym: he does have a Luigi.

472
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:46,040
Rym: But anyway, it points out that even with all the ridiculous like safety problems and poor design of the reactor.

473
00:32:46,840 --> 00:33:01,399
Rym: Chernobyl still wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the fact that the people who made the decisions moment by moment Arrogant, not just arrogant It's they made like eight decisions in a row all of which you had to choose the worst possible option.

474
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,925
Scott: Alarm is going off.

475
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:07,460
Scott: ignore disabled right not do with it, right?

476
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,633
Scott: Yeah, like a power plant and one on one warning is going off.

477
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:12,160
Scott: I'm like shut it down till we fix that.

478
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:13,926
Rym: Yeah, the problem was at the end.

479
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:16,975
Rym: pull out them rods at the end that well don't pull them out.

480
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:19,607
Rym: fuck Scott Do you know what a control rod does?

481
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:21,518
Rym: pulling it out as the worst possible thing to do?

482
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,444
Scott: I'm not a nuclear engineer.

483
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:25,233
Scott: putting the rods go in and out.

484
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:29,860
Rym: control rods Reduce the reactivity in the reactor.

485
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:32,370
Rym: They slow down the reaction.

486
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,980
Rym: pulling them out speeds the reaction up.

487
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,870
Scott: I thought the rods were the plutonium and you put more you put in.

488
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:41,586
Rym: those are the fuel rods not the control rods Fuel rods.

489
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:42,511
Rym: you just pull in and out.

490
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,883
Rym: the fuel rods are in there Semi-permanently.

491
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:59,334
Rym: unless you're looking at the scariest nuclear reactor in history the windscale reactor Which was air-cooled and you just use tubes and just like pushed hunks of nuclear material through it Like this like with your hands like with coal.

492
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:04,273
Rym: Yeah on a shovel The windscale reactor is far scarier and it also had a shitty disaster.

493
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:05,557
Scott: I could see why.

494
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:14,100
Rym: yeah but this video is good because basically it explains like the actual full technical details of that.

495
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,591
Rym: Graphite tipped control rods point in there in the like.

496
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:20,638
Rym: it explains this in interesting detail.

497
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,239
Rym: You should watch it.

498
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,344
Rym: So what you think of the day?

499
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:26,880
Scott: so I was just going on Twitter and I came across a funny little four panel comic.

500
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:28,989
Scott: And then I looked into that the funny.

501
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,033
Scott: I had never seen this.

502
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,974
Scott: we did a whole episode of Twitter comics Yeah, and this one was not mentioned at all.

503
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:34,940
Scott: This one would have been perfect.

504
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,777
Scott: I'd never seen it before and I it was a really it was above well above par funny little four panel comic.

505
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:48,791
Scott: and then I clicked on the account that it came from to say hey there any other funny four panel comics and There were so many and they were all so good.

506
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:54,518
Rym: mousetrap is the first one I saw four days ago And that's the one where I thought oh, wow, that's really good and I didn't follow up on it.

507
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,340
Scott: Yep So yeah.

508
00:34:55,661 --> 00:35:00,152
Scott: So the account the whole owner of this account is someone named Mikey Heller.

509
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:16,242
Scott: the Twitter name is yo-yo robot And this person Mikey is actually the lead writer on a Cartoon Network Cartoon called we bear bear which is adorable which I have not seen but have seen screenshots of Scott.

510
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,044
Rym: I will send you a link to.

511
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:20,034
Rym: just well, you just have to watch the initial D parody one.

512
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:32,977
Scott: Anyway, uh And apparently that in addition to being the lead writer for an actual running cartoon on Cartoon Network This person also makes little four panel comics that are a plus tier like a new.

513
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:38,680
Scott: follow Mikey Heller on Twitter and you will gain much joy.

514
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:40,688
Rym: The Isaac Newton one is too real.

515
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:41,953
Scott: Isaac Newton one is so good.

516
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:44,847
Rym: The vacuum one is like Rym style here Only the recent ones.

517
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:47,663
Scott: It's like I feel like I want to scroll all the way back But it's too much.

518
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:48,687
Rym: every one of them is great.

519
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:52,282
Scott: the I hope he makes a book so I can just buy it instead of Scrolling.

520
00:35:52,343 --> 00:35:55,280
Rym: the one that is the most too real is the one just titled mousetrap.

521
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,866
Scott: Maybe does have a book and I could buy it.

522
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:57,268
Rym: Yeah.

523
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:06,140
Rym: Anyway, it's uh in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book Which we just did was Troy Dennings pages of pain, but I've done it.

524
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:09,140
Rym: It is done If you want to read this book.

525
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,014
Rym: You can then know everything we have to say about this book.

526
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:14,710
Rym: is it is on our website Reviewed in full.

527
00:36:15,152 --> 00:36:26,509
Scott: the next book club book Which I should put a reminder to update the website is the first novel ever written in human history The tale of Genji, you should check that out.

528
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,717
Rym: It's gonna let you wield multiple weapons attack multiple times.

529
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:33,928
Scott: Make sure you buy the particular whatever.

530
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,115
Scott: Royale Translation is the penguin deluxe unabridged edition.

531
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,360
Scott: Don't buy any other edition.

532
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,327
Rym: Got a link to the good one kind of like how if you ever read the count of Monte Cristo There's this one penguin translation.

533
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:45,351
Rym: read that one.

534
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,354
Rym: Not the old one sadly.

535
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:49,970
Scott: We do not have a new Emily Wilson translation.

536
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,296
Scott: She doesn't know of Japanese.

537
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,260
Scott: I imagine Emily will.

538
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,860
Rym: She knows Greece more than we need the Emily Wilson equivalent for Japanese literature.

539
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:09,260
Scott: All right Maybe there is one but that person's original language is like French and maybe the French people Have like an Emily Wilson equivalent tale of Genji written in French, but there's no English.

540
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:10,062
Rym: It's crazy.

541
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:17,983
Scott: how even are people now translating the Emily Wilson Odyssey from English into French Spanish German Italian Whatever?

542
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,227
Rym: that would be exciting.

543
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:19,990
Scott: That's a or would.

544
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,300
Scott: there are there are there of Emily Wilson's doing it straight to from Greek.

545
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:30,180
Rym: Right, it's crazy how even in the modern world like those kinds of translation language barriers are still a big problem.

546
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:39,300
Rym: Oh, yeah, like it was only in the last couple decades that Primary sources from Japan about World War two were translated into English.

547
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,057
Rym: So English scholars would like study them and add them to the canon of World War two.

548
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:48,930
Rym: Yeah Otherwise Let's see Emily and I total aside.

549
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:50,356
Rym: We've been talking about this for all.

550
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,260
Rym: we actually launched it.

551
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:06,780
Rym: It's on the patreon now and on July 4th the first episode will go live publicly on the patreon But public you don't have to pay or anything, but we are going to review in detail Every Disney animation theatrical release in chronological order snow white starting with.

552
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:11,760
Rym: Actually, there's a theatrical release of shorts that came out before snow white and then snow white.

553
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:18,486
Rym: All right This does include victory through air power because that was released in theaters But also all the ones you can think of.

554
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:21,096
Rym: we're gonna do an episode fun and fancy free.

555
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:23,858
Scott: Yeah, hell yeah Hell yeah puppets.

556
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:25,966
Scott: In between the cartoons

557
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:40,920
Rym: we're figuring out we have a list and we're paring it down because we're not gonna do Pixar We're not gonna do like the goofy movie but this will be interesting because We're gonna talk about them before we rewatch them and then watch them and talk about them after we've seen them.

558
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,738
Scott: You can talk about even the ones you haven't seen ever before you realize.

559
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:50,377
Rym: yes Because I fun fact never actually saw Pocahontas or the hunchback or Hercules.

560
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:51,300
Scott: I saw Hercules.

561
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,123
Scott: I didn't see the other two.

562
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:53,468
Rym: Yeah, Pocahontas.

563
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:59,171
Rym: I've there was the error where I was like, yeah, I'm too cool for Disney Did not see Mulan.

564
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,439
Rym: I did not see Mulan either.

565
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:04,387
Scott: Yeah, what about some live?

566
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:05,350
Scott: you're not doing live-action.

567
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,674
Scott: I'm gonna go black hole.

568
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:08,640
Rym: no, we're not doing love live-action.

569
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:12,993
Rym: We're doing like Disney animation primary theatrical releases.

570
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:16,003
Scott: No Aladdin - Aladdin - so good though.

571
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,581
Rym: I let him do is pretty good - even those.

572
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:23,918
Rym: no Robin Williams Scott, how about you and I let's just watch Aladdin - again and do a Wednesday episode on it.

573
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,772
Rym: Hey, I could watch it again.

574
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:31,948
Rym: I worry That is not as good as I remembered Because Aladdin one already.

575
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:32,812
Rym: I like it.

576
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,600
Rym: still not as good as I remembered.

577
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,795
Scott: No, you know now my adult brain sees, you know racism and sexism.

578
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:50,330
Rym: Yeah, my brain is like Meanwhile even my kid brain was like yeah hunchback.

579
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,557
Rym: this feels exploitative and Pocahontas.

580
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:53,499
Rym: I was like, what the fuck?

581
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:06,379
Scott: Yeah, really honest was the one that Was like oh At the time even at the time At the time Aladdin didn't you know do anything wrong in my brain, but Pocahontas sure did.

582
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,764
Rym: Yeah, it was.

583
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:13,702
Rym: I feel like my favorites before we go back into rewatching them other than like Zootopia and modern stuff Really?

584
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:15,506
Rym: Like I really liked a little mermaid.

585
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:20,080
Rym: I really like Beauty and the Beast and I really like the rescuers.

586
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:22,895
Rym: Remember you see both of the rescuers.

587
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:27,436
Rym: Yeah So, yeah, that'll be on the patreon and you can enjoy that.

588
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,022
Rym: starting July 4th It'll be public.

589
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:42,041
Rym: But if you're a patron of the GeekNights patreon, the first episode is already up there in a preview mode Mm-hmm, and I think we can get right into it because we have no conventions till Pax West and then conventions He's.

590
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:47,366
Rym: it starts to do so back on July 23rd 2007 12 years ago.

591
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,363
Rym: Grim is huh.

592
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:53,480
Rym: Rym and Scott of GeekNights didn't even do a full episode on this.

593
00:40:53,901 --> 00:41:00,480
Rym: We used to do these episodes called specials which basically men we couldn't be asked to do a real episode of GeekNights.

594
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,828
Scott: So we just like well, you're doing for a week.

595
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:07,546
Scott: So sometimes, you know, we need we couldn't rather than cut the whole episode out We just did the special.

596
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,679
Rym: Yeah, we did four episodes a week for a long time.

597
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:15,914
Rym: So we did a special the 10th special called computer mice.

598
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:20,828
Rym: we talked about computer mice back in 2007. we've never done like a real and two years.

599
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:21,992
Scott: We did ten specials.

600
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:26,649
Rym: Yeah, that's saying something and I got a lot of thoughts about mice.

601
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,706
Rym: So I feel like we should actually talk about Computer mice.

602
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,789
Scott: Well, I mean, you know What is it say about fucking mice?

603
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,260
Scott: you hold it you move it around you point you click.

604
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:47,488
Rym: So let's go back to you know Like classic GeekNights because the Monday episodes people liked when we kind of got into history when computers first came out They had keyboards and that was it.

605
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:48,212
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:51,931
Scott: I mean the first time I ever saw a mouse I didn't understand it and it like.

607
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,540
Scott: it took me a while to figure it out.

608
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,317
Scott: It was like some Mac 512 K and it had the mouse with a ball in it and one fucking button.

609
00:41:58,377 --> 00:42:01,659
Rym: in my elementary school There were computers and they had applications on them.

610
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:06,913
Rym: There were mice plugged into the computers But there was nothing you could use the mice with.

611
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,662
Rym: so they didn't do anything We had.

612
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:12,560
Scott: only they were like, you know, there was like a mix of computers going on, right?

613
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:24,467
Scott: so it's like only the fancier computers had the mice because they were like max but the other computers like apples that didn't have mice but and eventually like mice kind of became the standard way people interact with a computer.

614
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:37,115
Rym: and then there was an error where people tried to get away from the mouse saying it's archaic and Most of the attempts to get away from the mouse involved turning all monitors into touchscreens Which ended up being mostly fucking terrible UX.

615
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:43,571
Rym: so the mouse persevered until the tablet era and People tried to make tablets and they sucked.

616
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:44,757
Scott: until the iPad came around.

617
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:54,051
Scott: pretty much No one there was like a. there were plenty of tablets that just like ran windows on a really Low-res touchscreen with a battery that ran out in five minutes.

618
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:56,480
Scott: You had a huge bezel around the screen.

619
00:42:57,363 --> 00:43:04,163
Scott: I remember playing with them in like computer stores and yep, you know comp USA or whatever And no one bought those fucking things.

620
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:05,706
Scott: So garbage.

621
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,148
Rym: So I think we're limiting our scope here.

622
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:14,554
Rym: We were only talking about primary Tracking inputs for computers like pointing input.

623
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:16,320
Rym: So we're not talking about drawing tablets.

624
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:29,434
Scott: Well, the original mouse the way they worked the values the original consumer ones, right because there were like fancy non consumer mice Ball like an actual ball rubber ball kids will remember.

625
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,320
Rym: but that ball had two rollers inside, right?

626
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:39,631
Scott: Inside the mouse were two spinny things And when you move the mouse around The ball would roll and the ball would roll against the spinners.

627
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:52,580
Scott: and one spinner would move the mouse cursor horizontally and one vertically and thus you would when you would move the ball the mouse around into two-dimensional space those two spinners would Move the arrow around the screen.

628
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,228
Rym: This also meant if you lifted the mouse at an angle You could still move the like.

629
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,760
Rym: you could move the pointer in a very precise way.

630
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:04,796
Rym: So when I was like sniping in games I would like lift the mouse to like move a few pixels over.

631
00:44:04,836 --> 00:44:08,189
Scott: first mouse I bought for my when I built my computer.

632
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:12,062
Scott: not the first mouse ever had but the the first mouse I bought for my good Computer.

633
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,653
Scott: Yeah was like this logitech wingman gaming mouse.

634
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:15,717
Scott: It had three buttons.

635
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:18,728
Scott: Holy shit That was advanced and a big ball in.

636
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:20,695
Scott: it was still a ball underneath.

637
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:22,120
Rym: bigger balls were just better.

638
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:23,308
Scott: It was a big ball.

639
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,139
Rym: big balls were better for a lot of reasons.

640
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:32,840
Rym: Yep But like you literally would have to like every few weeks Open the mouse pull the ball out and clean all the guys off the rollers.

641
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,510
Rym: Yep, the rollers are getting covered in garbage like they got disgusting.

642
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:41,878
Scott: then eventually one day somebody came up with the idea for the scroll wheel.

643
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:49,618
Rym: My shit like forgetting the archaic era where like mice had one button and max which had one button.

644
00:44:49,638 --> 00:45:01,537
Scott: until recently I'm not a hundred percent sure about this But I was always under the impression that it was the movement from ps2 to USB That allowed for the addition of all the extra buttons.

645
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:06,835
Scott: scroll wheel I think ps2 only supported what like three buttons and two axes and most mice.

646
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,480
Scott: I could be wrong about that.

647
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,016
Rym: So yeah ps2 mice.

648
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:16,160
Rym: yet Basically, you'd have the mouse with two buttons and typically people would their index finger on the left mouse button.

649
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:17,759
Rym: They're middle finger in the red mouse button.

650
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:26,330
Rym: And then if some fancy mice had a third button in the middle like I just said yeah But those were rare usually more expensive.

651
00:45:26,651 --> 00:45:28,177
Rym: not every application would work.

652
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:28,960
Scott: It was for games.

653
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:32,056
Rym: Yeah, like gaming was really the only thing that would use it.

654
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:36,500
Rym: Yep, and That like it took me a while to even get used to having a third button.

655
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,400
Rym: Well, I started with the third button, yeah, I started with two buttons.

656
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,880
Scott: Well, I mean I started with one button really on the Mac 512 whatever Yep, then I went to two, but then I went to three but then yeah one.

657
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:50,279
Rym: But then eventually the third button got replaced by a scroll wheel that you could also click in.

658
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,439
Rym: Yep, and that became the third button.

659
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,844
Scott: I was always annoyed with the scroll wheel in the early days because clicking it in would often scroll but nowadays that is mostly fixed on better mice.

660
00:45:59,905 --> 00:46:02,317
Rym: Yeah nowadays clicking in is actual third click.

661
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:09,657
Rym: Yes, and Then we had the proliferation of more buttons and nonsense on mice most of which are literally useless for anything but gaming.

662
00:46:09,677 --> 00:46:11,846
Rym: yep and Here we are.

663
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:13,579
Rym: I get a lot of opinions about mice now.

664
00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:19,019
Scott: The other thing that changed was they found a way to get rid of the ball by inventing the optical mouse.

665
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:29,140
Rym: well So I there was an interim step where there were mice that had balls in them But instead of the rollers tracking the movement they had like a little sensor that would track the rolling of the ball.

666
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:37,310
Scott: That is actually how a lot of scroll wheels these days work like the scroll wheel on my mouse is Actually an optical sensor aimed at the scroll wheel.

667
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,577
Scott: It's not physically clicking anything inside.

668
00:46:39,738 --> 00:46:42,878
Scott: Yep, right And it works fine most of the time.

669
00:46:43,227 --> 00:46:44,345
Scott: But yeah The optical mouse.

670
00:46:44,385 --> 00:47:14,139
Scott: the idea behind the optical mouse was that you would have Basically like a light similar to the lights that they used to scan QR codes at the grocery store Yep And it would just sort of scan the table underneath the mouse Right and when you move the mouse well the whatever it was scanning would move Obviously in relation and basically just by look like if I'm looking outside the window of a train And I see trees moving to the left I know that I'm moving to the right assuming the train is doing the moving and not the trees.

671
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:17,792
Scott: Yeah, so if you're a mouse you can assume the table is not doing the moving.

672
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:22,948
Scott: so if you see the table moving up You know that the mouse is moving down right.

673
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:25,415
Scott: you don't need like a full-on camera to see this.

674
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:27,911
Scott: you just need a really rudimentary optical system.

675
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:32,852
Scott: and over time those optical systems became better and better and better and better and better.

676
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:36,223
Scott: and now optical mice work perfectly on way more Surfaces.

677
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:44,820
Scott: mice with the ball had a lot of problem on different surfaces And you know where the ball wouldn't roll very nicely or get stuck or whatever, but also that's why you needed mouse pads.

678
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:54,346
Scott: but the Optical mice also had in the early days a lot of issues on different surfaces glass surfaces And also early mice.

679
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:57,780
Rym: in that day they either they use lasers or LEDs or whatever.

680
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:00,956
Rym: But they had a bright usually red light coming out of them.

681
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:01,519
Rym: to make it work.

682
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:03,288
Scott: They still kind of have a light coming out the bottom.

683
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:08,731
Scott: all modern mice or modern mice know modern mice Can you pick them up are a lot better about turning the light off immediately.

684
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,879
Rym: no modern mice used non-visible light, too.

685
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,205
Scott: That's occasionally true.

686
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:13,109
Rym: That's most mice like.

687
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:15,420
Scott: I see a lot of mice with lights coming out the back usually shitty mice.

688
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,145
Scott: No, my arm.

689
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:18,057
Scott: I think them up and light goes away right away.

690
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:21,079
Rym: most mice I've owned for a long time don't have any visible light coming out of the bottom.

691
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,227
Scott: You sure it's not just turning off real fast.

692
00:48:23,388 --> 00:48:24,532
Rym: I'm a hundred percent sure.

693
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:26,820
Scott: because like for example this Apple watch, right?

694
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,955
Scott: You think oh, it's like.

695
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:30,027
Scott: you know It's not nothing that comes out of the bottom.

696
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,300
Scott: if you trick it you can see there's like a bright green light coming out the bottom.

697
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,540
Rym: Well, cuz that's the only way it's like your heart rate Rob.

698
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,868
Scott: I'm saying you like it does you can't?

699
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:38,880
Scott: it's so smart about turning it off lightning.

700
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,320
Rym: I see that green light all the time on people's wrists.

701
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:43,918
Scott: It will only come out if you if you trick it into coming out.

702
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:46,187
Rym: So there was an error where I remember.

703
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:50,020
Rym: people kept making 3d mice that you hold and they were garbage.

704
00:48:50,121 --> 00:48:50,886
Rym: They never worked.

705
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:52,697
Scott: Well, I saw gimmicks in CompUSA in the 90s.

706
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:01,560
Scott: Yeah, like you put your finger on it and it would like sense like your electrical Signals in your body and you control the mouse with your mind or whatever as a bunch of bullshit.

707
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:03,039
Scott: Yeah, it didn't work for shit.

708
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,727
Rym: But the word all the 3d like free space mice.

709
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:18,640
Rym: when people trying to reinvent just the same problem that monitors that were touchscreens had Was that it is actually very inefficient and fatiguing to be waving your arm around all the time Arm on the desk reading it's relaxed.

710
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,999
Rym: Yeah, if you're using a mouse correctly kind of like using a keyboard correctly, you're not moving around that much.

711
00:49:24,582 --> 00:49:26,993
Rym: It's a very efficient way to interface with a computer.

712
00:49:27,073 --> 00:49:27,435
Scott: that should be.

713
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:28,380
Scott: crank that sensitivity up.

714
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,444
Rym: Yeah and I'm actually like.

715
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:35,858
Rym: I think the mouse will persist in workstations for the lifetime of anyone listening to GeekNights like.

716
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:38,578
Rym: it's a hyper efficient way to interact with computers.

717
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:44,133
Rym: Life times too long for our lives short of a brain implant.

718
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,059
Rym: What's gonna replace the mouse brain implant?

719
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,939
Rym: Yeah short of a brain implant.

720
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:52,805
Rym: And we are making in.

721
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:54,933
Scott: I just don't want to rule out brain implant in my lifetime.

722
00:49:55,154 --> 00:49:56,640
Rym: Yeah, I'm hoping for brain implant.

723
00:49:57,482 --> 00:50:05,718
Rym: Yeah, so the alternative to the mouse like the only real alternative to what a mouse does specifically is the trackball.

724
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:16,975
Rym: Some people use trackballs for accessibility reasons like trackballs like depending like depending on a wrist mobility thumb mobility arm mobility.

725
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:24,019
Rym: trackball is a Functional equivalent to a mouse and it's a matter of preference taste and like ability to use.

726
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:27,899
Scott: also You know, there are certain times you need to have a trackball like let's say you want to play golden tea.

727
00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:35,123
Rym: Yeah, let's say you want to play my part You'll play centipede our friend can at RIT and when I was in high school Marvel Madness Can.

728
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:39,700
Rym: the one thing that I remember the most about him is that he was crazy good.

729
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,710
Rym: FPS is like we played all that like.

730
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,755
Rym: that was what we did in high school.

731
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:45,024
Rym: He was a sniper mostly he was really good at it.

732
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:52,248
Rym: dude played a sniper in mega TF and weapons factory with a Fucking trackball instead of a mind.

733
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:52,729
Scott: now there was.

734
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,420
Scott: originally there were the big trackballs Atari style, right?

735
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:57,500
Scott: But there were also these other trackballs.

736
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,111
Scott: You can still get these where it's.

737
00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:01,860
Scott: it's shaped like a mouse But you don't move the mouse.

738
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,953
Scott: Yeah dead in the thumb zone is a little red ball about.

739
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:14,680
Scott: it's maybe smaller than ping-pong ball But I sit like a rose and you just move that with your thumb and then you the rest of the mouse is the same.

740
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:15,800
Scott: You just don't move the mouse around.

741
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:26,100
Scott: This is really good for people with a lot of hand mobility But not a lot of arm mobility Right because even if you use the big trackball, you still gotta have to move your arm right to get going.

742
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:31,620
Scott: But with just the thumb ball you can just keep rest your hand there and move your fingers only.

743
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,565
Scott: What do you know in high school?

744
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:43,976
Rym: what I always wanted me and Ken both one and we talked about it a lot Was I always wanted a mouse that had a normal mouse with like the the bottom movement and everything But it also where the thumb goes had a trackball.

745
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:44,800
Scott: sure it exists somewhere.

746
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:46,083
Rym: Yeah Cuz I want.

747
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:51,740
Rym: my dream was to use the mouse for like broad strokes movement and FPS and use the wheel for like really fine.

748
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:54,009
Scott: If you plug two mice into a computer.

749
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:54,671
Scott: it just works.

750
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,820
Scott: it just works and they'll compete against each other.

751
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:02,160
Scott: But if you were say using them cooperatively, right they would and you could even have them at different sensitivities.

752
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:05,753
Scott: They would work cooperatively both influencing the mouse movement.

753
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:07,700
Scott: They're all relative movement not absolute.

754
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:17,686
Scott: So you absolutely could you know move the big mouse and then move little mouse totally what I found the ps2 spec, so By two is just X movement.

755
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:19,671
Rym: by three is just Y movement.

756
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:23,191
Rym: Yeah, and by one has it a bite.

757
00:52:23,923 --> 00:52:24,405
Scott: They would.

758
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:33,837
Rym: I don't want to get into the details of ps2 Yeah, but it old signaling protocols are stuff that you don't need to know how it works.

759
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:36,913
Rym: Good fucking God You can one one measure.

760
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:38,060
Scott: how many buttons did it support?

761
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:40,564
Scott: There's a bite.

762
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:41,647
Scott: you have a whole bite.

763
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:43,453
Rym: So bite two is just X movement.

764
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:44,717
Rym: by three is just Y movement.

765
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:45,560
Rym: bite one.

766
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:48,205
Rym: Bit zero is left button.

767
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:51,454
Rym: So binary on or off bit one is right button.

768
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:53,299
Rym: bit two is middle button.

769
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:55,835
Rym: Bit three is just a one.

770
00:52:55,996 --> 00:52:57,202
Rym: all the time I guess.

771
00:52:57,583 --> 00:53:02,780
Rym: okay, and then bits four five six and seven are something to do with the signs of the X&Y movement.

772
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:03,649
Rym: So they're all.

773
00:53:03,669 --> 00:53:04,620
Rym: they're doing more.

774
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:09,215
Rym: They're overloading the output of bit two bites two and three into by one point.

775
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:10,780
Scott: is you had left middle and right?

776
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:14,516
Rym: Three bites you can sample to figure out what the fuck the mouse is doing.

777
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:15,480
Scott: right three bites.

778
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,252
Scott: But if you have three bits for the buttons, that's actually two.

779
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:20,476
Scott: to the it's two for six.

780
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,700
Scott: You can actually have six button.

781
00:53:22,021 --> 00:53:23,186
Rym: Well, you could but here's the problem.

782
00:53:23,226 --> 00:53:25,959
Rym: bit zero is either one if it's no no eight button.

783
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:32,780
Rym: one Bit zero way returns a one if the button is pressed and a zero if it is currently not press.

784
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:37,117
Scott: Yeah, you can just change, you know, you just write your software to interpret that differently.

785
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:39,948
Rym: Yeah Sounds like a pain in the ass.

786
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,598
Scott: Yeah, you could have eight button mouse with that.

787
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:49,460
Scott: Because eight different comedy if you wrote a special custom driver that nothing would support different combinations of the three mouse buttons.

788
00:53:49,582 --> 00:53:58,265
Scott: so if Somebody could like push buttons one and three at the same time to trigger button for the problem is what I don't remember is the details Of like how the sampling works.

789
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:00,132
Rym: that might not work for practical reasons.

790
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:02,340
Rym: Anyway, cuz this is some old shit here.

791
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:09,180
Scott: Yeah, there's six pins with regardless there isn't any room for the analog sort of analog miss of the scroll wheel.

792
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:13,595
Rym: Yeah, like USB came and changed everything when it came to mice.

793
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:15,020
Rym: now, you can have a hundred fucking buttons.

794
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:19,920
Scott: I remember lots of really stupid mice coming out in the MMO days.

795
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,100
Scott: I'm sure someone is gonna tell me they were actually useful for MMOs, but I find that hard to believe.

796
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,311
Scott: I still feel like never not having played in those MMOs.

797
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,740
Scott: I still feel like regular mouse plus keyboard.

798
00:54:30,844 --> 00:54:32,074
Scott: You know, there were mice I saw.

799
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:32,760
Scott: they were so dumb.

800
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,235
Scott: They had like a whole calculator worth of buttons in the thumb area.

801
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:36,817
Scott: all these tiny.

802
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:42,256
Rym: but what I would rather That is a custom keyboard with like custom keys for all that nonsense.

803
00:54:42,296 --> 00:54:43,320
Rym: not to put them on the mouse.

804
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,091
Rym: Yeah, just have a giant keyboard like a piano of options.

805
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:47,532
Scott: Yep.

806
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,220
Rym: Yep, but we ain't talking about that.

807
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,188
Rym: We're talking about mice can't talk about keyboards.

808
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,574
Rym: That's the scope creep here.

809
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:57,874
Scott: So if you look at modern mice They're all pretty much the same except it for they're not Apple mice.

810
00:54:57,934 --> 00:54:59,582
Scott: They're all magic or whatever It's just.

811
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:03,600
Rym: do you want a mouse that has a bunch of buttons for gaming an optical sensor?

812
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,079
Scott: It's got a wire or not?

813
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:07,733
Scott: It's got two buttons and then a scroll wheel in the middle.

814
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:08,939
Scott: that is also a third button.

815
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:10,969
Scott: Some of them have stupid thumb buttons.

816
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,937
Scott: some of them have an area to rest your thumb.

817
00:55:12,957 --> 00:55:13,520
Scott: Some of them don't.

818
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:18,457
Scott: But the ones that really I don't understand are the ones that look like Rym said a pile of.

819
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:21,371
Rym: oh, dude I just learned something interesting in early mice.

820
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:32,356
Rym: for a long time like in the ps2 era Normal mouse if anything had a 3d component Forward went down and back went up like flight stick style what we would call inverted.

821
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:32,737
Rym: today.

822
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,139
Rym: all Drivers and early games if you said invert the mouse did the opposite of what invert does today?

823
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,101
Rym: Uh-huh.

824
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:46,520
Rym: So what we call inverted was the default until well after Apple decided to invert the scroll wheel also.

825
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,060
Rym: Yeah, cuz Apple always just makes the weirdest possible decision.

826
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:56,021
Rym: I mean Apple had one button mice long into the era where we had discovered that you can put more than one button on a Mouse.

827
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:56,522
Scott: Yep.

828
00:55:56,863 --> 00:55:59,490
Scott: Well, then they made a fancy ways to click more than one button.

829
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:01,997
Rym: Yeah instead of just having multiple buttons.

830
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:12,448
Rym: Yeah, so Another advance that came was the wireless mice which until kind of recently like in the last decade were garbage Like early wireless.

831
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:14,720
Scott: my aid maybe early wireless mice.

832
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:16,045
Rym: We're just like.

833
00:56:16,065 --> 00:56:22,085
Rym: the batteries would run out really quick and they were like a laggy like you notice Visible lag when you use them.

834
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:26,437
Scott: Mmm, really that I probably lived in beacon when GeekNights started.

835
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:27,520
Scott: There were good wireless mice.

836
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,608
Scott: Yeah, now they're actually even better wireless mice.

837
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:41,191
Scott: It's to the point at which like if you're pro gaming It's like maybe there would be a tiny tiny and presentable difference if you're super pro gaming But you could actually probably get away with it for all.

838
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:46,954
Scott: but like the most elite counter-strike, whatever I would still use wired mortgage because they'll use wired for many reasons.

839
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:49,205
Rym: one because you don't want to risk Interference.

840
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,398
Scott: Yeah, like you don't under is the battery running out while you're gaming.

841
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:53,608
Rym: Yep And that wire like.

842
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,500
Rym: I'm not walking away from my computer with the mouse.

843
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:59,031
Rym: It's not like I'm ever unplugging the mouse.

844
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:01,963
Rym: mouse and keyboard are plugged in tables that are hidden.

845
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:05,613
Scott: it is nice to have the wireless mouse because it is so comfy.

846
00:57:05,894 --> 00:57:10,800
Scott: the wire never like tugs on you or Bumps into stuff on your desk, but that doesn't happen to me.

847
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:13,360
Scott: I'll put stuff on my desk and it gets on top of the wire.

848
00:57:13,621 --> 00:57:20,860
Rym: See, I have a shelf for my keyboard and mouse underneath the rest of the desk So there's literally nothing my mouse could ever bump into the boys.

849
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,040
Scott: There are nice reasons to have a wireless mouse and you're not super pro gaming.

850
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,618
Scott: There's no reason really not to get the wireless mouse, but always gonna have a wired one is backup.

851
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:29,059
Scott: You never know.

852
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:32,432
Rym: Yep, I use wired mostly because I didn't mouse.

853
00:57:32,472 --> 00:57:33,516
Scott: I got one at home.

854
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:35,929
Rym: I got wireless at work I got wired at work and everywhere.

855
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:40,793
Rym: cuz I just I don't want to ever think about Having to deal with wait is my mouse out of battery?

856
00:57:40,854 --> 00:57:42,260
Scott: that's something that's really interesting.

857
00:57:42,361 --> 00:57:44,940
Scott: I've noticed is co-workers of max most of them, right?

858
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:51,820
Scott: They always got these Apple wireless magic mice and they're constantly charging batteries and swapping batteries all the fucking time.

859
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:59,666
Scott: Yeah When I had a wireless the wire with a triple-a battery in it and like eight years later a wireless mouse that I have at Work has the original batteries.

860
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:03,679
Scott: I've had it for a fucking long at least a year and I've never had to change them.

861
00:58:04,382 --> 00:58:07,960
Scott: Yep, I don't know what the problem is, I don't know Apple people I Apple people.

862
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:17,916
Rym: Yeah, so these days in terms of a mouse pretty much I just use like the Logitech whatever like I use a Logitech g502 which funnily enough.

863
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:19,080
Rym: I was not the razor blade one.

864
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:21,154
Rym: Yeah, I don't mind the razor blade.

865
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:23,475
Scott: Oh god Cut your hand.

866
00:58:24,362 --> 00:58:26,107
Rym: Here's the thing when I want a mouse.

867
00:58:26,488 --> 00:58:30,280
Rym: what I want is really good click action on my primary button.

868
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:36,078
Rym: Like if it doesn't feel good like I don't hear that like nice I got a feel tactile.

869
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:40,664
Scott: clicking on the scroll wheel Yeah, but no don't move scroll wheels I don't mind.

870
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:42,271
Rym: if you can put this like.

871
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:44,480
Rym: I can hit a button and my scroll wheel is smooth.

872
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,264
Scott: That's a nice feature.

873
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:45,685
Scott: I enjoy.

874
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,453
Rym: Yeah, cuz I use that like browsing the web.

875
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:48,880
Scott: Let's not be the only option.

876
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:53,608
Rym: Yeah, because when I'm playing Counter-Strike it is Weapon weapon weapon weapon.

877
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:56,878
Scott: Yeah, it has to be click click click discrete or I'm gonna go crazy.

878
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:57,280
Rym: That's right.

879
00:58:58,246 --> 00:58:59,455
Rym: I need really good buttons.

880
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:01,666
Rym: Mm-hmm And I need a thumb shelf.

881
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,172
Rym: Like I'm addicted to the thumb shell.

882
00:59:03,192 --> 00:59:03,915
Scott: I don't need thumb shell.

883
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:09,473
Rym: I really like the thumb shell Partly because I don't actually move my arm or wrist at all.

884
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:12,102
Rym: I pretty much just move the mouse with my fingers alone Mm-hmm.

885
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:15,616
Rym: So I like to rest my thumb on that shelf while I'm moving it around.

886
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:15,917
Rym: Mm-hmm.

887
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,427
Rym: And in terms of sensitivity I like my mouse.

888
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:19,749
Rym: to be.

889
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:26,259
Rym: my mouse even at work is Sensitive to the point that when a normal person sits down at my computer, they cannot use it.

890
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:32,484
Rym: They move the mouse and the cursors top corner bottom corner top corner bottom quarter and they don't know what to do and they walk Away, it's really funny.

891
00:59:32,866 --> 00:59:35,577
Scott: Don't you have a sensitivity changing button on the mouse at home?

892
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,019
Rym: I do not.

893
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,459
Rym: at work I get like my boss at work has generic scroll real button button and that's it.

894
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:44,537
Rym: So I actually went to the registry and just crank the sensitivity all the way up.

895
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:47,734
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so I work.

896
00:59:47,814 --> 00:59:54,080
Scott: I have a wireless mouse like I just said but before I had a different mouse that had like a scroll wheel issue where you would.

897
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:57,472
Scott: It was like fucked up and because of that I got angry.

898
00:59:57,873 --> 00:59:59,700
Scott: so I didn't buy another one of those mice.

899
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:07,640
Scott: So at home and I brought my mouse from home to work Right because I was tired of having the wireless one at home with the gaming situation, right?

900
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,383
Scott: So I bought the good.

901
01:00:08,423 --> 01:00:09,768
Scott: the mouse at work was busted.

902
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:13,040
Scott: It was flawed like manufacturing flaw.

903
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,780
Scott: So I brought the wireless one from home that I didn't want to use wireless at home anymore to work.

904
01:00:18,403 --> 01:00:19,347
Scott: And then I bought.

905
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:26,752
Scott: since I was mad at Logitech for making broken mice I bought the default razor whatever.

906
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:31,464
Rym: so I had I used to have a steel series death adder Steel series doesn't.

907
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,150
Scott: razor is the death adder steel series.

908
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,578
Rym: Oh, yeah steel series was the side else.

909
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:36,742
Scott: Yeah something I don't fucking know.

910
01:00:37,124 --> 01:00:37,826
Rym: Yeah, but that's dead.

911
01:00:37,886 --> 01:00:42,964
Scott: I bought the default razor death adder for home and as a weird-looking shape It's not razor blade.

912
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:46,460
Scott: It's just sort of curved in the front and I didn't notice it and I was actually using it.

913
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,044
Scott: It's just fine.

914
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:50,765
Rym: Yeah, like the razor blade aesthetic when I'm using the mouse I don't notice so I'm fine with it.

915
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:52,632
Scott: the rate all the razor blade aesthetic.

916
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:53,295
Scott: I do notice.

917
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:54,580
Scott: How do you notice it?

918
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:04,054
Rym: I've used them at like demos and the only thing I can't stand is the mouse that has a big hump that like Fits into your hand like fully like I don't like my palm to touch the mouse ever.

919
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:05,880
Rym: my palm never touches a mouse.

920
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:07,668
Scott: I rest I'm like leaning.

921
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:08,995
Scott: I'm just you know, plop my hand.

922
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:11,649
Rym: I'm also up like this Like it's just fingers touching the mouse.

923
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,359
Scott: That's a lot of energy to hold your arm in there.

924
01:01:13,781 --> 01:01:19,777
Rym: no, because the bottom I my wrist is touching the mouse pad and My hand your hand is like crook like this.

925
01:01:20,158 --> 01:01:21,463
Rym: Yeah, my hands up like this the whole time.

926
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:25,610
Rym: Uh-huh resting on the mouse Uh-huh, actually pointed my for the live stream.

927
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:25,971
Rym: I just.

928
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:30,044
Rym: I just plop my arm down like plop I do but my palm does not.

929
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:36,070
Scott: my palm is a good inch over the mouse And it's only being used energy in your fingers or wrist to keep your palm up in there.

930
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:39,329
Rym: No, I don't because they're all just touching the mouse like arched.

931
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,203
Rym: So the only things touching the mouse are the tip of my thumb.

932
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:43,690
Scott: the trim just likes to be weird.

933
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:46,805
Rym: Oh, this is weird, this is how you hold this mouse.

934
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:47,690
Scott: no one else does that.

935
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:49,318
Rym: I feel like this is how anyone holds his mouth.

936
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:51,770
Rym: because this mouse you can't get your whole hand.

937
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:53,041
Scott: You're the only one who does it that way.

938
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:55,970
Rym: if I put my whole hand on it Then my fingers like sticking past the front of the mouse.

939
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:57,374
Scott: Different to be different.

940
01:01:57,655 --> 01:01:58,599
Scott: No, this is just comfortable.

941
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,989
Rym: You're the one with the weird like front part of your mouse.

942
01:02:02,573 --> 01:02:03,549
Rym: Your mouse has a weird front.

943
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,905
Scott: Yeah, the part you don't touch cuz it's so far away from.

944
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:07,630
Rym: why don't you touch it?

945
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,458
Rym: Why do you even have it then?

946
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:08,701
Rym: Why do you?

947
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:09,449
Rym: why did you get different mouse?

948
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,274
Scott: Because I don't touch that part.

949
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:18,623
Rym: Anyway my point is I pretty much only buy Logitech default mouse or razors Because all the other brands like SteelSeries.

950
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:21,033
Rym: like everyone who's made a special mouse I did.

951
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:25,030
Rym: They wore out like they were just like not that well made like they all wore out.

952
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:28,010
Rym: Meanwhile my piece of shit like cheap Logitech has lasted forever.

953
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:32,687
Scott: Microsoft is actually making a official surface mouse that is two buttons and a scroll wheel.

954
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:40,364
Scott: that seems really good If you don't care about gaming or whatever I mean when this thing finally dies cuz actually I did from playing overwatch.

955
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,650
Rym: I broke the scroll wheel.

956
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:46,302
Rym: Good job, but but I fixed it by shoving some paper in there to like.

957
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:51,529
Rym: basically I made I made a paper bushing And that has actually made the mouse wheel work fine.

958
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:59,042
Rym: Uh-huh, rather than replacing the mouse like you wouldn't unless you look in there and you see this bushing I made parents breaking his mouse by anyone, but I didn't buy a new one.

959
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:00,667
Rym: I'm still using the same shitty mouse.

960
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:02,834
Rym: Apparently I Repaired it.

961
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:03,640
Rym: cuz that's how I do.

962
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:04,689
Rym: I repair things if I can.

963
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:12,950
Rym: So, uh In terms of sensitivity though in FPS is I've actually made a big leap in the last couple years.

964
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:17,729
Rym: When I used to play FPS is I also forced myself to play an extremely high sensitivity.

965
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:19,967
Scott: Your pros have low sensitivity.

966
01:03:20,028 --> 01:03:24,865
Rym: Yes I have since moved back to low sensitivity and I've actually moved further into.

967
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:29,078
Rym: I use the Sensitivity swapping features on modern mice.

968
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:31,004
Rym: So depending on the character.

969
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:36,221
Rym: I'm playing I the game I program to have different sensitivities and depending on what I'm doing.

970
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:38,850
Rym: I will swap between different sensitivity modes.

971
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:46,161
Scott: This is why it's good the gaming mice do, you know, they got rid of a lot of the other stupid buttons They used to have but they've kept the sensitivity changing button.

972
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,786
Scott: It's usually not below the scroll wheel.

973
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:51,355
Rym: So I got to below the Sensitivity mid game.

974
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:55,330
Rym: so below the scroll wheel I can swap between four different profiles of sensitivity.

975
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:57,178
Scott: You can fully configure if use the software.

976
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:00,130
Rym: then there's two buttons that I could bind to things.

977
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:04,261
Rym: But instead I bound to increase and decrease sensitivity just ad hoc.

978
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:11,195
Rym: and there's another button where if I hold it down with my thumb Just cuts my sensitivity down by a tenth Mm-hmm, that's the like.

979
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:15,831
Rym: I've really got a snipe and I hold it down and I just like track someone's head very carefully Hmm.

980
01:04:16,613 --> 01:04:23,050
Scott: See if you want to see the very first mouse that was ever made you can see the mother of all demos.

981
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:28,210
Scott: I think we've talked about it in GeekNights before Perhaps thing of the day or maybe on its anniversary or something.

982
01:04:28,633 --> 01:04:29,438
Scott: But you should go check.

983
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,350
Scott: if you haven't seen that you should check it out anyway.

984
01:04:31,772 --> 01:04:34,043
Scott: But that's pretty much the first mouse.

985
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:38,719
Scott: effectively speaking I found actually the first mouse but it's effectively.

986
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,390
Rym: I found a picture here of the first wireless mouse from 1984.

987
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,745
Rym: Okay, which had two buttons.

988
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:45,570
Rym: take that Apple.

989
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:49,925
Rym: Yeah wireless and two buttons two years after I was born.

990
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:52,231
Scott: ever windows like 1.0 1984.

991
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:57,013
Rym: who even knows with the logitech metaphor Oh Logitech was around then.

992
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,858
Scott: Yeah, Logitech's no company.

993
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,502
Scott: Was it like infrared for its wireless?

994
01:05:00,582 --> 01:05:01,365
Rym: I assume so.

995
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:08,363
Scott: infrared wasn't using Wi-Fi Or anything like that, so I had to be using infrared right?

996
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:11,010
Rym: Yeah, I guess you could use our effectively a remote control.

997
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:13,898
Rym: Yeah, everything wireless was that back then effectively.

998
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:14,961
Scott: It's like wireless.

999
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:16,947
Rym: Nintendo controllers were garbage.

1000
01:05:17,128 --> 01:05:17,870
Rym: I are back then.

1001
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,410
Scott: Did you ever hold your Gameboy Pocket or color next to another Gameboy Pocket or color to give?

1002
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:25,310
Scott: Pokemon presents to the other person and Pokemon gold and silver.

1003
01:05:25,693 --> 01:05:31,470
Rym: I never did that but I had a wireless SNES controller that you had to point at a thing the entire time or it broke.

1004
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,924
Rym: Mmm, I got it at a garage sale.

1005
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:34,650
Rym: It was a piece of shit.

1006
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,387
Rym: Yep, I sold it at a different garage sale for more money than I paid for it.

1007
01:05:38,447 --> 01:05:38,809
Rym: Good job.

1008
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:46,270
Rym: But so actually someone in the stream asked about what about those vertical form factor mice the handshake style?

1009
01:05:46,752 --> 01:05:47,435
Rym: Never see those.

1010
01:05:47,455 --> 01:05:50,350
Scott: I mean, that's just an idea for people who need it, but I don't see.

1011
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,476
Rym: Those exist for one purpose.

1012
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:59,017
Rym: if you have mobility problems or like carpal tunnel syndrome There's a reason you need it.

1013
01:05:59,077 --> 01:06:00,425
Scott: Then you need it if you don't need it.

1014
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:01,230
Scott: That's just weird.

1015
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:05,128
Rym: I feel like you would never want to use one of those unless you had a specific reason to write.

1016
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:11,210
Rym: It's like nothing and for me like holding my hand like that is way harder and more stressful than using a normal mouse.

1017
01:06:11,612 --> 01:06:18,130
Scott: right weird things in the world exist because Someone has a weird case like they legitimately need that weird thing.

1018
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:21,135
Scott: If you don't need the weird thing Don't be that weird.

1019
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:24,830
Scott: Oh who just insists on using the weird thing or holding your mouse in a weird way like Rym?

1020
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:30,200
Scott: Do things in a normal way like a normal person.

1021
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:30,923
Rym: stream can decide.

1022
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:33,030
Rym: I've been pointing the camera at how I use my mouse.

1023
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,936
Rym: This is like the second half of this episode.

1024
01:06:35,317 --> 01:06:36,480
Rym: You can see exactly what I do.

1025
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:36,942
Scott: Yep.

1026
01:06:37,684 --> 01:06:38,506
Rym: I don't think it's weird.

1027
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:41,357
Rym: Oh Here is a picture of the first computer mouse.

1028
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,342
Scott: Yeah, there it is.

1029
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:43,527
Rym: It's got like a wood case.

1030
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:45,921
Rym: Yep We should get that.

1031
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:46,428
Rym: get it to work.

1032
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:47,955
Scott: It's in a museum.

1033
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:49,121
Rym: Yeah, we could make this.

1034
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:50,790
Scott: Oh you want to make a replica?

1035
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:52,130
Rym: You have to plug it into an Arduino.

1036
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:54,217
Rym: I guess probably the easiest way to make it work.

1037
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:55,863
Rym: with a model you do an Arduino in it.

1038
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:57,850
Rym: Uh, it's big enough.

1039
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:01,550
Rym: Anyway, so how about the mouse pad?

1040
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:10,120
Scott: There was a time when mouse pads matter needed the mouse pad for the when you had the ball because you in if your table Was not good getting good traction with the ball, right?

1041
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:17,410
Scott: Yep, and then you needed the mouse pad with the The optical sensor when the optical sensor was garbage.

1042
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:23,130
Rym: But now like my mouse works fine on a completely uniform white surface like mice got real good.

1043
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:37,290
Rym: The only reason I use a mouse pad is that it's more comfortable on my wrist to have like a soft surface there instead of just the table and It prevents the pads on the bottom of my mouse from wearing out as fast from scraping against a hard table.

1044
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:41,350
Scott: Yep, the other thing with the the mouse pad actually stopped using the separate mouse pad.

1045
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,196
Scott: But now I know I just use a play mat.

1046
01:07:43,637 --> 01:07:47,850
Scott: Yeah, I get a play mat that is designed for playing collectible card games.

1047
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:48,814
Rym: That's what I got right here.

1048
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:52,030
Scott: I get that I laid out a cover like my whole friggin table.

1049
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:53,776
Scott: I'm shifted over to the right.

1050
01:07:53,796 --> 01:07:56,850
Scott: So half my keyboard is on it, but then there's a huge area for the mouse.

1051
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,097
Rym: That is exactly what I do.

1052
01:07:58,177 --> 01:08:06,238
Rym: I'm done with mouse pad is a separate thing But I don't even use the huge area because the stream you can see I only have like a few inches of play because I Don't move my mouse that much.

1053
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:06,721
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1054
01:08:07,023 --> 01:08:07,768
Rym: Like that's all I need.

1055
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:17,529
Rym: Well, if you go low sensitivity in an FPS well when I'm playing an FPS I push this keyboard up and I pull out the smaller gaming keyboard because I like the cherry MX blues.

1056
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:19,937
Rym: You don't want to play in a key boards.

1057
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:20,379
Scott: Really?

1058
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,830
Rym: You don't want to play an FPS with the cherry MX blues.

1059
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:27,303
Rym: That could the heavy click that sucks for an FPS.

1060
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:28,930
Rym: That's gonna cause problems.

1061
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:31,916
Scott: Daddy, two keyboards daddy two keyboards.

1062
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:35,808
Rym: I just I have a keyboard with the cherry Reds that are linear.

1063
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:36,630
Rym: No click.

1064
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:39,770
Rym: Okay, because they just they're just you touch him instantly take effect.

1065
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:43,889
Scott: I mean, yes, the red is better for gaming than blue but having two keyboards really why not?

1066
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:52,515
Rym: When I'm typing versus when I'm gaming and when I'm gaming it gives me another six inches because I don't need a numpad when I'm No, that's true.

1067
01:08:52,535 --> 01:08:55,609
Rym: Like what do you if I'm playing a game that needs a numpad?

1068
01:08:55,992 --> 01:08:58,370
Rym: It's not a game that needs cherry Reds.

1069
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,055
Rym: I can use my regular keyboard.

1070
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:05,130
Rym: if I'm playing like command and conquer using the regular keyboard that that other keyboard is only for FPS.

1071
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,518
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1072
