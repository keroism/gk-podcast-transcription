1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,185
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 7th.

2
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:11,907
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:12,609
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:13,993
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:25,901
Rym: Tonight, free comic book day 2008.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,591
Rym: This is going to be a somewhat difficult show for me to do.

8
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,940
Rym: You see, we're making VLT's tonight.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:44,259
Rym: So Emily got it to make some fresh bread and she put the fresh bread right next to me and it's sitting there and I can smell it.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,660
Scott: I thought it was wrapped in it like a bath towel, but it's actually some sort of colorful...

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,748
Rym: Yes, Scott is not used to nice napkins.

12
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,540
Rym: So when he sees a nice napkin, he assumes it's a bath towel.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,368
Scott: It's just, uh, it looks like a dish towel actually.

14
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:57,312
Rym: Not so much.

15
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:59,480
Rym: Yeah, it looks like a napkin.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,499
Scott: It's pretty colorful for a napkin.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,526
Rym: But I'll tell you one thing.

18
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:11,280
Rym: If you're out there, not many of you are podcasters, but imagine trying to podcast when there's fresh bread that you're not allowed to eat yet right next to you.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,571
Scott: What if, what if it's the bakery cast and you're the baker?

20
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:14,796
Rym: You know what?

21
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:19,440
Rym: If you're a baker, I think you're either immune to the effects of the smell of fresh bread or you're obese.

22
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:20,780
Scott: Uh, both.

23
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,619
Scott: You mean you got immune by getting obese.

24
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:26,929
Rym: I don't know if I could get immune though.

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,439
Rym: I could just eat bread until I died.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,059
Scott: We wanted to quit and become bakers.

27
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:30,920
Scott: Yeah.

28
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,180
Scott: Let's open up a bakery.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,667
Rym: I remember one or two times, I actually, when I worked at that Tavella's when we lived at RIT for that summer, I was the baker.

30
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,920
Rym: Like I assisted the baker.

31
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:46,078
Rym: I get in at six in the morning and make the bread and basically make the bread meant I stood there while the baker did everything and then I cleaned up after him.

32
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,759
Rym: The smell was painful and I stole like two loaves and ate him.

33
00:01:55,621 --> 00:02:03,880
Rym: Anyway, since we're not going to talk about anime for the rest of this show, I'll at least point out that I'm watching a show that we're probably going to talk about sometime soon on the train.

34
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:06,399
Rym: Watching that Princess Tutu.

35
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:07,357
Scott: Oh, that one.

36
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,419
Rym: It's interesting.

37
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,933
Rym: And what I want to say is I like it.

38
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:12,899
Rym: I do like it.

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,059
Rym: But what Lara said when she gave it to me sums it up best.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:25,420
Rym: Princess Tutu is a show that you can enjoy and get a lot out of so long as you go into it knowing that it is a show where people fight via ballet.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,920
Rym: And when Aunt Iterina, good God, it's interesting.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,660
Scott: Swan Lake Attack?

43
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:45,420
Rym: You know, you'd think that, but it's more like by doing ballet with you I have learned the secrets of your heart and now I do something magical to steal your heart because I know the secrets.

44
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,780
Scott: It's like Utena only with ballet instead of swords.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,879
Rym: And with much less subtlety.

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,220
Scott: Oh, subtlety was important to Utena because, well, without the subtlety... You get the movie.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,038
Scott: It would have been, yeah, pretty much.

48
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:04,320
Rym: But it's like imagine if Utena, every character in Utena was either Wakaba or Nanami.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:13,895
Scott: Of course, Utena's subtlety, you know, there's a question is it actually subtlety or is it just sort of unintentional vaguery?

50
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:15,380
Scott: Or intentional vaguery?

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
Rym: Well, the fact that it all comes together in the end definitely leans toward the former.

52
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,893
Rym: But I don't know about Princess Tutu.

53
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:22,720
Rym: I gotta see more.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,740
Rym: I haven't gotten past the point where people say it gets good, but it's already pretty good.

55
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,140
Scott: I've downloaded a whole bunch of anime.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,200
Scott: I'm gonna start going through all those new episodes and new shows.

57
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,660
Scott: And I also watched the first DVD that got us, you know, Yojimbo.

58
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,140
Rym: Yup, second DVD's on the way.

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,820
Scott: Which is a show I watched a long time ago, completely forgot and watched again.

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:49,613
Scott: But I sort of feel like maybe we should watch Yojimbo and also watch Fistful of Dollars and then sort of do a Yojimbo try show.

61
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,300
Rym: I feel like each one could merit its own show.

62
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,575
Scott: I know, but I feel like we should do the three in a row or something.

63
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,459
Scott: I don't know.

64
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,899
Rym: We haven't even watched Strange Days yet.

65
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,900
Scott: We'll watch it this weekend or something.

66
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,752
Rym: That movie's like ten years old.

67
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:07,880
Rym: Actually twelve.

68
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,559
Rym: Alright, so I think that's it for anime today.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,839
Scott: Yeah, so it's time for Scott's Box.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:23,820
Scott: Oh no, you people wanted me to do Scott's Box when I got the box as opposed to when I ordered the next box.

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,580
Rym: Which I think is the superior option.

72
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,099
Scott: Well, that's what the people voted for.

73
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:32,500
Scott: And unlike, I guess, in other parts of the world, what you vote for is what you get with GeekNights.

74
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,179
Scott: Are you kidding?

75
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,760
Rym: We pretty much ignore any time someone votes for a banning or anything in the forum.

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,400
Scott: Shush, I'm trying to be like other parts of the world and give the people the impression their vote counts.

77
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,584
Rym: Okay.

78
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,240
Scott: Alright, so let's start with, let's see what came in the box.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
Rym: What came in Scott's Box?

80
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,840
Scott: Alright, so I'll do the issues.

81
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,480
Scott: I'll do the issues first, then I'll do the trades.

82
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,440
Rym: I think we need some Scott's Box music.

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,434
Scott: I guess so.

84
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:04,159
Scott: I don't know, I think it should have lots of percussion to resemble the box.

85
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:10,080
Scott: Maybe I should just bang a beat on a cardboard box that has full of peanuts and that'll be it.

86
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,380
Rym: I could make a drum loop.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,242
Scott: I guess.

88
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:15,060
Scott: Alright, so the first thing I got here, DC Universe Zero.

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,078
Scott: Why did I get this?

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,520
Rym: It was seventeen cents.

91
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,231
Scott: No, the cover price is fifty cents.

92
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,239
Scott: I paid twelve cents.

93
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:25,660
Scott: This is sort of, from what people have been saying, I haven't read it yet.

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,780
Scott: I haven't read any of this yet because I read all the free comp books we're going to talk about in the second half of the show instead.

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Scott: This is sort of like, you know, DC's about to go nuts with all sorts of crises that they go nuts with.

96
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,139
Scott: Well, every summer there's crises, who knows, right?

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:06:00,953
Scott: And this is sort of like, if you haven't been paying attention, like this is like, you know, sort of wraps up what was going on and sort of brings you into the new with like little tiny, like there's a little Batman bit, there's a little Wonder Woman bit, there's a little Superman bit, a little Green Lantern bit, and it's sort of like, here's all the bits to sort of catch you up and, you know, sort of pull you into the next thing.

98
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:01,799
Scott: That's what it's supposed to be.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Scott: Alright, we got Soleil Free Sampler.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,580
Scott: Remember I was talking about how I was going to get the Sky Doll from Marvel to support their European comic endeavors?

101
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:13,580
Rym: That's right.

102
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:18,460
Rym: We got that short interview we did with the people who were pushing French comics at the New York Comic Con.

103
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:28,340
Scott: Alright, well Marvel has this sort of like Soleil thing they're doing and they've got Sky Doll, Universal War 1, Samurai, and Scourge of the Gods, right?

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:37,519
Scott: And I ordered the three issues of Sky Doll, but the other one I'm interested in, the Universal War 1, is six issues, so I'll probably wait for the trade on that.

105
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:49,360
Scott: But they sent me a free sampler, just it's like Soleil Free Sampler, and it gives me little bits of each of these for European comics Marvel's going to put out so I can see what they're like and decide if I want to buy them.

106
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,660
Scott: So maybe I won't even order that Universal War, whatever.

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:01,160
Scott: Alright, we got that second part of the three part Logan Wolverine series that I'm only getting because it's written by Brian K. Vaughan and Brian K. Vaughan means automatic buying.

108
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,436
Rym: But does it mean automatic?

109
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:02,699
Rym: good?

110
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,882
Scott: Usually.

111
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:06,394
Scott: He's the Why the Last Man Runaways guy.

112
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:07,600
Scott: He's the Ex Machina guy.

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,668
Rym: See, I really like Ex Machina.

114
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,080
Rym: I really didn't like Why the Last Man.

115
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:13,496
Scott: I don't think you read enough of it.

116
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,760
Rym: It really went downhill for me pretty much right away.

117
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,999
Scott: Anyway, he's never done anything bad.

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,109
Rym: Yeah, I can't say that it's bad.

119
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,660
Rym: I felt it was kind of dumb.

120
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:31,799
Scott: We got Marvel Comics Presents #8, the only book that I buy every month, so you're going to hear that on Scott's Box every month until they stop printing it.

121
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,407
Scott: Alright, check this out.

122
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,880
Scott: I bought this based on two things.

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,540
Scott: I bought this based on the title and based on the price, which is less than a dollar.

124
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,977
Scott: The title is "I Was Kidnapped by Lesbian Pirates from Outer

125
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:42,319
Scott: Space.".

126
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,180
Scott: How can you not buy that?

127
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:50,100
Scott: Even if it was $5, how can you not buy "I Was Kidnapped by Lesbian Pirates from Outer Space"?

128
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,500
Rym: I didn't read it, but I flipped through it, and you know what it's about?

129
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,760
Scott: Someone who was kidnapped by lesbian pirates from outer space.

130
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,440
Rym: It looked kind of good, actually.

131
00:07:58,681 --> 00:07:59,004
Scott: I know.

132
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,620
Scott: For a dollar, can't go wrong.

133
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:02,697
Scott: If it's good, I'll wait for the trade.

134
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:03,000
Rym: Why not?

135
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,040
Rym: It looked slightly more than a dollar's worth of good.

136
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:09,140
Scott: And the art style, actually, really, that's my kind of style.

137
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,237
Scott: Sort of like old school, hip kind of thing going on.

138
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,131
Scott: Alright, I got "Wonder Lost #2" by C.B.

139
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:15,373
Scott: Cebulski.

140
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,509
Scott: If you don't know C.B.

141
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,760
Scott: Cebulski, right, I wanted to talk to him at the New York Comic Con.

142
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,720
Scott: He had an artist's alley table, but he was always there when I wasn't there, so I never actually got to talk to him, but me and him have a lot in common.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,520
Scott: He and I, I don't know, have a lot in common.

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,180
Scott: You see, he grew up in the Connecticut.

145
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,620
Scott: I grew up in the Connecticut.

146
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,120
Rym: A lot of people grew up in Connecticut.

147
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:36,509
Scott: He likes the comics.

148
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,078
Scott: I like the comics.

149
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,073
Scott: I think he was involved with

150
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:40,659
Scott: C.P.M.,

151
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,200
Scott: and he's sort of like, he knows about the animes and the mangas.

152
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,519
Scott: I'm also into the animes and the mangas.

153
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:46,864
Scott: C.B.

154
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,159
Scott: Cebulski is my kind of guy.

155
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,080
Scott: He did all those Spider-Man fairy tales, X-Men fairy tales things for Marvel.

156
00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:01,200
Scott: He's done a lot of good stuff, and "Wonder Lost" is sort of like his autobiographical childhood stories thing.

157
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,780
Scott: Well, more like teenage years stories.

158
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:12,980
Scott: There's a story where he makes out with some girl in his car outside of the Wonderland of Ice ice rink, and I've been to the Wonderland of Ice ice rink because I grew up in Connecticut.

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,519
Rym: Did you make out with anyone there?

160
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,379
Scott: No, sadly.

161
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,740
Scott: That was in issue one of "Wonder Lost,".

162
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,553
Scott: so of course I'm going to buy issue two of "Wonder

163
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:21,855
Scott: Lost."

164
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:28,220
Scott: And the last issue I got was this "Glamourpuss #1" by Dave Sim.

165
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,480
Scott: He's the service guy, right?

166
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:45,740
Scott: And basically I bought this for the art, because if you say nothing else about Dave Sim, he has the art skills, but "Cerabus" is supposed to be like this ultra-famous indie comic that's like 300 issues long, and I read the first two phone books of it.

167
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,320
Scott: You might not know what it is, but once you see the phone books, you'll recognize it, because you've seen it before.

168
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:52,840
Scott: And it was painful.

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,819
Scott: Reading that second trade was like dragging my brain through a marsh.

170
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:57,814
Rym: Why did you even bother?

171
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,520
Scott: Because it's so famous, I felt like I was obligated.

172
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:07,038
Rym: That's how I felt about "Great Expectations," and I cut and ran well before.

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,340
Scott: But basically I've actually found out recently that Dave Sim is actually this horrible, horrible misogynist dude.

174
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:26,160
Scott: So yeah, we'll see what this thing's about, because it's supposed to be about women's parody on women's fashion something something from a misogynist, so we'll see what that's about.

175
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:33,820
Scott: I guess I gotta view the guy sort of like Mike Tyson, where even though his skills at work might be awesome, he's not a good person.

176
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,530
Scott: Alright, that's the end of the issues.

177
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,994
Scott: Let's look at them.

178
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:36,599
Scott: trades.

179
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,450
Scott: "Mushishi Volume

180
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,881
Scott: 3.".

181
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,119
Scott: You know, "Mushishi" the anime was awesome.

182
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,280
Scott: And "Mushishi" the manga, the first two volumes, were pretty much the same as the anime.

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Scott: Like, I wasn't getting anything more or less by reading the manga, and so unless this manga goes and tells stories that the anime didn't tell, I sort of feel like I might stop buying it.

184
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,000
Rym: Well, part of what made the anime so great was that the animation was just amazing.

185
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:03,479
Scott: It was super amazing.

186
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,699
Rym: To quote ourselves, it was animated in twosies.

187
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,764
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

188
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,496
Scott: Well, Emily told us that, right?

189
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:10,919
Scott: Is that right?

190
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:13,560
Rym: Something like that.

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,180
Scott: Yeah, she said it was right.

192
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:20,959
Rym: But also it was just the sound and the atmosphere, and there was a lot, and it was very subtle and slow, and I liked it.

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,179
Scott: Yeah, the only thing in this manga that I don't get in the show is the funny, you know, little omake in the back or whatever it is.

194
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,980
Scott: So, you know, it's a good manga.

195
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,920
Scott: If you haven't seen the show and you like manga more than you like anime, you should probably get this, because it's just as awesome.

196
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,620
Scott: It's the same stories and characters.

197
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,240
Rym: Yeah, but all things being equal, if you're a fan of both, I think I'd recommend the anime.

198
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:50,760
Scott: Yeah, I think if this volume doesn't really, like, you know, do something awesome that the anime didn't do, I'm just going to stop and maybe buy the anime DVDs sometime in a box set.

199
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,028
Scott: Okay, we got this thing.

200
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,930
Scott: Super Real Graphics presents Gnome.

201
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,150
Scott: And this actually, because I ordered it for my pre-order place, came with a free sketch of the Gnome character.

202
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,190
Scott: This is by Dave Dwan.

203
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,830
Rym: So a gnome with a G, like gnome?

204
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,479
Scott: Yes, it's like a garden.

205
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:10,970
Scott: The story is, right?

206
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,045
Scott: I'll read the back.

207
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:12,270
Scott: Ready?

208
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,390
Scott: "Believed to be simple yard decoration, these garden gnomes once roamed the earth as its greatest protectors.

209
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,249
Scott: Long ago, a curse was placed upon them, petrifying them, until the day they were needed to protect the earth once more.

210
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:27,247
Scott: In 1956, the world was in peril, and one lonely gnome answered the

211
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:27,429
Scott: call.".

212
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,805
Scott: So this is the adventures of a garden gnome come to life, defending the world in the late 50s.

213
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,542
Scott: Or the mid to late 50s.

214
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:35,609
Rym: I don't know about that.

215
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,549
Scott: I don't know about either, but it was cheap, and it came with a free sketch.

216
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,570
Scott: And the sketch is actually pretty high quality.

217
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:48,770
Rym: You know, I realize that your rationale for buying a lot of these comics is getting to the point where you can't make fun of Scott Johnson for his deal hunting anymore.

218
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,448
Scott: I don't know about that, because I...

219
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,070
Rym: How many times is there a conversation, "Why did you buy that show?

220
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:54,646
Rym: It was only 50 cents if I bought

221
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:54,990
Rym: 10.".

222
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,910
Scott: Yeah, but his DVDs are like five bucks, not 50 cents.

223
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,429
Scott: If the DVD was 50 cents, then it would be okay.

224
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,329
Scott: I don't know.

225
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:05,508
Scott: And the only other thing is that he watches those DVDs, and he likes them.

226
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:11,489
Scott: I read comics that are, you know, if they had lesbian Pirates of Outer Space was bad, I would say...

227
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,289
Rym: But that's probably good.

228
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:12,850
Scott: I know.

229
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,009
Scott: Okay, if the DC Universe number zero is bad, I'll say it's bad, even though I spent 12 cents on it.

230
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,425
Rym: All right.

231
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:18,975
Rym: 12 cents?

232
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:20,830
Scott: All right.

233
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:24,369
Scott: So Osamu Tezuka's Dororo, number one.

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,106
Scott: Vertical.

235
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:25,889
Scott: Tezuka.

236
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,470
Scott: I'm going to repeat this, like, till the end of time here.

237
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:28,970
Scott: Right?

238
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,530
Scott: They sent me a free copy.

239
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,330
Scott: I still bought a copy anyway.

240
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,290
Scott: And this actually, I read this already, because I read the free copy when I got it.

241
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,690
Scott: I think it's the only thing in Scott's box I've read already.

242
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:43,670
Scott: And this is actually kind of different from Tezuka's, I mean, it's still Tezuka stylin'.

243
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,930
Scott: But story-wise, it's unlike any of Tezuka's other stuff, and I'm really liking this.

244
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,209
Scott: Like, this might be like my second or third favorite Tezuka manga there is.

245
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:55,088
Scott: It's so good.

246
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:55,790
Rym: I don't know.

247
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,250
Rym: More and more, I really like Apollo's song.

248
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,909
Rym: I don't know why I like it so much.

249
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,670
Scott: Apollo's song's good, but it's not, like, holy crap, dude.

250
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,027
Rym: Well, no.

251
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,748
Rym: It's no name like five other works, but...

252
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,350
Scott: All right.

253
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,050
Scott: I bought the, see, the complete Persepolis.

254
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,250
Scott: Remember we saw the movie?

255
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:21,150
Rym: The movie was good, but Emily was reading the comic, and I was flipping through, I read the first bit of the comic, and it's, the comic makes it all a lot more, I don't know, realistic.

256
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:31,450
Scott: Yeah, I haven't read the comic yet, as I said, but there's the whole thing in one book, and I got, like, 30 or 40% off, so... I imagine... I like the movie, we'll see what the book is like.

257
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:35,050
Rym: I imagine it'll warrant a review, or at least a geek bite in and of itself.

258
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:35,970
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely.

259
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:36,730
Scott: All right.

260
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,899
Rym: Waiting for Scott to continue to go through his box.

261
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:41,800
Scott: All right.

262
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,340
Scott: I got Whiteout, volume one and two, a new printing by Oni Press.

263
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,979
Scott: This is written by Greg Rucka.

264
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:59,200
Scott: I found out about Greg Rucka when I read Gotham Central, and if you've never heard of Gotham Central, it was this DC comic about the police in Gotham City.

265
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,040
Scott: So Batman's there, but very little.

266
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:01,880
Scott: He's barely there.

267
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,100
Scott: It's mostly about the police in the city dealing with all the shit that Batman does or doesn't deal with, right?

268
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,973
Rym: Now, that's kind of my alley, because...

269
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,800
Scott: Gotham Central is over.

270
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,240
Scott: Like, you can just go out and buy all the trades and get the whole thing, and you don't have to understand any DC bullshit.

271
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,520
Scott: Like, if you've seen one Batman movie, you know more than enough.

272
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,020
Scott: You know more than you need to know to understand...

273
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,759
Rym: No, forget a movie.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,538
Rym: Just watch one episode of BTS.

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,660
Scott: Yeah, if you watch one episode of Batman animated series, you know more than enough to understand what's going on in Gotham Central.

276
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,420
Scott: if you read, like, you know, the little foreword in the first volume.

277
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:39,440
Scott: And it's super awesome, and it's Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker, I think, did that.

278
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,499
Scott: So, then, I got, like, these volumes of Queen and Country, right?

279
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:44,479
Scott: From somebody.

280
00:15:45,523 --> 00:16:01,280
Scott: And I read the first three volumes of that, and it was Greg Rucka, and also, like, Brian Lee O'Malley did the art on an issue, and... Yeah, it's basically, like, sort of like a spy, you know, secret missions against terrorism kind of story about, like, this, you know, British group of people or whatever.

281
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,859
Scott: And that was really good.

282
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:04,791
Scott: So, I'm like,

283
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:05,095
Scott: "Huh.".

284
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:08,160
Scott: And I sort of figured out that Greg Rucka is the shit.

285
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,079
Scott: So, now, Greg Rucka, I think, is on the automatic buy list.

286
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:16,100
Scott: So, they reprinted... I had the first three volumes of Queen and Country, right?

287
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:23,580
Scott: But now they came out with these Queen and Country definitive editions, which are much newer, better printings and fewer volumes for less money.

288
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:34,840
Scott: And I figured out that if I just get rid of the three volumes I have and buy these definitive editions, I'll get the whole series for less money than if I just bought the rest of the normal existing volumes.

289
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:42,996
Scott: So, actually, in my hands, I just got in Scott's box Queen and Country definitive edition one and two and Greg Rucka whiteout one and two.

290
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:46,980
Scott: All from Oni Press, all new printings, all awesome.

291
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:47,475
Scott: Okay.

292
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,059
Scott: Almost done.

293
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,871
Scott: -Almost?

294
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:51,320
Scott: -Almost.

295
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,183
Scott: Okay.

296
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:57,680
Scott: I don't know if this is going to be good or not, but I got the Avengers Kree-Skrull War.

297
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,680
Scott: Now, you know, when I was a kid, I read Marvel comics.

298
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,676
Scott: And nowadays, I still read a few bad Marvel comics and a few good ones, too.

299
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,780
Scott: But there's always references, especially in, like, the outer space.

300
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,759
Scott: Because I like the outer space ones, like Silver Surfers and Adam Warlock and whatnot.

301
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,099
Scott: And there's references to the Kree-Skrull War.

302
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,339
Scott: Like in Captain Marvel, you got it going on, you know.

303
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,319
Scott: And there's always these references to it.

304
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:25,520
Scott: But I've never actually read the Kree-Skrull War.

305
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,359
Scott: And I assumed maybe it's an old comic.

306
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,040
Scott: It's probably bad because I read Secret Wars and that was bad.

307
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:31,568
Scott: But I said, "You know what?

308
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,359
Scott: They're printing a new trade of it.

309
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:38,659
Scott: And I'll check it out and I'll see what actually happened in the Kree-Skrull

310
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:38,899
Scott: War.".

311
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,980
Rym: I imagine there's a lot of people declaring what they're about to do as they do it.

312
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,401
Scott: Yep.

313
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,800
Scott: Okay, we got another Marvel comic here, Deadpool Classic.

314
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,860
Scott: Now, Ian, our friend, was a huge fan of Deadpool, right?

315
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,431
Scott: And I recognize Deadpool.

316
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:53,279
Scott: I know what he looks like.

317
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:56,820
Scott: And I've only ever read, like, one or two Deadpool comics in my life.

318
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:02,440
Scott: And he's sort of just, like, you know, a really powerful mutant assassin badass guy.

319
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,480
Scott: Sort of like that '90s cable stylin', you know?

320
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Rym: See, for whatever reason, I liked cable.

321
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:09,148
Scott: Yeah.

322
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,740
Scott: That doesn't really appeal to me that much.

323
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Scott: What appeals to me is that it seems like Deadpool is, like, the wisecrackingest guy in the universe.

324
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,292
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

325
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:19,180
Rym: What about Spidey?

326
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,920
Scott: No, he's like Spidey times a thousand.

327
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:21,914
Rym: How could that be?

328
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:28,620
Scott: Trust me, you read a well-written Deadpool comic and it's like everything he says will have you peeing in your pants.

329
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
Scott: I've read, like, I swear to God.

330
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:32,780
Rym: Are you sure you're not just in continent?

331
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,510
Scott: I'm pretty sure, like...

332
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,659
Rym: Read some of this Transformers and see if you're peeing.

333
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,080
Scott: He's really, he's just that witty.

334
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,266
Scott: So, I said, "You know what?

335
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,540
Scott: I've never actually read a lot of Deadpool comics, you know, I've never actually...".

336
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,320
Scott: And they printed this Deadpool classic, volume one.

337
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,759
Scott: So I said, "What better way to check and see if, you know, my remembering Deadpool being hilarious was true than to buy this

338
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,100
Scott: volume?".

339
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:05,840
Scott: Okay, Jonah Hex, only the good die young, volume... I guess this is volume some number, but they don't put the number out of it, they're giving it a name, which is appropriate.

340
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,780
Scott: Because Jonah Hex is a Western comic that DC puts out, and it's sort of like, you know, it's a new one.

341
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,559
Scott: Like, Jonah Hex is actually a really old character, but this is sort of like, you know, a new series.

342
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:27,060
Scott: And it's really good because if you buy this in the issues as opposed to the trades, each issue is a standalone Western story and has nothing to do with the DC universe.

343
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,599
Scott: It's just a Western story about Jonah Hex, a badass cowboy with an ugly face.

344
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,274
Scott: And I buy it in the trades because it's cheaper and it's awesome.

345
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:37,720
Scott: I really can't go wrong.

346
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:47,687
Scott: I mean, if you want to read awesome Western stories where the main character happens to be a guy with a fucked up face, this is pretty much where it's at.

347
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,140
Scott: I could say this is like the best Western comic in print today.

348
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:52,283
Scott: All right.

349
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:58,017
Scott: You can't get there from here by Jason.

350
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,380
Scott: You can't get wrong with Jason.

351
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,130
Rym: Jason, I've never been disappointed by Jason.

352
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,536
Rym: I think the best one is still.

353
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,479
Rym: why are you doing this?

354
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,360
Scott: Why are you doing this really good?

355
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,840
Rym: That one really, really got to me.

356
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:10,722
Scott: It is.

357
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,548
Scott: But yeah, it's a Jason comic.

358
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,980
Scott: I'm going to buy every single one of these until we have every single one of these.

359
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Scott: And whenever a new one comes out, I'm going to buy that too.

360
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,200
Rym: They're fantastic.

361
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,339
Scott: And last book, Rabbi's Cat two.

362
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:24,999
Rym: I still got to read one.

363
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,463
Scott: I didn't even know this is coming.

364
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,787
Scott: It came out of nowhere.

365
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:28,268
Scott: Right.

366
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:32,860
Scott: This is by Joan Spahr, the dungeon guy, also the Klezmer guy.

367
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,662
Scott: Right.

368
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:37,678
Scott: Rabbi's Cat one was like a billion Eisner Award winning.

369
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,240
Scott: Awesome.

370
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,410
Scott: And I didn't even know there was going to be a two.

371
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:41,979
Scott: I wish he would do Klezmer two.

372
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,926
Scott: But yeah.

373
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,151
Scott: So it came out of nowhere.

374
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,460
Scott: and I said, how can I not order that?

375
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,247
Scott: It's like not ordering.

376
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,296
Scott: it would make you know, would be stupid.

377
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:52,300
Scott: It's like automatic.

378
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,805
Scott: So it is here.

379
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:55,873
Scott: I'll read it and I'll see what the deal is.

380
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,620
Scott: But it's kind of weird to think.

381
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,566
Scott: Rabbi's Cat two.

382
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,680
Scott: It's like Rabbi's Cat one was sort of a self-contained story.

383
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:04,252
Scott: So I really, really wonder what's going on here.

384
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,739
Scott: The cover is a little intriguing.

385
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,026
Scott: Looks sort of like a I don't know.

386
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:11,760
Scott: We'll find out what's going on with the rabbi and his cat.

387
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,079
Rym: So before we move on to the main.

388
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,188
Scott: That's Scott's box.

389
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:16,700
Scott: Scott's box for the month.

390
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,661
Rym: But before we go on, I do have a quick news for anyone who lives in, I don't know, New York City, L.A.

391
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:22,444
Rym: or Seattle.

392
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:27,080
Rym: Tokiwakakaru Shoujo, the girl left her time is being screened in all those cities this summer.

393
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,160
Rym: I'll link to it because it's actually in June and August.

394
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,806
Rym: So you'll forget if I say the dates now.

395
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:38,459
Rym: But if you live in one of those cities or Washington, it looks like, then I'd recommend you check this movie out if you've never seen it.

396
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,412
Scott: All right.

397
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:46,660
Rym: Things of the day.

398
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,310
Rym: I guess Scott can go first for once.

399
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,723
Scott: So I found this awesome flash game when I got home.

400
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:51,930
Rym: It's pretty awesome.

401
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,810
Scott: And on congregate congregate, if you don't know, is this really is pretty much the best site for flash games.

402
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:57,131
Scott: Right.

403
00:21:57,654 --> 00:21:58,800
Scott: And has like a social network.

404
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,945
Scott: It integrates to the Facebook.

405
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:00,850
Scott: It's got a little chat room.

406
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,710
Scott: It's good stuff, but it has achievements, which is the only bad part.

407
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,250
Scott: So they got this new flash game on there called Chrono Tron.

408
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,630
Scott: And Chrono Tron is a game unlike no other game I've ever played.

409
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,548
Scott: There might have been a game like it, but I never played it.

410
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,621
Scott: Basically, the concept is this is a platform game.

411
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,990
Scott: And in each map, each screen is one.

412
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,154
Scott: It's only one screen.

413
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,139
Scott: There's no scrolling.

414
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:21,400
Scott: Right.

415
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:23,490
Scott: You control this robot.

416
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,075
Scott: You can walk left and right.

417
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:25,736
Scott: Jump and duck.

418
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:28,203
Scott: That's it.

419
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,450
Scott: Every level you come out of this blue door.

420
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,157
Scott: It's sort of like a time elevator.

421
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,021
Scott: You're the chrono.

422
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:33,664
Scott: try to remember.

423
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:35,110
Scott: So, of course, time is going to be an element.

424
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:40,910
Scott: You go from the door and there's a green button somewhere in the room.

425
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,556
Scott: You have to touch that green button.

426
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:44,663
Scott: Then you have to go back in the door.

427
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:46,450
Scott: Sounds easy enough, right?

428
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,370
Scott: Walk, touch the button, walk, get in the door or maybe jump over an obstacle.

429
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,410
Scott: Well, the thing is, many of the obstacles are impossible to do because you only have one robot.

430
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:01,570
Scott: Like there'll be you'll have to step on a button to open a door and then also go in the door.

431
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,122
Scott: But if you get off the button, you know, the door closes.

432
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,409
Scott: Classic Zelda puzzle.

433
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:05,630
Scott: Right.

434
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,119
Scott: And how do you solve it in Zelda?

435
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,809
Scott: You put a brick on the button.

436
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,261
Scott: What if there's no brick to put on the button?

437
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,306
Scott: Then what do you do?

438
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,110
Rym: Well, you're fucked.

439
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,170
Scott: You're fucked, except in Chrono Tron, because in Chrono Tron, it's very interesting.

440
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:24,030
Scott: The way this works is you come out of the door, you step on the button, you wait, you go back in the door.

441
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:30,590
Scott: When you go back in the door, you're you're traveling back in time to when you started the level.

442
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:35,390
Scott: So you come out of the door and you see your former self go and stand on the button.

443
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:43,490
Scott: And now your current self, your present self goes in, touches the button on the wall while your former self is holding the door open.

444
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,496
Scott: Then you go back in the elevator.

445
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:48,750
Scott: Then your former self goes back in the elevator and poof, it takes you to the next level.

446
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,090
Rym: Now, the concept is absolutely amazing, but I feel like someone else is going to take this idea and make a game out of it.

447
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,674
Scott: They definitely need to take it.

448
00:23:56,774 --> 00:24:02,410
Scott: It's basically a proof of concept and it's a little flaky, but it's solid enough to be worth playing.

449
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,838
Scott: And it's solid enough to make you go, wow, holy shit.

450
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:08,570
Scott: Plus, there's some cool time paradox thingies that can happen.

451
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,839
Scott: Like you go into the past, right?

452
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,010
Scott: You have your past self walk to the left and walk to the right.

453
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:14,699
Scott: Then you come into the future.

454
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,290
Scott: Your past self walks to the left.

455
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,350
Scott: Then when your past self walks to the right, you open up a door, your past self falls in a hole and you close your past self in there.

456
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,181
Scott: Then you go back in the elevator.

457
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,590
Scott: Time paradox.

458
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:27,388
Rym: So what happens?

459
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:33,870
Scott: I didn't actually try to do that because it said do this to do a time paradox and instead of doing that, I just beat the level.

460
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,409
Scott: So I'm going to do it later and see what happens.

461
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,022
Rym: I can't believe you didn't do that.

462
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:38,366
Rym: It's like a...

463
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,787
Scott: I didn't figure out exact...

464
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,317
Rym: It's like you're going to choose your own adventure.

465
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:43,489
Rym: The first thing you do is read all the awesome deaths.

466
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:44,597
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

467
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,550
Scott: But anyway, I'll do it.

468
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,270
Rym: Or in Chrononauts, you go for that.

469
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,290
Scott: This is definitely a Flash game worth playing.

470
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:55,150
Rym: So my thing of the day, actually, Emily showed us this, but it's related tangentially, I guess.

471
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,983
Rym: You know, anime, manga, comics, anime.

472
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:57,810
Rym: It's an animation.

473
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:05,850
Rym: But this is called Evergreen and it's a music video from Anaboom and it's absolutely beautiful and it's great in every way.

474
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:06,730
Scott: Alright.

475
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:08,436
Rym: I don't really want to spoil anything.

476
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:08,978
Rym: Just watch it.

477
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,086
Rym: It's definitely worth clicking on and watching.

478
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:11,950
Rym: It's not even that long.

479
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,291
Rym: Yep.

480
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:15,404
Scott: Yeah, it's a high quality music video action.

481
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:16,749
Scott: You know, why not watch it?

482
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,690
Scott: You really got something better to do with those three minutes.

483
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:30,250
Rym: Well, considering that pretty much whenever we don't have enough time to watch a full movie or something, we'll sit down around the TV with the YouTubes and we'll pretty much drain the internet of everything good.

484
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:31,189
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

485
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:37,170
Rym: Of course, we have people like Emily who go to sites we don't go to, so they'll usually have all the things that we never would have seen otherwise.

486
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,677
Rym: Meanwhile, where does Scott go?

487
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:39,403
Rym: College humor.

488
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:40,310
Rym: We're already went.

489
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,301
Scott: Yeah, I like college humor.

490
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,010
Scott: They seem to have pretty consistent quality.

491
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,589
Rym: I like college humor a lot more than dig.

492
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,470
Scott: That's for sure.

493
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,168
Rym: I'll tell you that much.

494
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,610
Scott: Yeah.

495
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,890
Rym: So, free comic book day.

496
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:58,250
Scott: Yep, it was free comic book day and as I've done for the past few free comic book days, I go down to the Dragon's Den.

497
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,067
Rym: Well, I guess up.

498
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:05,410
Scott: Yeah, up to the Dragon's Den and unlike other comic book stores that put a limit on you, the limited Dragon's Den is one.

499
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:06,788
Scott: One each.

500
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:10,510
Scott: You get one of every free comic that they still have in stock if you want.

501
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:16,950
Scott: You can take, you know, I guess some people don't take one of each, but I take one of everything and my, my, was it a stack this year.

502
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,392
Scott: You know what?

503
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:21,130
Scott: We didn't even get every free comic that we possibly could have gotten.

504
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:32,229
Scott: I'm getting five free comic books, you know, from free comic book day in the next Scott's Box and like at least three of them were not at the Dragon's Den, but you'll hear about them next month on Scott's Box.

505
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:35,710
Rym: So, I think we're just going to jump right into this and kind of take turns bringing them up.

506
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:39,050
Scott: Yeah, basically what we did is I read like a handful of these.

507
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:46,870
Scott: Then I sort of gave a couple of the ones that I read to Rym and then we pretty much divided up the rest that I hadn't read.

508
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,329
Scott: So, a few of these we both read.

509
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:50,302
Rym: We had a draft.

510
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:57,590
Scott: Yeah, most of these only one of us have read and we did a draft which is sort of like, okay, you pick one, I pick one, you pick one, I pick one.

511
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,987
Scott: So that we sort of had even quality, at least judging the books by their covers, we had even quality, you know.

512
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:09,130
Scott: So, that way it wouldn't be like Scott reads all the awesome comics and Rym reads all the shit comics.

513
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,897
Rym: So, I get to read what?

514
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,150
Rym: NASCAR and Jughead.

515
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:11,833
Scott: You did.

516
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,227
Scott: Jughead's not bad.

517
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:13,490
Scott: Anyway.

518
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:14,950
Rym: Yeah, we'll get to that.

519
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,554
Scott: We'll get to it.

520
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,570
Scott: So, we're going to take, we're going to style start.

521
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:18,405
Rym: Okay.

522
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,148
Scott: You want to start?

523
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:20,930
Rym: I'm like, go ahead, go ahead.

524
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,510
Scott: So, the first comic I read and we're probably going to do this in, I don't know, I sort of have mine in semi-quality order here.

525
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,670
Rym: Mine are in random order.

526
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:30,965
Scott: Maybe I'll shuffle mine up, but I'm going to start with Gumby.

527
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:31,590
Scott: You read the Gumby?

528
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:32,869
Rym: I read the Gumby.

529
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:38,070
Scott: Yeah, the Eisner, Gumby actually won an Eisner award for best like kids comic.

530
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,670
Scott: And I read this Gumby and now I see why.

531
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:48,070
Scott: I mean, this, this isn't like the same as the Gumby that I remember watching on TV as a kid.

532
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:50,570
Scott: It's definitely way different than that, right?

533
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:55,121
Scott: But it's really cute and sort of, you know, like Powerpuff.

534
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,430
Scott: Girls would sometimes have jokes that only adults will get and kids won't get.

535
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:01,110
Scott: Like Mojo Jojo locked in jail with Bubba.

536
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,350
Scott: Only kids won't get that joke, but adults go, oh man, this Gumby has a lot of that kind of stuff going on.

537
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,008
Scott: And it's actually, this is also a coloring book and I kind of feel like coloring it in.

538
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:15,310
Rym: I don't know.

539
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:23,710
Rym: I mean, this is one that I also read and it was okay, but it, it had a little bit, it reeked of SpongeBob humor just a little bit.

540
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,728
Rym: It seems like most of that, well, at least this one, maybe not other Gumby, but this one, there was a lot of that kind of, yay.

541
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:35,270
Scott: There was a bit of yay, but there were, and those parts were kind of eh.

542
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:37,969
Scott: But there were also some funny parts like.

543
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:39,479
Rym: There were two good jokes.

544
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:40,670
Rym: There was one really good joke.

545
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,709
Rym: There's the one with the crayons.

546
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,444
Rym: Where he finds the crayons in the thing and then how he reacts to that.

547
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:46,950
Rym: That was, that was actually really funny.

548
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,421
Scott: The ending I think was lame though.

549
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:49,430
Scott: The ending was way lame.

550
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,730
Rym: Oh yeah, most definitely.

551
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,523
Scott: Actually in the back, there's these two really good like pinups.

552
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:56,590
Scott: One is like Gumby, but he's King Kong.

553
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:00,590
Scott: And the other one is like Gumby, but he's Sinbad and he's fighting a skeleton.

554
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:03,310
Rym: Yeah, I just, I don't know if I'd ever read any more Gumby.

555
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,518
Scott: No, it's a kids' comic.

556
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:05,829
Rym: I'm not actually suggesting to read.

557
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,486
Rym: I think there are better kids' comics too.

558
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:07,810
Rym: It was just.

559
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:09,178
Scott: I don't know if there's better.

560
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,710
Scott: There's not that many better kids' comics.

561
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,011
Rym: It reeked.

562
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:13,850
Rym: It's just, there was a little too much of that SpongeBob in there.

563
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,769
Rym: I really don't like that SpongeBob.

564
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:22,470
Scott: I, you know, I actually don't know what the, I know there is a SpongeBob and it's a popular kids' show, but I've never watched it, so I don't know about it.

565
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,689
Rym: I saw two episodes.

566
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,848
Scott: Except I know the song because when you go to minor league hockey games in Bridgeport, they play the song fucking every game.

567
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:30,490
Scott: It's really annoying.

568
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:37,010
Rym: Right, so, Transformers Animated is, is, is garbage.

569
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:43,490
Rym: I can't even, first off, I'm not going to nitpick here, but you look at the front cover, right?

570
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:51,970
Rym: And all the proportions are kind of off and it looks kind of weird, but one guy's face, I don't know who this bot is, but he's big and green.

571
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,110
Rym: I don't know if they just like rip this straight from.

572
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:56,729
Scott: What kind of, what kind of car does he look like?

573
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,189
Rym: It doesn't look like a car at all.

574
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:58,650
Scott: Okay.

575
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,550
Rym: He's big and green and his head looks like it's flat and squashed up against him.

576
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,910
Scott: Is that Ironhide maybe?

577
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:05,430
Scott: I don't know.

578
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,810
Rym: The shadows, it's like, it just, it's awful.

579
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:15,890
Rym: Like it looks like they kind of, pretty much what I think they did is they took the animated show and they kind of made an animanga from it.

580
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:29,850
Rym: That's what it looks like because there's a lot of, every time there's an action scene, it kind of just cuts to this overview where someone like a ray of energy shoots out of the Allspire directly into her dog bot chewed key card and changes it into something spectacular.

581
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:32,990
Rym: But the sound had drawn the attention of Optimus Prime.

582
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,790
Rym: And it just, it's awful.

583
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,669
Rym: It's absolutely awful.

584
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,350
Rym: It looks terrible.

585
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:47,310
Rym: It looks like they poorly ripped like screenshots from a cartoon, threw them together into a comic, put some bad dialogue in and hit done.

586
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,750
Scott: I've read a few of the Transformers comics, but some of the more serious ones.

587
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,269
Rym: Oh, those are a lot better than this.

588
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,710
Scott: I've read like Spotlight Shockwave and that was okay.

589
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,627
Scott: Spotlight Soundwave was also okay.

590
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,310
Rym: This also just doesn't make any sense.

591
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,750
Rym: It's like people are talking and then they're in a factory.

592
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,750
Scott: Well, I mean, a few free comic days ago, they had that one that was like the Pokemon Transformers.

593
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:08,929
Scott: That was better.

594
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,949
Scott: Capture all the mini cons or whatnot.

595
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,230
Rym: But like they're talking and then they're in a factory and then suddenly there's a giant ant larva.

596
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:22,150
Rym: And then suddenly the Autobots are fighting the giant ant larva and it just goes, it doesn't make sense.

597
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:25,169
Rym: And Optimus Prime has a really, really, really narrow waist.

598
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:28,330
Rym: I have nothing else to say about that comic.

599
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,769
Rym: That was not worth my time.

600
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:30,659
Scott: Okay.

601
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:31,750
Scott: Let's see here.

602
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,630
Scott: I read the Dark Horse Hellboy free comic book day.

603
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:42,670
Scott: Now, the only Hellboy I actually know is like the movie, which I don't remember why I saw it, but I saw it back at RIT.

604
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:49,587
Scott: Now actually, you open up and in the front page of this comic, there's a mashup of Hellboy and Futurama characters.

605
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:50,630
Scott: that is pretty awesome.

606
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,060
Rym: Not bad.

607
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,714
Scott: Not bad.

608
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,230
Scott: So already we're off to a good start.

609
00:31:53,731 --> 00:32:03,130
Scott: Then we get sort of like this Hellboy comic that's actually like, it's like made 10 or so pages and it's a complete story beginning to end.

610
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:05,387
Scott: But the ending was a little meh.

611
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,281
Scott: But it was good.

612
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,330
Scott: The art was really good.

613
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:10,150
Scott: But story wise, there wasn't a lot.

614
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:19,030
Scott: I mean, I don't know how much you can do in so few pages, but it didn't really sort of introduce me to Hellboy or give me an idea if I'm going to like Hellboy comics or not.

615
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:23,470
Scott: It just sort of told me Hellboy comics have good art, which I guess is a good thing.

616
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:27,389
Scott: And then there were two more stories in here.

617
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:27,932
Scott: Right.

618
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:31,230
Scott: That are not Hellboy, but they're by Mike Mignola, who's the Hellboy guy.

619
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:33,770
Scott: The first one was called Out of Reach.

620
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:34,552
Scott: Right.

621
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:40,390
Scott: And this seemed kind of interesting, like the characters and some of the what was going on.

622
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:47,110
Scott: It's about like this robot kind of person and they don't really and there's some sort of military group or they're on a mission.

623
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,930
Scott: But the robot gets left behind for some reason and it's not too happy about it.

624
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,401
Scott: But then it's just sort of contrived.

625
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,169
Scott: It's like, oh, where did the knife go?

626
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,063
Scott: Obviously, the robot has it.

627
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:58,588
Scott: The end.

628
00:32:59,352 --> 00:32:59,899
Scott: Uh huh.

629
00:32:59,919 --> 00:32:59,960
Scott: OK.

630
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:12,490
Scott: And the third story was Bishop Olek's Devil, which was sort of a standard Lovecraftian sort of Necronomicon story.

631
00:33:13,353 --> 00:33:15,110
Scott: And I kind of like this little story here.

632
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:22,030
Scott: It's pretty much, hey, you know, there's a guy and, you know, we're going to check out what's going on in his mansion.

633
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,602
Scott: Oh, he's old and sick and he wants us to take his scary book.

634
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,750
Scott: Let's not take a scary book just yet.

635
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,757
Scott: Oh, what's that noise we hear at night?

636
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,870
Scott: Oh, look, there's a horrible monster that rapes him like every night.

637
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:34,594
Scott: Let's take the book away.

638
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:38,570
Scott: Oh, look, now the boss is coming to rape me because it rapes whoever has the book every night.

639
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,293
Scott: This is just great.

640
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:43,790
Scott: And it's pretty much if you get the book, you get awesome powers from having the book.

641
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:46,120
Scott: But this monster will rape you every night.

642
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,550
Scott: So literally, somewhat literally.

643
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,561
Rym: Yeah, that that sounds like a bad fanfic.

644
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:52,464
Scott: No, but it's.

645
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:52,745
Scott: it's.

646
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:53,970
Scott: it's pretty cool.

647
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,234
Scott: Lovecraftian kind of.

648
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,279
Rym: Oh, I like the Lovecraftian.

649
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,630
Rym: I'm just I'm dubious of this whole rape element.

650
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:01,505
Scott: I'm not sure if it's raping, but it does something to you every night.

651
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,410
Scott: that's quite unpleasant.

652
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:08,650
Scott: It's like a giant starfish kind of monster only with hands on the end of its stars.

653
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,813
Rym: Edge is great.

654
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:10,799
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good.

655
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:11,905
Scott: I like this Lovecraft stuff.

656
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:12,889
Scott: So, of course, I'm going to like that.

657
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,899
Rym: So speaking of something I like, that's all that we got.

658
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,449
Rym: Walt Disney's gyro gear loose.

659
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,534
Scott: I wanted that one.

660
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:19,096
Scott: You got to give me that.

661
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:19,719
Scott: It's like, you know what?

662
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,810
Rym: It's pretty much just more Scrooge McDuck.

663
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,837
Rym: But it follows gyro gear loose.

664
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:27,010
Rym: He was kind of dopey, absentminded professor.

665
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,139
Scott: I was kind of liked him on DuckTales.

666
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,347
Rym: I liked him a lot on DuckTales.

667
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:30,809
Rym: Didn't it?

668
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:33,679
Rym: Was he the one who actually made the that Mecca duck?

669
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,850
Scott: What I think he did make it was a gizmo duck.

670
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,935
Rym: Yeah, gizmo duck.

671
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:38,275
Scott: He made.

672
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:39,783
Scott: I think he made the gizmo duck.

673
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,130
Scott: But that other guy wore the gizmo.

674
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,940
Rym: Because he accidentally said the word that no one was supposed to say.

675
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:44,824
Scott: Exactly.

676
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:46,429
Rym: I forget what the word was suffering.

677
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,072
Scott: I didn't like.

678
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:50,290
Scott: See, I liked gizmo duck, but I didn't like the guy in it when he wasn't in it.

679
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,940
Rym: Well, because he was lame and moto.

680
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:53,330
Rym: I know, which is kind of the point.

681
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,790
Rym: One thing I got to say about gyro is that his is just a Robocop parody.

682
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,845
Rym: His little light bulb robot dude is a lot smarter than he is.

683
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:02,528
Rym: Oh, yeah.

684
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:04,273
Scott: Oh, of course.

685
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:04,835
Scott: I love that guy.

686
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:05,517
Rym: Love that guy, too.

687
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:05,938
Rym: Yeah.

688
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,430
Rym: But this is if you like that Scrooge McDuck action, which you probably should.

689
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:10,635
Rym: This is pretty good.

690
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,870
Scott: Yet Disney Comics, like you might think, ah, Disney Comics.

691
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,490
Scott: Disney Comics are probably the only good Disney thing there still is.

692
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,480
Scott: I mean, you know, all I ever wanted from Disney.

693
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:20,761
Scott: Right.

694
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:23,410
Scott: I was like, Disney, you have Mickey Mouse fucking everywhere.

695
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,903
Scott: When was the last time you actually made a Mickey Mouse movie?

696
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,049
Scott: What, fucking Prince and the Pauper?

697
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:27,791
Scott: Right.

698
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:28,556
Scott: Bring it on.

699
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:30,247
Scott: Where are the fucking Mickey Mouse movies?

700
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:30,690
Scott: You know what?

701
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,917
Rym: I never I never expected a diatribe.

702
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,610
Rym: Please make more Mickey Mouse movies to be so infused with the word fuck.

703
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:39,392
Scott: Exactly.

704
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:44,610
Scott: So the place to get the Mickey Mouse Donald Duck real Disney stories is in the comics.

705
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,238
Scott: They don't animate them anymore because they suck.

706
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,390
Scott: But the comics are still good.

707
00:35:48,430 --> 00:36:03,310
Scott: And if you like, you know, watching like old quality Disney animations with the actual Disney characters, then you'll like Disney Comics, especially if it's a Scrooge or Duck story that is by Carl Barks or by Don Rosa.

708
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,518
Scott: Those are like the best ones.

709
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:05,767
Scott: All right.

710
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:06,149
Scott: Let's see.

711
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:11,586
Scott: We got from the pages of Wizard, the comics magazine, which is already.

712
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:12,850
Scott: you can see this is going downhill.

713
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:18,630
Scott: How to draw and for as someone who can't draw.

714
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,050
Scott: I'm not sure how if this is telling me how to draw a good way or a bad way.

715
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:31,590
Scott: And this really doesn't seem like it's going to be this free comic book anyway is going to be a big help in teaching how to draw.

716
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:36,790
Scott: It's mostly an advertisement for you to buy the actual how to draw books that they sell.

717
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:45,270
Scott: And as teaching me how to draw, you know, I've never had I've tried a few how to draw things in my day.

718
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,470
Scott: None of them have been very helpful, but that just might be my fault.

719
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:58,330
Scott: So but when I look at this, there's a lot of really cool like pencil art in here by real comic creators.

720
00:36:58,671 --> 00:36:59,353
Scott: Right.

721
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:06,010
Scott: And you look at it and I always, you know, with superhero comic art, especially you look at the pencils.

722
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:13,410
Scott: And these days it's like it feels like back in the day that the pencils would be sort of rough and the inking would be like the full real deal.

723
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,310
Scott: But nowadays, it seems like the people doing the penciling are like going full on.

724
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:24,229
Scott: And the anchors really are more tracers than they used to be, even though they're not totally traces and not all of them are.

725
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:31,770
Scott: So, you know, when you look at pencil art, I think the pencil art these days is better than the finished art.

726
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,450
Scott: And I wish that they would just have the guys do the pencils and then print that instead of coloring over it.

727
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:42,550
Scott: Because whenever I look at like original pencils for like modern superhero comics, I say, holy shit, that's amazing.

728
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:50,990
Scott: Why did the comic look like shit when the actual printed one, you know, and this is full of a lot of that pencil art that I like so much.

729
00:37:51,631 --> 00:38:00,250
Scott: And I want to sort of tie something else into this, which is the other free comic book by Dynamite, which is The Death Defying Devilman.

730
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:08,990
Scott: Now, Dedede Devilman, I thought this Devilman would sort of be, you know, the the going a guy Devilman.

731
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:11,710
Rym: You really expected to be the going a guy Devilman.

732
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,390
Scott: It's not the going a guy Devilman.

733
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,590
Scott: And I wonder if there's some sort of lawsuit that's going to happen.

734
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:24,190
Scott: But what this is and actually I didn't realize it is Alex Ross, you know, the amazing kingdom come Marvel's art guy.

735
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:24,774
Scott: Right.

736
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,490
Scott: Who does the super painting comics.

737
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:37,390
Scott: He has this project called Project Superpowers, which sort of is taking all these old Golden Age characters and putting them together in like one story, you know, and sort of doing a thing.

738
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:41,490
Scott: But now it seems like I bought the first or zero issue with that.

739
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,348
Scott: It was pretty bad.

740
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:45,810
Scott: I didn't realize this goes along with that.

741
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:51,610
Scott: This is sort of like the same thing, but it's the story of like concentrating on the Devilman character in that.

742
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:56,650
Scott: And this is also pretty bad and sort of lame.

743
00:38:57,231 --> 00:39:08,850
Scott: But what really gets me about this is I remember when I read that Project Superpowers thing, right, is they had in there like the pencils from the art and the pencils were amazing.

744
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,190
Scott: And the actual art in this book looks sort of average.

745
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,950
Scott: And I mean, Alex Ross isn't doing the art, but he's doing the plot cover and art direction.

746
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:23,870
Scott: And I think that he should just fire the colors to the anchor and just have the pencils be printed directly.

747
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,390
Scott: And I would buy this just for the art if they did that.

748
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,458
Scott: But oh, well, it's just a bleh superhero comic.

749
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:36,730
Scott: that really sort of, I think, would only appeal to people who have Golden Age superhero comic nostalgia.

750
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:42,810
Rym: So to get away from Golden Age superhero nostalgia at all, Sonic the Hedgehog.

751
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,310
Scott: Oh, you got the Sonic comic.

752
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:46,470
Rym: There are a lot of Sonic comics.

753
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,910
Scott: Sonic comics are real popular.

754
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,842
Rym: Well, I kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog.

755
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:50,950
Rym: I like him and all his friends.

756
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,487
Scott: He's all right.

757
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,709
Rym: But so let me take you through this.

758
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,375
Rym: Page one, Dr.

759
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,350
Rym: Robotnik has a rope around Sonic's neck and hangs him.

760
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,092
Scott: Yes.

761
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:01,990
Scott: Sweet.

762
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:02,746
Rym: Panel two.

763
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,610
Rym: While he's choking to death, he yells at him.

764
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,689
Rym: And in panel three, he kills it.

765
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:09,964
Scott: All right.

766
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,970
Rym: Then it turns out it was just a pinata.

767
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,350
Rym: And let me tell you, this is like the worst comic of the lot.

768
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:17,630
Scott: Oh, really?

769
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,010
Scott: Worse than the NASCAR heroes?

770
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,770
Rym: Well, it might have sounded, I don't know, funny or weird.

771
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:25,690
Rym: It's just it's drawn really, really badly.

772
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,735
Rym: Well, I think that it's.

773
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:28,870
Rym: no, it's not like other Sonics are drawn really well.

774
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:36,227
Rym: This is drawn in that kind of super cheap, super off model, no backgrounds, like just really, really.

775
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:38,109
Rym: It's awful.

776
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:39,449
Scott: That's sad.

777
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:40,469
Rym: And the story is dumb.

778
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,890
Rym: And it's even for a little kid.

779
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,749
Rym: I can't imagine a little kid enjoying this at all.

780
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:44,670
Scott: All right.

781
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,450
Scott: We need to pick up the pace here, I think a little bit.

782
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:46,683
Scott: Do we?

783
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:47,021
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:47,670
Scott: All right.

785
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:48,870
Scott: I went along with the last one.

786
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,130
Scott: All right.

787
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,510
Scott: So we got Bongo comics free for all.

788
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,450
Scott: You might be thinking, what the hell's Bongo comics?

789
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,810
Scott: Bongo is the soup of the Simpsons Futurama type comics of awesome.

790
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,590
Scott: Now, this it's funny because I don't buy any Simpsons or Futurama comics.

791
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:04,989
Scott: Right.

792
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:09,990
Scott: But every year I read the free comic book of it and I really like it.

793
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,790
Scott: And this year, more than ever before.

794
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:17,132
Scott: And the best thing about this year's Simpsons comic offering is that they actually.

795
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:21,407
Scott: this actually helps me figure out like what Simpsons comics are published.

796
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:23,870
Scott: It's like there's a Simpsons comic monthly.

797
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,570
Scott: There's a Bart Simpson bi-monthly.

798
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:29,490
Scott: There's a Futurama comics bi-monthly.

799
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,270
Scott: There's a Simpsons super spectacular that's bi-annual.

800
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:38,928
Scott: There's a Simpsons treasure trove that's going to be digest size coming this summer.

801
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,510
Scott: Sixty four pages each.

802
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,428
Scott: So like this teaches me about all the different Simpsons comic buying options.

803
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,709
Scott: And I'm thinking, I like this.

804
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:47,930
Scott: I like Simpsons.

805
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:51,330
Scott: I might actually be buying some Simpsons comics soon.

806
00:41:51,490 --> 00:42:04,009
Scott: And the best part, actually, is at the end of this thing, there's a Simpsons and a manga parody that does a manga style Simpsons called Oui Oui called Bartamu.

807
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:20,110
Scott: And all you need to know is looking at the first page and it's like anime style and Bart like hitting a baseball while Nelson the catcher is like wind from swing is like kamikaze.

808
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:21,670
Scott: So mighty is its presumption.

809
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,688
Scott: And then comic book guy, the umpire, is taking off his mask and he says best hit ever.

810
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:31,690
Scott: Yeah, it's I like this action.

811
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,895
Scott: I think I might be buying.

812
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:36,330
Scott: maybe I'll get those digest size Simpsons treasure trove.

813
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:37,228
Scott: That looks pretty good.

814
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,068
Rym: All right.

815
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,530
Rym: So I don't think I need to say this is good, but Atomic Robo is fantastic.

816
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:48,610
Rym: I don't think you understand how up my alley Atomic Robo.

817
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:51,629
Scott: I got all six issues of it in the other room.

818
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:57,710
Rym: Plus, remember, Atomic Robo, in case any of you forgot, is by Brian Clevenger, the eight bit theater guy.

819
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,770
Rym: And let me tell you, eight bit theater.

820
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:08,849
Rym: I feel like what that guy did is he made eight bit theater and he learned a lot about characterization and like how to make a good comic and good characters from it.

821
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,470
Scott: He definitely has the writing skills.

822
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,709
Scott: I still want to read his freakin atomic whatever book, Atomic Age or whatever it's called.

823
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,510
Rym: So he took everything you learn from that and from other things he's done.

824
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,410
Rym: and Atomic Robo is just great.

825
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,410
Rym: There's there's a little bit of Black Mage in Atomic Robo.

826
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,730
Scott: I think there's a little bit of like a lot of characters in Atomic Robo.

827
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,130
Scott: He's sort of an Indiana Jones Spider-Man Black Mage robot.

828
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:31,829
Rym: A little bit of Batman, too.

829
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:32,970
Rym: A little Batman, too.

830
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,327
Rym: I just I love the little Dr.

831
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,289
Scott: McNinja action.

832
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,044
Scott: The expressions on his face are priceless.

833
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,010
Scott: Even though he's a robot who has no expressions.

834
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,789
Rym: But he does.

835
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,450
Scott: But the art in Atomic Robo is like amazing.

836
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:50,249
Scott: I first saw the real art at Kinetic Con because they were sitting next to the Apple Geeks table and they showed me the art.

837
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,030
Scott: He had like a hole in his big portfolio.

838
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:53,467
Rym: Oh, my God.

839
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,009
Scott: Atomic Robo is like so great.

840
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:03,710
Rym: Irrespective of any of the other Atomic Robos, this one, the free comic book day one, a complete story start to finish is great.

841
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:05,390
Scott: Yeah, I'm definitely got to read that.

842
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,670
Scott: It's the only Atomic Robo I haven't read.

843
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,570
Rym: It's about a Soviet madman.

844
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,670
Scott: Oh, that's not in these six issues.

845
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,010
Scott: So I guess it's really good to get my hands on that.

846
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:14,128
Rym: And I like how it ends.

847
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:15,090
Rym: All right.

848
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,710
Rym: And also in this, they included Neozoic, which obviously that's another thing published by Red Five Comics.

849
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,269
Rym: Yeah, obviously they're trying to promote it.

850
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:23,288
Rym: It's it's OK.

851
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,570
Rym: It's kind of like well drawn, but kind of generic fantasy.

852
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:30,690
Rym: But fantasy with a little bit of a high tech edge.

853
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:32,470
Rym: So I'll have to read more before I pass judgment.

854
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,048
Rym: But I kind of like it.

855
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,849
Scott: You want you want me to order you some Neozoic?

856
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:36,850
Rym: Yeah, why not?

857
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:37,587
Rym: I kind of like it.

858
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:38,090
Rym: All right.

859
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:39,229
Rym: I don't know if it'll be good.

860
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:41,210
Scott: I'll see if there's a trade or something.

861
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:47,548
Rym: It does the thing that always I always get a little irked when dragons are just like dumb animals as opposed to the awesome things there in D&D.

862
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:48,403
Rym: But yeah.

863
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,450
Scott: It's got kind of spoiled on those dragons.

864
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,350
Rym: And yeah, I'm used to a gold dragon.

865
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,610
Scott: But I think the balance is to have the really smart dragons, but had to be really rare.

866
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,969
Scott: But then because everyone likes seeing dragons all the time, you should have like dumb worm type creatures that people can fly around like Lindwurms.

867
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:05,628
Scott: Exactly.

868
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,650
Rym: Lindwurms don't have wings.

869
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:07,528
Rym: They can't really fly out.

870
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,027
Rym: But anyway, they're both pretty good.

871
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:10,948
Scott: OK.

872
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,830
Rym: Red five just seems to be busting out.

873
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:13,065
Rym: Yeah.

874
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,930
Scott: Red five is like sort relatively new publisher, relatively high quality.

875
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:17,508
Scott: All right.

876
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,549
Scott: Tiny Titans.

877
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:23,790
Rym: You know, I almost liked Teen Titans.

878
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,789
Rym: I decided I didn't.

879
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:32,250
Rym: But it took me two episodes of the show to realize that my problem with with Tiny Titans is that I don't know the Teen Titans at all.

880
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:46,689
Scott: Like I know Robin and I can kind of tell by looking at them like, OK, that's kid Flash and that's kid aqua kid and that's little Wonder Woman and that's, you know, a little green arrow guy, but he's red.

881
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:51,350
Scott: But then it's like, OK, robot dude, green kid, semi.

882
00:45:51,650 --> 00:46:00,190
Scott: It's like Wonder Woman girl with blond hair girl who is the same color as like an X-Men sentinel little devil guy and girl with an X on her chest.

883
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,548
Scott: So I don't know any of them are.

884
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:07,649
Scott: But that didn't seem to matter because the art in this was just really cute and it was really silly.

885
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:16,749
Scott: But some of the jokes I didn't get because I didn't know the characters like this one joke where it's like, you know, oh, we're going to have a substitute teacher to substitute principal today.

886
00:46:17,053 --> 00:46:17,277
Scott: It's Mr.

887
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:17,929
Scott: Slade.

888
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:19,010
Scott: Hello, students.

889
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:23,810
Scott: And then one girl in the class is like, my dad's the principal is so embarrassing.

890
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,370
Scott: But I don't know who the girl was or who the dad was.

891
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,328
Scott: So I didn't laugh.

892
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:31,590
Scott: But the second one is the green kid who I learned as Beast Boy.

893
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:34,829
Scott: And he goes and gets a dog and the dog won't play with him.

894
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,526
Scott: But then he turns into a green dog because he is turning into a dog.

895
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:39,589
Scott: powers that it's happy, cute.

896
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:39,894
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:40,834
Scott: Yeah.

898
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:42,489
Scott: So I like that action.

899
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:44,810
Scott: Then the next one I also liked.

900
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,490
Scott: It was a funny story with like, you know, Robin.

901
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:50,210
Scott: And he's like, hey, your name is Speedy.

902
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:51,109
Scott: Can you run fast?

903
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:52,789
Scott: No, I shoot arrows.

904
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,910
Scott: Then the flash kid is right behind him.

905
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:56,389
Scott: So he's like, hey, flash kid.

906
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,428
Scott: And the flash kids looks like, yep.

907
00:46:58,211 --> 00:46:59,650
Rym: OK, that's kind of lame.

908
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:00,370
Scott: I like that.

909
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:00,790
Rym: I'm sorry.

910
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,889
Rym: Maybe, you know, maybe describing it doesn't quite do it.

911
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:04,589
Scott: No, it doesn't.

912
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,550
Scott: It's pretty much just cute and happy.

913
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,410
Scott: And there's some jokes about wearing jeans and playing with dolls.

914
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:10,210
Rym: All right.

915
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,130
Rym: So broken Trinity prelude.

916
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:17,290
Rym: I I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what the hell this was about.

917
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,150
Rym: To be honest, there's a lot of words and the art was kind of generic.

918
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:22,910
Rym: And then at the end, it looked like it was just Witchblade.

919
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:28,530
Scott: But if I had one thing to say about this, I actually say the new Witchblade comic is not like Witchblade.

920
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:29,150
Rym: All right.

921
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,167
Rym: So I'm looking at a big spread about the Witchblade comic.

922
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:41,407
Rym: And if one thing summed up like the selling points of it based on this promotional picture, it is tits.

923
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:48,346
Rym: She has gigantic breasts, like to the point that they stand out painfully to.

924
00:47:48,948 --> 00:47:51,390
Rym: nipples are exposed through the shirt, which is unnecessary.

925
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,410
Rym: Three, she's grabbing one of them and she's like squeezing it.

926
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,208
Rym: And I don't know what kind of consistency this thing has, but she has put quite a dent into it.

927
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:01,670
Rym: It is surprising.

928
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:03,430
Rym: It does not look comfortable.

929
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,530
Rym: I don't think Witchblade is good.

930
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,029
Rym: I think it's just big tits.

931
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,570
Scott: Well, the my theory, I have a thinking going on now.

932
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,730
Scott: It's like, OK, if a comic or something has lots of boobs in it, right.

933
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:17,370
Scott: They made a conscious decision to put those boobs there, right?

934
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:23,250
Scott: If the thing you have, your comic, your anime or whatever is good, why would you put boobs in it?

935
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,148
Scott: That would only cheapen it.

936
00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:25,749
Scott: Well, they can't remember it.

937
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:31,589
Rym: The only possibility is they're pulling a chareau, right, pulling out the best scenario.

938
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,734
Scott: And that's still.

939
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:35,850
Rym: I've got to trick people into reading my philosophy and sci fi.

940
00:48:36,471 --> 00:48:41,370
Rym: I'm going to put jiggly butts and then around the jiggly butts will be science fiction.

941
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:46,770
Rym: OK, but the other thing, all the art in this is just that kind of fantasy art.

942
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:52,549
Rym: I hate of like semi naked women with chainmail bikinis straddling swords with snakes around their necks.

943
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:53,108
Rym: It's just crap.

944
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:53,910
Scott: All right.

945
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,423
Scott: Del Rey and Dabble Brothers, 2008 preview.

946
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,470
Scott: Now, this is one of those.

947
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,043
Scott: I hate these because they do these on free comic book day.

948
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:07,949
Scott: instead of actually giving you like a whole bunch of one comic where you can sort of get your teeth into it and decide if you like it or not.

949
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:11,290
Scott: They give you like a tiny bit of a bunch of different comics.

950
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:14,189
Scott: So you have no idea what they're about or if they're good or not.

951
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:14,567
Scott: Right.

952
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:20,910
Scott: So we've got, let's see, Dresden Files, Wild Cards, Frankenstein and In God We Trust.

953
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:25,628
Scott: So this is Jim Butcher, George R. Martin, Dean Koontz and Dean Koontz.

954
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,246
Rym: Dean Koontz?

955
00:49:27,794 --> 00:49:27,983
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:30,830
Rym: I used to read a lot of Dean Koontz novels as a kid.

957
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:39,650
Scott: Basically, what we've got here is we've got people making comics based on, you know, books and TV shows or whatever in order to try to get sales.

958
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,430
Scott: It's like a licensed property deal, right?

959
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:48,750
Rym: I wonder if they'll ever get together and just make a comic about strangers, which was an OK novel that Dean Koontz wrote, except for the fact that the end is the stupidest thing ever.

960
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:51,230
Scott: Anyway, the Dresden Files one makes no sense.

961
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,746
Scott: Scott Johnson had to explain it to me.

962
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,050
Scott: Wild Cards, completely lame.

963
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:00,390
Scott: All I got from it was it's sort of like X-Men, only the mutants are ugly.

964
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:10,729
Scott: Then we got Frankenstein, a sort of Frankenstein story that sort of got a little B. Shonen twist on it.

965
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,690
Scott: But the art is all sort of ugly.

966
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:13,689
Scott: It's a little eh.

967
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:22,980
Scott: And then the in God we trust, actually, the art is sort of like this black and white manga styling like U.S.

968
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,890
Scott: sort of mix up kind of thing.

969
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:32,342
Scott: And this could actually, you know, regardless of the art, the story was seemed a little bit like Silence of the Lambs.

970
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:34,050
Scott: ish kinds of story almost.

971
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,842
Scott: And I don't know, I'm a little little intrigued by.

972
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:39,314
Scott: I don't know if I'll buy it, but it's a little.

973
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,208
Scott: maybe it's got something to it.

974
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:42,809
Scott: Maybe we'll check it out.

975
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:44,348
Scott: I like some of the characters in it.

976
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:45,131
Rym: All right.

977
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,310
Rym: So real quick, Jughead, generic Archie comic.

978
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:50,030
Rym: It's there's really nothing there.

979
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:51,129
Rym: But if you like that sort of thing.

980
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:51,571
Scott: Yeah.

981
00:50:52,093 --> 00:50:55,710
Rym: Amelia rules is I don't think I would read it.

982
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,029
Rym: This is definitely aimed at kids.

983
00:50:57,411 --> 00:51:01,009
Rym: There's not much for, I don't know, anyone over the age of 12 to get out of it.

984
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,090
Rym: But I feel like it's not that bad for a certain like demographic of 10 to 12 year olds.

985
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:09,910
Rym: Yeah, it's an OK, solid story, you know, touches on issues a little bit.

986
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,430
Rym: Doesn't get too deep into it.

987
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:19,569
Rym: I don't know what the deal is with all these other Amelia rules things, because halfway through, well, near the end, it cuts to all these photographs and I don't get it.

988
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:28,490
Rym: But I think there's a lot of other Amelia rules stuff that I don't know about since I'm not really connected to the current Nickelodeon generation is even a Nickelodeon thing.

989
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,014
Rym: I don't think so.

990
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:30,590
Scott: But I don't even know what Amelia rules is.

991
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:31,277
Rym: I don't know either.

992
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,409
Rym: All I know is it's OK.

993
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:33,868
Rym: OK, it's a kid's thing.

994
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,493
Scott: So check it out.

995
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,589
Scott: I got this one graphic classics.

996
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:42,115
Scott: And this is actually really cool because it's free, but it's a lot of pages and there's almost no ad.

997
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,250
Scott: There's basically no ads in it except for it for itself.

998
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:54,010
Scott: And what this is, is you got a story by Po, a story by Beers, a story by Lord Dunsany, I like a story by Conan Doyle and a story by Mary Shelley.

999
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:56,909
Scott: But these aren't stories that most people are likely to know.

1000
00:51:57,491 --> 00:52:02,990
Scott: And they took short stories by these people and they just made comics to those stories.

1001
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:11,716
Scott: And the best one is the Ambrose Pierce one about the diet called Diagnosis with the monkey and the oyster.

1002
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:13,589
Scott: That is, it's one page is the best one.

1003
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:22,950
Scott: But the rest of it, you know, the stories are quality and there's like different artists on each story and they sort of some of the art I think is better than some of the other art.

1004
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,101
Scott: But definitely not a gyp.

1005
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,630
Scott: They could have charged me money for this.

1006
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:30,110
Scott: And actually they got the ads for all their other graphic classics.

1007
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:35,279
Scott: And I'm thinking, huh, maybe I'll get the fantasy classics or maybe just like the H.G.

1008
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,707
Scott: Wells ones or something like that.

1009
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:37,230
Scott: See what's up.

1010
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:38,732
Rym: Right.

1011
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:42,790
Rym: So Worlds of Aspen, I'm not entirely sure what the hell this was.

1012
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:45,610
Rym: I think it's a whole bunch of different comics.

1013
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,170
Scott: Aspen is a publisher that does like a whole bunch of fantasy kind of things, right?

1014
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:49,713
Rym: Yeah.

1015
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:52,170
Rym: Because two of them are written by the same guy.

1016
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,090
Rym: And if you open it, it starts with three bikini girls.

1017
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:58,430
Rym: So I think they're, again, trying to target a certain demographic.

1018
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,890
Rym: The art's good, but the first story, there were too few pages.

1019
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,240
Rym: I have no idea what it's about.

1020
00:53:03,563 --> 00:53:04,390
Rym: So that was useless.

1021
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:05,660
Rym: It's called Fathom.

1022
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:09,910
Rym: The second one, Soul Fire, was also too short to figure out what was going on.

1023
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:10,848
Rym: It was kind of generic.

1024
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,441
Scott: It's just like that Dabble Brothers one.

1025
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,917
Scott: They give you a whole bunch of stuff, but each one is too short.

1026
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:17,210
Scott: They should give you one big one and then forget the others.

1027
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,041
Rym: The third one's just really dumb.

1028
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:20,410
Rym: It doesn't make any sense.

1029
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:21,936
Rym: It's called Shrugged.

1030
00:53:21,977 --> 00:53:24,490
Rym: I don't even want to bother trying to explain what it's about.

1031
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:30,570
Rym: And the last one is super stereotypical and kind of annoying to read.

1032
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:41,630
Rym: It's basically what if we made a comic about a woman who is just as bad ass as Oren Ishii and we had every possible like Chinese triad stereotype in the world.

1033
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,349
Rym: It's just it's dumb and it ends with nakedness.

1034
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:55,170
Scott: OK, so for free comic book day, DC thought it would be a good idea instead of making a new comic to just reprint All-Stars Superman number one and put that out as a free comic.

1035
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,187
Scott: And I've never read All-Stars Superman number one, so I read it.

1036
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:05,210
Scott: It's a pretty much average Superman story with really good arts because it's Frank quietly and his arts are really awesome.

1037
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:08,770
Scott: But other than that, it's sort of like a generic Superman story.

1038
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,102
Scott: Oh, Lex Luthor is bad.

1039
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:10,870
Scott: He's coming to get you.

1040
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,559
Rym: I got to go back to World of Aspen.

1041
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:16,320
Rym: I forgot I read this on the train and I was like, there's no way I can go with.

1042
00:54:16,984 --> 00:54:17,930
Rym: the writing is awful.

1043
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:23,264
Rym: I'm going to quote something a character is saying and see if you can point out the grammatical problem here.

1044
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:23,890
Rym: All right.

1045
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:30,010
Rym: Release the boy, relinquish the box of which you hold and turn yourself in.

1046
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,783
Rym: Uh, of which?

1047
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:33,750
Rym: what the fuck?

1048
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,180
Rym: Sorry, I couldn't let that slide.

1049
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,809
Rym: That was just that was bullshit right there.

1050
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,350
Rym: But speaking of bad comic, this is here's another one.

1051
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,970
Rym: A lot of these comics, they kind of start in the middle of a story.

1052
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,386
Rym: Don't tell you what got what's going on.

1053
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,810
Rym: And they're just really generic, like they don't stand out.

1054
00:54:49,870 --> 00:55:00,070
Rym: But Salem, Queen of Thorns is about one bad ass Puritan, a bunch of lame Puritans and a bunch of evil Puritans who all work for the church.

1055
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,089
Scott: So so what does it think appears to say good or bad things about Puritan?

1056
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,879
Rym: I can't tell pure.

1057
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:15,150
Rym: Obviously, the Salem witch trials are bad, but I don't know why there are crusader knights, because I don't think there were crusader knights in America in Puritan times.

1058
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:16,816
Rym: It's it's.

1059
00:55:16,837 --> 00:55:18,204
Rym: I think it's going for that.

1060
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:19,210
Rym: Check it out.

1061
00:55:19,532 --> 00:55:22,150
Rym: We're dark and we're full of religious symbolism.

1062
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:27,290
Rym: Oh, man, look how dark and and like we're going to make fantasy and history together.

1063
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:28,175
Scott: Oh, no.

1064
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,969
Rym: Yeah, I think we got to move along here.

1065
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:30,554
Scott: Yeah, we do.

1066
00:55:30,775 --> 00:55:32,710
Scott: So let's do this X-Men one that we both read.

1067
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:33,274
Scott: All right.

1068
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:41,670
Scott: Basically, you had here a one shot X-Men story and the actual X-Men themselves, you know, the characters, you know, in love weren't in it that much.

1069
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,389
Scott: And actually, they have the ugly cat beast I don't like.

1070
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:51,090
Scott: But it was really a story about, you know, one girl who's a mutant and she has her, you know, troubled mutant life.

1071
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,170
Scott: And that's really where X-Men stories have always shined.

1072
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:57,270
Scott: I think, you know, you get your kiddie pride, your jubilees, kiddie pride.

1073
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,867
Rym: Scott Johnson's having a fit right now.

1074
00:55:58,928 --> 00:55:59,090
Rym: Right.

1075
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:07,170
Scott: So this is just sort of like one of those stories executed in a really good and modern way with very high quality arts.

1076
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:08,859
Scott: And it was decent.

1077
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,670
Scott: It wasn't amazing, but it was good stuff.

1078
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:16,910
Scott: And it kind of makes me wish that X-Men comics were just all like this, as opposed to the way they are, which is unreadable.

1079
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:18,644
Rym: Yeah, because, I mean, I enjoyed it.

1080
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:19,270
Rym: It was pretty good.

1081
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,668
Rym: Had a couple of corny moments, but it was pretty good.

1082
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,970
Scott: Yeah, it had some corny moments in it, like when the X-Men showed up with their, you know.

1083
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:31,268
Rym: But I'll say this, I liked it and I like the style of art now, as opposed to Iron Man and Hulk and Spider-Man.

1084
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:32,788
Scott: Oh, God, let's see.

1085
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:33,830
Rym: And they fight Mandarin.

1086
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:38,189
Rym: And it starts out with a page explaining Mandarin's rings and what they all do.

1087
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:39,609
Scott: What do they all do?

1088
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:41,409
Rym: Oh, and Ant-Man is also in it.

1089
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:43,690
Scott: Doesn't Ant-Man like actually get really big?

1090
00:56:44,091 --> 00:56:45,390
Rym: Yeah, well, it starts out little.

1091
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:45,850
Rym: Yeah.

1092
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,850
Rym: It's really, really cheesy.

1093
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,088
Rym: And I guess if you like that sort of thing.

1094
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,789
Scott: That's actually, the X-Men was just Marvel straight up.

1095
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,149
Scott: That is Marvel Adventures, so it's meant for kids.

1096
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,090
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess it wasn't bad.

1097
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,050
Rym: It was just not up my alley, necessarily.

1098
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:06,485
Rym: There's one good part where they're all about to fight, and then Spider-Man's like, "Wait, wait,

1099
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:06,727
Rym: no!".

1100
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:08,930
Rym: And then everyone kind of stops fighting.

1101
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:10,384
Rym: They're like, "What's going

1102
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:10,606
Rym: on?"

1103
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:18,710
Rym: And he's like, "All right, guys, we're in this ancient world of the, like, Wonder of the World temple, and the Hulk's here.

1104
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:21,669
Rym: So I don't think I want to be responsible for destroying it.

1105
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,167
Rym: Can we all just agree to walk outside and then start fighting

1106
00:57:24,228 --> 00:57:24,409
Rym: again?".

1107
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,690
Rym: And then they all go outside and fight.

1108
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,350
Scott: That's, see, that's the reason I like Spider-Man is because of shit like that.

1109
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:35,010
Scott: They should, that's why, you know, that's what makes Spider-Man comics good, is that Spider-Man has that attitude on most of the time.

1110
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,823
Rym: But the Hulk is just dumb, but I don't know.

1111
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,830
Rym: I like the Mandarin.

1112
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,647
Rym: I kind of was rooting for him because...

1113
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,730
Scott: Yeah, you like the Mandarin.

1114
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,110
Scott: You like the Mandarin in Marvel Team Up also.

1115
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,550
Rym: Well, because he's evil and he's not stupid.

1116
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,610
Scott: I think you're a Mandarin man.

1117
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,346
Rym: I think I am.

1118
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:49,386
Scott: I like it.

1119
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,510
Rym: You know why?

1120
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,430
Rym: Because much like Jafar, he sneers.

1121
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,061
Rym: And he sneers in this way.

1122
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,170
Rym: that is very endearing to me.

1123
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:59,530
Scott: Maybe we'll have to go get you a copy of, like, Best of the Mandarin if such a thing exists.

1124
00:57:59,872 --> 00:58:01,010
Rym: All right, but let's move along here.

1125
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,309
Rym: Dan Dare is crap.

1126
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:03,710
Rym: I don't get it.

1127
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,449
Rym: I don't like it.

1128
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:11,129
Rym: It's really, really lame and kind of, like, it takes itself way too seriously for what's going on.

1129
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:11,890
Scott: All right.

1130
00:58:12,517 --> 00:58:21,130
Rym: I only say that because I've actually received multiple Dan Dares from the publisher before ever since I got in this press mailing list from, you know, being at the New York Comic Con.

1131
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,150
Rym: They keep sending me these Dan Dare comics.

1132
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:24,570
Rym: None of them are good.

1133
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,690
Scott: Yeah, people are talking those up, but Rims doesn't like them.

1134
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:28,310
Scott: I'll have to check.

1135
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:28,947
Rym: You should read them.

1136
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:29,706
Scott: I'll read that one.

1137
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:30,709
Scott: I'm not going to read the other one.

1138
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,950
Rym: It's just, it could be OK, but the art is generic.

1139
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:36,730
Rym: It takes itself way too seriously.

1140
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:39,708
Rym: And Dan Dare has got kind of this, look at me.

1141
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,070
Rym: I'm perfect.

1142
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:44,310
Rym: And I'm going to save everybody all the time.

1143
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:47,270
Scott: I got here Comics Go Hollywood.

1144
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,310
Scott: Now, what this is, it's not actually a comic.

1145
00:58:49,713 --> 00:58:51,130
Scott: It's by Tomorrow's publishing.

1146
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:57,930
Scott: And if you're looking for sort of a high brow alternative to like Wizard magazine, Tomorrow's is where it's at.

1147
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:08,630
Scott: Like if you want to learn shit about comics and get like high quality real interviews and awesome arts and all that sort of stuff in a black and white magazine, Tomorrow's provides like tenfold.

1148
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:21,290
Scott: And what this is, is a little tiny magazine in the Tomorrow's style that contains a bunch of articles relating to, you know, comics and Hollywood together and TV and movies and all that stuff.

1149
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:28,150
Scott: They talk about, you know, the people who are animating some, you know, DC New Frontier DVDs.

1150
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:32,470
Scott: They talk with Jeff Loeb about something.

1151
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:37,590
Scott: They talk about the X-Men movie that might have been made in 1984, but didn't actually get made.

1152
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:40,929
Scott: They talk about like the history of the art style of the Joker.

1153
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:43,490
Scott: And it's pretty interesting.

1154
00:59:43,571 --> 00:59:47,047
Scott: And it was really wordy and is pretty impressive for something that's free.

1155
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:49,730
Scott: And Tomorrow's usually puts out high brow stuff.

1156
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:55,427
Scott: I just don't read it because I don't care enough to actually read a magazine about this kind of thing all the time.

1157
00:59:55,773 --> 00:59:56,149
Rym: All right.

1158
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,210
Rym: I got like four more here.

1159
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,230
Scott: And I got three more.

1160
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,549
Rym: I feel like we should just wrap it up.

1161
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,287
Scott: We should just wrap it up.

1162
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,970
Rym: Let's just give like the plus or like the hey for the rest of them.

1163
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,329
Rym: And I got one I want to talk about.

1164
01:00:04,536 --> 01:00:04,599
Rym: OK.

1165
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:08,409
Rym: So the stranded kind of generic modern fantasy issue look pretty cool.

1166
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,628
Rym: I actually wasn't that bad.

1167
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:13,390
Rym: Love and Capes was just really not up my alley at all.

1168
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,508
Rym: I guess if you're into superheroes, but I didn't like it.

1169
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,250
Rym: It's like superheroes, but live in normal lives.

1170
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:21,150
Rym: But they're all still superheroes all the time.

1171
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,250
Rym: And one guy wants to like top 10.

1172
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,709
Rym: One guy wants to ask like he's Superman.

1173
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,128
Rym: He wants to ask this girl to marry him.

1174
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:29,569
Rym: But I don't know.

1175
01:00:30,116 --> 01:00:30,549
Scott: All right.

1176
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:31,926
Rym: I got very little to say about it.

1177
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,029
Rym: Gekiga is Gekiga.

1178
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,190
Rym: You should read Gekiga.

1179
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,910
Scott: Yeah, actually, that was originally.

1180
01:00:38,194 --> 01:00:39,510
Scott: they were going to misspell the title.

1181
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,830
Scott: They were going to call it Gekiga.

1182
01:00:41,032 --> 01:00:43,769
Scott: And then I guess they corrected it, which I guess someone told them.

1183
01:00:43,992 --> 01:00:45,230
Scott: All that is, is a preview.

1184
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:52,349
Scott: If you don't know, if you want to read the Yojihiro Tatsumi drawn and quarterly real Gekiga stuff that will let you know if you want to read it or not.

1185
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,188
Rym: OK, you should.

1186
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:54,388
Scott: Of course you should.

1187
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:56,190
Scott: OK, what do I got here?

1188
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:00,098
Scott: I got an entertaining comic sampler, E.C.

1189
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,549
Scott: Comics.

1190
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,390
Scott: They used to publish like all the pulp comics way back in the day.

1191
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,890
Scott: We're talking like, you know, Cryptkeeper type stuff.

1192
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:08,270
Scott: Right.

1193
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,209
Scott: And basically like Tales from the Crypt and Weird Science.

1194
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:12,956
Scott: E.C.

1195
01:01:12,997 --> 01:01:14,070
Scott: was who published all those.

1196
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,526
Scott: And Gemstone, which are the people who publish the Disney comics, are publishing the E.C.

1197
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:18,930
Scott: Comics.

1198
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:20,888
Scott: And this is a sampling of some E.C.

1199
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,322
Scott: Comics.

1200
01:01:21,572 --> 01:01:22,668
Scott: And I like E.C.

1201
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,210
Scott: Comics a lot more than I thought I would.

1202
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:29,750
Scott: And I maybe I'll buy some trades or hardcovers or something of some weird science because that's like in that action.

1203
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:30,887
Scott: Very Twilight Zone ish.

1204
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:31,845
Scott: Pulpish kind of stuff.

1205
01:01:33,091 --> 01:01:35,088
Scott: Ape Entertainment's cartoon palooza.

1206
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:46,970
Scott: Yeah, this is just like really bad cartoons in comic form, like, you know, like those kids cartoons, but like the art is sort of bad.

1207
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:52,970
Scott: And, you know, of course, the art on the final one, the Ursula Wild was actually pretty good.

1208
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:54,790
Scott: That was probably the only thing worth reading in here.

1209
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:58,450
Scott: Everything else in here was just sort of like bleh and whatever.

1210
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:02,570
Scott: And then the last thing I got is Kid Houdini and the Silver Dollar Misfits.

1211
01:02:03,193 --> 01:02:08,429
Scott: This was a little bit better than some of the other ones in terms of, you know, kid stuff.

1212
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:12,769
Scott: But the art was really sort of it didn't really grab me.

1213
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:20,649
Scott: And the plot was sort of like this really generic and obvious of, oh, there's a bunch of misfit kids stuck at the evil carnival.

1214
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:29,830
Scott: In the back, there was actually this other story about like, you know, kids and they're like detective agency of checking out, you know, cryptozoology, whatever.

1215
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:32,250
Scott: And the art and that was actually really cute.

1216
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,729
Scott: But the story was lame.

1217
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:37,550
Rym: And that's all I got to end this because I'm really hungry.

1218
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:38,588
Scott: I'm also really hungry.

1219
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,450
Rym: NASCAR heroes.

1220
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,150
Scott: Oh, I forgot that it was now we thought we were done.

1221
01:02:43,512 --> 01:02:47,130
Rym: I thought this would be about like people who are NASCAR racers.

1222
01:02:47,272 --> 01:02:48,229
Rym: And it seemed like that was it.

1223
01:02:48,371 --> 01:02:49,649
Rym: What what it was going to be about.

1224
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:57,570
Rym: And then there was this ghost of a NASCAR driver who had died and he's like a headless NASCAR's man.

1225
01:02:58,513 --> 01:02:59,709
Scott: And that sounds pretty cool.

1226
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:00,236
Rym: No.

1227
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,889
Scott: Imagine if, like, you know, look at the track.

1228
01:03:03,635 --> 01:03:04,227
Rym: Look at that.

1229
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:06,910
Rym: This makes no sense.

1230
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:07,308
Scott: I kind of.

1231
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:12,089
Scott: I mean, if you wrote a comic about like the ghost of Ayrton Senna coming and beating Michael Schumacher, that was awesome.

1232
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,050
Rym: But it wasn't that it made no sense.

1233
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:18,290
Rym: And then in the end, he falls into this alligator pit and he beats the alligators up.

1234
01:03:18,614 --> 01:03:20,929
Rym: And then like the plot finishes for the story.

1235
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:22,950
Rym: And I was thinking, wait a minute.

1236
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:24,490
Rym: How do you beat the alligators up?

1237
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,230
Rym: They kind of mentioned that he has superpowers.

1238
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:31,278
Rym: And then after the comic, they have a little kind of preview.

1239
01:03:31,379 --> 01:03:37,689
Rym: explanation of yes, this comic is actually about NASCAR drivers with superpowers.

1240
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,267
Rym: If you have superpowers, why would you drive NASCAR?

1241
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:44,189
Rym: I'm going to read for you the introduction, the yellow text.

1242
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,329
Rym: NASCAR, a sport not like no other.

1243
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,369
Rym: Eight hundred horsepower driving action.

1244
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,190
Rym: A sport like no other with fans like no other.

1245
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:52,910
Scott: There's a lot of other.

1246
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,500
Rym: Sure, being a janitor, I got picked on, even pushed around by him.

1247
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:58,930
Rym: Jack Diesel.

1248
01:03:59,354 --> 01:04:00,990
Rym: He was the hottest driver in NASCAR.

1249
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,370
Rym: Not very nice, as I would find out later.

1250
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:05,067
Rym: He was a very bad man.

1251
01:04:05,993 --> 01:04:06,709
Rym: Less successful.

1252
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:08,270
Scott: He was a very bad man.

1253
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,067
Scott: It says that.

1254
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:12,688
Rym: Were my friends on the flat stock racing crew.

1255
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,749
Rym: Gus, Zip, Ed.

1256
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,449
Rym: Now these guys are so generic.

1257
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,649
Scott: Gus, talk about a mechanic's name.

1258
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,759
Scott: He was the mechanic.

1259
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:22,910
Rym: And Zip was the engineer.

1260
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,688
Rym: And Ed is like the pit crew guy.

1261
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,249
Rym: They had they had just lost their driver to another team.

1262
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:35,710
Rym: I thought like their boss, Esther, Esther Shockington said that the next race would be their last.

1263
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,410
Scott: I mean, I saw that we had NASCAR heroes.

1264
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:40,570
Scott: I knew that that would sort of like be the, you know, the shitty kid in class.

1265
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:45,270
Scott: I don't think I realized where this is going that bad.

1266
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,709
Rym: I don't think you realize I haven't gotten that yet.

1267
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:50,607
Rym: Oh, God, I point out that there's a bunch of typos here.

1268
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,769
Rym: Oh, God, I felt bad for my friends who might lose their job.

1269
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,049
Rym: And for me, because Esther Barley knew I was alive.

1270
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:01,170
Rym: That would soon change.

1271
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:02,470
Rym: OK, that doesn't make any sense.

1272
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,210
Scott: I don't get it.

1273
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:04,955
Rym: And there was a bunch of typos there.

1274
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:05,570
Rym: I had to read over.

1275
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,648
Rym: Everything would change.

1276
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:14,388
Rym: I stumbled upon Diesel as he experimented with what seemed to be an illegal fuel source.

1277
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:18,190
Rym: And it shows him in a lab holding up this beaker and like going.

1278
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:24,550
Scott: If he has superpowers, wouldn't he be better off with like have superpowers yet with a bicycle powered car?

1279
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:25,650
Rym: You got to see this picture.

1280
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,150
Rym: Jack Diesel is holding up this pedal faster than the engine.

1281
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,906
Rym: And he's looking up at it with that scientist look.

1282
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,827
Rym: And there's this evil looking Doberman just kind of watching him.

1283
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:38,709
Rym: Maybe this was his secret to winning all those races.

1284
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:44,669
Rym: As I looked closer, Diesel dropped the mysterious substance dropped to the floor.

1285
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:53,489
Rym: But as I looked closer, Diesel dropped the mysterious substance dropped to the floor.

1286
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:55,529
Scott: Oh my God.

1287
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,649
Scott: Did a NASCAR fan write this?

1288
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,090
Rym: The results were explosive.

1289
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:03,810
Rym: I was thrown across the compound.

1290
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,847
Scott: Can we can you please spare me any more pain?

1291
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,130
Rym: But was completely unhurt.

1292
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:12,450
Rym: In fact, when I woke up at a time and heard cries for help, I realized I'd never felt better.

1293
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,050
Rym: I was faster, stronger.

1294
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,530
Rym: Best of all, I was a hero.

1295
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,169
Scott: Are you done?

1296
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:21,109
Rym: As it turned out, that explosion had affected us all.

1297
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,669
Rym: Gus was super strong.

1298
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:24,190
Rym: Zip could well zip.

1299
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:26,330
Rym: An ad could duplicate himself over an hour.

1300
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,150
Rym: We all had superpowers.

1301
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:34,390
Rym: Later, Esther's electric personality would pour over into her own superpowers.

1302
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:44,950
Rym: Jag Diesel, we found out, had acquired the most powers of all and had plans to use those powers to cheat in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series.

1303
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:46,929
Scott: He's going to cheat at NASCAR.

1304
01:06:47,532 --> 01:06:48,990
Rym: His eyes are like on fire.

1305
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:51,069
Rym: If my eyes are on fire.

1306
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,149
Rym: I couldn't let that happen.

1307
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:58,530
Rym: The explosion had also enhanced my natural driving abilities, so I donned the flat stock fire suit and helmet.

1308
01:06:58,873 --> 01:06:59,902
Scott: That's the new identity.

1309
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:02,568
Rym: Jimmy Dash.

1310
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:05,108
Rym: It goes on.

1311
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,410
Rym: This was awful.

1312
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:13,250
Scott: It sounds like, though, it's so awful that it has some qualities.

1313
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:15,950
Rym: No, no, no, it does not.

1314
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,630
Rym: It it was much more funny with me reading.

1315
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,809
Rym: You do not want to read that.

1316
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,590
Rym: That is the worst comic a free comic book day.

1317
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,690
Rym: And it's time to go make some bacon.

1318
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:26,530
Scott: You want to have sort of a free comic day verdict?

1319
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:29,229
Rym: I'm I don't know.

1320
01:07:29,572 --> 01:07:31,847
Rym: I feel like a lot of companies just do it because they have to.

1321
01:07:32,372 --> 01:07:32,830
Scott: They don't have to.

1322
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,850
Rym: It's completely up to them, but they feel like they have to for marketing purposes.

1323
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:36,510
Scott: Well, they should.

1324
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:36,868
Scott: It is.

1325
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,389
Scott: It's good marketing if you do it right.

1326
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:39,169
Scott: I don't know.

1327
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,610
Scott: companies don't do it right.

1328
01:07:41,273 --> 01:07:44,508
Rym: I think we should talk about free comic book day as a concept on another night.

1329
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:45,508
Scott: All right, we'll do it.

1330
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,450
Rym: Time to make some bacon.

1331
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,250
Rym: Good night, Internet.
