1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,846
Scott: It's Thursday, July 1st.

2
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:11,410
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,479
Scott: I'm Rynn.

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,857
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:18,830
Scott: Tonight, non-Legos.

6
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,208
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,070
Rym: So Scott, you want to start with the fireworks or the bed wedding?

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,587
Scott: Why did you?

9
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,309
Rym: If you weren't going to say it, I was going to say it.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,430
Rym: I mean, our listeners, they don't get the five seconds before I hit record.

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,140
Scott: They're not supposed to.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,250
Scott: That's why it's before.

13
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:43,481
Scott: We have to come before.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:43,622
Scott: Anyway.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,489
Rym: That's what your mom said.

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,690
Scott: So I'm laying in this bed doing the show or getting ready to do the show.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,430
Rym: And now I got to take the futon out.

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:59,190
Scott: Now the bed's wet because I had a water bottle with water and some of it dripped out onto the bed.

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,283
Rym: I call mine the young master water bottle.

20
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:03,810
Rym: That's not water.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,676
Scott: Well, it's not a euphemism.

22
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:06,358
Scott: It's literally.

23
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:09,549
Scott: I had the water bottle with actual water in it.

24
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,509
Scott: And it, you know, when I was done drinking, I fell over it.

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,707
Rym: So apparently there were fireworks last night.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,712
Scott: Well, yeah.

27
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:21,548
Scott: So I'm sitting in my bedroom working on something, which is actually getting scarily close to reality.

28
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:27,427
Scott: It's actually the first thing I've done that might make money.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,990
Scott: It'll make at least a dollar and has a potential of infinity dollars, as does everything.

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,669
Rym: I'm not sure which thing you're talking about.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,409
Scott: Yeah, because it doesn't involve you at all.

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,816
Rym: At all?

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,530
Scott: Really?

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,030
Scott: Yeah.

35
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,670
Rym: So it's not a Dorf or anything?

36
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,029
Rym: No.

37
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,428
Scott: It's basically the only thing delaying the return of Dorf.

38
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:46,690
Scott: Anyway.

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,356
Rym: That's fine.

40
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,170
Rym: We got to make that video.

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,905
Scott: So I'm working and I'm actually on a roll.

42
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:50,430
Scott: Right.

43
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,990
Scott: And suddenly I hear this noise outside and it sounds like some jerk is like revving his fucking engine.

44
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,377
Scott: I don't have an alley.

45
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,310
Scott: You know, it's actually a road, but it's not.

46
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,308
Scott: It's a less main road, which is why it's a road and not a street.

47
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,590
Scott: Right.

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,863
Scott: If it's a street, that's like a street.

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,673
Rym: Well, that depends on where.

50
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,770
Rym: I mean, right here we got streets, avenues, roads, lanes, and they all have the same numbers.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,372
Scott: Yeah.

52
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,168
Scott: Well, yeah.

53
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,741
Rym: It literally goes 44th road, 44th street, 44th avenue.

54
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,110
Scott: Well, the streets in Queens, at least in our area of Queens, the streets go up and down and they're real important.

55
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:26,528
Scott: The avenues go east and west over here, which is the opposite of Manhattan.

56
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:26,910
Scott: Right.

57
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,394
Scott: And they're still pretty important.

58
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:36,770
Scott: And the roads also go east and west, but they're in between the avenues and they're less, they're less important than the, uh, than the avenues are.

59
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,050
Scott: So the road behind my, you know.

60
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,489
Rym: Yeah, but what about, cause Verde or Northern Boulevard is like the biggest road right here.

61
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,549
Scott: That's a little out though.

62
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,309
Rym: That's a Boulevard.

63
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,131
Scott: Yeah.

64
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,516
Scott: Boulevard, boulevards are serious.

65
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,222
Scott: Anything that's different is serious business.

66
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,370
Scott: Like Union Turnpike, serious business.

67
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,803
Scott: Cause it's not, you know, it's a Turnpike.

68
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,788
Scott: It's like, Oh, fuck me.

69
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:56,150
Scott: Right.

70
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,689
Rym: I remember as a kid, I was confused as to what Turnpike meant when I was really young.

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:10,003
Rym: Cause like the only time I'd ever heard the word was in the context of a ride at Cedar Point called the Turnpike, which it was made in the fifties.

72
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:14,630
Rym: and you drove fifties looking gasoline cars around a track.

73
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,251
Scott: Anyway.

74
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,515
Scott: So I hear this noise out there.

75
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:21,566
Scott: It sounds like a dude revving his engine and it's slightly disturbing, but it goes away.

76
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:22,990
Scott: and no, it doesn't go away.

77
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,737
Scott: It sticks around and it keeps bothering me.

78
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,126
Scott: And I'm like, what the fuck, dude, your car is working.

79
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,050
Scott: What the fuck?

80
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,554
Scott: And it doesn't even sound like a ricer.

81
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:33,205
Scott: It sounds like some old shitty broken car with no muffler.

82
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,549
Scott: And I'm like, Oh, fuck you.

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,909
Scott: So then I go out onto the balcony and I'm going to just yell, shut the fuck up or something like that.

84
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,070
Rym: Right.

85
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:40,670
Rym: That's what you do.

86
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,879
Scott: And when I'm out in the balcony, suddenly it doesn't sound the same anymore.

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,310
Scott: It sounds like thunder or perhaps thunder or perhaps cannons.

88
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,496
Scott: And it does lights like flashing.

89
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,443
Scott: I can't see around the corner of my balcony.

90
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,170
Scott: So there's some flashing going on.

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,270
Rym: So, so my question is at this exact moment, did you suspect fireworks first or were you still confused?

92
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,256
Scott: Well, I was, I knew it was equally one of three things.

93
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:16,716
Scott: Either lightning was around the corner where I, uh, there was bombs around the corner, I guess possible or fireworks around the corner.

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,548
Scott: And so I go to the roof, which is on fire.

95
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:23,410
Scott: No, it wasn't.

96
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:24,032
Scott: Sadly.

97
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:29,730
Scott: Anyway, I go to the roof and there's like four or five neighbors already chilling up there and there's some firework action.

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,713
Scott: And I'm like, Oh, come on.

99
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,295
Scott: Seriously.

100
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,643
Scott: It's like, you can't hold it in until Sunday.

101
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,830
Scott: Are you like testing it or something?

102
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,134
Scott: Testing the launch tubes?

103
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,826
Scott: or are you fucking like getting rid of some extras?

104
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,110
Scott: or what the hell are you doing guys?

105
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,214
Rym: Might've been a different festival.

106
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:43,676
Rym: Where were they?

107
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:44,199
Rym: Over the river.

108
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,183
Scott: It was out on the river.

109
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:46,550
Scott: So they must've been testing, right?

110
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,880
Scott: Or getting rid of some excess or something.

111
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,282
Scott: I don't know.

112
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,249
Scott: But yeah, those fuckers.

113
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:55,849
Rym: I'll tell you about the karaoke guy that I had to dispatch.

114
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:02,466
Rym: So, you know, we have in the fancy like big building and we're in the bedroom and it's really late.

115
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,670
Rym: It's like two in the fucking morning.

116
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:04,132
Rym: All right.

117
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:08,570
Rym: And there's this guy and it doesn't bother me during the day because I don't hear it during the day.

118
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:16,110
Rym: And even if I'm home, like I wouldn't be in the bedroom, but because the bathrooms like are connected to this positive air pressure thing.

119
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,074
Scott: Yeah, you could, I can, I have that same problem.

120
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:24,670
Scott: If you're in like my kitchen, this event or in my bathroom, this event, and I can hear like adjacent people through the vents.

121
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:29,689
Scott: But if I, you know, close the bathroom door or, and I'm, you know, not right in the kitchen, I can't hear it.

122
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,097
Rym: See, we can't hear adjacent.

123
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,579
Rym: We can only hear up down and only in the- Yeah, it's up down adjacent.

124
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,190
Scott: It's not left right adjacent.

125
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,210
Rym: But only in some of the bathrooms because not all the apartments have two bathrooms.

126
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,653
Rym: Ah.

127
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:46,510
Rym: So the second bathroom, which is connected to the bedroom, there's a dude who lives above us who sings karaoke in Korean terribly.

128
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,230
Scott: Like, how can he even, is he playing, maybe he's playing Korean rock band or something.

129
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,581
Rym: He might be, but it's only him.

130
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,609
Rym: I never hear anyone else.

131
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,390
Rym: And he sings the same fucking songs.

132
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,369
Scott: You sure he's not singing in the shower?

133
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,816
Rym: No, he's definitely not because he's got a stereo going.

134
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:04,730
Rym: He sings the same fucking songs over and over and over again forever, which is fine because I usually don't run into it.

135
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,010
Rym: Like I'll go to pee and I hear it and I'm like, wow, that guy really sucks.

136
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,170
Scott: Dude, you should record him and put him on the internet.

137
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,475
Rym: One time I just started singing back at him.

138
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:19,190
Rym: I was like, I didn't, and he stopped singing and then the singing went away for a while.

139
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,189
Rym: I think at that moment he realized people could hear him.

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,768
Scott: Maybe.

141
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,270
Rym: But you seem to have forgotten that because we're like two in the morning and he's singing.

142
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:26,370
Scott: Two in the morning?

143
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,230
Scott: Louder and louder and louder.

144
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,088
Scott: He must have been drunk.

145
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:29,889
Rym: And louder.

146
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,568
Scott: That's why.

147
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,184
Rym: So finally I just get up and I go into the bathroom.

148
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:35,690
Rym: I stand on the toilet.

149
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,590
Scott: You could hear him in your bed all the way from the bathroom?

150
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,549
Rym: Yes, with the bathroom door shut.

151
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:39,954
Scott: Whoa.

152
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,417
Rym: So I go in there and I listen for a bit.

153
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:45,446
Rym: I'm like, dude, it's fucking two in the morning.

154
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:46,449
Rym: Shut up.

155
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,990
Rym: And he stops and the music keeps playing like the music, but he's not singing.

156
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:59,850
Rym: And it's quiet for like a few minutes and then the song stops and then another song starts and then he starts to sing again.

157
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,009
Rym: So I was like, what did I just say?

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,230
Rym: And then I hear like a scrambling, scramble, scramble and the music stops, dead silence the rest of the night.

159
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,586
Scott: You should find out who it is and go to the doorman.

160
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,013
Rym: I know who it is.

161
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,380
Rym: It's the apartment directly above me.

162
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,830
Scott: Oh, well then you can go knock on his door.

163
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:30,110
Rym: Yeah, if it happens again, I feel like I should just record it for a while and then just leave like a USB stick with MP3s of him singing like under his door.

164
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,846
Scott: No, you should do is you should go up there, right?

165
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,950
Rym: Well clearly, Scott, the USB stick is also a virus.

166
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,198
Scott: No, what you do, you ready for this?

167
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,248
Scott: This is the guaranteed win.

168
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:40,590
Scott: You ready?

169
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:41,669
Scott: I'm a genius.

170
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,510
Rym: I've got a couple ideas.

171
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,326
Scott: Now there will be demonstration of my genius.

172
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:45,950
Scott: Are you ready?

173
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,636
Scott: You go and you knock on his door.

174
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:48,520
Scott: He opens the door.

175
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,086
Scott: Vuvuzela in the face.

176
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:50,528
Scott: That's it.

177
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:51,090
Scott: Done.

178
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,350
Rym: Why not just play the vuvuzela through the vent?

179
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,410
Scott: Because it'd be so much louder if it's just right in his face.

180
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,531
Rym: I don't know.

181
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:01,810
Rym: I kind of like the singing back at him as loud as I can.

182
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:04,090
Scott: Vuvuzela is made of wind.

183
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,950
Scott: Vuvuzela.

184
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,790
Scott: Anyway, all right, let's check some news out.

185
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,502
Rym: You have some news?

186
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:08,810
Rym: It's Thursday.

187
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,150
Scott: Yeah, there's basically, there is nothing happening in the world.

188
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,662
Rym: There's tons happening, just nothing.

189
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:14,290
Rym: I have a lot to say.

190
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,664
Rym: All right, there's news about homeopathy.

191
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,570
Rym: I'm going to say the same thing.

192
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,008
Scott: It's not a big deal news.

193
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,090
Rym: There's news about like a kid getting arrested because he made a bomb out of dry ice.

194
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,948
Scott: Not a big news.

195
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,850
Rym: Well, no, it's more that all the news, all of you out there know exactly what I'm going to say about it.

196
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,520
Rym: The BP oil spill, you know what I'm going to say.

197
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:32,950
Rym: Politics, you know what I'm going to say.

198
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,087
Rym: So, I don't know, what do you have?

199
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,549
Scott: So there's a big steam sale going on.

200
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,929
Rym: What are you going to say about that?

201
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,450
Scott: It's basically got, no, I haven't bought any, I bought one game for $2.50.

202
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,014
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

203
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,390
Rym: So, you have nothing to say about anything.

204
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,150
Rym: So instead, you say that you have nothing to say about the steam sale.

205
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,166
Scott: No, what I have to say about it is that it's kind of weak sauce compared to their usual sales where it's like, "Oh man, I got to buy some of

206
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:57,610
Scott: everything.".

207
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,482
Scott: This is sort of like, "Hey, where's the

208
00:08:59,885 --> 00:08:59,986
Scott: beef?".

209
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,049
Scott: You know, they got wicked low prices.

210
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,755
Rym: Where's the beef?

211
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:04,570
Rym: That's your reference?

212
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,610
Rym: I don't think any of our listeners, or at least 99% of them have no idea what that is actually from.

213
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,528
Scott: Well, then let them go to YouTube and find out.

214
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,030
Rym: That was barely our generation.

215
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,590
Rym: That was like the beginning of our generation was the end of that.

216
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,025
Scott: Well, that's dumb shit for them.

217
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:21,289
Scott: Anyway.

218
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:33,582
Scott: I mean, it's like they got all these games, but it's like none of them are games that are like, I sort of learned my lesson with these steam sales, that like the first time I bought all these games and I barely played them, where you buy like some huge pack

219
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:35,070
Rym: for $20.

220
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,350
Rym: The id Software pack was the first one I ever bought.

221
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,530
Scott: Yeah, you play like five of the games for a little bit, and then you hardly ever play them.

222
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,186
Rym: Let's see, I'm looking at the deck pack right now.

223
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:43,490
Rym: Let's see.

224
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,990
Rym: I never even installed Doom 3 or the sequel to Doom 3 that I got.

225
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,191
Scott: I definitely didn't beat Doom 3.

226
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,169
Rym: I never even played it.

227
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,689
Rym: I played like a little bit.

228
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,190
Rym: I didn't install Indiana Jones or Hexen or Hexen or Hexen or Heretic.

229
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,729
Scott: I played those back in the day.

230
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,990
Rym: Loom, Master Levels, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 2, Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 3, Quake, Quake Castle Wolfenstein.

231
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:14,296
Scott: Yeah, but basically you got, you know, you get all these games, and even though it's only $2.50, right, it's like, "Hey, $2.50?

232
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,588
Scott: That's a fucking breakfast sandwich,

233
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:15,809
Scott: dude.".

234
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:20,490
Scott: And if I'm not actually going to play these games, I just basically took a breakfast sandwich and threw it in the trash.

235
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:31,490
Scott: So even if a game is a crazy low price, if you've played it already or if it's not something you're actually going to invest a lot of time in, it's not worth it, even when the price is wicked low.

236
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,603
Scott: So like look at this, they got...

237
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,408
Rym: Well, think about what this means.

238
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:41,029
Rym: It's the same thing, you know, I don't really want to talk about it on Thursday, but that whole ASCAP thing that's happening right now.

239
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,548
Scott: All right.

240
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:59,790
Rym: It's the situation that, you know, everyone thinks us nerds are always mad about piracy and we're trying to fight for the right to pirate, but even way back, all we care about is the fact that so much stuff is free and we have so many options of entertainment that piracy is nothing compared to the fact that we're just apathetic about the majority of media.

241
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:12,450
Scott: Yeah, the only reason that, you know, I think, you know, for piracy, right, is you have made something so difficult to obtain and I happen to want it now-ish, so piracy is an option.

242
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,990
Scott: Now bear in mind, if you had made it, you know, available for a dollar like Steam does and I could have just gone and got it, I wouldn't have pirated because that's a pain in the ass.

243
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,150
Rym: But at the same time...

244
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,309
Scott: You made it a pain in the ass.

245
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:31,190
Rym: At the same time, even when the game is a dollar, I'll sit there and I'll look at Steam and I'll be like, "Huh, that game's only a dollar.

246
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,185
Rym: People said the game's pretty

247
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:32,388
Rym: good.".

248
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,125
Rym: And I'll look at it and I'll be like, "Do I really want to pay a

249
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:35,547
Rym: dollar?".

250
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:36,815
Rym: And it's not like.

251
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,628
Rym: I'm going to say, "Fuck them, I'm pirating

252
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:38,769
Rym: it.".

253
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:40,125
Rym: I just don't play it.

254
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:40,661
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,750
Rym: It's not even worth free to me, let alone a dollar.

256
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,770
Scott: I know, it's like, should I install that thing and take up space on my hard drive?

257
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,490
Scott: I mean, I have to click and wait and get some bandwidth going.

258
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:51,748
Rym: It's going to take up like 20 megs.

259
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,027
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if I'm not actually going to play it, why would I do that?

260
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,770
Rym: Wow, I guess I have Team Fortress Classic.

261
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,430
Scott: Well, so does everyone.

262
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:02,028
Rym: The dig!

263
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:02,870
Rym: Right, right.

264
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,427
Rym: Commander Keen.

265
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,810
Rym: God, that's not even a stall.

266
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:05,490
Scott: Why do you have the dig?

267
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,168
Scott: I don't have the dig.

268
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,010
Rym: It came with some pack I bought, I guess.

269
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,949
Scott: What pack did you buy?

270
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,630
Rym: I don't even know.

271
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,230
Scott: Do you have other LucasArts adventure games?

272
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,950
Rym: I think I have every LucasArts adventure game.

273
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,890
Rym: You have Monkey Island and Loom.

274
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,009
Rym: Yeah, I think I have all of them.

275
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,239
Rym: Really?

276
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,389
Scott: I never bought that pack.

277
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,709
Rym: Well, I guess I did.

278
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,030
Scott: I played some of those on ScummVM, though, back a year back, though.

279
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,330
Scott: I played Full Throttle all the way through.

280
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,850
Rym: I got to say, of all those games, we don't want to turn this into a Tuesday show.

281
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,585
Rym: Quest for Glory 2 is like...

282
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,090
Scott: That's not a LucasArts game.

283
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:36,750
Rym: I know, but that style of game, you know, click on stuff, type stuff, walk around, solve puzzles, that's the only one that I could actually play again, I think.

284
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,629
Scott: I like the later King's Quest, because you got the right click to change your cursor and then you click on things.

285
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,669
Rym: All the Quest for Glory's are like that, except two.

286
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,288
Scott: Oh, okay.

287
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:55,089
Rym: Except the Quest for Glory's are actually decent games, but the ScummVM games, this may be heresy for some of you gamers, they're not even really games.

288
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:56,748
Scott: No, they're basically...

289
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,630
Rym: Like, at least Quest for Glory, the puzzles were like actual puzzles, and the games were mildly open-ended.

290
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:18,390
Scott: It wasn't just crazy fucked up logic, so you get a fact, and then you basically, now that you got a fact, it's basically a movie, but because you've got a fact, you're not seeing all the alternate pathways to failure, you're only seeing the success.

291
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,029
Rym: Oh, we did a whole panel on that.

292
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:32,229
Scott: So a lot of the humor is out, and then, but the thing is, the failure really isn't fun, at this point in my life, because it takes a lot of time, and when I was younger, it'd still be great, and it's also no longer funny, most of it.

293
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,829
Rym: Yeah, well, I think part of it was, you know that game you were just playing on the iPhone where you mix things together to make other things?

294
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,095
Scott: Yeah.

295
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,088
Rym: ScummVM games are the same thing, they're just a novelty generator machine, and eventually you expose all the novelty and that's it.

296
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:45,527
Rym: Yeah.

297
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,350
Rym: They're barely games.

298
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,789
Scott: You can just better off watching them on YouTube than playing them.

299
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,930
Rym: Yeah, unless you're under the age of six, or you got nothing better to do, I guess.

300
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,470
Rym: Those are good games for like laptop, 12 hour plane ride, can't sleep.

301
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,767
Scott: Very good.

302
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:00,789
Rym: That's pretty much where I play a lot of games.

303
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:02,369
Rym: Oh, God.

304
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,004
Rym: So, you know, I'm going through these games, listing them right now, and you know what I see?

305
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,229
Rym: Civ IV, Beyond the Sword, Warlords, Civ V, because I own it, and I can't play it yet.

306
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,409
Scott: I didn't preorder it yet, because you know why?

307
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,287
Scott: It doesn't matter if I preorder it now or at the last minute, so why rush?

308
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,990
Scott: Maybe it'll be a dollar, maybe it'll be cheaper, you know, later.

309
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,368
Rym: I got something for preordering it.

310
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,410
Scott: Well, then again, it could be more expensive later.

311
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,170
Rym: Yeah, I think I got something, but I'm not sure.

312
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,410
Scott: Maybe I'll preorder it just because I know I'm gonna play it immediately, right?

313
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:37,448
Scott: So, why not?

314
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,468
Rym: I don't even remember preordering it.

315
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:40,988
Rym: It's just here.

316
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,709
Scott: All right, what do you got over there?

317
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:45,510
Rym: I don't really have much, actually.

318
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:46,065
Scott: All right.

319
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,209
Scott: I don't know, it's summer.

320
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,729
Scott: Heatwave's coming, maybe, that's gonna be cool.

321
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,988
Rym: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

322
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,970
Rym: I'm just chilling.

323
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,150
Scott: There's a holiday this weekend, so who knows what, oh, let's save that.

324
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,910
Rym: Yeah, we're having some sort of party.

325
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,750
Rym: What could we possibly have for the meta moment for that?

326
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,979
Scott: There might be a disturbance in the show next week.

327
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,990
Rym: All right, yeah, I guess we'll talk about that.

328
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,730
Scott: Because of Independence Day.

329
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:20,350
Rym: Now, I mostly got the fact that my whole hopper's been basically pushed back by preparations for Otakon and ConnectiCon and PAX and other big things that we're planning.

330
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,030
Scott: Yeah, they really sort of infiltrated my hopper quite a bit.

331
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,870
Rym: Yeah, my hopper got pushed back severely, but we've got a couple of videos coming.

332
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,009
Rym: I guess we're getting into meta again.

333
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,347
Rym: I don't know, it's Thursday, I got nothing.

334
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,069
Rym: I really just want to play Counter-Strike right now.

335
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,609
Rym: Of all the things I could do right now.

336
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,007
Scott: You know what I really want to do right now?

337
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:39,169
Scott: Eat dinner.

338
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:40,910
Rym: Eh, I had a big ice cream.

339
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,030
Scott: Oh, you know what, I'll mention one more thing, right?

340
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,329
Scott: So, near my office, there was this place I used to always get a breakfast sandwich from.

341
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,469
Scott: That's bad, don't do that.

342
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,109
Rym: I'm thinking about learning the song from Okadono Ken.

343
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:02,690
Scott: So, the breakfast sandwich place went out of business a while ago, and I haven't been able to find a place to get a decent breakfast sandwich near my work.

344
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,346
Scott: The only place is Tim Hortons, which is like, ugh.

345
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,670
Scott: It's like a combination Tim Hortons, KFC, Dunkin' Donuts, and Pizza Hut.

346
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,709
Scott: All in one, all in one.

347
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,970
Rym: So, I do not know if Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts have changed their recipes over time.

348
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,289
Scott: I guess it's not a Dunkin' Donuts anymore, it used to be.

349
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:27,629
Rym: Or if it's just that I have not eaten that sort of crap food in so long that I no longer am bamboozled by it.

350
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,070
Rym: But I ate a Tim Hortons breakfast sandwich the other day, and it tasted like sugar.

351
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,730
Rym: But it wasn't a donut, it was like a sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin, but it tasted like sugar.

352
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:43,122
Rym: It was so sweet, I couldn't stand it.

353
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,610
Rym: I threw the fucking thing away.

354
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,970
Scott: So, across the street, there's a place called The Majestic, and you can get one there.

355
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,910
Scott: But it's like $7, because it's all touristy and shit.

356
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,990
Rym: Dude, for $7, I'm expecting some lox and like a Bialy.

357
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,573
Scott: I know, right?

358
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:58,257
Scott: But not even.

359
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:01,030
Scott: You get lox and a bagel with cream cheese or $5.

360
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,823
Scott: With the coffee, right?

361
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:02,190
Scott: Anyway.

362
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,310
Scott: So, there's this other place I discovered, because they had a chalkboard out on the sidewalk.

363
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,509
Rym: Wow, this is suddenly New York.

364
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,650
Scott: Yeah, the chalkboard on the sidewalk was like custom omelet, whatever.

365
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:22,605
Scott: And I noticed that during lunch one day, because basically, there's this strip where there's an everything place, then there's a Qdoba, and then there's a Pret, and then there's another everything place.

366
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,005
Scott: Oh, Pret sucks.

367
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,430
Rym: I know, I don't know, all these people in my office like the fucking Pret.

368
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,019
Rym: It's just like Cozy.

369
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,250
Rym: Like, why do people eat at these places?

370
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,750
Scott: I don't know why anyone eaten the sandwiches that come in a cardboard box, please.

371
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,759
Rym: Well, Cozy doesn't even cook their food.

372
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,590
Rym: You order like a hot pizza that it's not even cooked?

373
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,149
Scott: At least Metro Cafe is like, you know.

374
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,756
Rym: Thing is, I got a bunch of tweets, and people emailed me when I tweeted out like, "Yeah, fuck you Cozy.

375
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,287
Rym: You've crossed me for like the fifth

376
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:48,630
Rym: time.".

377
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:51,059
Rym: And they were all like, "What are you talking about?

378
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,782
Rym: Cozy's awesome.

379
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:52,727
Rym: Your Cozy must just

380
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,029
Rym: suck.".

381
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,486
Scott: I'd rather go to fucking...

382
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:00,790
Rym: So, listen kids, in full disclosure, it is three separate Cozy's in three separate geographic locations.

383
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,667
Rym: If you think Cozy's good...

384
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:03,730
Scott: You don't know what's good.

385
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,230
Scott: What's the place that puts the sandwiches through the toaster?

386
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,249
Rym: A lot of places do that.

387
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,170
Scott: No, the place that was in, you know, the chain.

388
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,510
Scott: Yeah, Quiznos is better than fucking Cozy.

389
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,450
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

390
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,910
Scott: I mean, Subway's better than fucking Cozy.

391
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,294
Rym: In fact, I wouldn't mind a Quiznos nearby because when I'm... You know, sometimes you get in that mood where you look at a Subway and you're like, "You know what?

392
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:24,685
Rym: Maybe I'll eat

393
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,210
Rym: Subway.".

394
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,790
Scott: There's actually this place near my work called Fresh End Co.

395
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:30,670
Rym: Oh, those places are pretty cool.

396
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,770
Scott: It's actually like the sandwiches they have there.

397
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,610
Rym: I was gonna say cool, and then I said good.

398
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,238
Scott: You can get a sandwich there.

399
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,087
Scott: that's Quiznos style, but it's like 10,000 times better.

400
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,710
Scott: Anyway, and it's so cheap, it's like $6.

401
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,130
Scott: So there's two everything places, right?

402
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,370
Scott: But one of the everything places is only lunch, right?

403
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,970
Scott: It doesn't do breakfast or dinner.

404
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,850
Scott: And it's better than the first everything place.

405
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,269
Scott: So we've never actually been to the first everything place because the second everything place is just so much better.

406
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,590
Scott: But the first everything place I discovered today has breakfast.

407
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,127
Scott: So I went to get a bacon, egg, and cheese on an English muffin.

408
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,058
Scott: Dude used so much egg, right?

409
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:12,090
Scott: He had egg, then he put the bacon and the cheese in the egg and folded the egg over the top.

410
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,417
Rym: Oh, man.

411
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:14,710
Rym: That was like an omelet sandwich.

412
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,269
Scott: And then he put the egg into the English muffin.

413
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,749
Scott: The English muffin was basically so tiny compared to the egg.

414
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,282
Scott: It was like I had to eat the egg around the edge.

415
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,490
Rym: It was basically a Gothic Lolita English muffin.

416
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:34,589
Scott: I had to eat the egg around the edge before I could actually sort of hold on to the muffin.

417
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,270
Scott: But it was only $3.

418
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,830
Scott: You know, everything places usually charge like a big markup, but it was only $3.

419
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,890
Scott: So I was like, hells yeah.

420
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,657
Rym: Not bad.

421
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,410
Rym: I'm still sampling.

422
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,070
Rym: I walk by six different breakfast sandwich places on my way to work.

423
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,370
Scott: You haven't tried them all yet?

424
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:49,646
Scott: No.

425
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,409
Scott: You've been to work more than six days.

426
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,588
Rym: Yeah, there's two of these places I walk past every day and I look at them, I'm like, eh.

427
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:00,130
Scott: Well, just go to one of them on Tuesday and one of them on Wednesday.

428
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,470
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, usually I'm either running late or like they just they don't grab me.

429
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,898
Rym: And I walk past them and go to a place I've already been to.

430
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:12,690
Rym: because while they're not the greatest, I know they're at least acceptable.

431
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,803
Scott: Well, you can, you know, just try it out.

432
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:15,689
Scott: It's not going to poison you.

433
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,710
Rym: Yeah, but so imagine you're in this situation.

434
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,850
Rym: You're really hungry and you have a choice of a place that you know is acceptable, not good, but acceptable.

435
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,649
Rym: Or an unknown quantity that looks a little shady.

436
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,350
Scott: Well, if it looks shady, I'm not going to go there no matter what.

437
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,970
Rym: Because if I get the equivalent of a Tim Horton sandwich, what am I going to do?

438
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,650
Rym: Throw it away and go to another place in the same morning?

439
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:37,570
Scott: I would just eat it and deal with it.

440
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:38,395
Rym: I'm done with that.

441
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,810
Rym: I've started, if something's really bad, I just throw it away.

442
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,790
Scott: But what if you're missing out on an awesome sandwich?

443
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,569
Scott: Yeah, I'm not.

444
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,029
Scott: That just happens to be in a shady place.

445
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:47,729
Rym: Yeah, that could be.

446
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,849
Scott: Because it means I went to the place I went to, the everything place that I went to and got this breakfast sandwich, is the shadiest looking everything place we have.

447
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,230
Rym: The place that I keep walking past has had two competitors spring up like adjacent to it.

448
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,909
Rym: So I have a feeling there's something going on.

449
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,910
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

450
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,090
Scott: My computer went to sleep.

451
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,714
Rym: That's fine.

452
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,269
Rym: I'll talk about my thing of the day.

453
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:22,992
Rym: I'm a reader of Fark and I just want to point out as an aside, Drew Curtis had an interesting talk where he basically said, "You know what?

454
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,470
Rym: The wisdom of the crowds is bullshit.

455
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,701
Rym: 99% of what anyone says on the internet is terrible.

456
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:29,725
Rym: I should know.

457
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:30,547
Rym: I run

458
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:30,828
Rym: Fark.".

459
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,649
Scott: That's right.

460
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,750
Rym: So there's an article on Fark and this is why I read Fark.

461
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:43,150
Rym: This is one of those things that is just so weird and amazing that I'm not really sure how to take it.

462
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,489
Rym: It is an article that begs questions.

463
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:46,730
Scott: All right.

464
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,230
Rym: So there's an American Airlines flight, right?

465
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:50,797
Rym: It's going to take off.

466
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,004
Rym: People are on this flight.

467
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,989
Rym: They're ready to go.

468
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:55,270
Scott: They get stranded on the thing.

469
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:55,933
Rym: No, no.

470
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:56,689
Rym: They don't get stranded.

471
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:04,710
Rym: So apparently maggots started falling out of the ceiling somewhere onto this woman.

472
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:05,771
Scott: Okay.

473
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:15,730
Scott: So obviously there was some sort of meat in the overhead compartment that was left there by a previous passenger and they failed to clean it out as per the requirements that they clean the airplane after each flight.

474
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,030
Rym: So what they found, so obviously they take the flight back.

475
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:20,975
Rym: There's a minor emergency.

476
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:23,630
Rym: They're going to figure out what's going on with this maggot infestation.

477
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,121
Scott: You don't really need to go back for that.

478
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,330
Scott: You can just land at the nearest airport.

479
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,059
Rym: No, they didn't take off yet.

480
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,830
Rym: They taxied back to the terminal.

481
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,480
Rym: They sit there and people look around.

482
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,570
Rym: They're wondering if maybe it's something in the ceiling.

483
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,970
Rym: Maybe there's a problem with the airplane.

484
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,629
Scott: Maybe somebody actually brought maggots onto the plane in their carry-on.

485
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:48,870
Rym: So apparently there was a suitcase brought on by one of the passengers just a carry-on full of meat that was full of maggots.

486
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:52,669
Rym: And it was leaking maggots all over the place.

487
00:22:53,691 --> 00:23:02,610
Rym: Now, how could this carry-on suitcase have been so sealed that maggots weren't falling out during that security check and everything?

488
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,610
Rym: And then suddenly maggots, when it's on the plane.

489
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,730
Scott: And how could the maggots weren't killed by x-rays?

490
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:10,049
Rym: I don't think they would kill the maggots.

491
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,618
Scott: Maybe it would multiply.

492
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,250
Scott: That's why they started spilling out.

493
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,090
Scott: They were strengthened by the x-rays.

494
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,730
Scott: Because they were now radioactive super-strong maggots and they busted out of the luggage with their superpowers.

495
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,850
Scott: Like the Hulk or Spider-Man.

496
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,610
Rym: The article doesn't tell you anything more than that.

497
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,795
Rym: It's like, "Oh, they found the suitcase.

498
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:28,407
Rym: There were maggots in it because of spoiled meat in the

499
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,010
Rym: baggage."

500
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,261
Rym: And it doesn't say anything else.

501
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:34,050
Rym: What kind of journalism is this?

502
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,530
Rym: Obviously, we want to know who brought it on, why they brought it on.

503
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,909
Rym: I want a police interview with the person like, "See, you brought a bag full of spoiled meat.

504
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,266
Rym: Were there maggots in it when you put it in the

505
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:45,528
Rym: bag?".

506
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,630
Scott: Were there maggots who took it out of the bag?

507
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,210
Scott: Why didn't you put it in a refrigerated container and send it by next day FedEx?

508
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,069
Rym: See, that doesn't bother me that much.

509
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,250
Rym: Because I'm assuming that this is a person who willfully put meat, possibly spoiled meat, in a carry-on bag.

510
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,910
Rym: Probably not even in plastic.

511
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,296
Scott: Are you sure it was actually meat?

512
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:05,150
Scott: It could have been like, you know, bad bathtub cheese or something.

513
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:08,610
Rym: It says meat in the article.

514
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,720
Scott: Was it like just a dead animal?

515
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,930
Scott: or was it actually a proper cut of meat?

516
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,376
Rym: They don't say.

517
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,550
Rym: There's a little video of the maggots.

518
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,089
Scott: Because it could have just been like someone's pet died, you know?

519
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:22,110
Scott: In the carry-on, in the overhead container.

520
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,209
Scott: Well, no, he died and then he was bringing it somewhere to a pet cemetery far away, so he just put it in a carry-on.

521
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,210
Rym: But then, so cut back to our wonderful Homeland Security people.

522
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:36,150
Rym: You'd think they would have noticed the skeleton in the x-ray.

523
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,020
Scott: No, no, no, no.

524
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:40,988
Scott: Don't talk to me.

525
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,829
Rym: Just, this newspaper people.

526
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:45,789
Scott: He de-boned it.

527
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,110
Rym: The people who say, oh, newspapers.

528
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,000
Scott: Was it fish?

529
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:49,709
Scott: It could have been fish.

530
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,190
Rym: When newspapers go away, that we're going to lose journalism, there already isn't journalism.

531
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,989
Rym: This article told me nothing that I needed to know.

532
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,285
Scott: Well, I mean, there already isn't journalism at 99% of newspapers, right?

533
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,910
Scott: It's pretty much, because all the local newspapers, they get all their news from the big newspapers.

534
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:09,270
Scott: And basically, there's only actually like two or three sources of actual journalism.

535
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,670
Scott: And at those sources of actual journalism, such as New York Times and such, the majority of the journalists there aren't actually real journalists.

536
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,389
Scott: So it's like you have a small, the smallest percentage of journalism places have a small percentage of actual journalists, and that's it.

537
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,046
Scott: So, yeah.

538
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:29,729
Rym: It's going to bother me, because I'll never be able to find out what the deal was.

539
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,130
Scott: You know, you would have been better off not knowing it even happened.

540
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,717
Rym: I know.

541
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,390
Rym: Thanks, Fark.

542
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:34,570
Scott: That's why I don't read Fark.

543
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:46,030
Rym: But it's one of those things I would love for there to be a website that was like a collaborative thing that was designed solely, you know, integrated with phone apps and everything, to geotag, you know, like give location coordinates and things.

544
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,685
Rym: And basically, it's a what the fuck website, where you just say, "What the fuck was up with

545
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:50,908
Rym: this?"

546
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:57,240
Rym: And you give as much information as you have, and then maybe other people will tell you what the fuck it was up with, whatever it was.

547
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,930
Rym: you're wondering what the fuck it was up about.

548
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,770
Rym: Like, you know, you're walking by, and like a boot just falls from the sky, like lands in front of you.

549
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,190
Rym: And it's full of, like, gerbils, and they're fine, and they run off.

550
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:07,757
Rym: You're like, "What the

551
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:08,061
Rym: fuck?".

552
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:11,126
Rym: So you post, and the guy's like, "Yeah, I dropped my gerbil

553
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:11,327
Rym: boot.".

554
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,089
Scott: It was Currybo's shoe.

555
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:19,290
Scott: So, here's my thing of the day.

556
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,090
Scott: What is man?

557
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,652
Scott: No.

558
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,489
Scott: What is the best Gundam of all Gundams?

559
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,310
Scott: Freedom.

560
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,054
Scott: That's right.

561
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:26,730
Scott: Freedom Gundam is the best Gundam.

562
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,050
Scott: So, here's a video, and in this video, this guy builds Freedom Gundam.

563
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:37,304
Scott: In fact, he builds the same exact Freedom Gundam model that I have, which is the first Gundam model I ever built, the 1/100th Freedom Gundam.

564
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,742
Rym: Alright.

565
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,569
Scott: And he does it fast-forward, right, in the video, so it takes a few seconds for it to do that.

566
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,970
Scott: Then he builds another Freedom Gundam model that happens to be four feet tall, but that is not the important part, the fact that it was large.

567
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,070
Scott: That is not that impressive.

568
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,925
Scott: The impressive part is that he makes it out of paper.

569
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:10,270
Scott: He basically prints out 178 sheets out of his desk jet, and he gets an exacto knife and some glue and some folding in his hands, and he builds a four-foot-tall Freedom Gundam exactly like the plastic one.

570
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:10,776
Rym: Whoa!

571
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:14,270
Scott: And he basically does this, you know, also in fast motion.

572
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:23,990
Scott: So, it took him two weeks of sitting on the couch with a piece of cardboard on his lap, and, you know, scissors and whatever, but it takes you about four minutes to watch.

573
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:49,390
Scott: So, you watch four minutes of fast-forwarding, and you can see what the funniest thing about this, right, is you basically get four weeks of this dude sitting on the -- two weeks of this guy sitting on the couch, you know, building this model, and you see people occasionally come to sit with him on the couch and just sort of chat him up, and you notice, like, these people who sit with them on the couch, like, they're just, like, flipping around with their cell phones and whatever the whole time or just not doing anything, and this guy, he's building something.

574
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:51,410
Scott: So, don't be the guy with the cell phone.

575
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,430
Scott: Be the guy making a model out of paper.

576
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:54,570
Scott: All right.

577
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,367
Scott: Don't be the other guy.

578
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,770
Scott: And also, four-foot-tall Freedom Gundam.

579
00:27:57,915 --> 00:27:58,307
Scott: Oh, fuck.

580
00:27:58,572 --> 00:27:58,925
Rym: Not bad.

581
00:27:59,491 --> 00:27:59,908
Scott: Shit, yeah.

582
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,070
Rym: All right, Fark did a little bit of digging.

583
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:08,689
Rym: It was a woman who brought the suitcase on, and she was on the flight, and that's all they know.

584
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,609
Scott: No one asked her?

585
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,489
Rym: I don't know.

586
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,886
Rym: This is just Fark being like, "Hey, here's the best we could come up

587
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:14,087
Rym: with.".

588
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:15,748
Scott: Call her on the phone.

589
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,587
Scott: Be like, "Why did you have

590
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:17,688
Scott: meat?".

591
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:23,508
Rym: But, bonus points, there's a screenshot someone took, and they posted it on Fark, off the article, right?

592
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:27,529
Rym: And there's contextual advertising on the news site that reported it.

593
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:28,650
Scott: For selling maggots?

594
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,327
Rym: Selling meat.

595
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,663
Rym: And the first post, "Carry in

596
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:35,005
Rym: luggage."

597
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:37,670
Rym: That's a good joke.

598
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,470
Rym: The rest of the posts are garbage.

599
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:40,268
Scott: Yeah, it does.

600
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:41,699
Scott: "Carry in

601
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:41,944
Scott: luggage.".

602
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:43,570
Rym: So, the meta moment.

603
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,369
Rym: ConnectiCon is next weekend.

604
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,628
Scott: Oh, fuck me.

605
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,870
Rym: Yes, Jesus Christ.

606
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,829
Rym: Fuck me in the eye.

607
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,270
Rym: We run panels there.

608
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,110
Rym: It's going to be awesome.

609
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,320
Rym: July 9th, 10th, and 11th.

610
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:53,510
Rym: We'll be there.

611
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,370
Scott: Yeah, we're not just doing panels.

612
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:57,369
Scott: We are in charge of the panels.

613
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,150
Scott: Like, who is the boss of panels?

614
00:28:59,616 --> 00:28:59,748
Scott: Us.

615
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,590
Scott: Us is the boss.

616
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,889
Rym: And there have been some problems along the way.

617
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,129
Rym: I can tell you that much.

618
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,490
Scott: We're doing the best we can, considering our late induction.

619
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,970
Scott: But, next year, they'll be much better.

620
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,405
Rym: Yes.

621
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,910
Rym: Also, the New York Anime Festival Comic Con, off in the future, will be there doing stuff.

622
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:14,490
Scott: Oh, my God.

623
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,650
Scott: October 8th, 9th, 10th is going to be the weekend of doom.

624
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,030
Rym: The biggest fucking weekend ever.

625
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,670
Rym: There's the NerdNYC Board Gaming Night Friday.

626
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,990
Scott: October 8th, that night, 7 o'clock at Think Coffee downtown, NerdNYC Board Game Night.

627
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,010
Rym: Also, that is the beginning of 10-10-10, the Burning Wheel Extravaganza in Queens.

628
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:40,068
Scott: Yes, the Burning Wheel was originally released on 5-5-5, so it's 10-10-10, Burning Wheel Con on the 8th, 9th, and 10th.

629
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,788
Scott: Now, watch out.

630
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,960
Rym: If you can't do modulus math, you won't be able to figure out when the next one is going to be.

631
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:44,507
Scott: I know.

632
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:58,020
Scott: And, even worse, right, the New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival double mega convention in the New York, in the Jacob Javits Center on the west side is also the 8th, 9th, and 10th.

633
00:29:58,413 --> 00:29:58,966
Rym: So, it's anime.

634
00:29:59,472 --> 00:29:59,890
Scott: Of October.

635
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,670
Rym: And comics, and gaming, and we'll be there doing big shit.

636
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,930
Scott: But, before then, about a month before then, on Labor Day weekend, PEX West.

637
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:09,310
Rym: Oh, my God.

638
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:11,429
Rym: Oh, my God.

639
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,170
Rym: And, by the way, PEX West will be there.

640
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,689
Rym: We're doing numerous events.

641
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,770
Scott: Yeah.

642
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,490
Rym: The Book Club book is Still the Lies of Locke Lamora.

643
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:23,369
Rym: It's not the best written book, but it's really fun.

644
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,188
Rym: Really fun.

645
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,329
Rym: You'll probably enjoy it.

646
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,288
Scott: I chose it because it was a fun and easy book that would, hopefully, people would read it for fun.

647
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,330
Rym: It's like Lupin in a fantasy world, basically.

648
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:33,941
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,270
Scott: But, you see what I'm talking about.

650
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,510
Scott: It has that, we set up a fantasy world, but the story isn't about the fantasy world.

651
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,630
Scott: It's just in the fantasy world.

652
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,870
Scott: So, like, the deal with, like, why are there these towers of crystal and shit?

653
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,470
Scott: Well, we're not going to really explain, or that has nothing to do with the story.

654
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,470
Scott: They're just part of the setting.

655
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,150
Scott: All right.

656
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:49,843
Scott: Let's go.

657
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:50,746
Rym: Yep.

658
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,290
Rym: I don't know what other meta we have.

659
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,710
Rym: Next week, basically, for the next two weeks, gig nights will be on and off again.

660
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,090
Scott: You may not live in the United States.

661
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,029
Scott: You may not know that it is the 4th of July this weekend, which means we don't have to work on Monday.

662
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,889
Rym: It's the day where we kicked your albionic asses.

663
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:03,910
Scott: Right.

664
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,250
Scott: So, that means that who knows- You like my alliteration?

665
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:15,348
Scott: Who knows what kind of shows we're going to be doing next week, considering, like, Friday, you know, Thursday night or maybe Friday morning, we're running off to ConnectiCon and Monday we don't have work.

666
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:19,110
Scott: So, it's pretty much a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday next week, and who knows if we're.

667
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,950
Rym: I don't think we're going to do any shows next week.

668
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,990
Scott: We're going to do some show.

669
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,289
Rym: We might do one show.

670
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:24,629
Scott: What show should we do?

671
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:25,129
Scott: I don't know.

672
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:25,929
Rym: I got an idea.

673
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:26,990
Scott: Maybe we'll do something.

674
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,610
Scott: Anyway, next week, who knows about the status of our podcast.

675
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,670
Scott: Of course, but maybe not the Phantom.

676
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,010
Rym: So, we did a show on Lego.

677
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,528
Scott: A long time ago.

678
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:40,789
Rym: So, we realized, you know, we needed a show to do.

679
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,850
Scott: And I came up with an idea, a genius idea.

680
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,770
Rym: Clearly, we would do a show on UnLEGO.

681
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:53,410
Scott: Yeah, because there's a lot of UnLEGO, so that we can definitely cover enough, you know, material to make an entire episode of GeekNights.

682
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,009
Scott: We're talking about all the various UnLEGOs.

683
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:59,030
Scott: So, I- Pick an UnLEGO, or you shall begin with it.

684
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:04,929
Rym: See, it's tricky because what we each pick as our first one will say a lot about our personalities, I think.

685
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,849
Scott: I think it's, no, it's actually just gonna say about what I have the most to talk about.

686
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,010
Rym: Eh, no, because the one that I think stands out the most in my head is Tinker Toys, because nothing else was like Tinker Toys.

687
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,810
Scott: That's the one with the little wooden balls with the holes and the sticks.

688
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:16,325
Scott: Yes.

689
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,110
Scott: I actually, like I, you know, I knew Tinker Toys, but I never really had them.

690
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,590
Rym: I think my- Tinker Toys date back to World Fucking War 1.

691
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,721
Rym: I know.

692
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,890
Scott: My grandma, I think, had one bucket of them.

693
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,310
Scott: And I know of some friends who had them.

694
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,090
Rym: There were also, Kelvin played with them in Kelvin and Hobbes.

695
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,129
Scott: Yeah, but I never really had them or used them that much or really explored any of their possibilities.

696
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,210
Rym: In my mind, they were much more kind of, there was a lot more you could do with them.

697
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,530
Rym: They were just more versatile and more weird.

698
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,290
Rym: You could make big, weird contraptions, the likes of which you really couldn't make with other things.

699
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,328
Scott: Yeah, but they didn't really move.

700
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,049
Rym: You know, you could- Nothing back then moved.

701
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,110
Scott: Oh, yeah, it did.

702
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:54,650
Rym: What?

703
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,250
Rym: Construction or constructo?

704
00:32:57,884 --> 00:32:57,948
Scott: No.

705
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:58,947
Scott: The erector set.

706
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,089
Scott: I had the erector set.

707
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,050
Rym: Yeah, honestly, I didn't like the erector set.

708
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,470
Scott: Oh, you see?

709
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,290
Scott: This is the thing, right?

710
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,142
Scott: So, I had, right?

711
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,370
Scott: I had my freaking mom's brother's erector set.

712
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,529
Rym: Yeah, I had the same deal.

713
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,810
Rym: Basically, the whole family was super full of nostalgia for erector sets.

714
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,749
Rym: So, they got me an original real deal erector set.

715
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:24,590
Rym: And I already had a bunch of other kinds of things that were more updated.

716
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,550
Rym: So, the erector set was kind of difficult.

717
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,890
Rym: I couldn't make anything interesting with it.

718
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,430
Scott: Oh, see, I had this old erector set, right?

719
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,530
Scott: And it had all this crazy- It even had like a motor and some crazy shit.

720
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,830
Scott: I couldn't even make it work because it was just so old and crazy.

721
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:41,529
Scott: But the thing that was awesome about the erector set, right, was that you could- You had actual screws and nuts.

722
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,450
Scott: It was like you're actually doing for real hardware.

723
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,570
Scott: It wasn't like some, you know, like snap together child-friendly thing.

724
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:55,350
Scott: It was like, "Here, here's a bunch of pieces of fucking metal with holes in them and screws and nuts that are the right size for the holes.

725
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:56,176
Scott: Go

726
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:56,502
Scott: nuts.".

727
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:59,790
Scott: And you could actually, you know, you can make like there's some wheels.

728
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,370
Scott: I made some cars, some other stuff with that.

729
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,750
Rym: See, I guess much more fun than erector sets.

730
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:09,710
Scott: But then, actually, later on, they like the re- You know, erector set disappeared for a while or at least lied low.

731
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,130
Scott: But then it made a slight resurgence.

732
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,230
Scott: And I had like one more modern erector set thing that was like a helicopter of some kind.

733
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:20,790
Scott: And it actually was relatively compatible with the original erector set.

734
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:27,250
Scott: It was just more modern, you know, less cut yourself, more safe for the modern times kind of situation.

735
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,659
Rym: See, I had this set of toys.

736
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,889
Rym: I have no idea what they were called.

737
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,309
Rym: Maybe someone can help me out.

738
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:42,909
Rym: They look kind of like erector sets, but they were- Because this is mostly of flat green pieces of plastic with large holes kind of interspersed, like along their lengths, and the holes had kind of ridges around them.

739
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:50,330
Rym: So you could use these plastic bolts and screws and nuts and things to connect them together.

740
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,750
Rym: And they were kind of like a big plastic erector set.

741
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:56,010
Scott: It might have just been wussy erector set.

742
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,910
Rym: No, because they actually- you could do things like make large swords and actually hit people with them.

743
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,943
Scott: You could make a fucking sword with an erector set.

744
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:04,790
Scott: Watch the fuck out.

745
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,110
Rym: But they were also bendy, so you could make really interesting shapes with them.

746
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:09,910
Scott: Oh, okay.

747
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,650
Rym: And actually, I would use them to make these very elaborate vehicles to put my mask men in, and then see if they would survive.

748
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,090
Scott: See, erector set is like more of an engineering thing, right?

749
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,770
Scott: You can't just make like a long stick, right?

750
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,261
Scott: You got to think about it like a bridge.

751
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,149
Scott: You got to tress it and stuff like that.

752
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,910
Rym: Well, if you're talking about wussifying things, there's always connects.

753
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:30,061
Scott: Yeah, my brother had connects.

754
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:31,610
Scott: I didn't really do too much of it.

755
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,910
Rym: They kind of, like by the time we got connects, was right about when I was getting to the end of that era in my life.

756
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,250
Scott: And the problem with connects is that it was really only strong- the links were strong in only one direction.

757
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:50,069
Scott: So if you wanted to make anything that was actually durable and stiff and could actually be for serious- You had to basically fully truss it.

758
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,157
Scott: You had to work in both dimensions.

759
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:57,950
Scott: You could make a sword, but if you made a flat sword, which is pretty easy, it would be all floppy.

760
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,689
Scott: You had to make a sword in the shape of a plus to actually get it to be kind of strong.

761
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,990
Rym: Which was good in a way that it was more for building structures rather than building a sword that I hit my brother with.

762
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:14,850
Scott: Yeah, it was very similar to erector set, but it only worked at certain angles, and you snapped instead of screwing.

763
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,410
Scott: So you lost the screwing aspect of it.

764
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,790
Rym: But notice how they would pop in and out the sides, which really limited your structural integrity.

765
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,893
Scott: That's what I was just saying.

766
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:29,529
Scott: Any link was only strong in one direction, which means you needed to go in multiple directions to get any sort of strength.

767
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:39,446
Scott: Plus, honestly, you couldn't do that much interesting with them, and most of the interesting things were- Yeah, other than following the directions, it was actually pretty hard to come up with something original that wasn't just like, "I made a gun.

768
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:39,747
Scott: It's an

769
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:40,329
Scott: L."

770
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:45,963
Scott: "I made a box with a stairway inside," or something.

771
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:57,770
Rym: I gotta say, though, I don't know if I should save it for last or just jump in the middle, but of all those sorts of things, the best, far and away, bar none for me, were waffle blocks.

772
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,390
Scott: You mean just fucking the fluffy foam things?

773
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:02,752
Scott: What?

774
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:05,790
Rym: No, these were big pieces of very sturdy plastic.

775
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:14,270
Rym: For a little kid, they were huge, flat pieces of plastic with interlocking notches along the edges.

776
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:14,940
Scott: Yeah, right.

777
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:15,330
Scott: Okay.

778
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,550
Rym: But they were hard plastic.

779
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,036
Scott: They made those still, but they're foam.

780
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,890
Scott: They're like jigsaw puzzle pieces, but they're all identical.

781
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,315
Rym: Yeah, but these, well, they weren't all identical.

782
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:24,378
Rym: Some had holes in them.

783
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:28,570
Rym: You could mount them on the sides, not just in the middle.

784
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:29,289
Rym: Oh, right, right.

785
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:32,739
Rym: But you could make large structures that could hold your own weight.

786
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,770
Rym: I would make entire forts, walls to block off parts of the house.

787
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,634
Scott: Yeah, that is something to be said, right?

788
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,298
Scott: It's like none of the other things.

789
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:45,230
Scott: When you're working with, say, Lego, you're making things that are miniature size.

790
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,155
Scott: It's like you're making toys.

791
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:52,430
Scott: Unless you're rich, you're not making Legos that are the size that can interact with the real world.

792
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,063
Scott: But some of these other ones, like erector set, you're also usually making something small.

793
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,629
Scott: Unless you have so much erector set, you could make a real go-kart.

794
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:01,230
Scott: you could sit in.

795
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,661
Scott: But that's a lot of fucking erector set.

796
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,144
Rym: One time I remember we would always make, my brother and I, we'd make a boat in the living room.

797
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,470
Rym: Like a gigantic with a floor.

798
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,449
Scott: You'd put it in the pool?

799
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,772
Rym: No, it wouldn't float.

800
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:14,337
Rym: But we'd make it on the floor, right?

801
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:17,243
Rym: With a hull and walls and a deck.

802
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,630
Rym: And then we'd basically fight off the pirates from the outside with Nerf guns.

803
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:20,977
Rym: Yeah.

804
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,788
Rym: Oh, and also there were Wii waffle blocks, which were like two or three inches by two or three inches.

805
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:28,370
Rym: They were much smaller.

806
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,068
Scott: Was that for adding detail to the big waffle blocks?

807
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,176
Rym: No, they were incompatible.

808
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:32,545
Rym: They were just like a smaller scale.

809
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:34,859
Scott: They were basically- So I hate that when the shit's incompatible.

810
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,950
Scott: Like why isn't Duplo compatible with Lego?

811
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,868
Rym: They kind of were.

812
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:38,345
Rym: No.

813
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,106
Rym: I used them.

814
00:38:39,991 --> 00:38:40,954
Rym: You know why I used them?

815
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:46,030
Rym: The Duplos were the old cyclopean ruins of ancient giant civilizations.

816
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,394
Scott: They're not compatible.

817
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:49,678
Scott: They really got to work on that.

818
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,910
Scott: I think that what they should do for Duplo, right, is because you get a Duplo and like you got a big Duplo.

819
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,596
Scott: And it's got like eight big circles on it, right?

820
00:38:56,616 --> 00:39:02,510
Scott: What they should do is they should just make Duplo just have Lego sized dots on top, right?

821
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,135
Scott: So it's just, it is a Lego.

822
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,000
Scott: It's just fucking big, right?

823
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:09,470
Scott: Then it would be way more awesome and Lego would be compatible with it.

824
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,857
Scott: It would just be, you know, Lego pieces that were gigantic.

825
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:16,590
Scott: And it would actually help you out with your Lego later on when you grow, you graduate.

826
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,054
Scott: Because then you want to build a big castle, like big.

827
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,497
Scott: You just do blow it up.

828
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:27,430
Scott: You get to forget, you know, instead of having a million small Legos to build a big flat wall, it is just a lot of pieces that make a mess.

829
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,211
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:31,421
Rym: Of course, if you're going to make a big thing, I mean, like the waffle blocks are like this big.

831
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,103
Rym: I'm gesturing.

832
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,370
Rym: No one else can see, but they're like, they're gigantic.

833
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,956
Scott: Yeah.

834
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:36,433
Scott: All right.

835
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,884
Scott: Did you have any other non-Legos?

836
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,510
Scott: Because I had- I had quite a few.

837
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:47,029
Rym: Actually, my favorite thing with waffle blocks though, which was always dangerous, was I'd make the tallest stairway I could make and then climb it until I broke it.

838
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:49,330
Rym: Or turn it into bridges over gaps.

839
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,830
Scott: If you made it too tall, wouldn't you hurt yourself?

840
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,029
Rym: Yes, I hurt myself often.

841
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,323
Scott: I guess that makes them the most dangerous non-Lego, right?

842
00:39:57,343 --> 00:39:58,830
Scott: Because the other ones are not dangerous at all.

843
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,670
Rym: I would argue that actually the Tinker Toys were the most dangerous.

844
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:02,074
Scott: What?

845
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:02,387
Scott: How so?

846
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:08,890
Rym: Because they consisted of hard, brittle, easily snapped into basically stake pieces of wood.

847
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,318
Scott: They're little tiny sticks.

848
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,590
Scott: They're no more dangerous than pick-ups.

849
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,041
Scott: They're like pick-up sticks.

850
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:13,790
Scott: They're not dangerous.

851
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,369
Rym: Pick-up sticks are reasonably dangerous.

852
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,906
Scott: Or what's that game where you pull the sticks out and the marbles fall down?

853
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:18,530
Scott: Same sticks.

854
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,698
Rym: No, they were wood.

855
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:23,950
Scott: They actually, if you broke one in half- Not like- My pick-up sticks are wooden.

856
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,569
Rym: If you broke these in half, you could stab a kid right through the chest with it.

857
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,010
Scott: Well, you had a serious Tinker Toy then.

858
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,170
Scott: I think that's just the way they were.

859
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,930
Scott: I never saw a Tinker Toy that was that serious.

860
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,137
Rym: You ever snap one in half?

861
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,509
Rym: They snap into basically a stiletto.

862
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,911
Scott: Alrighty.

863
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:40,510
Scott: I see that you are much practiced with stabbing.

864
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,926
Scott: You have a third sibling that was murdered.

865
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:47,021
Scott: I don't know.

866
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:53,090
Scott: The other ones I had to- If I think back, the ones I actually used quite often were Lincoln Logs.

867
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,910
Scott: Really, you couldn't do anything with Lincoln Logs except make log cabins.

868
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,730
Rym: Why was it so satisfying, though?

869
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:01,865
Scott: The only pieces you had were long, short.

870
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,530
Scott: You had the one that was half, so it was flat on the bottom.

871
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,074
Rym: Oh, I had more.

872
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:09,149
Rym: You had the green slats.

873
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,689
Scott: I had the green slats and the plastic things that held together the green slats.

874
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:13,789
Rym: See, I didn't use those.

875
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:14,509
Scott: Oh, really?

876
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,130
Rym: Those were wussy, but the sizes were- How did you hold your roof together?

877
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,610
Rym: You know the sizes, there were the three long ones with the notch in the middle and the two ends.

878
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,484
Scott: Well, there were three long ones.

879
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:23,809
Scott: Yeah, right.

880
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,029
Rym: Yeah, there's the two long ones, like the short ones, and there's the one long ones.

881
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:28,939
Scott: Yeah, the one longs, right?

882
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,130
Scott: I forgot about those, so you mentioned them, but yeah, I do remember them.

883
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,748
Rym: So, I would use those to make columns.

884
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:34,368
Scott: Uh-huh.

885
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:44,950
Rym: And basically, I'd use those to make structures that had awnings and arches coming out of them, or I'd have a deck three stories up with a column coming all the way down.

886
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,079
Scott: See, my problem is I just didn't have enough Lincoln Logs.

887
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:49,288
Scott: I pretty much had one log cabin, and that was it.

888
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,876
Rym: I also had four long ones.

889
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:55,790
Scott: Oh, shit.

890
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:55,999
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:41:56,331 --> 00:42:06,290
Scott: I didn't have any, so I obviously, I just had a set that was like a single log cabin set, so I couldn't really expand a lot with my Lincoln Logs, but now I wish I had more.

892
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,410
Rym: See, so what I would do with them is I usually make- Do they still make that shit?

893
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:10,787
Rym: I'd assume so.

894
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:11,141
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:20,590
Rym: I'd make big structures, but instead of using the slat holding plastic, I would put the slats flat across the top and build another structure on top of that one.

896
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,113
Scott: Oh.

897
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:23,758
Rym: I fucking love my Lincoln Logs.

898
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,868
Rym: And then I'd put a firecracker at the base.

899
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:36,029
Scott: Yeah, I think Lincoln Logs, they don't get enough respect or attention, but the fact that we both had them and both liked them and used them a lot, pretty much second to Lego, I was using Lincoln Logs.

900
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,280
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,806
Scott: You know?

902
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:37,720
Scott: I don't know.

903
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,729
Scott: I had- And all I was doing was building the same log cabin over and over again.

904
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:49,850
Rym: See, what I really do is I don't remember the names of really any of these products, but I would combine my Legos, but I can't talk about any of the Lego, obviously, so I'll skip that.

905
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:53,210
Rym: I'd make Lego cities, but I had micro machines.

906
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,730
Scott: Micro machines don't count.

907
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,796
Rym: No, no, no, but here's what I'd do.

908
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,829
Rym: So I'd use the micro machine like villages, right?

909
00:42:58,471 --> 00:43:01,470
Rym: And I'd connect them to this road building system that I had.

910
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:06,510
Rym: that was just like this third party completely independent toy where you'd connect like these roads together.

911
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,450
Rym: It had intersections and lanes and everything.

912
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,610
Rym: Well, I guess, I mean, I had this particular micro- Ah, but here, I'll link it to the stuff.

913
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:22,029
Rym: So I'd use those and I'd interface them finally with the wee waffle blocks and the wee waffle blocks would be used to make the suburbs.

914
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:30,490
Rym: And I'd basically make this gigantic heterogeneous city between hot wheels and road systems and micro machines and waffle blocks and Legos.

915
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:38,590
Scott: I actually had this one particular micro machine set, right, where you bought them individually for like five bucks, which is like the easiest toy to get.

916
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,910
Scott: Yeah, but you could connect them all together.

917
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,162
Scott: Because every time you go to the store, you're like, "Hey, mom, buy me one of those for 10 bucks.

918
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:43,827
Scott: Hey, buy me one of

919
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:43,988
Scott: those.".

920
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,810
Scott: And then you eventually get so many of them, you can connect them all together.

921
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,470
Scott: Did you ever get the two city centerpiece units?

922
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,950
Scott: No, my brother had the big van that opened up.

923
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,330
Rym: Oh, yeah, we had the van and there was another one.

924
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,830
Rym: And we combined those with the little ones and everything else to make an entire city.

925
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,815
Scott: But I had these little gray plastic rectangles and they folded in half.

926
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:10,928
Scott: And they had all these accessories that you'd put inside when you fold it in half and they would seal it.

927
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:18,470
Scott: And you'd open it up, like in a gas station, for example, and you would open it up and you'd put these decals on there and the gas station pieces would come out.

928
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,709
Scott: You'd put them on top.

929
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:21,270
Scott: And then you had these little cars.

930
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:29,270
Scott: So every set came with a highway intersection and some set pieces and some cars.

931
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,650
Scott: And you just kept getting enough of these.

932
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,748
Scott: It was like the greatest deal.

933
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,750
Rym: I remember the guy would talk really fast in all the commercials and that was how I would sell them.

934
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:35,749
Rym: Remember that guy?

935
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,109
Scott: All right, so let's go to things that are actually, you know.

936
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:47,290
Rym: The point was that I'd take the wee waffle blocks, but they were like one aspect of a basement-filling city that I would build over the course of an entire weekend.

937
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,170
Scott: Well, I think that's, you know, it's like no one had enough of a single toy to go all out.

938
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:59,750
Scott: You had to combine your toys, you know, and your different constructing things in some way to go large, right?

939
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,002
Scott: You know, unless you're rich, you didn't have so much Lego.

940
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:04,910
Scott: you could just cover the whole fucking basement, you know.

941
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,670
Scott: You only had enough Lego to build like a few castles.

942
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:12,230
Scott: So if you wanted to add something in there, you had to add something in there with some non-Lego.

943
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,789
Scott: Because, you know, you had this Lincoln Log sitting there.

944
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,190
Scott: It's like, well, I can't just ignore that shit, right?

945
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,770
Scott: Just let it sit in the closet, you know.

946
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:20,550
Scott: I don't have enough Lego to do what I want.

947
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:22,228
Scott: I got to bust something else out.

948
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,172
Scott: Now, let's see.

949
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:27,970
Scott: The only other two, I barely had any of it, but the Play Mobile.

950
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:29,267
Scott: Oh, yeah.

951
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,330
Scott: Because Play Mobile really, you don't build so much with it, but it's like it competes with the Lego men, right?

952
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:41,230
Scott: And the thing with Play Mobile is that it has pretty much anything you can imagine, they got it, right?

953
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,220
Scott: Pirates, they got it.

954
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,090
Scott: Ninja, they got it.

955
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,628
Rym: But because it was like 60% compatible with Lego...

956
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,408
Scott: Zombie, they got it.

957
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,590
Scott: It was kind of...

958
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,509
Rym: I would take the weapons and like file them down a little bit to get them to work.

959
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,790
Scott: Play Mobile's really more about the guys than it is about the building, you know.

960
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,850
Scott: But, yeah, I mean, they just have so many freaking sets.

961
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,288
Scott: Like, you can't imagine like a single thing that they do not have.

962
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:08,410
Scott: You know, if it's like fucking helicopter, fucking army, fucking just like wizards.

963
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,870
Scott: And it's like they must sit there and think of every possible setting for any possible story you could possibly imagine.

964
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,749
Scott: And any possible character you would need in that setting and any possible building you would need in that setting, there's a Play Mobile set for it.

965
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:28,730
Scott: You know, whereas Lego tends to stick to a setting and just sort of make, you know, the full like a whole run on it.

966
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:32,790
Scott: You know, Play Mobile will just make like one or two things per setting.

967
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:34,430
Scott: Like maybe a big, a medium, and a small.

968
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,209
Scott: And then they'll do as many settings as they can.

969
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,208
Scott: Whereas Lego does just a few settings.

970
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,889
Scott: And then they concentrate on them real hard.

971
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,370
Scott: Like, let's make a hundred castle sets.

972
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,605
Scott: Whereas Play Mobile's got like... We got three castles.

973
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:45,910
Scott: We're good.

974
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,090
Rym: One thing that I had, I don't remember what it was called, but it was a whole series that eventually died out.

975
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:57,310
Rym: It was basically eye beams and towers and all this kind of stuff that would construct together.

976
00:46:57,753 --> 00:46:59,889
Rym: Like you could make all sorts of different structures with them.

977
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,438
Rym: And you could combine the sets.

978
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,769
Rym: They were all compatible with each other.

979
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,750
Rym: But you'd make like a huge structure, like a radio broadcasting tower or a skyscraper.

980
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:13,310
Rym: And then they gave you like these four different, basically, bombs that would destroy them.

981
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:13,808
Rym: What?

982
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:14,947
Rym: They were designed...

983
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,150
Scott: This isn't what I was going to talk about.

984
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,290
Rym: No, but you could build them like Lincoln Logs or K'Nex or anything.

985
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,930
Rym: Because, you know kids, you'd eventually build like a gigantic tower out of something.

986
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:24,889
Rym: And then you'd destroy it.

987
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,170
Rym: And you're interested in like the way it destroyed.

988
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,550
Rym: Imagine a system, like a toy, that was designed to be destroyed.

989
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,850
Rym: And in fact was designed to where when you tried to destroy it, it fell apart in an awesome way.

990
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,428
Scott: I never heard of such a toy.

991
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,130
Rym: I had every set of it and all my friends did too.

992
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,870
Rym: They were huge among like my play group in like second grade.

993
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,130
Rym: I have no idea what they were called.

994
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,630
Rym: The first set was the simplest.

995
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,865
Rym: It was just like eye beams and connectors for them.

996
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:49,590
Rym: They were like brown.

997
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:51,470
Rym: And then they got more and more complex.

998
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,250
Rym: One was like this white and orange radio tower.

999
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,329
Rym: One was like an oil rig kind of thing.

1000
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:57,202
Scott: Uh huh.

1001
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,118
Rym: It was pretty fucking badass.

1002
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,149
Rym: I need someone out there to tell me what it was.

1003
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,669
Scott: Yeah, the only other thing I had a lot of was constructs, right?

1004
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,149
Scott: I don't know how many people out there know constructs.

1005
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,490
Scott: But basically the way it works, you have these plastic pieces, right?

1006
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:13,570
Scott: That are just sort of long and of various different lengths and colors.

1007
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:18,010
Scott: And then they have at the ends of each piece is a place to snap.

1008
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,930
Scott: And they give you these little tiny square pieces.

1009
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,549
Scott: And you basically can, you know, a square piece has a connector on all eight sides.

1010
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,550
Scott: All six sides, not eight sides.

1011
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:28,631
Scott: Right?

1012
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:32,110
Scott: So you can connect, you know, these long pieces, the beams.

1013
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:35,070
Scott: And you basically put a connector at every joint.

1014
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,309
Scott: And you can just go nuts.

1015
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,530
Scott: And sometimes they'll like give you a piece of plastic that you can like snap to fill in one of the sides.

1016
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:44,030
Scott: And then like I had the best set.

1017
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,530
Scott: I had like this one where there's a spaceman and he had a spaceship.

1018
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,610
Scott: And there's an alien and he had a spaceship.

1019
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:51,670
Scott: And they're like totally like the coolest looking alien dudes.

1020
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,730
Scott: They were totally evil.

1021
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,790
Scott: And they gave you like this cool, like before Lego did the outer space.

1022
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,970
Scott: Like this set the tone of the outer space style for that kind of stuff.

1023
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,169
Scott: And, you know, the best thing was because you had the plastic pieces to fill in.

1024
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:09,770
Scott: You can actually make like these big surfaces with them.

1025
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,650
Scott: So you could do is you could like make sort of like a, you know, a flat surface.

1026
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,970
Scott: And then a more elevated flat surface and then something else.

1027
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,450
Scott: And then you could, you know, use that as a platform.

1028
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,429
Scott: And you put your big flat Lego bases on top of that.

1029
00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:24,175
Scott: Right.

1030
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:25,270
Scott: To keep them off the floor.

1031
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:30,150
Scott: And actually you could put like a castle up high or a tree and then a castle down low.

1032
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:31,148
Scott: And then a boat.

1033
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:34,190
Scott: You know, you get you can make it as like the foundation for the Lego.

1034
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,370
Scott: It was a very, very good combination there.

1035
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:43,830
Scott: It was also had a motorized thing for it, but I never really, you know, I never really had great success with anything that was motorized.

1036
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:44,987
Scott: You know, I never really.

1037
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:46,986
Rym: Because they're always got a chintzy.

1038
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:47,430
Rym: They never work.

1039
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,390
Scott: The Lego Technic worked, but I didn't have motorized ones.

1040
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,010
Scott: I had cranked gear ones, you know, but none of my motorized things work.

1041
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,830
Scott: And I think it's because I never got the more expensive motorized sets.

1042
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,549
Scott: I always got the cheapest possible ones that sucked ass.

1043
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,569
Scott: I didn't get like the Mindstorm that actually works.

1044
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,530
Scott: You know, I got like if I can put 2D batteries in here and push a button and it spins around.

1045
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,355
Scott: Gee, thanks.

1046
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:10,369
Scott: That helps.

1047
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,010
Scott: I think that's all the ones I had.

1048
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:17,430
Rym: Yeah, we couldn't come up with much else to talk about.

1049
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,729
Scott: You didn't have any others?

1050
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,869
Rym: Not that I can recall offhand anymore.

1051
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,030
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, constructs were...

1052
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,890
Rym: No, I suddenly was reminded of a toy that I think almost everyone's forgotten about.

1053
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:30,790
Rym: Remember the Nerf fencing system?

1054
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:31,405
Scott: No.

1055
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:35,589
Rym: It was gigantic, awesomely constructed Nerf swords.

1056
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,730
Rym: And the like the hilt had basically four targets sticking out of it.

1057
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:43,810
Rym: And you had to push in the four targets on your opponent's sword.

1058
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,430
Scott: It's like the vaguest of vague recollections.

1059
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,470
Scott: It's like so vague, I don't even know if it's...

1060
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,730
Rym: Basically, I remember having this and it's suddenly like all these memories of like playing with it.

1061
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,869
Rym: And getting frustrated with trying to hit the targets, just hitting my brother over the head.

1062
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,530
Scott: We had to look it up on YouTube.

1063
00:50:59,056 --> 00:50:59,185
Scott: Yeah.

1064
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,680
Scott: Cause you know there's gonna be a video of it.

1065
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:01,910
Scott: Or a commercial.

1066
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,710
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1067
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,830
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1068
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:22,270
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1069
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,190
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1070
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:29,950
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1071
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,446
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1072
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,770
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1073
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,890
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1074
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:12,913
Rym: (Singing in Japanese).
