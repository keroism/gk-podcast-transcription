1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,400
Scott:

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,129
Rym: It's Christmas Day 2012.

3
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:13,711
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,154
Scott: I'm not Christian.

5
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:18,001
Rym: Neither am I and this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:23,197
Rym: Tonight on this lovely Xmas we are talking about Hotline Miami.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,802
Scott: The least Christmassy.

8
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,269
Rym: The most Christmassy game there is.

9
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:29,677
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:33,333
Scott: I was actually trying to think of if there are any Christmassy games.

11
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:34,117
Rym: Hotline Miami.

12
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:38,058
Scott: No, but like legitimately Christmassy games and I could not think of any.

13
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:46,202
Scott: The only things I could think of were games like Rise of the Triad where if you play it on Christmas then there's like Easter eggs because it looks a date on your calendar.

14
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,276
Rym: There probably are some crappy Santa ish games.

15
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:50,962
Scott: I'm sure but can you think of a...

16
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:51,464
Rym: Home Alone.

17
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,989
Rym: I guess.

18
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,631
Scott: Home Alone.

19
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,076
Scott: Die Hard was an NES game.

20
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,080
Rym: Yeah, Home Alone and Die Hard.

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,897
Scott: But I mean can you think of legitimately Christmas themed as in?

22
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,063
Scott: the theme is Christmas.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,998
Scott: not the theme is Home Alone which is a Christmas movie, right?

24
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,440
Scott: Games.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,844
Rym: So it's got to be the direct theme.

26
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:08,028
Scott: That aren't just.

27
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:09,131
Scott: So it can't be a game that is about.

28
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:14,814
Scott: That aren't just like throwaway shovelware you know or like flash games for marketing purposes or bullshit like that.

29
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:25,910
Rym: Why doesn't someone just make, I'm sure they exist and they're all terrible, the tower defense equivalent but more like the resource management game of Santa's got to deliver all the presents.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,156
Scott: That could be pretty good.

31
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,242
Rym: Yeah it could be pretty good.

32
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:29,770
Scott: You just plot Santa's route.

33
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:32,585
Scott: You have to manage all the elves to make enough presents.

34
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:33,852
Scott: You might come up short.

35
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,340
Scott: then you get which kids to short.

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,086
Rym: So then you start federating Santa's.

37
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:38,592
Scott: And you play years at a time.

38
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,479
Scott: You know one year, year one, year two.

39
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,151
Rym: No it's got to be like Sim, not Sim City.

40
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:44,096
Scott: Sim Pole.

41
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,629
Rym: No it's got to be like Arrow Biz where you start in like the 1890s.

42
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,655
Scott: There's competing Santa's.

43
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:50,980
Scott: There's other Santa's.

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,865
Rym: No you're fighting against Krampus.

45
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:58,743
Rym: I feel like most people didn't know about Krampus.

46
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:02,139
Rym: At least not in the US but just in the last, like this year.

47
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,071
Rym: for whatever reason, Krampus has come up.

48
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:06,927
Rym: Like there's been a bunch of College Humor videos about Krampus.

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,119
Rym: Krampus has come up in a bunch of webcomics.

50
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,689
Scott: I feel like, you know what, it's not just you.

51
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,721
Scott: This is the third time I've heard Krampus come up.

52
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,650
Rym: Yeah so why did it come up suddenly?

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,605
Scott: It came up on the John Hodgman podcast as the first place I heard it.

54
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:21,106
Scott: Then I saw someone mention it in a comment on the internets.

55
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:21,850
Scott: You just said it now.

56
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,594
Scott: It's the third one.

57
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:25,910
Scott: The reason it's been on my mind is three more Krampuses than I heard last year.

58
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:37,413
Rym: Since Halloween when everyone except Scott went to Chase's house to watch possibly the third best Christmas movie ever made, Rare Exports, which you should watch.

59
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:46,239
Rym: It is on the same level as Miracle on 34th Street and it's on that level of movie.

60
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,864
Scott: Of course the black and white old one.

61
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:51,315
Scott: That has remakes you know.

62
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:51,897
Scott: Really?

63
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:52,419
Scott: Oh yeah.

64
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,290
Scott: Let me look them up.

65
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:58,522
Rym: At least we agree Die Hard is the greatest Christmas movie ever made.

66
00:02:58,543 --> 00:02:59,650
Scott: And who does not agree with that?

67
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,622
Rym: And I think Tokyo Godfathers is up there.

68
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,671
Rym: Maybe number two three four.

69
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:04,214
Scott: Top five easily.

70
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,178
Rym: That's right it's up there.

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,363
Scott: There's a whole bunch of top fives.

72
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:09,753
Rym: So today I went skiing.

73
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:14,970
Scott: Okay there is a, hold on just to clarify before you go on your skiing, the one we like is the 1947 film.

74
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,821
Scott: There is a 1973 and a 1994 remake.

75
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:18,962
Scott: Why?

76
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:29,209
Scott: 1973 was a TV movie remake and the 1941 was a movie theater remake.

77
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:34,527
Rym: Alright Scott, which is better Miracle on 34th Street or The Nightmare Before Christmas?

78
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:37,656
Rym: As a Christmas movie.

79
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:48,951
Scott: As a, well then you had to say Miracle on 34th Street only because, only because, not to say that it's better than Nightmare Before Christmas, but because Nightmare Before Christmas is also a Halloween movie.

80
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:50,878
Scott: It is only half a Christmas movie.

81
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,370
Rym: Miracle on 34th Street or It's a Wonderful Life?

82
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,138
Scott: It's a Wonderful Life is way better.

83
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:55,440
Scott: Okay.

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,422
Scott: Not even close.

85
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:56,924
Rym: We agree.

86
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,268
Rym: It's a Wonderful Life or Die Hard?

87
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,435
Scott: It's Die Hard.

88
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:01,980
Rym: It's an affirmation, just making sure.

89
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,783
Rym: Unrelatedly, I think it was Porkfry tweeted, you know, talking about synchronicity.

90
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:10,366
Scott: You follow Porkfry?

91
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:11,492
Rym: I follow Porkfry.

92
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,670
Rym: Recently I thought, for whatever reason Twitter was like, "Hey, you should follow

93
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,334
Rym: Porkfry.".

94
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,399
Rym: I was like, "Oh, I kind of know that

95
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,741
Rym: guy.".

96
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,608
Scott: Does people listening know who the hell Porkfry is?

97
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,190
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:25,136
Rym: So I follow him now and he randomly was like, "Our tradition is to watch Die Hard every

99
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:25,638
Rym: Christmas.".

100
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,583
Scott: Why wouldn't it be?

101
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:33,096
Rym: But we were just talking about Die Hard and then after that there were two posts, two tweets, by two people who don't know each other.

102
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,050
Rym: They're not even the same spheres of the world.

103
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,417
Rym: They're just two people.

104
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:37,960
Rym: How could you tell?

105
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,112
Rym: Because they're two people I know independently.

106
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:41,272
Scott: Okay.

107
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:47,383
Rym: And they both tweeted within a few seconds of each other and they had the words "tamed" in their tweets.

108
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:53,205
Rym: One of them was talking about, I think, Satan and the other one was talking about a role-playing game.

109
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:54,069
Scott: Okay.

110
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:55,695
Rym: I don't know.

111
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,643
Rym: Die Hard, Krampus, taming.

112
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,990
Rym: I feel like there's something going on here.

113
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,660
Scott: What does taming have to do with Krampus or Die Hard?

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,843
Rym: It was a coincidence.

115
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:03,910
Scott: What do you mean?

116
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,720
Rym: I mean, there's been all the Krampus coincidences.

117
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:09,893
Scott: Die Hard and neither one of those have anything to do with taming.

118
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,202
Rym: But they all came up on Twitter recently.

119
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:14,189
Rym: My Twitter.

120
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:14,891
Scott: Okay, great.

121
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,356
Rym: Anyways, I was skiing today.

122
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:19,247
Rym: You know, we've talked about skiing a little bit before.

123
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,613
Rym: I'm an avid skier.

124
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,584
Rym: I'm not a professional skier.

125
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:24,489
Rym: I don't do it as a job.

126
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,313
Rym: I'm not ski patrol.

127
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,520
Scott: You're not a master either.

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,985
Rym: I'm not the best skier in the world.

129
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,412
Scott: You're not a master or a professional.

130
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:31,180
Rym: But I am a really good skier.

131
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,051
Rym: I'm a pretty good skier at this point.

132
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:43,917
Rym: And having skied at Hunter Mountain and on the East Coast a lot in the last few years in particular, one, what the fuck, dudes?

133
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,846
Rym: Why do you show up to the mountain at like noon?

134
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,191
Rym: It costs you the same.

135
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:53,029
Rym: You ski like twice and then you sit on your ass at the top of the mountain for the rest of the day.

136
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,380
Scott: You paid 70 bucks for that lift ticket.

137
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,265
Scott: Number one, why did they get there at noon?

138
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:58,229
Scott: They don't like to get up early.

139
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,935
Scott: Number two, why did they sit on...

140
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,789
Rym: I missed, you know, four and a half hours of skiing.

141
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,077
Scott: Why did they sit at the top of the mountain?

142
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:06,860
Scott: I have no fucking clue.

143
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,108
Scott: That would be like if you went up the waterslide stairs, you got to the top and they only let people go on the waterslide one at a time.

144
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,480
Scott: Imagine if everyone could go on the waterslide at once.

145
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,162
Rym: Dude, if I got...

146
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,534
Scott: Wouldn't you just go as soon as you got to the top immediately?

147
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:25,456
Rym: If we were little kids and there wasn't that dude there with that minor authority over us, we would all die.

148
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:26,760
Scott: Yeah, right?

149
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,294
Scott: So at skiing, you just get off and you can just go, right?

150
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,942
Scott: There's nothing stopping you from going immediately.

151
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:32,427
Scott: So why don't they go immediately?

152
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:40,953
Scott: And the only reason I can come up with is either A, they're crazy tired because they're weak or whatever, or B, they don't actually want to go.

153
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:45,551
Rym: So what I can see is that there's a lot of people... They're not excited to go.

154
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,500
Rym: I guess, and I realized the same thing when I was a kid.

155
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,105
Rym: I've kind of put it all together now.

156
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:55,186
Rym: When I was a little kid, me and my brother and my family were pretty hardcore about going to amusement parks.

157
00:06:55,206 --> 00:07:02,369
Rym: Like if we were there, our goal was to ride the most number of rollercoaster runs possible in the course of the day.

158
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,683
Rym: Because, you know, I paid like 70 whatever bucks to be there.

159
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,691
Rym: I'm going to be there the second that park opens.

160
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:15,028
Rym: And at 1159, before they shut off the line, I'm the last motherfucker in line.

161
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:19,145
Scott: We were not that hardcore, but we did show up as soon as it fucking opened in the morning.

162
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,515
Scott: We were there when the door gates were allowed in.

163
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,286
Scott: We went on as many things as we could in general.

164
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:29,387
Scott: Now, sometimes, you know, we didn't run, but you know, sometimes we'd only run for the first ride.

165
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:31,054
Rym: But like, you back it off a little bit.

166
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:31,837
Rym: You take some lunch.

167
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:37,018
Scott: Like, I remember going to Universal in the morning, right, where they sort of let people into the park slowly.

168
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,546
Scott: And basically, you can't go past this guy.

169
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,071
Scott: So the guy is there.

170
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,476
Rym: I've been there with that guy.

171
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,444
Scott: The guy is standing there when they open the gates.

172
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,333
Scott: You walk in, but you're not allowed past the guy.

173
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,363
Scott: And the guy slowly walks through the park.

174
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:50,674
Scott: And as he walks past a thing, that thing is now open.

175
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:51,920
Scott: And then you can go in that thing.

176
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,921
Scott: So of course, as soon as he passes like Back to the Future, which was the craziest popular thing at the time.

177
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:57,643
Scott: That was a good ride.

178
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:59,731
Scott: We'd just go right in.

179
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,320
Scott: But we weren't, like, running to go in every rollercoaster.

180
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:02,780
Rym: Yeah.

181
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:08,580
Rym: Well, you know, I'm not saying running hardcore, but when I was at the amusement park, I had a mission.

182
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,723
Scott: I had a goal.

183
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:10,265
Rym: There were missions.

184
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:11,993
Rym: I was there for fucking rollercoasters.

185
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,747
Scott: We did not, every ride and everything we wanted to do, we did.

186
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,393
Scott: We did not miss any things.

187
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:20,083
Scott: And we were doing things almost the entire time we were there.

188
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:26,146
Rym: So when I was older and I started going to Cedar Point and other amusement parks on my own, you know, with a car.

189
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,369
Scott: Same policy.

190
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,840
Scott: And even more hardcore because there's no family weighing you down.

191
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,522
Rym: No, are you kidding?

192
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,370
Rym: My family was possibly more hardcore than me.

193
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,433
Scott: So that was our thing.

194
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,135
Rym: It was our jam.

195
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,688
Rym: But, you know, I'd go with friends from, like, high school.

196
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,251
Rym: And the first time I went with a bunch of high school friends, we get in and I go to be fucking hardcore.

197
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:50,242
Rym: And one other guy with me is also ready to be fucking hardcore.

198
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,349
Rym: And everyone else is super slow.

199
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:55,360
Rym: And they're like, oh, let's get breakfast before we ride.

200
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,376
Scott: So you can vomit it up?

201
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:57,760
Scott: Pussy?

202
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,028
Rym: So I look at him and I was like, fuck you guys.

203
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,572
Rym: This was my Braveheart moment.

204
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:06,620
Rym: I was like, alright, listen up everybody.

205
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,545
Rym: Because we were like 15 of us there.

206
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:15,165
Rym: You guys who aren't here for serious business rollercoasters, you don't want to learn the fullness of it.

207
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:16,851
Rym: You don't care enough.

208
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,814
Rym: You're not hardcore.

209
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:19,360
Rym: You go do your bullshit.

210
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:21,666
Rym: But if you're a man, stand with me.

211
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:27,660
Rym: And like five or six of them came with me and we hardcored it all day.

212
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,968
Rym: We were literally the last people.

213
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,320
Rym: we, and I, cause I'd been going to see your point my whole life.

214
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,166
Rym: So I'd like timed it at the end.

215
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,073
Rym: Like we got food, like chicken fingers.

216
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,060
Rym: Like everyone had two baskets of chicken fingers.

217
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,080
Scott: They cost 20 bucks, but they only took one minute to eat.

218
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,744
Rym: And then, no, we got them.

219
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,329
Rym: And then we got in line.

220
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:48,140
Rym: We were the last people in line, in the longest line for the biggest rollercoaster at the end of the night.

221
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,579
Scott: That's right.

222
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,480
Rym: So we were in that line for another two hours, eating our chicken wings and just having an awesome time dance party.

223
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,840
Rym: We're the last motherfuckers on that rollercoaster other than like the staff.

224
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,832
Scott: He's letting everyone cut you.

225
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:07,935
Rym: And at the end of the night, the guy, everyone I was with kind of turned to me and they were like, "Rym, you're the god of Cedar

226
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:08,237
Rym: Point.".

227
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:09,500
Scott: Okay.

228
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,045
Rym: I was very proud of that moment.

229
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:11,909
Rym: It's the same thing.

230
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:14,640
Rym: These people, they're not hardcore about skiing.

231
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,899
Rym: You don't have to be hardcore about everything you do.

232
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Rym: But it's like they take all the trouble to travel all this way to be at a ski resort.

233
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,052
Scott: Maybe they live next door and they're just like,

234
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:24,354
Scott: "Whatever.".

235
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,410
Rym: A lot of them are from New York.

236
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,100
Rym: I could overhear their conversations.

237
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,660
Scott: The mountains in New York and almost everyone there is from New York.

238
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,360
Rym: New York City.

239
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:41,060
Rym: But it's that they're there to ski because they enjoy skiing, just like someone who's at an amusement park enjoys amusement parks.

240
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:45,100
Rym: Or just like someone who's playing Candyland likes Candyland.

241
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,005
Rym: But they're not, they're scrubs basically.

242
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:54,160
Rym: They're not interested in ever getting beyond, like they've achieved minimal basic proficiency at a thing.

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,760
Rym: Enjoy the thing to a degree, but have literally zero interest in moving at any point beyond that initial proficiency.

244
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:08,860
Rym: So they show up, they go to the top, they do the same blue square simple course every time.

245
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,560
Scott: And this is why Call of Duty is the big game and not Quake.

246
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,090
Rym: Yup.

247
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:13,517
Scott: Okay, let's move on.

248
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,060
Rym: So, it's gaming day.

249
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,458
Scott: Yeah, I don't really have any news, but I do want to talk about NS2.

250
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,218
Scott: Because during my little vacation here, because I have a lot of days off between, you know, pretty much every day off between Christmas and New Year's.

251
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,276
Scott: I'm not going back to work until after MagFest pretty much.

252
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,040
Scott: Maybe one day.

253
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:39,180
Scott: I've been playing a lot of NS2 when I'm not, you know, the rest of the day I spend doing anti-shit talk.

254
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,200
Scott: But during the times when I'm not anti-shit talking.

255
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,740
Rym: You know, we're kind of sliding into two separate courses right now because I've been doubling down on the Counter-Strike.

256
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,810
Scott: No, I'm doing NS2 big time.

257
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,400
Scott: And what I started doing is I have a new policy.

258
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,920
Scott: And the policy is games of NS2 get ruined a lot when no one gets in the comm chair right away.

259
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,160
Scott: So my new policy is I get in the game.

260
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:02,379
Scott: If no one gets in the comm chair of either team, whatever my team is, in five seconds, I get in.

261
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,097
Rym: It's not a bad policy because, you know, even if, you know, before...

262
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,949
Scott: And sometimes I'd be like, "Anyone doing it?

263
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:08,439
Scott: I guess I'm doing

264
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:08,499
Scott: it.".

265
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,680
Rym: Because if no one else will do it, no one has the right to complain if I fuck up.

266
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,648
Scott: As a result, I've done it a lot.

267
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,600
Scott: Which is kind of annoying because I don't want to do it a lot.

268
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,320
Scott: But it's just my policy to keep doing it.

269
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,540
Rym: Well, there's been a lot of nubs lately.

270
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,580
Scott: There are a lot of nubs because of the Steam sale.

271
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:23,920
Scott: But I've learned a lot of things commanding.

272
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:27,840
Scott: Number one, there's not too much micro like there is in Starcraft.

273
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,218
Scott: So I can actually fucking do it.

274
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:34,079
Scott: Two, because I know what the... Because I played NS for so long that I know what you should do.

275
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,680
Scott: Like in terms of strategy and build order and all that.

276
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,198
Scott: I'm not bad at it.

277
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:42,240
Scott: And three, because I beat the Starcraft 2 single player campaign on normal.

278
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,519
Scott: Even though I still could not beat anyone in Starcraft 2 who knows how to play it.

279
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:51,099
Scott: I got the skills of using those RTS keyboard shortcuts and such.

280
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,680
Scott: So I can actually build things quickly.

281
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,140
Scott: Now, here are some observations.

282
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,258
Scott: Observation number one.

283
00:12:57,061 --> 00:13:02,360
Scott: If your players ask for something, it is very likely that you are clicking on that thing at that exact moment, right?

284
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:02,878
Scott: As they talk.

285
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,399
Scott: I can't tell you how many times.

286
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,978
Scott: I wish I had a dollar for every time someone said, "Hey, can I have

287
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:08,340
Scott: spores?".

288
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:10,080
Scott: And I already had the thing open.

289
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,600
Scott: I was clicking on spores at that second.

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,129
Scott: Right?

291
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:14,517
Scott: "Hey, can we get armor

292
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:14,659
Scott: too?".

293
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,038
Scott: And it's like I'm clicking on the arms lab as I hear this guy saying, "Can he get armor

294
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:18,159
Scott: too?".

295
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,320
Rym: You must be psychic.

296
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,520
Scott: That happens all the... I think it's just because the players know when the thing should be ready in terms of how much res you have.

297
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,700
Scott: They can see how much res you have.

298
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,759
Scott: They know you have an arms lab.

299
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,300
Scott: They see they have armor one.

300
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,178
Scott: And it's like, yeah, I see the same thing they see.

301
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:35,800
Scott: So if they were coming, they would be clicking on armor two at the same time.

302
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,017
Scott: Right?

303
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,320
Scott: So it's like they're backseat coming, but we have the same mind because we have the same data.

304
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,560
Rym: The same hive mind.

305
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,760
Scott: Something else I've noticed, right, is people always be complaining about balance this and balance that.

306
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:50,220
Scott: Right.

307
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,278
Scott: You know, this is OP.

308
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:51,994
Scott: That's OP.

309
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,480
Scott: Here's what I notice.

310
00:13:54,141 --> 00:14:00,580
Scott: The only thing really that there are two things that determine who will win a game of NS2 as I see it right now.

311
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,860
Scott: Number one, is your com doing the job right?

312
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,000
Rym: A basic job, right?

313
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,010
Rym: Like if they build the right resource towers.

314
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,639
Scott: If the com fucks up, it doesn't matter what the players do.

315
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:13,558
Scott: You will lose.

316
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:13,747
Scott: Right.

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Scott: The com can lose the game for you, but the com cannot win the game.

318
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,760
Scott: There is nothing the com can do to just be like, boom, we're losing.

319
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,679
Scott: I'm bringing us back.

320
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,520
Scott: It's like, no, if you're losing, you're going to lose.

321
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,627
Scott: Right.

322
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,340
Scott: If the com is doing the job properly, he enables victory.

323
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:36,100
Scott: He may creates the possibility of winning or guarantees losing, assuming the other team hasn't also fucked up big time.

324
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:36,377
Scott: Right.

325
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:44,040
Rym: I got to admit, some of my favorite games of NS are where the two coms are both incompetent and the game is just turned into some really weird cluster.

326
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,319
Scott: That doesn't happen ever.

327
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:47,679
Scott: I haven't seen it happen all week.

328
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,640
Scott: But the com can enable victory by coming mostly properly.

329
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,558
Scott: If the com does the job mostly right, the victory is possible.

330
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,100
Scott: What makes the victory happen, what determines whether the win, assuming both coms do it and do it properly.

331
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,248
Scott: Right.

332
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,752
Scott: What determines who wins and loses is FPSing.

333
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,440
Scott: That's pretty much all that matters.

334
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:19,779
Scott: If the Marines go out and when they're building a res tower, if they kill all the skulks who come to bite it and then move on to the next tower and kill all the skulks who come to bite that one.

335
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:20,939
Scott: Guess what?

336
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,079
Scott: Now the commander has two more towers and probably a second com chair.

337
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:24,779
Rym: We need a stat for this.

338
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,760
Rym: It has to be something like what's the ratio?

339
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,680
Rym: Like how many skulks can one of your Marines take out on his own?

340
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,080
Scott: If, you know.

341
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,799
Rym: Like if it's one to three, like if one Marine can take out three simultaneous skulks, that alien thing is done.

342
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,356
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,380
Scott: If a Marine goes out and he's building a res tower and he gets bitten and then the second wave of Marines go and barely rescue that RT.

344
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:46,619
Scott: Well, guess what?

345
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,720
Scott: You know, you think, oh, it's just one RT delayed you by one spawn wave, whatever.

346
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,120
Scott: No, it means the aliens now have their infestation in that tech point.

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:05,080
Scott: That's right behind that first RT, because most of the maps go, you know, RT, you know, hive tech point, RT, RT, hive tech point, RT.

348
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:05,517
Scott: Right.

349
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:11,940
Scott: So by failing at that first RT next to your base, which is where the skulks will be, because the skulks don't have to fucking build anything.

350
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:12,093
Scott: Right.

351
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,338
Scott: They're running straight for that shit.

352
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:19,960
Scott: You know, you're losing that position after it by not pushing hard enough out there.

353
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:23,380
Scott: And now you're set back and all that had nothing to do with the commander.

354
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,019
Scott: All he did was press S and build the RT for you.

355
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:26,520
Scott: Right.

356
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
Scott: It's because you couldn't kill the skulks.

357
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,038
Scott: You got bit.

358
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:32,240
Rym: I'll admit I've been in situations where, you know, I've just failed.

359
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,360
Rym: And you hear the commander be like, no, guys, stop dying.

360
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:35,806
Scott: Right.

361
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,900
Scott: Now, here's the thing that I didn't so much realize.

362
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,000
Scott: And this is the final point.

363
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:40,300
Scott: Right.

364
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:45,759
Scott: Is being the commander of the team that loses, which I have done somewhat often.

365
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:52,260
Scott: I've also been commander of quite a few teams that just dominate so hard that we're pretty much all over.

366
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,360
Scott: We just take over the whole map almost immediately, which is almost also equally less fun.

367
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:01,120
Scott: But being the commander of the losing team is like being angry Hitler.

368
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:06,656
Scott: It's just like, you know, send in the troops from the.

369
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:07,339
Scott: oh, they're dead.

370
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,079
Scott: Well, guys, push, push east.

371
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,938
Scott: God damn it.

372
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,900
Scott: Well, this is like, what the fuck, guys?

373
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,396
Scott: Stop going.

374
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,407
Rym: I've I've built the last four shotguns that got.

375
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,333
Scott: all the guys here are dead every cycle.

376
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,420
Scott: Just like it's just being angry.

377
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,519
Scott: There's nothing you can do.

378
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,220
Scott: There's no buttons you can press in that command interface to suddenly make your team be able to fucking aim or bite or whatever they need to do.

379
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,140
Rym: I think at that point, all you can do is admonish your own players for their failure.

380
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,275
Scott: That's pretty much what you do.

381
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:43,960
Scott: But yeah, oh, the all the other thing that's really bad is if your players don't listen, I just quit the server.

382
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,118
Scott: I've had like two games where the guys were just like assholes.

383
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,599
Scott: Really?

384
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,499
Scott: They were just trolling on whatever server it was.

385
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,020
Scott: And they just kept pushing the other way.

386
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:54,980
Scott: And I was like, guys, we would.

387
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,439
Scott: We had three reds to the left.

388
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:01,299
Scott: We lost all of them because you guys kept going to the right, even though I said, use the phase gate.

389
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,400
Scott: The only one guy built that phase gate.

390
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,399
Scott: He built all that stuff on the left side of the map.

391
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:06,720
Scott: And then he died.

392
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,478
Scott: He was one guy.

393
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:08,199
Scott: He was awesome.

394
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,600
Scott: And then we lost all that stuff on the left side of the map.

395
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,360
Scott: And all you guys kept going right, even though I repeatedly said, go left, go left.

396
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,500
Scott: And you said, fuck you, commander.

397
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,560
Scott: We want to go right to where the alien hive is right there.

398
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,400
Scott: And there's a pile of skulls biting you when you're getting killed constantly.

399
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,518
Scott: He could have taken the left side.

400
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:25,998
Scott: They didn't want to.

401
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:27,500
Rym: So I wonder, I just quit.

402
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,980
Rym: I wonder what will drive that kind of trolling behavior.

403
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,220
Scott: It's pretty rare.

404
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,060
Scott: It only happened twice in multiple days.

405
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,498
Rym: But I never, I never remembered it happening in NS1.

406
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,440
Rym: So I wonder.

407
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:37,335
Scott: It was rare.

408
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,920
Rym: I wonder if there's a slightly different mechanism design going on.

409
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,412
Scott: Well, in the one game, I think it was one guy on the team was a bad egg and he was enabling and encouraging.

410
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,900
Rym: He was egging him on.

411
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,419
Scott: He was encouraging the bad behavior by the other players.

412
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,100
Rym: He evolved into an asshole.

413
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,540
Scott: He was like, fuck you, commander.

414
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,479
Scott: We're going right.

415
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:57,804
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,767
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:18:59,466 --> 00:18:59,879
Scott: All right.

418
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,387
Rym: So on the other side of that coin, you know, I'd set up our GeekNights, counter-strike server.

419
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,999
Rym: You guys haven't been using it too much.

420
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,398
Scott: I haven't been using it at all.

421
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,080
Rym: So get your shit together.

422
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,059
Rym: If you guys want me to keep paying for it, because I might just shut it down because I have a clan server that I play on.

423
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,149
Scott: I predicted this would not, you would not get enough

424
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:34,020
Rym: players so cheap, but basically I've learned a lot one by playing on the, you know, playing a lot of games with really good clanny people in counter-strike go and I've got, I've become a much better counter-strike player as a result.

425
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Scott: My counter-strike has probably gone downhill.

426
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:36,639
Rym: My ass has gone way down.

427
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,240
Rym: So we're, we're on equal sides of the same sinking boat at this point.

428
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,620
Rym: But that stuff aside, running a server, I've realized now why it's such a pain in the ass and why so many people use these services and don't just run it themselves.

429
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,339
Rym: You can just run it yourself.

430
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,420
Rym: Ninety percent of the actual configuration and functionality is undocumented.

431
00:19:58,014 --> 00:19:58,260
Scott: Oh yeah.

432
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,838
Rym: It is documented solely in bullshit, mostly not correct forum posts and crappy way out of date wikis.

433
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,440
Scott: Way out of date wikis is right.

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,231
Rym: The other part of that wiki is that sure you could figure it all out, but actually stuff changes a lot, especially now with counter-strike.

435
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:22,613
Rym: go, like they'll just change something in the master config and then your server breaks and there's no way to figure out how to fix it.

436
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:28,420
Rym: And I've been wrestling with that a lot and it's a giant pain in the ass and I know why this is the case.

437
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,220
Rym: It's pretty simple.

438
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:36,799
Rym: There's some hardcore motherfuckers who are willing to do all the work to make their own counter-strike servers stay up.

439
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,460
Scott: And there's a bunch of official ones, right?

440
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:39,560
Rym: I don't know.

441
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,660
Rym: I don't plan any official ones cause they, okay, I actually don't use any of the official matchmaking or anything anymore.

442
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,440
Rym: I just go on the two clan servers and my own server cause I know they're good.

443
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,398
Rym: I know there's good people there.

444
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:50,559
Scott: What if they're full?

445
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,338
Rym: If they're full, I don't play.

446
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,960
Rym: My server's never full.

447
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,577
Rym: That's true.

448
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,357
Scott: Sometimes it's paying for it.

449
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:57,739
Rym: Cause it's so cheap.

450
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:06,380
Rym: But those people will keep those servers going and spend a ridiculous amount of time in their lives making them work and making them work well.

451
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,139
Scott: They got a clan.

452
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:08,759
Scott: That's serious business for them.

453
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Rym: And valve wants the latitude to change things whenever they want.

454
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:17,920
Rym: If they actually maintain documentation as to how the server really works.

455
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,360
Rym: And I know how this kind of product works cause I manage several similar products.

456
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,020
Scott: No one likes updating documentation.

457
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:25,387
Rym: No.

458
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:28,180
Rym: I'm pretty sure there isn't documentation.

459
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,319
Rym: The documentation is the code and probably some text files related to the code and the.

460
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:39,440
Rym: the comments in the config file and the config files are pretty much self documenting.

461
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:48,300
Rym: If you understand what's going on on the undocumented backend, if you understand quake one language console commands, it'll slowly crystallize.

462
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,740
Rym: I'm pretty sure because they're, you know, right now, like for example, here's something.

463
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:53,779
Scott: say they add a new map.

464
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:58,569
Rym: Well, there's this complicated, it's not going to go into your map rotation automatically, right?

465
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,660
Scott: Cause that's a text file.

466
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,240
Rym: No, it'll make your server not work anymore.

467
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,639
Scott: Why wouldn't it?

468
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,162
Scott: It's just, it.

469
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:10,699
Scott: just, you, all you did was add a, if there's a new map and you run the steam updater, all it should do is put a new BSP file in the map folder.

470
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,708
Rym: So there's a complicated structure.

471
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:18,459
Rym: now where there's, there's master config files that you should never edit, but you can edit them and you shouldn't.

472
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:28,600
Rym: Now the way you make changes is you make a, like that same file, like underscore server, and you just override things in that file.

473
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,000
Scott: I know that pattern.

474
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:37,527
Rym: So like that is a good pattern, but they have this other within the main config, they have this meta structure for map groups.

475
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:41,400
Rym: that is way, way, way over complicated.

476
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,539
Scott: It's not just BSP files.

477
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:42,884
Rym: No.

478
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:51,880
Rym: So all these different variables have to be set for different maps and you set a map group, a map group consists of a type and then a number of maps within that type.

479
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,620
Rym: But a map group can also consist of other map groups.

480
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,960
Scott: Oh, this is how it, so this is how it separates, say demolition from CS, from FY.

481
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:07,580
Rym: Or classic from all maps or offline with bots from these maps don't support bots.

482
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,880
Rym: And it's a tree that seems to loop back upon itself a couple of times.

483
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,460
Scott: It sounds pretty much just like a digraph.

484
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,819
Rym: And it changes pretty often.

485
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:24,239
Rym: And the problem with it is that if there is any structural problem at all, like something the whole server won't work.

486
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,480
Rym: Yeah.

487
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,760
Rym: The whole service won't work in really difficult to diagnose ways.

488
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,340
Scott: Like the log file, there's no standard error output for the server.

489
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,560
Rym: I don't really have easy access to that because the kind of hosting I use.

490
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,258
Scott: The hosting thing, but isn't that what you're paying them for to take care of that bullshit for you?

491
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,360
Rym: So they do eventually fix that stuff, but they're really slow at it.

492
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:46,220
Scott: They don't do it immediately as soon as things up.

493
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,120
Rym: So pretty much any time the Counter-Strike servers down, it's probably because there's an update that hasn't been pushed to my server yet.

494
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,559
Rym: You got to wait like three or four days.

495
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:55,240
Scott: That three, four days downtime.

496
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:55,760
Rym: Yeah.

497
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,120
Scott: Do you have to pay for those three, four days?

498
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:57,269
Rym: Yeah.

499
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,440
Scott: I would fucking complain.

500
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,740
Scott: I'd be like, hey, you guys didn't, I pay for this.

501
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,260
Scott: You know what?

502
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,220
Scott: You didn't get my server.

503
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,680
Scott: My server was down for three, four days.

504
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,198
Scott: Fuck you.

505
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:04,395
Rym: No.

506
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,100
Rym: Cause I could fix it myself by getting the files manually and pushing them via FTP.

507
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,760
Scott: And what am I paying for?

508
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,200
Scott: Or if I know how to do that, then I don't need to pay for your hosting.

509
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,478
Scott: I'll just use someone else.

510
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,700
Scott: I'll just use regular, you know, Linux virtual host.

511
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,478
Rym: No, because the Linux virtual hosting is more of a pain in the ass.

512
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:21,339
Scott: Even more of a pain.

513
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,099
Rym: Because in the very least, these guys, if I just use their default shit, it'll work most of the time.

514
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,860
Scott: I've gotten Counter-Strike servers just running most of the time.

515
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,190
Scott: Yeah.

516
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,840
Scott: You know, just the Linux machine.

517
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,339
Rym: Try getting Counter-Strike go to continue to run with updates.

518
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,820
Scott: Uh, you had to just restart it whenever there's updates.

519
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,093
Scott: Nope.

520
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,698
Rym: You have to restart it and pull down the new master config files and probably change some bullshit.

521
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Scott: When I run servers though, the thing I love, I always keep default everything.

522
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,639
Scott: I don't change anything at all.

523
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,919
Scott: I don't put any weird mods or anything like that.

524
00:24:50,760 --> 00:25:00,140
Scott: So what I would just do is if that was really a problem, if restarting the server didn't fix it with his updates, I would just delete the whole server and reinstall it with like a little script every single time so that it would be completely fresh.

525
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,236
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:08,299
Rym: But then you, like the whole reason we have our server and like the good clan servers and everything is they'll do basic stuff like remove dust too from the rotation.

527
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,196
Rym: cause fuck that map.

528
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,000
Rym: I'm sick of it.

529
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:22,719
Rym: I like, yeah, but I mean, or more importantly, for example, leave friendly fire on, but like what my server, what I did is one line in a text file, I cut the number of lines down of those numbered lines.

530
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:26,720
Rym: I cut the number of, uh, rounds in a match in half.

531
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:35,997
Rym: So you have a faster rotation and I changed and I changed all these sort of timer things like buy time and all these things and set the map for default ones.

532
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,131
Rym: Uh, then a competitive match takes a couple hours.

533
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:43,939
Rym: sometimes it can take up to 90 minutes.

534
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,757
Scott: I've had some NSS go 90 minutes, but most of them take 20, 30 minutes.

535
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:57,600
Rym: But counter strike, you start to lose players and I'd read for our players and our demographic, I'd rather have 15 rounds and then switch to a new map with a winner.

536
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,099
Rym: One team won.

537
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:05,520
Rym: It encourages much more goal-based play, but so I want some aspects of casual and some aspects of competitive.

538
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,197
Rym: And then there's the bot configs.

539
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,579
Rym: So I basically have to merge the casual and competitive together into my own thing.

540
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,120
Rym: Anyway, the reason it's a pain in the ass is because it's undocumented.

541
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,759
Rym: It'll probably never be documented because there's no reason to document it.

542
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:22,140
Rym: It'll stop people like me from almost complaining.

543
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:23,074
Scott: Let's move on.

544
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,930
Rym: So things of the day, I had a thing of the day.

545
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:36,869
Rym: I know none of you assholes had seen it because it was relatively obscure.

546
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,870
Scott: I got two things of the day so I can cover for you.

547
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,810
Rym: Well this thing.

548
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,070
Scott: I don't want, I would normally save one, but they're both Christmas.

549
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:43,889
Rym: Oh, okay.

550
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,089
Rym: Mine is not Christmas at all.

551
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:56,170
Rym: So, you know, the Hoppit movie came out and there's the scene where they're getting, where the elf is like, Oh, this is Glandring, the Foe Hammer, and this is Orchrest, the Goblin Sleigh Cleaver and all that stuff.

552
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,690
Scott: I never, see that was one thing I forgot to mention, right?

553
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:06,510
Scott: Orchrest is a really fucking LV sword, which makes sense cause it's an LV sword, you know, but it's like, I never thought of it as an LV sword.

554
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:15,670
Scott: So seeing it and seeing it as the style of LV sword from Lord of the Rings, it was like, Oh, that's an interesting choice to make it that style of sword.

555
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,886
Scott: When for example, Narsil is, you know, the other kind, even though it was also made by elves.

556
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:20,186
Rym: Yup.

557
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,930
Rym: Well Glandring, the Foe Hammer.

558
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,307
Rym: So I found this video just randomly and it only had like 11 or 12 views.

559
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:28,649
Scott: Okay.

560
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:36,990
Rym: And basically it was that scene from the Hobbit where he's describing the names of the things and he's like, and you know how we kind of unsheathed Glandring and then she's it again.

561
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:47,930
Rym: So you know that mashup style where someone will just take a thing and cut to other people reacting like, or a Porky or not Porky, Porkins screaming forever before he dies.

562
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:51,290
Rym: So they did that with that scene.

563
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:59,330
Rym: So it was like, and this is Glandring, the Foe Hammer, Foe Hammer, Foe Hammer, Foe Hammer, and it cut around.

564
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,789
Rym: It was really well done in terms of the cuts and everything.

565
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,930
Rym: So this goes on for like two minutes and I'm kind of, I'm giggling a little bit.

566
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,490
Rym: Emily's like, this isn't that funny and she's not laughing.

567
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:10,150
Rym: Then the very end, he stopped.

568
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:16,468
Rym: He's like, Foe Hammer, ah, and Orcrist, the Foe Hammer, and then it ends up there.

569
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:19,529
Rym: And Emily even laughed there.

570
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,828
Scott: Orcrist is not the Foe Hammer.

571
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,569
Rym: It was so well done.

572
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,608
Scott: So here's two things.

573
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,370
Rym: It's gone.

574
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,470
Rym: It got takedowned and it's gone.

575
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,506
Rym: I can't find it.

576
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:31,070
Rym: So instead I link to you the original Glandring, the Foe Hammer.

577
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:31,687
Scott: Okay.

578
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,110
Scott: So here we go.

579
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,808
Scott: This one's really quick.

580
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:37,418
Scott: You know, the Chipmunks Christmas song, you know, where they're like, he wants a hula hoop.

581
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,889
Rym: I think we already did this as a thing of the day years ago.

582
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,241
Scott: Did we?

583
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:40,637
Rym: Yeah.

584
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:41,570
Scott: You can do it anyway.

585
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,271
Scott: This was posted on, oh yeah, uploaded in 2008.

586
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:46,570
Scott: But anyway, someone slowed it.

587
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,030
Rym: This was definitely a thing of the day.

588
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:48,370
Scott: Okay.

589
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,621
Scott: Well then it's a fall callback thing of the day.

590
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:52,495
Scott: then because it came up again and I forgot it.

591
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,309
Scott: They freaking slowed it down.

592
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:04,629
Scott: So all the other parts sound like they're slowed down, but all the sped up, you know, but the other chipmunk parts sound like normal, like a barbershop guys singing chipmunks on.

593
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,381
Scott: I've heard this also totally.

594
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:07,750
Scott: look at this fake album cover.

595
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:08,730
Scott: Look at Simon.

596
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,290
Rym: He's oh my God.

597
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:10,989
Rym: It's Simon.

598
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:11,610
Rym: He's just.

599
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:12,438
Scott: All right.

600
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,609
Scott: So anyway, here's my real thing of the day.

601
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:15,767
Scott: That's not a redo.

602
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,448
Scott: All right.

603
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,350
Scott: This is a Gary Gygax.

604
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,269
Scott: You know, Gary Gygax is better creator of D and D. He would get Christmas cards from friends.

605
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,930
Scott: Everyone who sent him a Christmas card, got this note in reply.

606
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,310
Scott: And this note is interesting for several reasons.

607
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,465
Scott: Reason number one, because you know, D and D was sort of hated as being satanic for a long time.

608
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,086
Scott: But Gary Gygax is way Christian, right?

609
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,030
Scott: And number two, he was also way rules lawyer.

610
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:46,206
Scott: Let me read to you.

611
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:47,910
Scott: I'm going to read the whole thing.

612
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,489
Rym: I'm unfamiliar with this thing.

613
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,010
Scott: Gary Gygax would send this note to anyone who sent him a Christmas card.

614
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:56,090
Scott: I'm going to read the whole thing, even though it takes a little while.

615
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:56,943
Scott: It's worth it.

616
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:00,570
Scott: Gary Gygax thanks all his friends who sent Christmas cards.

617
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:12,990
Scott: Being a Christian, he does not celebrate this holiday because colon one, the Bible does not command Christians to keep a festival on the birthday of Jesus Christ.

618
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,590
Rym: How is one of those Galatians for colon nine through eleven?

619
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:17,504
Scott: And what's C.O.L?

620
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:19,485
Rym: I don't know.

621
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,170
Scott: C.O.L, whatever C.O.L is, two, sixteen and seventeen.

622
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,990
Scott: Two, the Bible does command that the followers of Jesus refrain from having anything to do with pagan religious celebrations.

623
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,230
Scott: First Corinthians ten, fourteen, Acts fifteen, twenty, second Corinthians six, fourteen.

624
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:42,050
Scott: Three, Jesus was not born in December, but sometime in the autumn.

625
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,930
Scott: Check your religious or secular encyclopedia in parentheses.

626
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:57,410
Scott: For the, quote, Holy Day, Christmas was not celebrated by early Christians, parentheses, check sources indicated in three above five.

627
00:30:57,891 --> 00:31:04,910
Scott: Numerous pagan rites have historically been held at this time of the winter solstice, the best known being the pre-Christian Saturnalia of the Romans.

628
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:16,889
Scott: And Christmas is simply an agglomeration of various pagan religious observances sprinkled with a pinch of Christianity to scrot to disguise its true flavor and certainly does not honor either God nor his son.

629
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:24,670
Scott: For detailed information on any particular aspect of the above, contact Gary at three thirty Center Street, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, five three one four seven.

630
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:31,769
Scott: So there you go, rules lawyering and Christianity from the creator of D&D.

631
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:33,050
Rym: Not bad.

632
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,526
Scott: Take that.

633
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:38,730
Scott: And don't send me Christmas cards either, but not for those reasons, because I hate cardboard.

634
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:40,330
Scott: It's like waste of cardboard.

635
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:40,750
Scott: Come on.

636
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,628
Scott: You got something better than that.

637
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:43,270
Scott: Maybe send a digital one.

638
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,928
Scott: I'll be less upset.

639
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:48,530
Rym: So in the meta moment, there might not be gig nights for a few weeks after this.

640
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:49,168
Scott: Oh boy.

641
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,087
Scott: Why would that be?

642
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:56,057
Rym: Well, we've got our annual New Year's celebration extravaganza that we run in my apartment every year.

643
00:31:56,492 --> 00:31:56,690
Scott: Awesome.

644
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,930
Rym: Then we were going immediately to Magfest.

645
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,789
Scott: Double awesome.

646
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:03,350
Rym: And then I might be flying directly from Magfest to Istanbul.

647
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:05,030
Scott: Would be more awesome if I was going.

648
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:06,080
Rym: You could just go.

649
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:06,729
Rym: take time off.

650
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,390
Scott: I don't have money.

651
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,010
Scott: I'm already taking time off from Magfest.

652
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,109
Rym: Take more time off.

653
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,049
Scott: Don't have more time off.

654
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:11,750
Scott: Go to Australia.

655
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:12,529
Rym: Not that expensive.

656
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:13,150
Rym: All right.

657
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,330
Rym: We got a ride.

658
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,130
Rym: We're going to PAX Australia.

659
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:16,850
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,530
Scott: Let's not do the far future meta moments.

661
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,030
Scott: Let's concentrate on the Magfest because this is the last pre Magfest episode.

662
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,770
Rym: All our shit is on Friday, dog.

663
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,029
Rym: The schedule is up.

664
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,970
Rym: Magfest is happening Friday morning.

665
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:39,029
Rym: We are doing the ethics of video games, video game genres and our own lecture beyond Candyland, which we've rewritten.

666
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,290
Scott: Then we're going to play a fuck ton of games.

667
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:42,050
Rym: Oh my God.

668
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:43,370
Scott: I'm playing so many games.

669
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,750
Scott: Of the arcade and table varieties.

670
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,150
Rym: I'm so excited about Magfest.

671
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,365
Rym: It is my second favorite convention.

672
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:51,209
Rym: that is not PAX.

673
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,023
Scott: What's better than Magfest?

674
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:54,770
Scott: that's not a PAX.

675
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:56,789
Rym: I had to leave wiggle room in there just in case.

676
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:57,870
Rym: Okay.

677
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:03,545
Scott: It is my, the convention where I have the most fun times.

678
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,770
Scott: that is not a PAX.

679
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:07,950
Rym: It's also a different vibe from PAX.

680
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:21,610
Rym: Much more chill in terms of 24/7, four days gaming in that there is awesome content, but I pretty much just want to dick around and play games with my friends and random strangers and at PAX.

681
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,748
Rym: The other bullshit that's going on is so great that anything I'm doing at PAX, you

682
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:31,123
Scott: got to spend like an hour or two at a PAX, go to the expo hall of missing some other packs

683
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,896
Rym: thing at any packs thing I'm doing, but at Magfest, I don't feel like I'm missing anything because it's so long.

684
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:41,870
Rym: granted PAX Prime is going to be four days.

685
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,970
Scott: So yeah, I think there is actually going to be a counter-strike tournament at Magfest.

686
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:49,548
Rym: You better bone up.

687
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:54,190
Rym: No, I'm not going to play in the counter-strike tournament, but I am going to play counter-strike is playing counter-strike.

688
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,429
Scott: You need to bring your own PC for that.

689
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:55,767
Scott: Don't you?

690
00:33:56,611 --> 00:34:02,010
Rym: Uh, maybe I don't remember if they had open PCs or not saying I played a bunch of counter-strike at PAX though.

691
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,930
Scott: That was some awesome counter-strike at PAX.

692
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,290
Scott: Something about LAN parties.

693
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:15,989
Scott: Why at PAX, you know, was I able to buy the, the, you know, the, what are the fricking awesome machine gun, the Nova, and just hose everyone down on Italy, just like literally hosing them down in the marketplace.

694
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:23,929
Scott: But when I go online, if I bring the machine gun and bring it to the marketplace, it just get one headshotted because, and that's what makes me think this cheating.

695
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:24,870
Scott: But I can't tell.

696
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,428
Rym: I think it's just that we were drawing from a smaller, I mean, there aren't big fish, small pond.

697
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:34,530
Rym: The counter-strike players in the world are not that many compared to say other things in the world.

698
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:43,204
Scott: Medium fish in the guppy pond at PAX, but medium fish in the shark pond and the internet in the transient pond from like 11 AM to 1 PM on Friday.

699
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,188
Scott: Whereas if I go on the internet, I'm the medium fish in the shark pond.

700
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,310
Rym: Yeah.

701
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:50,569
Rym: So yeah.

702
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,648
Rym: Magfest be there.

703
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,010
Rym: Kinetic con panels.

704
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,830
Rym: Admissions are open.

705
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,989
Rym: We'll be scheduling things starting at the end of January.

706
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,389
Rym: So submit soon, the sooner you submit, the more likely I'll read your submission.

707
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,889
Rym: book club is the great Gatsby.

708
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:11,084
Scott: And you should visit us on the internets cause you're not going to get any content from us in the podcast between now and January sometime.

709
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,869
Rym: We've recorded ahead.

710
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:21,090
Rym: We might record a little bit more video off and on, but we're not going to speed up the video production unless you guys get more views on those YouTube videos.

711
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:32,930
Scott: So there's not going to be any new podcasts, but there may be videos, newsletters, and other sorts of things that you might enjoy, but you're not going to notice those things unless you follow us and go to our website and go to YouTube channels and go those places.

712
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,610
Rym: And that said hotline Miami.

713
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,408
Rym: All right.

714
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,050
Rym: So I've enjoyed the shit out of this game.

715
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:42,670
Scott: So this game, people were talking it up, right?

716
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:43,870
Scott: And it was big steam sale.

717
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:44,589
Scott: I never heard of it.

718
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,649
Scott: Just sort of came out of nowhere on the steam sale for me.

719
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:47,669
Scott: Not the new steam.

720
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:55,910
Rym: So the previous team, I heard buzz about it, but not from like the usual sources of buzz, but like people I knew would tweet like something, something hotline.

721
00:35:56,471 --> 00:36:00,090
Scott: I saw some tweets and then I also saw some forum posts.

722
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:06,890
Scott: So I picked it up for way cheap and I, you know, but it was then after I did that, I found out it was mad crash.

723
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,007
Scott: No, I think I found it was mad, crashy and buggy before I got it.

724
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:13,390
Scott: And then I was like, well, I'm going to bite the bullet for everyone else.

725
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:14,289
Scott: So I got it.

726
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,590
Scott: And of course it was mad, crashy and didn't work.

727
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,969
Scott: So I told everyone, fuck this shit.

728
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:18,748
Rym: It doesn't work.

729
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,083
Rym: Fuck.

730
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:24,930
Scott: And then they got their shit together and a week later they patched it a whole bunch and I noticed it kept getting updated on steam.

731
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:31,149
Scott: So then I played it and I played it on my HTPC because it felt like an HTPC robotron kind of game.

732
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:38,330
Scott: And now I'm not so sure if it, if I should play with the gamepad or the mouse and keyboard, it's like either way I got some keyboard.

733
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,189
Rym: I tried with both.

734
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:44,370
Rym: I think the game is better with mouse and keyboard because it's not perfect either way.

735
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:44,809
Scott: No.

736
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:58,970
Rym: Well, the thing is with mouse and keyboard, I feels like the game was designed with that in mind because it could be the fact that there's a crosshair gives you a ridiculous degree of precision when it comes to using projectile weapons and planning things out.

737
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:07,343
Rym: And I, I feel like I was much better at the game with the mouse and keyboard, despite the somewhat janky implementation of WASD.

738
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:09,950
Rym: and when I tried with the gamepad, I just couldn't fucking kill anybody.

739
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,990
Scott: I was slightly better, but for example, with the mouse and keyboard, there's some things I can do better.

740
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:22,369
Scott: For example, I'm in a room and you know, there's a guy coming at me, I needed to quickly aim at different guys, much easier with the mouse, right?

741
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:29,307
Scott: But the gamepad actually allows you to lock onto a guy like, like Zelda, like lock on Metroid locker.

742
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:31,649
Rym: So lock arms though.

743
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,669
Scott: Well, no, but what this lets you do is, for example, there's a room and there's one guy in it for it, right?

744
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:38,369
Scott: And he's just sitting on the couch.

745
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:43,847
Scott: I lock onto him before I go in the room, then I just opened a door and like throw a baseball bat at him.

746
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,810
Rym: But see, I immediately that's like, that's like aimbot, right?

747
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,104
Scott: It is.

748
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:49,970
Scott: So I can't, it's part of the game though.

749
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,229
Scott: So you can't possibly miss while doing that.

750
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,890
Scott: So certain situations you can exit you more efficiently.

751
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:04,725
Rym: So if there was some way to switch between the two controllers, you say it's part of It is, but it is in the sense that lock on is like the go to number one.

752
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,746
Rym: first gimpy thing you do.

753
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,150
Rym: If you take a game that was designed for mouse and keyboard and port it to a gamepad.

754
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,750
Scott: But this is, you actually have to press a button to lock on.

755
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,989
Scott: It's not just like an auto aim.

756
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,366
Rym: Oh yeah.

757
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,590
Rym: Most games have the button press for auto lock on at the same time.

758
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:19,870
Rym: I feel, I don't know.

759
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,746
Rym: I feel like the game flows better when you don't have that because then it's much more frantic.

760
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:25,374
Scott: Yeah.

761
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:26,969
Scott: It's frantic no matter what.

762
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:27,887
Scott: So let's let's let.

763
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,710
Scott: So what the game is, there's a weird sort of theme to the game and I can talk about that, right?

764
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,808
Rym: I like the theme.

765
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:34,447
Scott: I'll say that.

766
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:41,430
Scott: But it basically what it is, you're this dude and you go into a level and you have to kill everybody without dying and you die in one hit.

767
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:41,948
Scott: Pretty much.

768
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,569
Rym: If anything, super meat boy thing of if you die, just try again, try again, try again in infinity times.

769
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:50,550
Scott: And it's a robotron game, direct top down view.

770
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:59,685
Scott: And you walk around with one, you know, and then you move, you aim with the other in any of the directions and you know, you can pick up any weapon that anyone drops normally have fists.

771
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:01,750
Scott: And if you hit a guy with fists, he doesn't die.

772
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,449
Scott: You have to actually get on and sort of bash his head in.

773
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:04,969
Scott: Right.

774
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:08,010
Scott: And then you take people's weapons and you can use the weapons.

775
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,449
Scott: If hit someone with a weapon, they die.

776
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:17,430
Scott: But if you shoot a gun, right, that's obviously the most efficient way to kill a lot of guys, but it makes noise, which attracts more guys to come out of the woodwork.

777
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,469
Scott: Normally, it's a hero quest where they won't go through doors and they'll just sort of follow patterns.

778
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:26,070
Scott: So you can you know, each level is sort of like a puzzle you have to solve.

779
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,450
Scott: Which guy do I kill first?

780
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,510
Scott: Which room do I go in?

781
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,310
Scott: I need to kill a guy first to get a weapon.

782
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,390
Scott: Then I can kill these guys quietly.

783
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:36,448
Scott: But then there's so many guys in that room, I'm going to have to use an assault rifle, which will wake up these guys.

784
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:46,490
Scott: And you plan out each level through trial and error and, you know, walking around to eventually figure out the way to kill all the guys without getting killed.

785
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,630
Scott: And then you need to execute it because it is fast, but it is really fast.

786
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:58,170
Rym: Now, what's very important here is the very minimalist top down 2D game, but the aesthetic and the music drive.

787
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,169
Scott: The music is really good.

788
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:14,290
Rym: The music is so pumping and so rhythmic and it just and the style and the aesthetic, it feels like it's almost one of those like it's a deconstruction of an ultra violent, like late 90s sort of film noir throwback action movie.

789
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:15,190
Scott: Yeah.

790
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:15,933
Scott: It's what it's.

791
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,970
Scott: it's pretty psychedelic in its styling.

792
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,240
Scott: It's like one of those weird, trippy, cry movies.

793
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,990
Scott: where, you know, what was that one?

794
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,648
Scott: where we didn't watch the beginning part of it?

795
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:28,650
Scott: Oh, I don't remember.

796
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,970
Scott: On the DVD we skipped the part with Keanu Reeves sitting on the bench.

797
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,170
Rym: What was that movie called?

798
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,729
Scott: It's sort of like that a little bit, but maybe a little more neon.

799
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:40,590
Scott: A little more criminal.

800
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:53,290
Rym: The music pumping the way it basically drives you to get this sort of like flow in the game where it's like kick the door, throw the bat at the dude while you're waiting to punch the dog that you know is going to come around the corner.

801
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,290
Rym: You can't punch dogs.

802
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,101
Rym: Oh, yeah, you can't.

803
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:57,769
Rym: I think you can if you take the punching mask.

804
00:40:58,418 --> 00:40:58,870
Scott: Oh, maybe.

805
00:40:59,211 --> 00:40:59,490
Rym: I don't know.

806
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,950
Rym: I only ever wore Don Juan, the horse mask.

807
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,729
Scott: The horse mask, I think, is my favorite mask.

808
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:07,042
Rym: The horse mask basically meant a lot of times.

809
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:13,470
Rym: what I would do in a map if I was having trouble is I go get a gun, I'd back up near a door and fire that gun once.

810
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,290
Rym: And I'd stand just so on the door and the door just became a murder machine.

811
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:17,708
Rym: And I just.

812
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,586
Scott: Yeah, because basically, here's that when there's a door, you basically touch the door and it opens.

813
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,709
Scott: And if there's a guy on the other side of the door, he gets knocked down.

814
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:26,549
Scott: He doesn't die.

815
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,289
Scott: He just gets knocked down.

816
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,329
Rym: And if he has a weapon, he drops.

817
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,930
Scott: He has a weapon.

818
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,447
Scott: He drops it.

819
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,950
Scott: So that gives you a chance to jump on him and bash his head in quietly or kill other people in the room while he's lying down and then kill him.

820
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,230
Scott: So if a room has two guys and one of the guys is next to the door, that's a really good situation.

821
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,709
Scott: You knock the guy down with the door.

822
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,209
Scott: You kill the guy who's still standing really quickly before he kills you.

823
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:46,590
Scott: Then you kill the guy on the ground.

824
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:47,210
Scott: Really simple.

825
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,349
Scott: If there's three guys in a room, that's when you start to have troubles.

826
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:54,570
Scott: But if you get the horse mask every time you start a level, you can choose a mask, right?

827
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,070
Scott: Which gives you one special power.

828
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:58,669
Scott: And as you get farther in the game, you get more mass to choose from.

829
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,927
Scott: The horse mask means if you hit a guy with a door, he dies.

830
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:11,189
Scott: So what you do is if you shoot a door with a gun, the door swings back and forth because it just got shot with a powerful gun.

831
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:13,689
Scott: If that door hits someone, they die.

832
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:19,549
Scott: So you just get guys to go through a door, trick them into it and keep shooting the door with your gun.

833
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,950
Scott: And it flaps back and forth.

834
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,990
Rym: Oh, I wouldn't shoot the door with a gun.

835
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,469
Rym: I'd stand next to the door going, bam, bam, bam, bam, just bumping into it.

836
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:26,428
Scott: Oh, like that?

837
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:37,430
Scott: I'd shoot the door with the gun because then it goes like a little, you know, like it's literally like a wood chipper for any guys that run into it while the gun is firing.

838
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:46,310
Rym: Now the game gets increasingly, it really does a good job of teaching the player the skills necessary to tackle increasingly complex and dangerous maps.

839
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:47,550
Rym: And they're all different.

840
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,709
Rym: Some of them are super stealthy.

841
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,830
Rym: Like you go room by room, like kill everybody in the room, go to the next room, kill everybody.

842
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,486
Rym: Some of them, like you walk in, there's a guy immediately at the door like trying to kill you.

843
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:56,701
Scott: Yeah.

844
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:02,390
Scott: I hate that when they, there's some of the levels where it's like start and it's like the door, you just opened the door and a guy runs at you immediately.

845
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,107
Scott: It's like, fuck you.

846
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:09,245
Scott: One of those maps one time, it reminds you of those times when you save state with the bullet coming at you.

847
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:11,008
Scott: So you're like low dodge.

848
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:19,911
Rym: Though there's one of those maps where what I did, cause I couldn't get past it is I opened the door to the outside and the guy sees me and then I ran back before it like locked me in

849
00:43:20,493 --> 00:43:20,654
Scott: and

850
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:30,450
Rym: I ran off into the, you know, the, the, uh, neon BS outside and then the guy came and I killed him and took his gun, fired a shot, and then everyone in the building starts running outside and I shot them all one by one.

851
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:30,865
Scott: Nice.

852
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:31,725
Scott: Nice.

853
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:35,070
Rym: I pretty much only use the horse mask or the unicorn.

854
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:38,890
Rym: I use the unicorn to take out the cops.

855
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,410
Scott: The uh, you know, the giraffe isn't bad unless you see really far as you can plan out better.

856
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:51,170
Scott: So what you can do is you can do a level with the giraffe to sort of scope it out, then quit, load, continue, go back into the level with the horse.

857
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:58,824
Rym: So a lot of times I'd scope it out by not going in and walking around the whole building once first, maybe, uh, but sometimes, you know, I'm talking about like the second part of it.

858
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,098
Scott: Right.

859
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:01,170
Scott: Thursday we go up the elevator.

860
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:02,773
Rym: I got.

861
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:08,169
Rym: so the game teaches you so well that by the end of the game I was just like a murder machine.

862
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,750
Rym: Like I would walk through a level just killing everybody with almost no trouble.

863
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:13,050
Scott: Yeah.

864
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,857
Scott: It's, it's only when there's.

865
00:44:13,878 --> 00:44:15,150
Scott: sometimes they give you a tricky part.

866
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,490
Scott: It's pretty much like most of a level is always be because like it's like mega man.

867
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:22,090
Rym: If I die, it's cause I fucked up, right?

868
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,310
Scott: But it's like every level will have one or two tricky parts.

869
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:33,650
Scott: So it's pretty much like you're waiting patiently at the tricky part and as soon as you get past that hose down, a bunch of guys really easily go around murdering, murdering, murdering, and then up tricky part.

870
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:35,110
Scott: Get it just right.

871
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:35,789
Scott: Oh, I fucked it up.

872
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,250
Scott: Start again.

873
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,710
Rym: When a new element gets introduced.

874
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,310
Rym: Like at one point there's, there's the like, have you said black dude?

875
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,630
Scott: I hate that guy so much.

876
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,067
Rym: Oh my God.

877
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,409
Rym: That guy scares the crap because one time you have to shoot him with a gun.

878
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,229
Scott: You can't hit him with anything else.

879
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,809
Rym: So way later in the game, right?

880
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,790
Rym: I w there was one of the big maps and there's two of those dudes.

881
00:44:53,513 --> 00:44:57,590
Rym: I killed one of them and I, and I thought I killed the other one, but I guess I didn't.

882
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,322
Scott: There's the one level where you go in and there's immediately a guy with a two shot gun.

883
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,408
Scott: I hate the two shot gun.

884
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,309
Rym: I love that gun.

885
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:13,186
Scott: It's it's only fires two shots and it's easy to just fire them both by, you know, the, so you have to take the two shot gun from him and then two of the big guys come in immediately to shoot one, two, a boom, boom.

886
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:14,889
Rym: So I only way to do it.

887
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,470
Rym: I beat this whole gigantic map very methodically.

888
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,109
Rym: I had taken everyone out to kind of stealthily.

889
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,789
Rym: There was one room left with like two dudes in it.

890
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:23,230
Rym: So I went and got a machine gun.

891
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:27,289
Rym: I was like, I'm just going to kick in the door to shoot them both because there's no one left to respond to the gun.

892
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,270
Rym: So I kick in the door, I go, but bam, and I kill them both.

893
00:45:30,971 --> 00:45:35,248
Rym: And the, the stage clear doesn't appear and I'm sitting there, I'm like, thought I killed everyone.

894
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:36,174
Rym: Huh?

895
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,782
Rym: So I'm like thinking like, is there anywhere?

896
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,150
Rym: and I'm like, is there a secret?

897
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,569
Rym: Maybe there's like, I didn't know.

898
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,389
Rym: I'd never been this level before and out of nowhere, one of those black dudes just comes from nowhere and fucking kills me.

899
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:52,309
Rym: He must've been in the start of the map and I just missed him and he heard the gunshot and just came running all the way.

900
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,767
Rym: It took him like 45 seconds to get to me.

901
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:56,650
Rym: So he comes out of nowhere.

902
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,910
Rym: I'm like, ah, and he got me that guy.

903
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,270
Rym: I don't mind the detective nearly as much.

904
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,067
Rym: The guy with the taser.

905
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:04,650
Scott: No, that guy's not so bad.

906
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,769
Rym: Except sometimes you'll shoot him.

907
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,490
Rym: He'll like lunge forward and get you anyway.

908
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,943
Rym: You gotta like shoot him and then back off.

909
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,728
Rym: So how far did you get?

910
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:21,790
Scott: I've not beaten the game yet, but I'm at the, I got to the boss for the two Panthers and I have not, uh, I know how to beat him.

911
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,369
Scott: I just haven't.

912
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,590
Scott: And I've been playing at us instead.

913
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:24,869
Rym: So I beat him.

914
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,010
Scott: He was actually the easiest thing is at first the Panthers were so easy.

915
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:31,790
Scott: It gives you an arrow that says, Hey, pick up this trophy.

916
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:32,649
Scott: And it's like, Oh, duh.

917
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:33,010
Scott: Right.

918
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:35,390
Rym: And then I was like, hide behind the big statue.

919
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,310
Scott: It's like, I couldn't figure out what to do with the Ninja girl.

920
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,983
Scott: And then eventually I tried throwing and of course that worked.

921
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,390
Scott: and then I had to beat the guy himself.

922
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:48,270
Scott: So I, I went online and I saw that if you stand right next to him, there's a weird, it's not really a glitch.

923
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:53,348
Scott: It's more just like poor programming and that if someone has a gun, the bullets start at the end of the gun.

924
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:58,090
Scott: If you stand right next to a guy, the barrel of his gun is actually starting behind you.

925
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:01,970
Scott: So if you're right next to a guy who's shooting, he can't hit you.

926
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,069
Scott: The bullets are basically starting behind your back.

927
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:08,269
Scott: So I just grab a knife, get right up close to the guy, cut him off, cut him.

928
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:11,748
Scott: Then I get a second knife, but then I third knife, I fucked it up.

929
00:47:12,432 --> 00:47:13,390
Scott: So whatever.

930
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:19,730
Scott: Uh, but yeah, something that the thing is that is stuff about this game that bothers me, it's one of those situations.

931
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,790
Rym: Only one thing bothers a few things bother.

932
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,249
Rym: The game is crashing and glitchy is all fuck.

933
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,930
Scott: I actually, those problems went away for me after some up.

934
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,390
Rym: So yeah, after the updates, the crashing stopped.

935
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:36,809
Rym: But on two maps, I would very often be knocked by an enemy out of the map with no way back in and no way to die.

936
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:37,770
Scott: I haven't had that happen.

937
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,510
Rym: That happened to me like five times.

938
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:39,724
Rym: Okay.

939
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:45,702
Scott: Uh, what bothers me is number one, you know, the controls, we already discussed this a little bit.

940
00:47:45,891 --> 00:47:46,486
Rym: I like them.

941
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,207
Scott: They're yeah.

942
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:55,850
Scott: I mean, on paper they're right, but they're not, you know, really, you know, that accurate as they need to be for this kind of thing.

943
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,928
Scott: It's so fast.

944
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,190
Rym: They are accurate.

945
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,728
Rym: The problem is you have to be precise with the thing that isn't entirely obvious to you.

946
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,650
Scott: Why would you be precise with this?

947
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,466
Scott: Not obvious to me.

948
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:08,809
Rym: Like the, like the hit boxes on the guys are not obvious.

949
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:12,928
Rym: See the thing like you'll punch a guy and it'll miss him because he didn't actually hit his hit box.

950
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:13,488
Scott: Oh, that's all.

951
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,229
Scott: So that does happen.

952
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:14,506
Scott: Yes.

953
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,850
Scott: But the thing that bothers me is that if using the mouse and keyboard, right?

954
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,130
Scott: The mouse isn't relative.

955
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:20,470
Scott: It's sort of absolute.

956
00:48:21,111 --> 00:48:24,150
Scott: So and the guy isn't always locked in the middle of the screen exactly.

957
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,749
Rym: Which I like because you have the cursor on the screen.

958
00:48:27,096 --> 00:48:27,487
Scott: No, no, no.

959
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:32,829
Scott: Cause then what happens is, you know, I'll have the mouse to the left of the guy aiming left and then I'll walk left.

960
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,490
Scott: Suddenly they held the gun will flip to the right because I walked past the cursor.

961
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:38,069
Scott: It's like, no, no, no.

962
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,870
Scott: I didn't move the mouse.

963
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,470
Scott: I should still be aiming left.

964
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:42,590
Rym: See, I liked that because it's not aiming.

965
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:43,810
Rym: I didn't think of it as aiming.

966
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:44,789
Scott: I think of his aim.

967
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,810
Rym: I thought of it as I had the crosshair, right?

968
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:50,667
Rym: I was constantly hitting shift to doing the far look like the entire time I was doing that also.

969
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:53,270
Rym: And I always thought of the mouse as being absolute.

970
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,809
Rym: That actually seemed very intuitive to me.

971
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:57,469
Scott: It's not, that's not the way a robotron would be.

972
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:57,790
Scott: I did.

973
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,850
Rym: Cause it's not robotron.

974
00:48:58,991 --> 00:48:59,569
Scott: It is robotron.

975
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,269
Rym: No, it's not.

976
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:00,626
Rym: It is.

977
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,206
Rym: It shouldn't be.

978
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:01,846
Scott: It's robotron.

979
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:02,690
Rym: It's not robotron.

980
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,881
Rym: It's absolute because I would absolutely click on.

981
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,789
Rym: a dude went like, like it's fucking right on a dude when I was shooting at it.

982
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:10,308
Scott: It's robotron.

983
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,350
Rym: Anyway, I think it's better not being a robot.

984
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,829
Scott: I think robotron perfected it.

985
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,367
Scott: That's why everyone calls it robotron.

986
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,810
Scott: I'm saying this game.

987
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,106
Scott: No, this is not better than that.

988
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:22,870
Scott: I, for this game, I think it is you should use the smash TV controls and just had it be done.

989
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:29,610
Scott: Anyway, the other thing that bothers me is that, you know, it's all about doing the level over and over again, like super meat boy until getting it just right.

990
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:33,045
Scott: But unlike super meat boy, the level is not 100% identical.

991
00:49:34,632 --> 00:49:36,309
Scott: I do not like that.

992
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:44,925
Scott: If you want me to complete redo something over and over again until I get it just right, you need to have it be exactly pixely identical time that I did it.

993
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,089
Scott: Just like super meat boy.

994
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:47,445
Rym: No, no.

995
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,730
Rym: That would be the case if you're going for the ranking system, which I ignored.

996
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:51,949
Scott: I don't care.

997
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:53,970
Scott: I ignored that completely.

998
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:54,390
Rym: Yeah.

999
00:49:55,331 --> 00:50:05,270
Scott: I came up with this as a way to beat the level and it works, you know, five out of six times because the sixth time the level doesn't render and start the exact same way.

1000
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:08,950
Rym: The game is not a puzzle game like that.

1001
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:19,984
Rym: It is much more an action game in that the depend, like depending on where you stand and the tiny subtleties of, you know, like where you shoot the gun, different guys might hear it.

1002
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:22,490
Rym: Their path might be altered slightly.

1003
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:26,550
Rym: Once a guy hears you once his path changes, he might walk around a different room instead.

1004
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,130
Scott: I'm so much as the starting set up will not be the same.

1005
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:38,130
Scott: For example, there'd be a level with those big guys and you've got to shoot one and sometimes you'll start right next to a guy with a gun you can take and sometimes you won't.

1006
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:43,929
Scott: And it's like, well, if you start with the neck and the guy with the gun isn't there to take and the big guys are going to come, you pretty much can't beat them.

1007
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,370
Scott: So just die and start again because the level started shittily.

1008
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,941
Scott: That's why you need to have a level.

1009
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:51,470
Scott: be exactly the same every time.

1010
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:55,430
Rym: Because that one in particular, I played that level a ton of times.

1011
00:50:55,990 --> 00:51:00,805
Rym: It was a different gun every time, but that first guy always, always, always dropped a gun.

1012
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:01,267
Scott: I've had it.

1013
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,369
Scott: Start up baseball bat.

1014
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:03,130
Scott: What are you gonna do now?

1015
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,889
Rym: That never happened to me in that map.

1016
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,850
Rym: Now I think I know why it was done this way and I kind of like it.

1017
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,030
Scott: Lazy programming?

1018
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:14,030
Scott: No, I think it was- Same lazy program that calls these fucking crashes.

1019
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,330
Rym: Why would it be lazy to be randomized as opposed to just hard coded?

1020
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:21,350
Rym: I think it's much more simple.

1021
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:25,785
Rym: I think the rationale is, because this is the rationale I would use for something like this.

1022
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:39,457
Rym: You could randomize certain characters' weapons that you could get or weapon placements as a sort of mechanism for if a player can't beat a level, they might get a slightly different loadout after a few deaths.

1023
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:42,670
Rym: that might for that player make it easier for them.

1024
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,830
Scott: That is true.

1025
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,790
Rym: Because I'm really good.

1026
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:48,710
Rym: If I found a knife, I used the knife for the entire rest of the map.

1027
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,710
Rym: The knife was the best weapon.

1028
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,530
Scott: The knife is really good.

1029
00:51:51,290 --> 00:52:03,589
Rym: But the problem is, the lazy part would be, if you're gonna do that, you need to identify which guns can be random and which ones, based on the level, have to be the same or else the level doesn't work anymore.

1030
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,970
Scott: Yeah, you might get, you know, that's the thing is, I see where you're coming from on that, right?

1031
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:17,309
Scott: It's like I'm having a hard time, if the level is locked in and someone's having a hard time beating it, it would be a Super Meat Boy, exactly, where it's like, "Well, I can't really beat it and I'm getting the same shit every time and I don't know what to

1032
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:17,370
Scott: do.".

1033
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:25,770
Scott: But if it mixes it up, it's like, "Well, I couldn't beat it the way it is that way, but I can beat it this way because I start off with the assault rifle instead of the baseball

1034
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:27,010
Scott: bat.".

1035
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:32,950
Scott: But, why not just have the assault rifle one be the one it always is, then you won't have that problem.

1036
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:38,490
Scott: There's gonna be some configuration that's gonna be the beatable one for most people, even if someone else might have preferred.

1037
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:42,870
Rym: See, I guess I don't think it has the trappings of a puzzle game, but to me it's really just an action game.

1038
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,929
Rym: Like, I beat a lot of levels.

1039
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,890
Scott: Super Meat Boy is an action game, but it's also exactly the same.

1040
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,449
Rym: Yeah, it's a very different kind of game.

1041
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:54,347
Scott: I think it's actually mostly the same game as Super Meat Boy with these imperfections I've complained about.

1042
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,930
Scott: No, it would have to be- But, it's Robitron instead of platforming.

1043
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:06,090
Rym: It would have to be completely rewritten to be that because this game, due to its glitchiness and all the kinds of just the way it was done, is very soft and fuzzy in the end.

1044
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:09,950
Rym: You have to rewrite it to make it purely deterministic, like you want.

1045
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:19,810
Rym: Well, I think the other thing is, right, and- Which was fine because, I mean, you can beat most of the levels if you're good enough, just by grab a gun, you just run around fucking shooting everybody.

1046
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:20,289
Rym: Maybe.

1047
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,288
Scott: I've beaten- Ammo's an issue.

1048
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,730
Rym: No, because you keep picking up other guns.

1049
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,070
Rym: If you run out of guns, it doesn't matter, you can- Oh, that's something else that pisses me off, right?

1050
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:37,190
Scott: You're standing near a bunch of guns, the only button you have is pick up weapon, and you might pick up the gun you didn't want, so sometimes if it's quiet, I can sit there picking up all the guns to find the one that still has ammo in it.

1051
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:38,229
Rym: Nah, just fucking go for it.

1052
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:39,429
Rym: All guns are equal to me.

1053
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:44,245
Scott: No, what I'm saying is sometimes I'll sit there picking up guns until I find one that still has ammo in it.

1054
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,054
Rym: Ahh.

1055
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:51,330
Scott: But if I'm standing there, and there's like two empty shotguns and an assault rifle next to me, and the only button I have is switch weapon.

1056
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,970
Rym: So you gotta be smart about that shit, I would, whenever I finished a weapon, I would throw that gun off in the corner away from everything else.

1057
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:01,730
Scott: Yeah, okay, and then I kill a guy who's in that corner, then I go to go pick up his gun, but the bullshit gun, empty gun is there.

1058
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,230
Rym: See, I never threw guns at people, because I never needed to.

1059
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,468
Scott: This, you know, this situation's like this, right?

1060
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,750
Scott: I know, I'm saying they didn't bother me.

1061
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:22,170
Scott: And the controls, yeah, the controls don't bother with that, and you can't, I was occasionally fucked by that, and when that happened, I got pissed off, because there wasn't anything I did wrong, it was this bullshit game, didn't give me some means to indicate that I wanted to pick up the gun that had ammo, and not the empty one.

1062
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,257
Rym: I kind of enjoyed that.

1063
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:24,930
Rym: I didn't have those means.

1064
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,889
Scott: I don't enjoy getting fucked.

1065
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,469
Scott: Do you like getting fucked, Rym?

1066
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:29,790
Scott: Because you're fucking me.

1067
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:34,090
Rym: Because I, in this game, I kind of- Did you get me the iPad?

1068
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:52,405
Rym: Like I could go through the entire game super methodically and puzzly, but instead, the game was basically pushing you at all points to just fucking go for it, and I found that whenever I just went, I just picked up whatever gun and started shooting, the game was a lot more fun.

1069
00:54:55,653 --> 00:54:57,449
Rym: So, yeah, you didn't get to the plot at all.

1070
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,868
Scott: Well, I mean, there is some plot so far.

1071
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,990
Rym: Yeah, well, you're a psycho killer.

1072
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,769
Scott: Right, and you don't know why, but- And there's that janitor, who's looking at you.

1073
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:11,787
Scott: And there's a weird janitor looking at you, and there's some Russian mafia involved, and I also hosed down a whole police station, which is badass.

1074
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:16,850
Rym: I liked how when you get to the top floor of the police station- And there's something weird going on at the bodega.

1075
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:17,790
Rym: There's that detective.

1076
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:21,909
Rym: Well, yeah, because suddenly the guy who's been with you the whole time is dead, and there's this asshole there now.

1077
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:33,044
Rym: So I like the detective, who is talking to all the cops before you basically bust in Terminator 1 style and kill them all, and he's just like, "Come on, guys.

1078
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,430
Rym: Just follow procedure, and we'll get through this.

1079
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,682
Rym: We'll take out this crazy nut

1080
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:38,006
Rym: job.".

1081
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,006
Rym: It's like, "No, none of you are going home to your kids

1082
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:40,309
Rym: tonight.".

1083
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:45,790
Scott: Well, yeah, you are actually, 99 out of 100 times, but on the 100th time, none of you were going home to your kids.

1084
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,967
Rym: Yeah, but even the times when they took me out, most of them were not going home to their kids.

1085
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:54,070
Rym: I feel like every one of those cops was one day away from retirement.

1086
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:59,698
Scott: That's why they were in the police station, where they were safe, behind all those security doors.

1087
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,550
Rym: Or it's that XKCD, "Man, it's a shame, too.

1088
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,840
Rym: We died one day before we were going to lock him in that room that we lock every cop in the day before

1089
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:07,309
Rym: retirement.".

1090
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:07,948
Scott: That's right.

1091
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,269
Scott: But, yeah, so this is a game, and the reason it's more- So it's got to reveal something.

1092
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:19,610
Rym: If you beat that boss, you get an ending, a pretty interesting ending.

1093
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:24,270
Scott: And then there must be more game, because there's so many not unlocked masks.

1094
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:29,570
Rym: So remember way back when you ran into someone else who had already killed a bunch of people?

1095
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:31,481
Scott: Wasn't he a boss?

1096
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:31,989
Scott: and I killed him?

1097
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:38,767
Rym: Yeah, so then you play the game again as that guy, where that scene goes differently, and you kill him.

1098
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,109
Rym: So you're him, and you kill the you from the previous playthrough, and it's a different timeline.

1099
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:44,909
Scott: Oh, okay.

1100
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:50,090
Rym: Where what if that dude killed the psycho killer and went off doing his own thing?

1101
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,529
Scott: So it's not the same timeline.

1102
00:56:51,570 --> 00:57:01,529
Rym: So when you play as that guy, the biker dude, you have this meat cleaver that you can't drop, and you have three knives you can throw, and you can't pick up weapons, and there's no masks.

1103
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,730
Rym: And the game's totally different.

1104
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:05,069
Scott: But how do I get the other half of those masks?

1105
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:07,209
Rym: I don't know.

1106
00:57:08,012 --> 00:57:09,130
Rym: I ignored all that.

1107
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,930
Rym: I got the last man I unlocked, I forget which one is the last one.

1108
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:13,689
Rym: I got a bunch of masks.

1109
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,190
Scott: I got one mask every level, so I don't know how to get the rest of them.

1110
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:17,489
Rym: I got two masks in a couple levels.

1111
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:18,289
Scott: Oh, really?

1112
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:20,309
Rym: I found a mask on the ground and picked it up.

1113
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:20,901
Rym: Fuck.

1114
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:22,488
Scott: I fucked that up.

1115
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,348
Rym: I got the grasshopper guy.

1116
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,267
Scott: What does he do?

1117
00:57:24,771 --> 00:57:27,450
Rym: I don't remember, because I only ever use the horse head or the unicorn.

1118
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,785
Rym: That's right.

1119
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,048
Scott: Oh, man.

1120
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:31,486
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, this is one of those things where the game is so good, right?

1121
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,048
Scott: But there are some of these things that, at least I guess they don't bother him, but they infuriate me.

1122
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:45,729
Scott: Well, the thing is, the game is rough and unpolished, but I feel like... And that's the reason that it's infuriating, because if a game just sucks all around, the sucky things don't bother you, because you just don't fucking play it.

1123
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:54,750
Scott: It's infuriating when there are flaws in an otherwise great thing, because it's sort of like a stain on a beautiful painting, right?

1124
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:06,630
Rym: See, but to me, I guess this is the point where I'll take form and function, and form as function, and the idea that this game was unpolished and rough and had a lot of janky...

1125
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,429
Scott: And how that goes along with the plot and aesthetic of it.

1126
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,570
Scott: I do agree, and I give that is to the game's benefit.

1127
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,790
Rym: It also fits with the aesthetic.

1128
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:28,870
Rym: The aesthetic of the game just really feels like those weird black sort of fly glitchy things flying around whenever the masked guys are talking to you, and the game's just weird, and I liked it because it was so weird and janky.

1129
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,250
Scott: Yeah, so it's cheap on the Steam sale right now, right?

1130
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,148
Rym: You know what?

1131
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,229
Rym: We might have complained about it a little bit.

1132
00:58:36,135 --> 00:58:36,810
Rym: It's five bucks.

1133
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,170
Rym: You should play this game.

1134
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:38,987
Rym: This game is fantastic.

1135
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:43,050
Scott: Yeah, for fucking five bucks, why would you not buy this game, seriously?

1136
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,370
Scott: Five dollars.

1137
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,110
Scott: You'd probably spend more on lunch.

1138
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,709
Rym: And there really aren't other games like it.

1139
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:55,970
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's some robotrons out there, but most of the robotrons out there are like, what's that one, Alien something?

1140
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,230
Rym: Oh, this game is not anything like those games.

1141
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:04,210
Rym: It's not even... I can't call it a robotron game, because while it has similar controls, it's not like a robotron game.

1142
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,225
Rym: It's like...

1143
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,190
Scott: Yeah, Alien Breed.

1144
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,350
Scott: Yeah, this is way better than Alien Breed.

1145
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,930
Rym: This is ultra violence, but in this sort of deconstructed way.

1146
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:17,190
Rym: Like you're the bad guy, and you know you're the bad guy.

1147
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,390
Scott: You had to experience this game, and for five bucks, there's no reason you shouldn't.

1148
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,264
Rym: Yeah, that's...

1149
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:25,290
Scott: You got 40 hours as of this recording to get it for five bucks.

1150
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:26,130
Rym: You should get it.

1151
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,950
Scott: It's probably gonna be five bucks for a long time.

1152
00:59:28,351 --> 00:59:31,910
Scott: Even if you have to pay the regular price of 10 bucks, get it anyway.

1153
00:59:32,272 --> 00:59:32,408
Rym: Yeah.

1154
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,310
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1155
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:45,410
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1156
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:50,830
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1157
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,770
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1158
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:58,510
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1161
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,470
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1162
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:46,127
Scott: You love and then you hate, and you give but then debate, the night that wanders and tonight salutes you,

1163
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:55,283
Rym: the mind from different kinds, so reading down to see your heart, to see and then you're free,

1164
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:58,652
Scott: it's to me, it's honesty, it bites

1165
01:00:58,772 --> 01:00:59,795
Rym: in our world

1166
01:00:59,835 --> 01:01:05,362
Scott: to me to greet you, believe

1167
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:07,288
Rym: but don't you see, so

1168
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:07,889
Scott: make the

1169
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:08,451
Rym: world to

1170
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:10,095
Scott: start hosting,

1171
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:37,760
Rym: clear a wipe off, tear a stitch from the heart, love and be strong, and to fight, right, dight, hold your heart, no ordinary world can be so far, you're great, great, great, in the world of calligraphy, the night of monopoly to rescue your heart, great, great, great, he's the legend of.
