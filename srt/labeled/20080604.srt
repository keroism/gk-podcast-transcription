00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,640
Rym:

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,248
Rym: It's Wednesday June 4th.

3
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:12,050
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:15,020
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:18,256
Rym: We give the first four of toshikon sense.

6
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,617
Rym: Oh aka library war.

7
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:35,879
Rym: So what could be better than the best anime podcast in the english-speaking world going once a week?

9
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,833
Rym: How about uh going once every other week?

10
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:47,420
Rym: Yeah pretty much All right people because I know Wednesday probably gets the most listeners who don't listen to any other nights.

11
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:55,840
Rym: So I figure we should bring it up right at the beginning For various reasons partly because we haven't made our swag yet and because we're actually trying to do that whole.

12
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:02,104
Rym: I don't know video thing and it's summer which is pretty much the biggest Confounding factor here.

13
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,067
Rym: We're go.

14
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:07,840
Rym: we're enacting the GeekNights originally planned for season three half sabbatical schedule.

15
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:14,340
Scott: Yes now instead of GeekNights being four nights a week It'll be two nights a week, but there is still be four shows.

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:27,200
Scott: So instead of thinking of GeekNights as one podcast where you get four episodes every week Think of it as four podcasts for completely separate podcasts and each podcast comes out once every other week.

17
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:34,677
Scott: Oh my gosh, so next week there will not be a Wednesday episode But the week after that there will be a Wednesday episode.

18
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,508
Rym: next week There will be a Tuesday and a Thursday.

19
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,239
Rym: You see what we did there Monday Wednesday Tuesday Thursday.

20
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:50,676
Rym: now Occasionally, I mean if the muse bites us or there's something we really got to talk about or we're just bored There's a chance we might just do a normal episode in between all that.

21
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,599
Rym: but don't count on it.

22
00:01:51,901 --> 00:02:03,180
Scott: No, most likely instead of doing those, you know, since you're doing half as much GeekNights We're probably gonna be you know, putting out other things that are not GeekNights but are related in some way.

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,639
Rym: Yes, and in the very the very least of those will be you won't get a GeekNights special on a normal day anymore.

24
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:17,832
Rym: If you get a GeekNights special, that means it's kind of extra on top of what we're doing Normally, so you won't get those cop-outs like we used to do whenever we got tired.

25
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:18,233
Rym: Yep.

26
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:22,784
Scott: One example of such spin-offs Is Scott's box.

27
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:24,872
Scott: Oh Scott's boss Scott's box.

28
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:28,165
Scott: Scott's box would have been tonight But it's not gonna be.

29
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,656
Scott: and you know Scott's box has been actually pretty popular.

30
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:32,660
Scott: a lot of people like it.

31
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,800
Scott: I was quite surprised.

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,659
Scott: I didn't think too many people would be interested because I didn't think that many people actually bought comics who also listened to us.

33
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:44,849
Scott: so Scott's box though I think I'm gonna take it out of the GeekNights.

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,315
Rym: take it out of the box.

35
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:49,829
Scott: take it out of the GeekNights And people are probably like, oh no, don't take it out the GeekNights.

36
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:52,920
Scott: No, it's still gonna be around Scott's box.

37
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,605
Scott: I'm announcing right now.

38
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:57,975
Scott: It's gonna be its own thing on its own what I'm gonna do.

39
00:02:58,497 --> 00:02:59,600
Scott: The box is in my room.

40
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,266
Scott: It's sealed.

41
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:09,558
Scott: after the show After we eat probably I'm gonna go and I'm gonna turn on the camera and without editing anything I'm just gonna open the box.

42
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,644
Scott: I'm gonna do the same.

43
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,320
Scott: I'm gonna show you all the goodies that are in there and I'm not gonna cut it up or anything.

44
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:24,920
Rym: now we'll probably record the audio too and we'll probably put it in this feed or in the experimental feed because I Don't you guys definitely I imagine want the audio to listen to and the video would just be like an extra touch.

45
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:30,446
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna put the video on YouTube and whatever other sites and you know Now I'll put the link up.

46
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:37,898
Scott: It'll be up, you know, probably today or tomorrow as soon as I you know, compile it I'm gonna shoot for the weekend here my estimate.

47
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,838
Scott: No, I'm gonna do it cuz I'm not gonna edit it at all.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,340
Scott: I'm just gonna stand in front of the camera open the box and do it.

49
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,212
Scott: I can't do it twice once the box is open.

50
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:44,655
Scott: It's open.

51
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:45,420
Scott: I can't like pretend.

52
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:49,680
Rym: Well, the audio component will not be in the feed right away because I have to do stuff to that.

53
00:03:49,824 --> 00:04:00,140
Scott: No, well But the video of me opening the box and showing you all the stuff inside Will be a monthly thing and perhaps, you know, then I'll make addendums to it as well.

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,149
Rym: Well, you know remember the debate we had way back.

55
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,100
Rym: where is Scott's box gonna be when he orders or is it gonna be when?

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,485
Rym: He gets it eventually.

57
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,771
Rym: Scott's box could be both.

58
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,554
Scott: It could be both.

59
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:13,693
Scott: no reason not to but for now It's gonna be at that.

60
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:20,220
Scott: for just to start It's gonna be once a month less than 10 minute video of me opening the box and showing you the goodies.

61
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:29,312
Rym: And so expect that really soon, but don't worry You're a weekly bi-weekly Multi-weekly, however, you want to call it GeekNights isn't gonna change.

62
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:30,697
Rym: just Scott's box is there.

63
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:35,091
Scott: Yep So instead of Scott's box, let's let's do some news here.

64
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,078
Rym: What's the anime news?

65
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:37,700
Rym: Oh my gosh.

66
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,171
Scott: Well, it's not really so much anime news.

67
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:41,880
Scott: It's sort of manga comic news.

68
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:50,502
Scott: Yes, Tokyo pop the sort of you know company we have to thank for the you know, the manga boom in the u.s Company.

69
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,573
Rym: we have to thank for the specific kind of manga that has boomed.

70
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,224
Scott: Yes is Restructuring.

71
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:03,932
Rym: they're calling it a quote progressive Reorganization unquote which I'll translate that from business speak.

72
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,000
Rym: Yeah, we're trying not to go under in the long run.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,906
Scott: Yeah I mean this isn't like.

74
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:16,319
Scott: Oh knows manga is in trouble because actually vis is growing Dark horse is kicking some ass verticals doing pretty well, you know.

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,577
Scott: So don't think some don't think this is a sign of oh no the end times for manga.

76
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:24,040
Scott: the same way You know, it's sort of the end times for anime in the u.s.

77
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,457
Scott: But basically what it shows is that Tokyo pop is sort of playing a different game.

78
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:39,660
Scott: you see Getting the licenses for these mangas are real expensive and this sort of has a lock on all the really popular ones.

79
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:52,240
Scott: dark horse has a lock on a bunch of others and vertical has a lock on a bunch of the classics and Tokyo pops having a real hard time getting any good, you know, manga licenses of Japanese things to translate and bring over.

80
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:56,420
Rym: Well, plus they seem to have always used the shotgun approach.

81
00:05:56,805 --> 00:06:05,274
Scott: yes, the quantity is better than quality and we'll throw everything against the wall and see what sticks as opposed to Trying to pick out the stickiest poop and then throwing.

82
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:06,280
Rym: but then they keep putting out.

83
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,254
Rym: It doesn't stick and they just keep throwing it.

84
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:15,297
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so actually what it looks like is they're gonna split apart because people don't maybe not realize this.

85
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:20,160
Scott: Tokyo pop used to put out Like anime DVDs like they put out initial D. I have all those eggs now.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,065
Rym: No, I don't think it needs to be said.

87
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:28,472
Rym: but in case lest we forget Tokyo pop really sucked at putting out I wouldn't say that they sucked.

88
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:29,400
Rym: they were very good.

89
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:41,180
Rym: What they were is they were very good at taking an otherwise Okay show and doing their best to ruin everything that was holy good and pure about it before releasing it in English.

90
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,571
Scott: Well, they also put out DVDs of rain the Conqueror that show.

91
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,915
Rym: I don't know.

92
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,239
Rym: I didn't see enough of it.

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,636
Scott: You only had to see like 10 seconds to know.

94
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:51,460
Scott: that is terrible.

95
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,967
Rym: You know, I can't say cuz it for all.

96
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,936
Rym: I know it might have been okay.

97
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,260
Scott: What are the odds of it being?

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,660
Rym: Okay, I give it a 5% chance of being worth finishing the first episode.

99
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:08,894
Rym: I saw the first half of the first episode and I didn't turn it off in disgust.

100
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,580
Rym: I turned it off to play counter-strike.

101
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,188
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

102
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:15,072
Rym: Anyway, didn't we try to watch that on TV?

103
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:17,000
Scott: Yes, cuz it was on right after Lupin.

104
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:23,994
Rym: I remember we had to find a coaxial cable and then we plugged it into the wall Wondering if we had cable and finding out that we did.

105
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:25,180
Rym: Yeah anyway.

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,728
Scott: So Tokyo pop restructuring here.

107
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,832
Scott: What does this mean?

108
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:39,198
Scott: It means first of all Tokyo pop I'm guessing is gonna be doing a lot less, you know bringing over of Japanese manga, you know and translating it.

109
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:45,194
Scott: a lot more Publishing of you know suckering us kids into writing comics.

110
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:51,294
Rym: that they were not going to talk about their Licensing policy for new artists that they get from the u.s.

111
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,680
Rym: That's a whole separate discussion.

112
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,940
Scott: But the point is is that they sort of realize that it's a lot cheaper and a lot more profitable for them to you know.

113
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:11,207
Scott: Get you know, really pay kids in the u.s A lot less money than they'd have to pay a Japanese company and then sell but got these, you know Sell the books for the same amount now Beyond that regardless of what they're gonna be putting out.

114
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:23,300
Rym: It says here that they're pretty much cutting their distribution or it Distribution in terms of number of titles published not number of individual title of items in a publishing unit put out.

115
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,050
Rym: Yeah, but they're cutting it in half right.

116
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,999
Rym: half as many volumes a year, right exactly so it.

117
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:32,419
Scott: That means all right.

118
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:41,587
Scott: first of all what would happen is they would put a whole bunch of different volumes of manga on the shelf and people would end up choosing between a Tokyo pop and a Tokyo pop.

119
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:50,866
Scott: so by doing that they sort of were competing with themselves, you know It's like if I sell three products that are all sort of the same at once But people can't afford all three.

120
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:55,460
Scott: then they're picking one of the three things and I'm basically paying a lot more money.

121
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,925
Scott: I'm spending three times as much money because the biggest cost is you know, either buying the license or you know Creating the original work.

122
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,371
Scott: the actual printing is not that much.

123
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,782
Scott: now, you know take heed Tokyo pop They're doing.

124
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:13,080
Rym: they're basically doing what Nintendo figured out a long time ago Everyone's gonna buy Zelda everyone's gonna buy Mario.

125
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:19,398
Rym: Let's release Zelda until everyone's bought it and then when sales start flagging we release Mario.

126
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,968
Rym: that way Everyone buys every game.

127
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:22,491
Rym: Yep.

128
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:31,307
Scott: So by putting out less volumes they're gonna sell a lot more of each individual volume and therefore make more money and That is that is their intent.

129
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:38,599
Scott: Yes, and also by putting out less volumes Hopefully they will you know, put out more quality and less.

130
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:39,599
Scott: All right.

131
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,410
Scott: The thing is I don't really want to malign Tokyo pop.

132
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,040
Rym: No, they're not don't like most of their manga.

133
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,100
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I really think about it, right and it's like yeah You look at Tokyo pop and you look at their entire body of work and you kind of go.

134
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:04,800
Scott: But I buy to Tokyo pop titles regularly back and initial D. Right, of course, both of those titles are almost done and when they're done, I probably won't buy any more Tokyo pops at all.

135
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:12,613
Rym: I worry that Tokyo pops gonna get hit by a minor version of the Dragon Ball syndrome where Dragon Ball stops and then half the people disappear.

136
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:17,880
Scott: I don't think that initial D and Beck Oh Beck is a pretty big seller, but I don't think initial D is like their biggest seller.

137
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:19,867
Rym: No, but I feel like initial D is.

138
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,055
Rym: it's probably a very solid franchise for me.

139
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:22,376
Rym: Of course.

140
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:23,340
Rym: We don't know.

141
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:28,700
Scott: No one tells us no But it apparently was worth it for them to keep publishing the volumes right up to the end.

142
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,465
Rym: D is a pretty big follow.

143
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:35,180
Rym: it like it's not this widespread following but there is a strong cult following in the u.s.

144
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:36,369
Scott: I wouldn't be surprised though.

145
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:41,420
Scott: Beck was their biggest title though But it's only got like a handful of volumes left before it's done.

146
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,416
Scott: But yeah, I mean me buying two comics regularly from a single publisher.

147
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:47,800
Scott: That's pretty good.

148
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,260
Scott: I mean there are other other publishers that I don't buy, you know, two regular titles from them and you think that those are better.

149
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,845
Scott: You know, I mean like I don't buy to visit titles regularly not since Phoenix ended But viz.

150
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,620
Scott: I look at their body of work and I think it's better than Tokyo pops.

151
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:18,819
Rym: So I figure it would be a little bit self-serving, but I should mention it because well while we'll probably be around It's very unlikely We'll actually be able to be at this event, especially since we were at the Kinokuniya last weekend for Hal Cali and the Tokyo FM samurai beach radio thing.

152
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,642
Rym: but basically Kinokuniya won.

153
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:29,840
Rym: the manager of the Kinokuniya in New York City in Bryant Park is a pretty damn cool, dude And we're hopefully going to have him on the show sometime soon for an interview.

154
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:34,160
Rym: Yep, Scott's barking up that tree, but this guy's story is pretty and pretty cool.

155
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:48,113
Rym: but anyway, one thing that the Kinokuniya is doing very well is that they are Catering to the fact that there are a lot of anime and manga fans Independent of that a lot of Japanese culture and Japanese music fans in the u.s.

156
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,200
Rym: Especially in New York City.

157
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:57,780
Scott: I mean if you pick any, you know demographic no matter how targeted there is at least you know At least ten of those people in New York City.

158
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:05,363
Rym: Yeah, and now but the cool thing is what they're doing is they're having more and more of these events where there's an event at The bookstore.

159
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:13,879
Rym: so you go to the bookstore in one right by there not too far away You can get beard poppers and all that stuff and the book off is not too far from there.

160
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:23,019
Rym: but in Kinokuniya you get people going in any way to buy anime and manga and comics and plushies and Kitaro things that we're gonna be using a lot more in our video.

161
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,234
Rym: But they're also having these events, I mean we had TMR.

162
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:28,840
Rym: we interviewed them along with Brian.

163
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,679
Rym: Well, I guess Brian Nishi interviewed him along with us.

164
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,585
Rym: Yeah, and samurai beat radio.

165
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,475
Rym: and now they're having this weekend on June 7th.

166
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:42,379
Rym: I think that's Saturday a gothic Lolita and made fashion day.

167
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:49,727
Scott: Well, I guess if you're really into gothic Lolita and made fashion, that's something you should go to except There's something better.

168
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:51,275
Scott: You should be going to this Saturday.

169
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,920
Scott: Oh Especially if you're in New York City.

170
00:12:54,241 --> 00:13:14,280
Scott: Oh is that as you see this weekend Saturday and Sunday in the puck building on the corners of Lafayette and Houston Street in New York City is the annual Museum of comic and cartoon art arts festival now greatest comic convention in the entire world.

171
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,855
Rym: now a lot of people refer to this as the mocha but be careful because the mocha is a museum.

172
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:25,160
Scott: and then there is the Mocha arts festival, which is their annual fundraiser, which is where they get most of their monies.

173
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:34,040
Rym: It's also basically the latter which is what we're talking about is a super awesome Comic-con and it's not like the underwear pervert comic cons.

174
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,980
Rym: This is basically all the awesome indie art and web comic people and all the cool stuff from comics around the world.

175
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:58,598
Scott: This is a comic convention where you will see like an uber professional Sitting at a table next to some kid who just came from the kinkos with his photocopied You know doodles right next to famous webcomic person Right next to the guy who does Ally right next to the guy who does Scott Pilgrim.

176
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:06,206
Rym: now We're definitely going to be there along with you going to Knopf and Emily and hopefully a bunch of other front row crew people not On Saturday only though.

177
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:11,780
Scott: It's not as good as this con is unless you're sitting at a table Which the tables are actually really expensive.

178
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:14,891
Scott: There's not really a reason to be there both days.

179
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,220
Scott: you walk around and look at all the tables and they go Ah, that was awesome.

180
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,159
Scott: And you walk out with two sacks full of comics and you don't need to come back the next day unless you're rich.

181
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:32,619
Rym: now We'll be there interviewing and hanging out and checking people But we generally we avoid being there like we don't want to get a table or anything partly because one I want to spend my time walking around

182
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:33,039
Scott: Yep

183
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:37,174
Rym: And two I don't want to deny even the kid with kinkos from having his table.

184
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,603
Scott: then the kids with kinkos of some of the Best comics there.

185
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:40,607
Rym: a teen boat.

186
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:41,672
Scott: I mean taught your teen boat.

187
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,503
Scott: You're talking like little tiny like Comic.

188
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:45,346
Scott: that's like.

189
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:46,611
Scott: could you know the like?

190
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:49,080
Scott: an inch by an inch that is little pictures of monsters in it.

191
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,180
Rym: What was the name of that comic or the people who gave us those little custom free ghosts?

192
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,071
Scott: Oh the people who make the woodcraft every year.

193
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,140
Scott: I we saw that I have their business card.

194
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,851
Scott: I know what they are, but it's in my room.

195
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,280
Rym: They had the best promotion ever.

196
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,391
Rym: They just gave away free unique Pac-man.

197
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:09,612
Rym: Pac-man ghosts made out of wood and I remember taking one thinking wow, this is a really good idea.

198
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:14,507
Rym: and then I got home and immediately forgot who they were because I still have their business card.

199
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,994
Scott: I know who they are when we talk about the mocha.

200
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,180
Scott: probably two weeks from now we will.

201
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:25,885
Scott: We will make a point of mentioning these people because they're pretty sure I mentioned them the last mocha episode but you know last year.

202
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:32,511
Scott: look in the Wednesday episodes from around June of last of 07 and you will.

203
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,180
Scott: you will find possibly me man.

204
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,281
Scott: But

205
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:48,678
Rym: anyway, if you're gonna be in the city for the mocha on Saturday You'd might as well also go to the Kino Kunia for the Lolita and made fashion day a del Rey Samurai beat radio who I mentioned repeatedly only because we're getting more and more involved with them as time goes on.

206
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,223
Scott: and if you live In the city, right?

207
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:54,394
Scott: Why not go to the Lolita fashion show Saturday and the mocha Sunday?

208
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,420
Scott: Yeah, not been not bad.

209
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,447
Rym: So I got one more quick news.

210
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:01,016
Rym: I just want to bring this up because not too long ago.

211
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:07,540
Rym: We mentioned the strange occurrence whereby Jojo's Bizarre Adventure ran into some difficulty.

212
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:15,453
Rym: Uh-huh, the I'm not gonna get into all the details, but I'm sure you all Wondered what was up with that because we wondered what was up.

213
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,136
Rym: was that with that?

214
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:26,755
Rym: and the answer came out Pretty quickly and then there was a follow-up, but the deal basically is that in a particular Episode of the anime there was a book.

215
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:35,126
Rym: That's a care I'm trying not to spoil anything either is reading from this book and while he's reading from the book He's vowing to kill another character.

216
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,413
Rym: now apparently in the manga.

217
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,580
Rym: It's just some unintelligible book, whatever.

218
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:47,900
Rym: I didn't ever read the manga, but in the anime and I don't know who Noticed this let alone decided to make a ruckus about it.

219
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,439
Rym: You can read the news if you really care about who made a ruckus about.

220
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,727
Rym: it Happened to by random chance.

221
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:58,540
Rym: They just took pages from the Quran and stuck them in there because they needed something.

222
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:04,780
Scott: Well, maybe they were making a funny commentary because someone was vowing to kill someone and the Quran is full of vows to kill.

223
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,849
Rym: Indications are that it was just completely.

224
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,913
Rym: Hey, that looks good.

225
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:10,414
Rym: Throw it in.

226
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:13,723
Scott: All right, like a lorem ipsum supplement Yeah Something like that.

227
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:21,055
Rym: and as a result that was pretty much the reason behind the issue With Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

228
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:21,700
Rym: and in fact wait.

229
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,047
Scott: So because one episode has that this company that the entire company all they really did was was put out this anime Stop putting out the whole anime.

230
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,473
Scott: Why didn't they just edit that one?

231
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,361
Rym: I don't think that company was doing too Well.

232
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:42,013
Scott: anyway, I know I know and you know, I mean the only even if they I Guess they could have stood up to their guns that we're gonna put it out on.

233
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:42,697
Scott: edit in any way.

234
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:49,337
Scott: freedom of speech But if you don't have the money to fight, you know in court Even if you're gonna win then just you know, they could have just edited the thing.

235
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:49,819
Scott: What the hell?

236
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:58,476
Rym: Yes, but the the trouble got even further because apparently basically Japan's foreign ministry Apologized for all of this.

237
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,400
Rym: This I don't want to get into it because it's Wednesday's anime night.

238
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,646
Scott: Obviously, we're on the side.

239
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:07,218
Scott: if they should have just put it out unedited and given these people the finger.

240
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,950
Scott: Yes That's obviously our stance.

241
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,160
Rym: explain what happened.

242
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:18,087
Rym: I'm even okay with apologizing because it was clearly an accident that there's not a lot of indication that there was any Actual or true malice behind it.

243
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:23,404
Scott: now sure not like our our friends who make the Dutch cartoons Awesome.

244
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,700
Rym: that was also blown way out of proportion.

245
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,272
Scott: I didn't say it wasn't but they were deaf, you know, that's a little different between.

246
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:36,036
Rym: that is but the fact that this was probably an accident and If they just apologize, they should have just continued publishing.

247
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:36,840
Rym: and that bothers me.

248
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,139
Rym: But in case you wondered that's the deal.

249
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:54,115
Rym: But moving on to things that are not nearly so sad things of the day You see how I said that things that aren't so bad things of the day great.

250
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:54,757
Rym: It's poetic.

251
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:55,560
Rym: It's almost prose.

252
00:18:56,501 --> 00:19:00,211
Rym: Anyway, so this is a little old but it really bear.

253
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,876
Rym: if you haven't seen this you need to see it.

254
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,763
Rym: because this I think It's relevant.

255
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:11,839
Rym: one because it's animation - it's remixing which is a very big part of the anime manga culture both in the US and Japan.

256
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,180
Rym: and Three it's very very very well done.

257
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:17,624
Rym: Basically what this is?

258
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:22,015
Rym: there's someone named pogo a quote electro musician who took.

259
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,443
Scott: I'm a fan of the electro musician I am too.

260
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:31,223
Rym: But what he did is he took scenes from the original animated movie Alice in Wonderland and How original was it?

261
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:32,006
Scott: was based on a book?

262
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:37,286
Rym: Well, I don't know if there I worry that there was some knockoff anime or something I don't know about.

263
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,616
Scott: we're talking about the Disney one people.

264
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:43,896
Rym: Yes If you've seen some other Alice in Wonderland that might have merriman out of in pornographic.

265
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,880
Rym: We're not talking about that.

266
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,892
Scott: Yeah, we're not talking about Alice in Looking Glass either.

267
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:52,204
Rym: No different thing Anyway, so Alice in Wonderland He took this.

268
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:57,136
Rym: he took footage from it and remixed it together to make a video.

269
00:19:57,537 --> 00:20:04,960
Rym: then he took Sounds and samples from the movie and made a techno song.

270
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:09,540
Rym: He put them together and made a dual remix.

271
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,084
Scott: Yeah, he took.

272
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:11,585
Scott: he didn't.

273
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,450
Scott: actually it wasn't a mash-up.

274
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,080
Scott: He didn't take materials from two separate things and combine them.

275
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,900
Rym: It was like a man or a mash-out or a mash together.

276
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:25,620
Scott: He took and he wasn't like the phantom edit where he took a movie and just you know edited it.

277
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,660
Scott: You know the audio and the video together removing and scenes or reordering scenes.

278
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,496
Rym: Someday one of my crazy project is still to make a phantom edit of Sailor Moon.

279
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,279
Scott: That's a good one.

280
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:49,040
Scott: What he did is he took the audio From the movie took sampled it created a song then took the video from the movie Sampled it remixed it and made a music video for the song.

281
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,580
Scott: So using the source material of a full-length animated, you know motion picture feature animated film.

282
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,286
Scott: I totally missed that.

283
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,330
Rym: I was fantastic.

284
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,760
Scott: He made an animated music video.

285
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:15,387
Rym: This is super high quality And if nothing else I think that this alone if you have never been convinced by anything else and I guess if you're I don't know what's wrong With you if you're listening to GeekNights while having this sort of opinion This is why we need fair use.

286
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:20,080
Rym: this is why copyright needs to allow for the creative use of other people's works.

287
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:28,558
Scott: Yep, and also watching this, you know I realized wow that Alice in Wonderland movie was really well animated.

288
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:39,147
Rym: actually I didn't realize it, you know earlier in my life kind of randomly out of the blue today I was also watching a YouTube clip from the Aristocats Also super well animated.

289
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,211
Scott: Yeah, that was a good one.

290
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,788
Rym: I actually really really like that movie as a kid, but it's okay Seen it.

291
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:50,398
Rym: in two decades I cannot vouch for how good the Aristocats is but I liked the Aristocats as a kid.

292
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,080
Rym: It was okay.

293
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:53,568
Scott: I'm more of a great mouse detective.

294
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,133
Rym: Oh the great mouse detective.

295
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:57,060
Rym: That's going in the Netflix queue so hard.

296
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,229
Scott: Maybe it's on the road to talk about the Roku.

297
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,352
Rym: We might have to watch it tonight.

298
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,435
Rym: Maybe fuck sleep.

299
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:07,485
Scott: All right, so Check this shit out Somebody.

300
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,560
Scott: someone awesome named otaku king.

301
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:11,966
Scott: He's the king of otaku.

302
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,734
Rym: Otaku king or otaku king?

303
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,060
Scott: Oh right it is otaku king.

304
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:20,040
Rym: Otaku king is like people who say conservativism when they mean conservatism.

305
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:20,722
Scott: That's right.

306
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:26,440
Rym: Otaku king is from something something that if you don't know what it is, you're not old-school, right?

307
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,947
Rym: It's not even that old-school anyway.

308
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:29,730
Scott: Oh, yes.

309
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,175
Scott: He actually is otaku king.

310
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,941
Scott: I'm messing everything up tonight aren't I?

311
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:41,304
Scott: the otaku king from the UK made a Documentary.

312
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:45,892
Scott: could this perhaps be you know a Documentary no video or something.

313
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:49,200
Scott: But no, no, it isn't This guy the otaku.

314
00:22:50,401 --> 00:23:10,751
Scott: he's actually a professional as in that's what he does for his job like video game and Animation translator at adapter person, you know, like he's the guy translating Japanese video games into I guess UK English which is not the same as our English and He's a UK.

315
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:16,620
Scott: I believe you mean Albionic, yeah, actually, I think he's actually from the UK would do whatever.

316
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,460
Scott: Anyway, the point is this dude right is pretty good at the translating and of course being named otaku king.

317
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:29,260
Scott: he's a fan of a nimes and He's pissed off about the state of anime fansubbing.

318
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:43,330
Rym: Before you go out one of those people because you know those people the people who don't even understand any Japanese But we'll watch a fan sub in the whole time Exclaim how bad the translation was or or or.

319
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:52,200
Rym: the people who will watch a dub and then the subtitle track is also on and They based on the subtitle track assume that the dub is wrong, but assume that somehow the subtitles were right.

320
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:59,386
Rym: Yes, the people who prefer one subtitling group over the other because of these minutiae that they don't even understand You know those people right now.

321
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:01,072
Scott: this guy actually knows that he's talking about.

322
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:03,280
Scott: he made a documentary and it's in five parts.

323
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,540
Scott: But it's only in five parts because it's on YouTube and I'm working with him.

324
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:11,005
Scott: Actually, I'll tell you this I'm working with him to try to get him on the show But he says he's a little shy.

325
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:14,439
Scott: so you can email him and encourage him to be on the show.

326
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:21,460
Scott: Also, I'm working with him to try to get like a high-quality version of the documentary That's all in one piece to make it easier to watch it.

327
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:35,293
Scott: You know say conventions and stuff and in this documentary he brings up an issue and he and it's an issue I didn't even realize it was an issue but watching the documentary I've pretty much come over 99% over to his side of things.

328
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:44,583
Scott: and Now that I was watching a fan sub which we're going to talk about on the way to and from work today Oh good.

329
00:24:44,623 --> 00:24:45,506
Rym: God the fan.

330
00:24:45,546 --> 00:24:46,749
Rym: So that was a bad fan.

331
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,066
Scott: So right and you know watching it and Thinking back to this documentary.

332
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,972
Scott: I was like wow, this dude is totally right.

333
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:56,320
Scott: and now I'm really bothered by fan subs.

334
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,780
Scott: It's like you're looking at something bad and you didn't realize it was a bad.

335
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:04,500
Scott: And now this guy in his documentary comes out and points out how bad it is.

336
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:10,023
Scott: And now all you do is see the badness all over the place and you're like, no you're right It is terrible.

337
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:11,668
Scott: These fansubs all suck ass.

338
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:15,260
Rym: Really the only things I disagree with him on are did you watch the whole thing?

339
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:19,060
Rym: I watch a bunch of it I got to watch the rest, but I disagree a tiny bit.

340
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,844
Rym: but I don't.

341
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:30,360
Rym: I realize I don't fully disagree and I can't say that I disagree because While I I see value in a very tiny number of the things he talks about as being bad.

342
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:43,820
Rym: Though that value is only there for I guess advanced anime watchers or people who are kind of very used to watching anime and It really does a disservice to anyone who is not like that to try to watch a fan sub that does that.

343
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:54,240
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like if anything the far far future of translation I could see having Multiple subtitled tracks for people who aren't familiar with versus people who are that sort of stuff.

344
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:09,079
Scott: but maybe so I think that really the one thing I learned from this documentary is that Fansubs being sort of the primary way of new shows being introduced to the fandom in the u.s you know, whereas it used to be sort of after-school television is.

345
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:20,080
Scott: Then the fact that fansubs are done in a terrible way that they're done is Really hurting and making it difficult for new people to get into anime watching anime.

346
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:29,700
Scott: It's making it very hard to be a new anime fan in you know in in respect of pleasing Existing anime fans sort of similar to the way that you know.

347
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:45,900
Scott: You try to read like a Marvel or DC comic book and you can't understand what the fuck is going on because you haven't been reading them for the past five years and you don't know all the history of all these characters and the crazy universe and what's Going on in all the hundred books makes it very hard for new superhero comics fans and you know.

348
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,538
Scott: but at the same time if you tried it to please the new fans you had pissed off the old ones.

349
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:55,679
Scott: and He points this out very well, and I didn't even realize it and I'm all for it.

350
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,740
Scott: And we might be discussing this more in the future.

351
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:01,455
Rym: Oh, we will definitely be having a show or something about this.

352
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,784
Scott: if we don't have if we you know We can't get him on the show.

353
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:07,635
Scott: We might even just have a show, you know discussing it or who knows.

354
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:11,332
Rym: but yeah, so One thing watch the documentary.

355
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:24,720
Rym: one thing that you can always Do to make either something great or something horrible is to take two things that you wouldn't expect to be related together and relate them Together part possibly in a single show or manga or comic book.

356
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:33,796
Rym: For example, you take x-men you take zombies throw them together You get something that is both more and less than the sum of the parts.

357
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,620
Scott: Yeah, man You know, they're coming out with a third Marvel Zombies comic miniseries.

358
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:39,908
Scott: They came over.

359
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:44,008
Scott: they made Marvel so dumb Well in the story with Marvel Zombies, right?

360
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:47,660
Scott: is that they in the ultimate one of the ultimate Marvel comic books, right?

361
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,787
Scott: They had this zombie thing for a little bit.

362
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:51,233
Scott: They're like, oh, this is a zombie universe.

363
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:54,948
Scott: Okay, and then They made Marvel Zombies.

364
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:57,760
Scott: it was a miniseries about two issues of it and it was kind of bleh.

365
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:05,536
Scott: Then they made that sold so well They made Marvel Zombies 2 and apparently that sold well enough for them to make Marvel Zombies 3.

366
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:06,198
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

367
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:11,099
Rym: so anyway What if you took?

368
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,460
Rym: Libraries and mix them with guns, isn't that just read or die?

369
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,240
Rym: Well, that was libraries guns and superpowers.

370
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:22,728
Rym: Okay, so that's a three-way.

371
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:25,480
Rym: this is only a two-way, yeah, so it's not quite the same thing.

372
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,862
Rym: But no tonight we are talking about toshokan senso aka Library war.

373
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:35,172
Scott: Yes, toshokan means libraries, you know that fit that bit.

374
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:36,757
Scott: torrent site Tokyo toshokan.

375
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:37,700
Scott: It means Tokyo library.

376
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,757
Scott: I'm learning Japanese with the GeekNights.

377
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:46,440
Rym: now I don't know how many of you have watched any of this show yet and I'll say straight up that we're not doing a full review.

378
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:47,426
Rym: We're doing.

379
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:51,631
Rym: I'm thinking of kind of renaming because we used to say, you know We have a preview and then a review.

380
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:53,280
Scott: I don't think we should name it at all.

381
00:28:53,341 --> 00:29:00,820
Scott: I think we should just when we talk about the show We should say if there's gonna be spoilers and say how much we've seen and say how much you know.

382
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:06,913
Scott: We should say how much we've seen and how much we're going to discuss because I could have seen a whole show But only discuss the first episode.

383
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:10,616
Rym: so at the same time I feel as though any of you you do that up to a point.

384
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:17,163
Rym: but a Review can only occur when you have seen the entire show and you really can't call something a review before that Because you don't know

385
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:27,360
Scott: but a review isn't you know, unless someone is gonna think unless the show is already all done I mean, what if someone wants to watch the show as it comes out this there is a purpose to sort of discussing a show.

386
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,793
Rym: Yeah, before that is not a review.

387
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:43,280
Rym: and at the same time I really like calling the shows where we fully spoil and tell it till I tell the full on all The shows where we don't really talk about what happens we talk about the why and all the all the things that you don't like.

388
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,477
Rym: You assume that we already watched the show that I definitely like calling that.

389
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:47,060
Rym: final thoughts.

390
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,708
Rym: Oh, yeah, separate thing.

391
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,220
Rym: You don't go into that expecting us to explain the plot.

392
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:54,777
Rym: We assume you know the plot and we talk about how so-and-so totally got shot.

393
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,268
Rym: Mmm I was thinking about calling this the first four.

394
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,437
Scott: maybe that's not bad because but I've watched six.

395
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:03,758
Scott: Oh How many do you watch for?

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,480
Rym: Here's the thing at the RIT Anime Club the thing that worked really well and to this day every anime club.

397
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:12,439
Rym: This is the way to get people into new anime.

398
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:25,420
Rym: Every week we would show the first four episodes of a different show and except for the very first week of anime club We would show four first episodes of four different shows or occasionally three first episodes and one fifth episode.

399
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:27,762
Rym: That's yeah, but anyway I've.

400
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:38,430
Rym: it is I can think of so few times where I have watched the entire first four episodes of an anime and Not been able to figure out if I like the show or not.

401
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:44,718
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty rare that after the I mean Gonzo shows you sort of know that at the end they're gonna go to you.

402
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:45,699
Scott: Yeah, right.

403
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,240
Scott: But other than that, you know where there's a trend that you can sort of target an association with a production studio or director.

404
00:30:53,101 --> 00:31:05,080
Scott: You watch the first four episodes of a show and if you're not hooked on the show by then You sort of know if you're going to watch the show to the end or not And you sort of know what kind of person is gonna watch the show to the end.

405
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:14,120
Rym: I mean the acid test for us way back was when they showed us initial D. We saw four episodes and we thought it was the stupidest goddamn thing ever made.

406
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:14,422
Rym: It was.

407
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,960
Rym: we just made fun of it the whole way through.

408
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:27,734
Rym: we thought it was dumb and then on the way home from club the whole front row crew as it was is walking and someone turns to someone else and says so uh You think he wins the next race and then it had a marathon.

409
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:29,420
Scott: who he sat there through the whole goddamn thing.

410
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,956
Scott: Yeah, and I own the whole thing.

411
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,887
Rym: So Library Wars the plot is Possibly what you might expect.

412
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:43,380
Rym: I would almost say that it's a lot like full metal panic.

413
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,628
Rym: But no, no, no like the.

414
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:52,756
Rym: the aesthetic of the the raw bear Super zoomed out aesthetic reminds me a lot of that show.

415
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:53,700
Rym: Yeah, that's true.

416
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,422
Rym: However, if once you zoom in I hated full metal panic and I really like this show and there's a lot of reasons Why.

417
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,787
Scott: well, here's the thing right.

418
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:10,222
Scott: on the one hand the actual Sort of universe that this story takes place in is preposterous.

419
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:11,867
Scott: it is absolutely.

420
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:17,445
Scott: it is absolutely makes no sense and it's incredibly difficult to suspend my disbelief.

421
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:26,600
Rym: I know you have in 1989 the Japanese government after much pressure from various groups past the media betterment act.

422
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,707
Scott: But they also passed the library act.

423
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:39,860
Rym: Well, the media betterment act was basically the Fahrenheit 451 burn all the books law that there's actually a copy of Fahrenheit 451 in episode 6 spoilers.

424
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:56,478
Rym: So apparently one thing led to another and the intelligent people of the country got together and made sure that an anti MBA military force was founded based on the freedom of the library's law.

425
00:32:56,498 --> 00:33:00,517
Scott: and basically a country made two laws.

426
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:06,892
Scott: and These two laws Basically set up so that there would be two private semi.

427
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:16,840
Scott: Well one public and one semi public military force Fighting against each other within the country of Japan now, which is absolutely crazy.

428
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:18,029
Rym: This was after.

429
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,244
Rym: that was the name of that Incidents.

430
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,112
Scott: Oh the the Hino.

431
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:25,486
Scott: Yes the Hino library incident It always has to be an incident right?

432
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:28,820
Scott: Gundam seed you have the bloody Valentine bloody Valentine.

433
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:34,880
Rym: It was something Valentine, I'm pretty sure is bloody bound the bloody Valentine that was like the bloody eye.

434
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,270
Scott: Anyway, anyway, you know all these animes.

435
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,080
Scott: they always have that incident in the pad Seven y'all as Junius seven, right?

436
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,760
Scott: That was the that was the name of the colony and it's always that same sort of shtick.

437
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,799
Rym: but basically the government busted in with this.

438
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:59,131
Rym: basically a bunch of people who are dressed like M bison go around trying to burn books and meanwhile the Librarians are all armed with a full military.

439
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:01,540
Scott: Yeah, they're not allowed to burn books that the libraries have.

440
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,241
Scott: So the libraries go around buying books and protecting them from the people who are M bison Which

441
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:24,360
Rym: is great because there is a scene where this isn't really a spoiler where something happened outside of a library in some other building and the police are like will handle it and the library corps basically say Hold on a minute and they buy the building declared a library and then bust in with guns.

442
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,860
Scott: Yeah, because they're not allowed to go if it's not a librarian.

443
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:32,300
Scott: The thing about this show right is that on the one hand you've got sort of like this.

444
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:40,230
Scott: The big setup is this whole library war thing, but they don't really go and investigate This whole.

445
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:44,514
Scott: you know Obviously, they want to give a message about.

446
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,300
Scott: you know censorship.

447
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:45,942
Scott: It's the say.

448
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:52,788
Scott: it's the same moral as Fahrenheit 451, but they don't ever actually explore that Moral very much at all.

449
00:34:52,828 --> 00:35:00,660
Scott: They just sort of use it as an excuse for military Set, you know action in a civilian setting now.

450
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:12,198
Rym: That is why one of the reasons why I was originally comparing it to Full Metal Panic because Full Metal Panic was half Alright, let's have military stuff going on in an otherwise totally normal world.

451
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:19,520
Rym: Yep, and The problem with that was that that show tried to be two completely different shows at the same time and as a result neither one.

452
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:27,847
Scott: Now the thing is the thing that saves Toshikata and Senso, right is The characters in the show.

453
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,114
Scott: It's almost like it's a separate show.

454
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,619
Scott: It's like there's a perfectly nor.

455
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:39,248
Scott: It's not like a great show, but it's a perfectly normal above average Anime character drama and this other.

456
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:44,080
Scott: they just happen to use this crazy ludicrous backdrop of library wars behind it.

457
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:50,629
Scott: but the character drama itself is Perfectly fine and it's actually really great.

458
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:56,970
Scott: and I like the characters and I like the way they you know develop and how they work With each other and the situations they get in and the whole thing.

459
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,760
Scott: It's just they happen to put it in ludicrous land.

460
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,388
Rym: But the the cool thing now again, we have.

461
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,973
Rym: we've only seen the first four episodes.

462
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:05,636
Scott: I saw six.

463
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:06,800
Rym: Okay, you saw six.

464
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:14,420
Rym: We have seen on average five episodes But It wasn't that funny.

465
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:20,956
Rym: But we don't know that this might be one of those shows that later on pulls the.

466
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,980
Rym: oh no now We're getting into the plot business.

467
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,900
Scott: The I think is gonna be plot II but I'm pretty confident that that it might go in that direction.

468
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,779
Rym: But I could also see it going in the concentrate on the characters direction or in the very least it seems for now to be going in the.

469
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:41,520
Rym: It is not about the setting is about the characters and the setting is just an excuse to have all this go on.

470
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:46,760
Rym: And as a result, it's very obvious the good guys want to protect books.

471
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:48,586
Rym: They are clearly the good guys.

472
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,533
Rym: the bad guys want to burn books.

473
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,620
Rym: They're all dressed like M bison.

474
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:57,700
Scott: It's a little similar to cowboy bebop in that respect and the cowboy bebop had this world.

475
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:03,600
Scott: That was really just a backdrop for the unrelated character draw slightly related character drama.

476
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:13,380
Scott: You know, even though cowboy bebop setting was less preposterous But perhaps also didn't have a such a built-in moral that was blazingly obvious.

477
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:23,942
Rym: I think preposterous is the right word because we mentioned it earlier But there's kind of the scale where there's cowboy bebop and then you take one step more toward preposterous Arity.

478
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:37,933
Scott: Yeah, basically while I'm watching that is this show while I'm watching Tosha content So I sort of alternate, you know It's like I'll be watching it and suddenly there'll be a scene Where my suspension of disbelief flies right out the window and I'm like, what the fuck.

479
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:41,386
Scott: this is the stupidest most ludicrous bullshit I've ever seen.

480
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,180
Scott: but then I'm like, but you know what?

481
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,524
Scott: I'll sit here for the next 30 seconds until this bullshit is over because then there's gonna be five minutes of the characters that I've grown to like suddenly.

482
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:59,675
Rym: and I really like the characters because again kind of like full metal panic there's like the characters aren't really stereotypical, but they're all really strongly cast and they're not.

483
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:07,320
Rym: they stand out and they're Interesting and I'm interested in all of them and there's kind of the same separation of character roles like full metal panic.

484
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:12,680
Rym: But full metal panic took all those character roles put them all to the extreme and made it dumb as a result.

485
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:13,825
Rym: Yeah, but I got to stop.

486
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:15,432
Rym: I'm just trashing full metal panic.

487
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:16,015
Scott: I know.

488
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:23,540
Scott: the other thing is though Is that some of the episodes the individual episode plots are sort of resolved often by you know?

489
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,860
Scott: Semi-deus ex machina things which are hard to believe but it works because it's early on.

490
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,472
Rym: Yes, a lot of those things I don't think they're really deus ex machina as in.

491
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:39,694
Rym: there's these parallels because the whole point I the real story of the show forget the library wars and all that is.

492
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:41,559
Rym: there's a girl a girl who?

493
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:52,013
Rym: loves books and she is trying to buy a banned book at a bookstore just as these M bison types busted and they take the book from her and she tries to defend it.

494
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,560
Rym: and then a knight in shining armor.

495
00:38:55,262 --> 00:39:06,760
Rym: Well, basically one of these library core people saves her and saves the book and she looks up to this person wants to become like this person so she joins the library car and That's where the show kind of begins.

496
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,944
Rym: So you have these parallels.

497
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,714
Rym: where then this drill sergeant that she works with?

498
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:16,718
Rym: there's the same kind of relationship And then he's a lot like she was when she was young and this idealism playing through and etc.

499
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:16,898
Rym: etc.

500
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,412
Scott: It's that typical anime thing.

501
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:20,920
Scott: where oh, is that drill sergeant?

502
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,392
Scott: Is he the guy who saved her way back in the day?

503
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,343
Scott: or he's a lot like her, you know Cuz he never.

504
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:28,340
Scott: they never showed the guy's face and it's sort of like the horse.

505
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,259
Rym: This is the cycle of how people like this are born.

506
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:36,244
Scott: Yeah, and then they you know, it's like obviously they're supposed to get together But they don't.

507
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:41,924
Scott: and they some other characters in there like, you know, the cool roommate girl and the other Officers.

508
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:46,579
Scott: and then you know, they heard the person who's also on the same team as she is the Tezuka kid.

509
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,920
Scott: If they said Tezuka, I thought they were talking about Tezuka like when they first said his name.

510
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,748
Scott: It's about books, so I thought they were going to save a Tezuka book, but then I was like, oh wait No, this guy's name is Tezuka this new character.

511
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:00,153
Scott: They just introduced two seconds ago.

512
00:40:00,213 --> 00:40:02,220
Rym: Okay, so the main character?

513
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:09,035
Rym: Well, I guess the real the super main character though This is one of those shows where there's kind of a core of mostly main ish characters.

514
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:14,799
Rym: Yeah, definitely Iku I really like her because she's not super stereotypical at all.

515
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,407
Scott: No, she did.

516
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:17,795
Scott: I can't really think of that.

517
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:24,921
Rym: many, you know She reminds me a little bit of Hitomi from Escaflowne in terms of personality a little bit a little bit She's.

518
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:29,616
Scott: she's a little crazier a little more energetic in the in the emotions at least.

519
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:33,789
Rym: She's also tall Athletic strong and kind of full of fights.

520
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,353
Scott: Yeah, she's also.

521
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:37,880
Scott: she's not stupid, but she's a little she you know.

522
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:46,591
Scott: They show her not be performing at peak in the mental tasks as much as the physical tasks Not right away, but what she does have are guts.

523
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:47,877
Scott: She's got plenty of guts.

524
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:48,439
Scott: That's for sure.

525
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:54,163
Scott: alright, so this show is Made by production IG.

526
00:40:54,223 --> 00:41:07,129
Scott: Those are the people who make the ghost in the shell standalone complexes and such and As you would expect the animation is completely awesome and off-the-wall like super on model But they do a lot.

527
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:14,737
Scott: sometimes there's a little like there was one like I Guess and maybe in the later episodes like there's a few parts that are off model like they draw.

528
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:15,560
Scott: they drew her roommate.

529
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:25,294
Scott: I remember in one scene Like they just they drew it in such a way that she was really tall like way taller than she ever was before and I Was like what might not have noticed that was kind of distracted by you didn't?

530
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:26,520
Scott: I don't think you saw that episode?

531
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,744
Rym: I probably didn't.

532
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,740
Scott: there was also another one where like they animated the main character walking like a little weird.

533
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:38,020
Scott: It's like it seems like they got one bad animator on the team and like one scene in 20 will be a little awkward.

534
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:39,188
Rym: You hear that Takashi?

535
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,020
Rym: Yeah, she Tanaka Tanaka.

536
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:43,866
Scott: But otherwise, you know the the.

537
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:57,518
Rym: the graphical quality of this show is you know at production IG standards No, they slip away into kind of super deformed land a lot, but they do it in a in a stylistically More unique way than you usually see.

538
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:58,261
Scott: Yeah It's very.

539
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:05,744
Scott: it's very polished and shiny and the colors are really strong and it's obvious that these people have the animation skills and Technologies and budget.

540
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:06,990
Rym: it's definitely though.

541
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,360
Rym: One thing you'll notice is it's one of those thick lines shows.

542
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,193
Rym: There's a lot of everything's thick and there's thick lines and strong lines everywhere.

543
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:16,379
Rym: And that's that's how I would characterize it.

544
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:23,100
Scott: Yep The music is you know, the opener and closer are pretty much standard j-pop songs.

545
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,071
Scott: They didn't really catch me to catch you.

546
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:26,479
Rym: I didn't even notice him.

547
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,086
Scott: Yeah, they're just j-pop songs.

548
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:31,860
Scott: typical, you know, Sony music is I guess one of these sponsors, you know.

549
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:32,893
Scott: The other sponsor is who?

550
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:35,937
Rym: Pocky.

551
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:37,847
Rym: Oh I was expecting something related to books.

552
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:40,056
Scott: It's actually Glico, but they make Pocky.

553
00:42:40,297 --> 00:42:40,920
Rym: Well, yes, they do.

554
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,132
Scott: Yeah, cuz I was watching it was like, you know, oh, okay.

555
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:44,493
Scott: Thank you.

556
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:45,658
Scott: They must you know.

557
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:54,040
Rym: sponsors Whatever now if you have any doubts as to where the show's loyalties lie I'll point out that the manga is published in Dengeki Daioh.

558
00:42:55,102 --> 00:43:01,440
Scott: That is the same Manga anthology that publishes the Asa manga dial the Otsuba, etc.

559
00:43:02,202 --> 00:43:04,509
Rym: Now it's ongoing as is the anime.

560
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:05,471
Rym: The anime is not done yet.

561
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:10,872
Rym: Yep, so, uh, I don't know I like it and I'm probably going to watch all of it.

562
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:12,560
Scott: Oh, I probably watch over.

563
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,840
Scott: That means better than a lot of other anime seen recently.

564
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:25,620
Scott: It's not some amazing, you know, perfect anime because there is still the absolutely Unbelievable universe that makes absolutely no sense and is really kind of painful at moments.

565
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:40,299
Rym: I will say one thing though The universe works partly because apparently the author of the manga hero Arakawa writes a lot about the SDF and military stuff and she knows what she's doing.

566
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:50,614
Rym: because The action scenes the military action scenes, which are actually a Not too bad Minority most of the show is just the characters hanging out and talking and doing their thing.

567
00:43:51,036 --> 00:43:52,380
Rym: It's not like a super action show.

568
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,900
Rym: It's a. it's a lot of character stuff and then the action kind of comes in and punctuates what the characters were doing.

569
00:43:58,384 --> 00:44:08,080
Rym: yeah, but the action is Very realistic in terms of military tactics and that sort of thing Like there's a lot of subtle like sniper tactics and squad tactics.

570
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:15,902
Rym: They're animated very much more properly than the average anime would animate them far better than those eyes eyes and Jotaro Animates them.

571
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:21,116
Rym: I don't think you can say it's hard to say better because you can't multiply by zero and get anywhere.

572
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:25,960
Rym: I Mean if this show had flat helicopters that come out of nowhere.

573
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:27,649
Scott: It has plenty.

574
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:29,280
Scott: actually the helicopters are really nice in this.

575
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:38,060
Rym: Yeah They are but like all the little details of squad tactics are there and you won't care about this unless you're a military otaku.

576
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,926
Rym: But if you care, it's there.

577
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:43,677
Scott: Yep, but the reason for the tactics is stupid.

578
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,206
Rym: It's not That stupid.

579
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:53,506
Scott: it's not that stupid because it's weird because you have this ludicrous completely off-the-wall Unbelievable premise.

580
00:44:54,168 --> 00:45:01,016
Scott: yet the aesthetic of the premise is awesome And the moral of the premise is sort of obvious Fahrenheit 451 moral.

581
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:03,645
Rym: But it doesn't matter.

582
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:08,060
Rym: obviously you should not let books out that damage you and you should burn anything controversial.

583
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,659
Rym: Of course exactly and bison will help you.

584
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:21,800
Scott: But you can you sort of ignore the you know lack of belief in the premise because you like the aesthetic and the character Drama, and well, there isn't that much of the premise going around.

585
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:38,651
Rym: It's interesting we brought up read or die because if this show takes a step toward preposterity From something like cowboy bebop then of course read or die goes beyond the word preposterous to the point where it's so out there That you have no choice, but to take it completely at face value.

586
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:44,346
Scott: Well, I think the difference is right is that this world presented in Toshikan sense.

587
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:47,680
Scott: Oh is in every other aspect like the real world.

588
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,660
Scott: There's no magic or anything else crazy and people are generally smart and whatnot.

589
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:58,532
Scott: So the fact that this incredibly stupid thing would happen sort of doesn't fit Whereas in read or die is a totally fantastical world.

590
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:00,420
Scott: so they sort of make up their own rules.

591
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,920
Scott: You know it is and they're self consistent.

592
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:13,180
Rym: What I think worked so well it was that read or die was this completely fantastical group of characters and plot Sets in other than all these people a completely normal world.

593
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:16,878
Rym: Everything was normal except all the characters in the show.

594
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:17,340
Rym: It's weird.

595
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:25,205
Scott: It's like when you're doing any sort of story right the sort of like this line you cross to where like you know your fantasy Enough.

596
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:30,819
Scott: well first of all you always have to be self-consistent or else And you know it's always gonna be screwed up no matter how fantasy you are.

597
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:38,700
Scott: But it's like you become fantasy enough that you can do really weird things and have people believe them as long as they're self-consistent.

598
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:50,660
Scott: But if you're not fantasy enough if you're only a tiny bit fantasy and everything else is very much reality Then it becomes hard to accept that little bit of fantasy even if you know it's self-consistent.

599
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,833
Rym: Like DMZ I was about to say it's kind of like DMZ jinx.

600
00:46:55,254 --> 00:47:01,560
Rym: yeah, but the only difference I would say is that I'm able to run with this a lot more easily than I was with DMZ.

601
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:03,219
Rym: I forced myself to go screw it.

602
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,414
Scott: I like actually actually I've run with DMZ a little more easily that I run with this.

603
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:20,039
Rym: well the thing is with with DMZ I think what I was able to do is I just I purposefully decided to not consider Anything, but the actual story of the guy and that was the only way I could get around it.

604
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:28,413
Rym: In this show I kind of I'm going with everything it presents me in the world and As a result every now and then I have the pangs of.

605
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:33,560
Rym: that doesn't make any sense But that's always supplanted by but it's totally fucking awesome.

606
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:42,060
Scott: Yeah, see in DMZ my lack of belief is sort of meta and that when I'm not reading it I think about what DMZ is and I say wow that's really unbelievable.

607
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,920
Scott: What while reading DMZ the lack of believability in the premise doesn't get in my face?

608
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:55,540
Rym: Met the rednecks at the tunnel is when my Ability to run with that setting got shot.

609
00:47:55,722 --> 00:47:56,698
Scott: I don't know it didn't bother me.

610
00:47:57,061 --> 00:48:15,200
Scott: But in Toshikansen, so you know for like a minute or two per episode when the premise gets in my face It kind of is like and I sort of just try to get through it to get on to the part where you know the characters And I can forget about the you know absolutely insane book thing.

611
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:19,220
Rym: But seriously the show is really fun, and it is fun.

612
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,701
Scott: You know what.

613
00:48:20,423 --> 00:48:28,104
Rym: I hate to make a recommendation so open like this, but it's a. if you like anime It's just if you're an anime fan You would care not just.

614
00:48:28,445 --> 00:48:29,831
Rym: oh I like specific anime.

615
00:48:29,852 --> 00:48:31,358
Rym: as you know people like a lot of people like it.

616
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:36,120
Rym: well Everyone likes cowboy bebop, but not everyone likes cowboy bebop is an anime fan.

617
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,999
Rym: They might just be a cowboy bebop fan And then they like this other thing and that other thing like most normal people are.

618
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:44,912
Rym: But if you consider yourself to be an anime fan.

619
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:45,614
Rym: just in general.

620
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,400
Rym: you're the kind of person who goes to anime cons.

621
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,308
Rym: You're the kind of person who does all that.

622
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,060
Rym: you will probably really like this show.

623
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,594
Scott: Yeah, this is this is a very wide appeal show.

624
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:55,580
Scott: it has a lot of stuff.

625
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,838
Scott: You know it can appeal to a wide group of people the military otaku the serious sci-fi people.

626
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:09,499
Scott: a little bit You know the the people looking for the character drama the comedy people a little slice-of-life action Military otaku.

627
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:10,998
Rym: They don't bring it up.

628
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:19,100
Rym: But if you pay attention the uniforms and the badges and the ranks and them and all that stuff is perfectly self referentially consistent.

629
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,153
Scott: Yeah, it's got the shoujo relationship action going on.

630
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,980
Rym: I actually really like the relationships.

631
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:37,767
Scott: I do that actually that's my favorite part of the show just when when someone asks because it's sort of like antenna with the fairy tale But you know backstory yes plus with the but also when someone asks someone out I actually really thought that was funny.

632
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:38,933
Scott: That was it was pretty good.

633
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:40,380
Scott: It came out of nowhere, but it was alright.

634
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:41,522
Rym: It's just.

635
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:42,446
Rym: it's a solid show.

636
00:49:42,486 --> 00:49:43,249
Rym: what more can I say?

637
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:44,694

638
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:52,420
Scott: you want something light if you can Get past and and you you can deal in your mind with the fact that the world makes no sense.

639
00:49:53,103 --> 00:49:55,935
Scott: Then you can watch this show and you'll probably enjoy.

640
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,249
