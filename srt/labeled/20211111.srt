1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,928
Rym: It's Thursday, November 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,169
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:13,800
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,387
Rym: And this is GeekNights Night.

5
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:17,740
Rym: We are talking about the Alien franchise.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,998
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:32,540
Rym: So, uh, I've been biking to work still because it's been like unseasonably warm and beautiful in New York for the last week, like 60s and sunny every day, like I'm eating lunch in the park.

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,280
Rym: So, uh, I noticed something.

9
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,166
Rym: For once, nothing weird happened.

10
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:40,340
Rym: I didn't get to see, uh, a divine comedy, like Two Stooges.

11
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,208
Rym: I didn't get to see a crazy guy.

12
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,480
Rym: I didn't have anyone threaten me over a city bike.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
Rym: Nothing happened, but I noticed something previously in the morning.

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,260
Rym: It's really hard to get a city bike because everyone's biking.

15
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:55,460
Rym: And then in the evening, it's also really hard to get a city bike because everyone's biking.

16
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:59,659
Rym: It got cold and that did not change at all.

17
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,880
Scott: But now we've talked about this and the studies about it.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,760
Scott: This is an old, boring topic.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,939
Rym: Yeah, so there's one more factor.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:21,020
Rym: Today and yesterday, there were no city bikes in the morning and an infinite array of city bikes in the evening, despite the fact that it was warmer and nicer in the evening than it was in the morning.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,760
Scott: The only difference- Did the city bike valets come and fill it up?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,202
Rym: Nope.

23
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:25,959
Rym: There is one difference that I've seen.

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,080
Rym: I also saw a lot fewer people biking on the way home than I saw biking to work.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,420
Scott: Was there something going on after work people were doing?

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:41,340
Rym: So before we shifted away from Daylight Saving Time, it was light out when I biked to work and it was light out still when I started biking home from work.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,656
Rym: Now it's light out-.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
Scott: Do you think the dark is the scaring people?

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,560
Rym: I think the dark is the primary factor because when I biked to work today and yesterday, tons of people biking.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,620
Rym: City bikes are hard to get.

31
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,100
Rym: On the way home, hardly anyone's biking.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,499
Rym: The only difference is it is dark when I walk out of the office.

33
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,280
Scott: I guess it's possible that people are scared of the dark.

34
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:12,199
Scott: All the city bike data is public, so you could look and see the rate of rides based on- You could line up the calendar- Every day that I've biked- Here's my anecdote.

35
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:19,320
Rym: Every day that I've biked home before Daylight- Before we went away from Daylight Saving Time, it was high to walk many blocks.

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,040
Rym: Many of the stations were empty and there were no e-bikes within a mile radius of me.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,160
Rym: Now, when I walked out, not only was every dock completely full, but there were like 10 e-bikes just sitting there that no one was even using.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:41,140
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying if you looked at the data, it's like their city bike, they might be filling up those docks or something while you're in the office, and it might have just been a coincidence that they started doing it when it got dark, you know?

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,580
Rym: It's possible, but the correlation was so strong that we'll just see if it continues.

40
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:46,300
Rym: I don't know, that's all I got.

41
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:49,479
Rym: That was literally the most exciting thing that happened to me in two days.

42
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:53,400
Scott: So, you know, I'm only biking inside these days, mostly.

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,520
Rym: It's too cold.

44
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,520
Rym: It was like almost 70 the other day, it was beautiful.

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,517
Scott: That's cold.

46
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,420
Rym: I biked home in a t-shirt today.

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:20,020
Scott: I was biking inside this morning, and I'm trying to do, in Zwift, which is like the VR bike MMO, there's basically all these different places you can go, and there's different routes, and I'm trying to complete all the routes that are in the game.

48
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:33,358
Scott: And I've done the vast majority of them, but there are a few that are like ultra long, ultra big hills, and I've only done a few of those, like maybe three, like the French mountain and the other one.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, when I'm biking in the morning, it's like a wake-up bike shower, so there's not too many that are short enough that I can finish them before I have to do stuff, right?

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:04:04,559
Scott: So this is one that I basically always do when there isn't one available that it's completable that I haven't completed before, and it's just like hilly route, and it's like you bike this one big hill, and then you sort of go do do do do, and if you're fast enough, I'll do the hill again.

51
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:04,840
Scott: I

52
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:19,579
Rym: mean, before COVID, when I would use the exercise bike in the building, usually what I do is I just tell, I pick this one setting that would randomly generate hills of varying sizes, and I just told it how long I had to bike, and it would just give me a random route every time.

53
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,310
Scott: Well, this is like a virtual place, right?

54
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,016
Scott: It's the same road every time.

55
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:33,846
Scott: It's not random, but by doing that same one occasionally, frequently, I can measure against myself, right, in the same spot, right?

56
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:48,940
Scott: So, you know, that hill that's at the beginning of the loop on the hilly route, it has a separate timing just for that hill, so you'll pass this little gate, and it'll start the clock, and then when you get to the top of the hill, it ends the clock.

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,840
Scott: So usually, just chilling, not trying hard, it'll take me four to five minutes to get up the hill.

58
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:56,899
Rym: Ooh, did you try hard?

59
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:00,540
Scott: And I was like, you know, I didn't huff and puff, right?

60
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,609
Scott: I huffed only.

61
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,919
Scott: I'm like, you know what, let's just see.

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,558
Scott: You know, I got nothing else to do today, right?

63
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:13,413
Scott: So, it was only on that portion, right?

64
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:14,840
Scott: So what, for three, four minutes?

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,003
Scott: And so, it turned out.

66
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:25,034
Scott: I got by basically, you know, to go up the hill, it's not a long hill, it's just steep and short, and it has like two phases.

67
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,580
Scott: Like, you go up and it's kind of steep.

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,945
Rym: I will say, when I'm biking in the real world, I prefer steep and short over the same climb, but longer.

69
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:34,658
Rym: Like, give me the steepest hill and get it out of the way.

70
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:36,603
Scott: Eh, whatever.

71
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:43,086
Scott: But it's a tiny plateau, like a second long, and then there's an even steeper part, and that's right.

72
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:50,795
Scott: So, I'm like, you know what, here's what I'll do, is I basically just won't normally, I'd go to the low gear and go doo-doo-doo-doo, right?

73
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,905
Scott: Just, you know, week-a-week-a all the way up.

74
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,361
Scott: I was like, you know what, we're just gonna not use the low gear, right?

75
00:05:56,381 --> 00:06:00,420
Scott: We're just gonna keep going like it's flat until we get to the top.

76
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:01,945
Rym: That is what I do.

77
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:08,607
Rym: I try to keep my cadence the same and do the highest gear I can and just, my goal is to not slow down on uphills ever.

78
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:10,332
Scott: Uh, okay.

79
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,540
Scott: Anyway, so, I got up the hill.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,259
Scott: It took instead of four to five minutes, it took about three minutes and change.

81
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,344
Scott: So, I saved like a whole minute.

82
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:17,886
Rym: Not bad.

83
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:22,803
Scott: But that's like a 25% improvement, which is significant, right?

84
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:27,979
Scott: Because you really get diminishing returns, you know, biking, right?

85
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,548
Scott: Over something so small, right?

86
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,497
Scott: It's like if you think about a long race, right?

87
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:40,200
Scott: Like a day-long Tour de France stage, a pro is going to finish hours and hours and hours before I will, right?

88
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:50,388
Scott: But if it's like, if it's one hill, it's like the pro is going to finish, you know, maybe a minute or two before me, right?

89
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,293
Scott: But that's still very significant.

90
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:56,745
Scott: So, uh, what happened though is I was huffing, right?

91
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:01,020
Scott: My body decided to evict like all the phlegm and mucus in my lung.

92
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:02,822
Rym: That's good.

93
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,286
Rym: I guess.

94
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:05,309
Rym: That happens.

95
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,493
Rym: So, it's not uncommon.

96
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:07,476
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:09,683
Scott: I think it's also, it's also getting kind of dry.

98
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:10,948
Scott: I got to get, oh, it's dry.

99
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,253
Rym: And also like everyone, like my allergies got like my allergies act up around this time of year, every year.

100
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:19,549
Rym: They're doing it more this year than they've ever done in like recent history.

101
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,839
Rym: And all my coworkers are sneezing like the same way.

102
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,384
Scott: No, I'm not sneezing.

103
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:32,592
Scott: It's just because I huffed when I took the shower right after, I just kept coughing up phlegm like constantly all over the place.

104
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,280
Scott: And I coughed up so much.

105
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,510
Scott: I don't even know where the hell, where did it come from?

106
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:45,722
Rym: If that my body is full of that much because you don't really do winter sports because you'll basically, your lungs will generate a lot more mucus.

107
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:53,494
Rym: It'll come out in like cold weather for a lot of reasons, but, uh, your lungs can hold a terrifying amount of mucus and they're constantly making it.

108
00:07:54,016 --> 00:08:00,981
Scott: I wish there was some way to like, you know, I don't like to boggle and I don't, not like you, uh, there was some point of order.

109
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,726
Rym: I do not enjoy boggling.

110
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:07,622
Rym: It is simply that that is my body's like first response mechanism to any trouble.

111
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:08,564
Scott: Right.

112
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:17,976
Scott: So, uh, I wish that I do wish there was some way, because right now it's like the only way to get the mucus out of the lung is like coughing and coughing sucks.

113
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,030
Scott: If there was some way to like mucus boggle, just like squeeze it out all at once.

114
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,378
Scott: Just like blorp.

115
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,963
Rym: The problem is it keeps making it.

116
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:28,792
Scott: It can't make it that fast.

117
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,280
Rym: It can make it way faster than you realize.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,623
Scott: That's too fast.

119
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:33,847
Rym: You know what that mucus is doing?

120
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,131
Rym: It slowly moves up with your little cilia in your lungs, collecting garbage quickly.

121
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,316
Scott: It didn't move up slowly.

122
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:41,120
Scott: It moved up quickly.

123
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,070
Rym: If it didn't move, it's not that it moved up quickly.

124
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,466
Rym: It's that you generated more than normal and then you had to expel it most likely.

125
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:54,153
Scott: Anyway, uh, so the point is I was in the shower and I was coughing so much in the shower that I slightly damaged my throat.

126
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:54,514
Scott: It hurts.

127
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:54,916
Rym: Yep.

128
00:08:55,418 --> 00:09:01,860
Rym: Uh, the other, the other thing that can cause that is because you rarely huff and or puff to a significant degree.

129
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:14,240
Rym: So if you don't push hard with cardiovascular exercise a lot, then when you do push, you'll generally make more mucus and have more troubles like that because your body kind of reacts to it.

130
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:21,168
Rym: If you huff and puff all the time, your body will get to the point to where you won't have any problem like that under any amount of exertion.

131
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:22,855
Scott: Eh, we're not doing that.

132
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,562
Scott: Yeah, but that's the option.

133
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:31,269
Rym: Just like if you don't want to shave, you could do, uh, like laser, like remove the hairs, like do some sort of, uh, medical procedure.

134
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:36,757
Rym: You can do the same thing with your lungs by just huffing and puffing all the time and then you'll never have to cuffle them up again.

135
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,179
Scott: The point is I just wish, you know, like I could just expel all the mucus and feel nice and clear.

136
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,557
Rym: See, this is how all the fake medicine gets a lot of people because they don't know.

137
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:51,858
Rym: Like imagine if you didn't know and someone said, Hey, your body makes a lot of mucus toxins.

138
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,968
Rym: Imagine if you can, I can give you a thing that like spell all that crap.

139
00:09:56,574 --> 00:10:02,080
Rym: I mean, you know, if there was such a thing, yeah, but the problem is there isn't, but it's really easy to feel like there should be.

140
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:13,258
Scott: So a little bit, I mean, I guess there is, is like you go to a doctor who put like a vacuum tube down your lung and somehow suck it out without collapsing your lung.

141
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:13,620
Scott: I don't know.

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,951
Rym: There are, that's, uh, there aren't really things like that.

143
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:18,660
Scott: That seems like a bad idea.

144
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:36,340
Rym: So, uh, there's a bunch of random news we can talk about, but one thing I want to talk about briefly, not on tech news day, but today is that YouTube is, uh, removing the dislike counts on videos, but they're not removing the dislike button because they still want that feedback.

145
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:40,939
Rym: And I have actually very mixed feelings about this in terms of how it'll impact people.

146
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,695
Rym: Because on one hand, I don't, uh, so I said there's one use case.

147
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:45,980
Rym: I've seen that's been very helpful.

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,586
Rym: One use case with a bad problem with dislikes is that if a Nazi uploads a video, like, yeah, a lot of good people will dislike it.

149
00:10:53,646 --> 00:11:03,281
Rym: It'll have a huge ratio of dislikes to likes, but also when good people upload things, bad people will brigade them with dislikes just to try to drag their video down.

150
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:17,685
Rym: But the other place I see dislikes commonly are pseudoscience, woo videos, fake information, bad and wrong tutorials, where they have a lot of dislikes and then the comments show people are saying this tutorial is wrong.

151
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:20,598
Rym: This information is absolutely objectively incorrect.

152
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:21,461
Rym: This video is bad.

153
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:30,899
Rym: And without that feedback, that's actually how I very quickly determine if a tutorial is worth watching or not is if it has a lot of dislikes, I'm very skeptical of it.

154
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,700
Scott: I hadn't thought of that because I don't, I basically don't look at the dislikes ever.

155
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:47,746
Scott: The only time I look at the dislikes is occasionally I'll see a comment that's like, you know, whoever the one person who disliked this is like, oh, you see a video that's like on a very good video.

156
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:50,718
Rym: That's like cute buddies jumping in the, in the forest.

157
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:53,268
Rym: And you see like 10 million likes for dislikes.

158
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,855
Rym: And you're like, who are those four people?

159
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,521
Rym: The fuck is wrong with you?

160
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,332
Scott: I almost never click the dislike button.

161
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,096
Scott: Like very rarely.

162
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:02,838
Scott: I forget it.

163
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,199
Scott: Basically.

164
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,005
Scott: I basically forget it even exists.

165
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:21,698
Scott: Um, the only time I use the dislike button is if I watch like a video and I'm like trying to learn some information and the information is wrong or the person it's either wrong or usually it's just the format of the video is just so long.

166
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,343
Rym: That's what I use it for.

167
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:29,545
Rym: If I find a tutorial or something, mostly nonfiction stuff, and it ends up being YouTube shouty manner wrong.

168
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,493
Rym: I use the dislike button immediately.

169
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:32,316
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:34,384
Scott: The other thing is the like button.

171
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:37,435
Scott: I don't even use the like button for liking things.

172
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:40,005
Rym: I use it to remember things to remember what I use it.

173
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:40,788
Scott: because right.

174
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,409
Scott: Because on YouTube, there's a page you can go to that says, here are the videos that you've liked.

175
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,112
Rym: Oh my God.

176
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,202
Rym: You ought to know where all my things of the day are.

177
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:48,905
Rym: You want to know like.

178
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:49,768
Rym: that is my fee.

179
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,351
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:53,182
Scott: That's my number one thing in the day place is like video.

181
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:53,825
Scott: I liked it.

182
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:59,404
Scott: So I'm using it to save the video for later, but I don't want to add it to a playlist.

183
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,552
Scott: Like the read late, the watch later.

184
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,278
Scott: That's stuff I watch later, right?

185
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,049
Scott: It's not stuff that I, you know, this is stuff I have.

186
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,652
Rym: That's a good point.

187
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,207
Rym: I use the like YouTube thing the same way I use Twitter likes.

188
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:15,189
Rym: I want to remember the tweet existed in my own feed because there's no fucking ways to have bookmark instead of like.

189
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:18,483
Scott: they changed it to like, I just kept using it like it was bookmark.

190
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:18,985
Rym: Yep.

191
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,831
Rym: I use like, like it's bookmark.

192
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:31,513
Scott: And I even, I even have things that are set up to where if I like a video on YouTube or favorite a tweet or anything like that, it automatically gets saved to my pinboard.in.

193
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,537
Scott: So that's where I actually collect.

194
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:33,622
Scott: everything is in one place.

195
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:36,033
Rym: So I saw some chatter about the like dislike thing.

196
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:36,897
Rym: that was fascinating.

197
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:44,609
Rym: So, because this is why I have a mixed opinion of this because, you know, the tutorial use case, I literally this morning I disliked a video I was watching at work.

198
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:50,871
Rym: I found some like Kubernetes video talking about a way to use Kubernetes and it was just like bad wrong crap.

199
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,496
Rym: So I was like, nope, dislike.

200
00:13:53,138 --> 00:14:05,078
Rym: But I saw a conversation of a bunch of creators like YouTube people, like small time YouTubers, and they were reacting to this saying, yeah, we don't really get brigaded with dislikes.

201
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,844
Rym: Like that's actually rarely a problem.

202
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:16,272
Rym: It seemed like the thing that the problem we have is that people attack us in the comments and send messages to us and harass us.

203
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,950
Rym: Someone disliking our video actually does not impact us in a material way.

204
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,102
Scott: The only way even looking at the dislike, you know, exactly like.

205
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:29,462
Rym: the only reason dislikes matter to them is because that can drag them down in the algorithms.

206
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:32,073
Rym: And YouTube is going to still use the dislike information.

207
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,088
Rym: So all the negative outcomes of the dislikes will still affect small creators.

208
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,849
Rym: But now they lose that data point and they lose that feedback when they watch other videos.

209
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:52,606
Rym: But one smart person in that long thread with like 10 people talking in it, they pointed out that the people who are complaining the most about the dislike counts are brands.

210
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,145
Rym: Big companies and brands are the people who are the maddest about dislikes showing up.

211
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:06,480
Rym: Notice how like Square Enix and Nintendo disable like and dislike counts all the time because they don't want people to see how many people dislike their ad videos.

212
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:08,184
Scott: Mm hmm.

213
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,048
Scott: That's a good point.

214
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,410
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,780
Rym: But it's anecdotes like that's just some smart person.

216
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:22,260
Rym: And while that feel I feel like that's true, I don't have any evidence to back that up, but I just looked at a whole bunch of YouTube accounts and yeah, almost every brand has hidden the like and dislike counts on all the videos.

217
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:29,802
Scott: I mean, you know, I'm more and more, you know, I'm basically just, you know, personally, right?

218
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:37,390
Scott: It's like I can't do too much to affect how all these different networks run their algorithms and their likes and dislikes and all that stuff.

219
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:43,328
Scott: But what you can do is I could just control what I go, what I use and how I use it.

220
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:50,028
Scott: So it's like, I don't really have any feeds that are algorithm controlled, right?

221
00:15:50,048 --> 00:16:01,452
Rym: The only one I have, the only one is I will occasionally, if I'm just sitting on the couch, like before we watch a movie, I open YouTube and it shows me it's algorithmically curated selection, mostly things I subscribe to,

222
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:05,369
Scott: but also things I go to my subscribe page, I don't go to the homepage.

223
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,482
Rym: I do both with YouTube, but that's the only place I do it with.

224
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:17,954
Scott: Well, you know, it's like, even on Twitter, it's like I'm getting, I'm basically decided I'm not looking at retweets, at least naked retweets.

225
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,202
Rym: I really, really like naked retweets.

226
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,189
Scott: I just filter them all out now.

227
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:26,321
Rym: But I only follow people who tweet and retweet only good stuff.

228
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:45,200
Scott: There were some people who retweeted good stuff, but you know, when I put the feeds side by side, you know, the no retweet and the retweet one, the no retweet one is like, oh, it's only content actually created by the people that I'm following directly and nothing else based on.

229
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,249
Scott: basically nothing else is occasional quote.

230
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,100
Rym: I will say that retweets are how I wanted.

231
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,025
Rym: This is, retweets are the primary way I find interesting people and art that I was not following that I want to now follow.

232
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:02,806
Scott: If there was some, but that's the thing is finding more stuff that I didn't know about.

233
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,615
Scott: that was a problem in the olden days.

234
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:08,968
Rym: Well, now there is a ton of stuff, but I can say I found a lot of there is.

235
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,695
Scott: no, I don't need more stuff.

236
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:11,660
Scott: I have too much stuff.

237
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,511
Scott: If I, if I had a shortage of stuff, I agree.

238
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:14,771
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,319
Scott: I turned that shit right back on.

240
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:16,640
Scott: Right.

241
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,309
Scott: But it's like, I have so much stuff now.

242
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:23,626
Scott: It's like, even if there's more stuff, I, I, I'm already, my hands are full, right?

243
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,335
Scott: It's like, I don't need more discovery.

244
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,019
Scott: I need anti.

245
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,310
Scott: I need to clean less anti discovery.

246
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,605
Rym: I heavily curate who I follow though, which does significantly cut down on that being a problem.

247
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:38,144
Scott: I cut down like followers by like a very large percentage on pretty much everything.

248
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:45,832
Scott: And also, uh, I wanted people to know this, you know, you might not use Instagram at all because it's owned by Facebook and that's very valid.

249
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:52,979
Scott: Um, and Instagram itself has become a bad, real bad, just even if you, even if it wasn't owned by Facebook, right?

250
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,844
Scott: What is now is not great.

251
00:17:55,145 --> 00:18:04,829
Scott: But if you go to Instagram in your desktop web browser and Microsoft windows, it is a completely different experience.

252
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,068
Scott: It's like, it's like Instagram from, you know, 10 years ago, there's no ads.

253
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:11,593
Scott: There's none of that bullshit.

254
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,258
Scott: There's no algorithm.

255
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:24,933
Scott: It's showing you Instagram posts from people you follow in reverse chronological order is like, it's, it's like you think, Oh, is it?

256
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,517
Scott: Cause they haven't updated it in forever.

257
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,262
Scott: And most of the users are mobile anyway.

258
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:31,192
Scott: It's like, yes, but they actually just added.

259
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:41,144
Scott: finally after how many years, the ability to post to Instagram from the desktop website, something that hasn't existed until as recently as like this month.

260
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:52,316
Scott: So, uh, I could actually Instagram, if you stick to desktop web version is one of the better social networks that exists.

261
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,961
Rym: The listener pointed out something else.

262
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:59,036
Rym: The most disliked video in the history of YouTube is YouTube's own 2018 YouTube rewind.

263
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:01,783
Scott: That's true.

264
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:02,687
Scott: I remember.

265
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:03,310
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,856
Scott: They can't, they canceled YouTube rewind.

267
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:05,660
Scott: cause it, it sucks.

268
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,084
Rym: Well, cause people disliked it.

269
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:07,185
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:18,310
Rym: But the last thing I'll say is this does remove, uh, I'll just link to this tweet quote, YouTube is removing dislikes and now's your last chance to see the greatest example of camaraderie on the platform.

271
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,886
Rym: It's the video from Futurama of the, uh, the neutrals responding.

272
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:29,026
Rym: And it to this day still has the same number of likes and dislikes 548,000 something.

273
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:34,946
Rym: And that number has been extremely stable for the entirety of this video's history since 2009.

274
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:35,106
Rym: Yeah.

275
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:44,494
Scott: If I made, if I were to make a social network or any kind of, you know, content user content publishing site of any kind, right.

276
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:59,745
Scott: Uh, I would absolutely, if I had features such, you know, I might have features like save for later, like, et cetera, those features would solely be for the purposes of individual users, you know, uh, collating their own collections and lists.

277
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:04,841
Scott: Uh, and there would not be any display of any numbers or any metrics to anyone.

278
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:12,185
Scott: unless a creator wanted to see their numbers that I might let them see them like in their creator dashboard.

279
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:17,150
Rym: I would definitely want to see my numbers or I wouldn't bother using a platform because I have no idea if anyone was watching anything.

280
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:18,276
Scott: Who cares?

281
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,207
Scott: You're creating it for the sake of creating it.

282
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:20,730
Scott: You'll get it.

283
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:22,461
Rym: If I was doing that, I wouldn't even publish it though.

284
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:23,285
Scott: Yeah.

285
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,595
Scott: It's because you're an egotistical kind of jerk like that.

286
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:25,796
Scott: Right.

287
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,243
Scott: I'm happy to create and I don't care.

288
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,489
Scott: if any, I don't, if no one sees it, what's the point about if, if I'm only creating it because for other people, right.

289
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:35,937
Rym: I'm only creating it for me.

290
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:37,785
Rym: I wouldn't even bother uploading it anywhere.

291
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,039
Scott: Van Gogh wasn't like, Oh, I'm not going to paint these sunflowers.

292
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,407
Scott: I don't know how many people are looking at him.

293
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:42,970
Scott: Right.

294
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,217
Scott: It wasn't like counting.

295
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,106
Scott: He wasn't counting people entering, you know, the gallery for you.

296
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,008
Scott: Did he sell those paintings?

297
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:53,365
Scott: He also killed, he also killed them.

298
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:53,727
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:54,974
Rym: But I'm just, I'm just asking you a question.

300
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,120
Rym: Did he sell those paintings?

301
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:57,883
Rym: Some of them.

302
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:03,160
Rym: Did he sell paintings for money in order to like, as a job, like?

303
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,725
Rym: that's a question I'm just asking you.

304
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,576
Scott: You get the idea though.

305
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:18,843
Rym: But actually, so an idea I've always had along those lines is I think there is a very narrow use case for semi algorithmically curated content.

306
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:22,495
Rym: The real problem is it's across all the users of the platform.

307
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,265
Rym: What if, imagine, I'll just make up an example.

308
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:43,956
Rym: What if there was a YouTube where you could use likes and dislikes, there's algorithmically curated feed as an option, not the default, but like it defaulted to your feed and you could click like, I want to see the algo feed, but that feed was only informed by your interaction with the platform and the interaction of people.

309
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:47,087
Rym: you've specifically said, I like the same things that person likes.

310
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:54,120
Rym: So like you and your friends have a locally semi-curated feed of your collective likes and interests?

311
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,409
Scott: I think a better idea than that is to simply, you know, a lot of the problem of the algorithms is their opaqueness, right?

312
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:03,300
Scott: It's like, even if you add features like that.

313
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:08,348
Rym: If I could click on a YouTube video and it was like, here's the data that led us to think you'd like this video.

314
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,239
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, no.

315
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:10,179
Rym: That would be fascinating.

316
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:20,880
Scott: No, what I think you need to do is don't have some sort of machine learning algorithm that you might not even know fully as the creator of the algorithm, how it chose things.

317
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,550
Scott: You might have a general idea, but not a specific idea.

318
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:25,257
Scott: give instead, right?

319
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Scott: Make the default as everything you follow in reverse chronological order, and then just give the user direct if they really care, right?

320
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,719
Scott: That's a power user tool only pretty much because normal people aren't going to use it.

321
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,549
Scott: Be like, you really want a fancy feed?

322
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:44,020
Scott: Okay, here you can type in rules, right?

323
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,454
Scott: Program your own personal algorithm.

324
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,400
Scott: Go right ahead, right?

325
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,957
Scott: You know, some point system, go nuts, whatever you want to do, right?

326
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,927
Scott: You can make your own algorithm.

327
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:58,719
Scott: You'll know how it works and you'll be able to, you know, choose how automatic recommendations come to you on your own.

328
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,998
Scott: And everyone can customize their own algorithm or even share algorithms with each other, right?

329
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,373
Scott: We're not going to tell you how to find new stuff.

330
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:07,700
Scott: You tell you how to find new stuff.

331
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,392
Rym: One problem is that most people, the way they want to consume media is they want something to tell them what to watch.

332
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:16,300
Rym: Like it or not, that's how people are.

333
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,398
Scott: So don't do that.

334
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,979
Rym: So don't give the people what they want and they're trying to have the money to do.

335
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,524
Scott: That's right.

336
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,020
Scott: Make it, you know, old school only.

337
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:37,723
Rym: But I think more the idea that platforms like online communities were better when they were still public and open and big, but they were also more local and had their local cultures.

338
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,871
Rym: Like, you know, Lotax died recently.

339
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,257
Rym: Shitty dude.

340
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:42,180
Rym: A lot of complication.

341
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Rym: I'm not, I don't want to get into him, but something awful is a place, good or bad.

342
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:54,860
Rym: It was its own culture and community distinct from like Fark, distinct from like Slashdot, distinct from all these different places on the Internet.

343
00:23:55,382 --> 00:23:58,080
Rym: There are very few places on the Internet anymore.

344
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,106
Rym: Everything is everything.

345
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:03,799
Rym: And that is where you see a lot of the social friction that we see today.

346
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:05,763
Rym: Right.

347
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:09,440
Scott: You are seeing that trend is, you know, things like discords and slacks and whatnot.

348
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:21,408
Rym: You know, I mean, we've we've I've retreated back away from public Internet other than like Twitter and like content we're making right now and publishing out to mostly conversing in a series of semi-private discords.

349
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:22,853
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:29,239
Scott: People are, you know, retreating into, you know, closed, you know, group even, you know, subreddits are the same thing.

351
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,024
Scott: Yeah.

352
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,720
Rym: So got any news?

353
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,442
Scott: Yeah, we got.

354
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:35,848
Scott: so I got a combo news here.

355
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:36,149
Scott: Sorry.

356
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:36,873
Scott: News one.

357
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:42,960
Scott: So the Valve Steam Deck, which I'm still don't give a shit about, but people seem to be giving a shit about it.

358
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,028
Scott: And it does seem like it has some potential.

359
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:50,399
Rym: I did see a bunch of chatter on Twitter of, well, if I can't get it by Christmas, I don't want it at all.

360
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,163
Scott: OK, sure, whatever.

361
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:57,844
Scott: But they're delaying it till 2022 because the economy has supply chains.

362
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:58,929
Rym: I did.

363
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:01,500
Rym: I can't imagine the person who did not expect that to happen.

364
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,827
Scott: I mean, I don't even know.

365
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,458
Scott: I don't even know they had a release date to begin with.

366
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:10,026
Scott: So the fact that it was like they had a date for it, I assumed 2022.

367
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:15,964
Rym: Then I saw the news delayed and I was like, what?

368
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:17,189
Rym: Delayed till when?

369
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:17,872
Rym: And said 2022.

370
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:18,816
Rym: And I was like, what?

371
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,890
Scott: I don't know what the I didn't even know it was had an original date.

372
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,487
Scott: So something I did know about the playdate, the little yellow handheld console.

373
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:38,965
Scott: So what happened to them was not necessarily a supply chain issue or kind of maybe, but they got a shipment, a whole big box full of play dates right from across the ocean.

374
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:39,668
Scott: It came in.

375
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:43,705
Scott: They were tested them to see if they were going to send them out to customers.

376
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:43,966
Scott: Right.

377
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:52,680
Scott: And they found that the batteries in them were really shitty, like really shitty, even though they had tested and chosen this specific battery.

378
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,435
Scott: And it worked so well, you know, in testing originally.

379
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,342
Scott: So they went, they gave it the go ahead.

380
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,790
Scott: And then, of course, when it actually arrives, ship battery.

381
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:08,474
Scott: So they ended up having to do is send them all back across the ocean.

382
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,401
Scott: So thankfully they didn't send them to customers yet.

383
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:11,749
Scott: Otherwise this would have been way worse.

384
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:14,201
Rym: And it wasn't just, they perform worse than they expected.

385
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:17,651
Rym: A huge percentage of them literally did not work.

386
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:18,474
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,503
Scott: So they sent all of them back across the ocean.

388
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:23,872
Scott: They bought new batteries from somewhere else.

389
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:28,572
Scott: And now the people on the factory and the other side of the world are going to swap all the batteries.

390
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:32,006
Rym: It looks like the factories in Malaysia for this particular product.

391
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:32,788
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,140
Scott: So, and then it's going to come back across again.

393
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:40,271
Scott: So, you know, here similar issue, right?

394
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:41,114
Scott: It's being delayed.

395
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:46,209
Scott: Uh, you know, another handheld computer device is gaming devices delayed.

396
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,373
Scott: So similarity there.

397
00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:54,094
Scott: Uh, but here I want to point out, you know, just the risk of doing any business venture, right?

398
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:58,527
Scott: Just even if you do everything right, shit can go wrong.

399
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:05,628
Scott: And if you're not enormous, like say Apple absorbing risk, it becomes very difficult, right?

400
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:14,605
Rym: I took a lot of at my last job, I ended up taking a lot of classes and getting certifications around corporate risk management to be able to decide how much risk can we assume, but not like.

401
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,032
Rym: they're lucky to have survived.

402
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,861
Scott: They're lucky to have survived this, right?

403
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:27,484
Rym: This would have just like, it could have just ended play date, but like, let's assume that they have a good contract and they can fuck over the people who gave them the bad batteries and get all their money back.

404
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,832
Rym: They're not going to get that money back.

405
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:37,959
Rym: Now they need to have money to solve the problem now because that litigation might take a long time and might fail.

406
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:42,239
Rym: They might lose like the place they got the first batteries from might just say, well, we're bankrupt.

407
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:42,520
Rym: Sorry.

408
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,362
Rym: And disappear.

409
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:45,047
Scott: Okay.

410
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,292
Scott: And so, uh, the final news, right?

411
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:53,026
Scott: We already know inflation's a big deal lately, right?

412
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,392
Scott: Uh, and it turns out the report just came out.

413
00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:03,311
Scott: The consumer price index rose 6.2% in October, which is the largest increase since 1990 when I was eight.

414
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:22,513
Rym: So inflation's kind of skyrocketing for a bunch of reasons, but I think the real, the fundamental reason in my, this is not the opinion of my employer, nor is this financial or investment advice, but it is my personal opinion as a professional in capital markets.

415
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:26,385
Rym: This is a symptom of a dire state in late capitalism.

416
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:27,369
Scott: Yep.

417
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,381
Scott: I mean, you basically have all these factors all at once, right?

418
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:30,823
Scott: It's not.

419
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:33,938
Scott: usually people think of inflation as like a monetary policy thing.

420
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,285
Scott: Like you printed too many dollars.

421
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,820
Scott: So now they're worth less because there's those greater supply of dollars.

422
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,966
Scott: That is partially true.

423
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:44,881
Scott: Uh, that can happen, but here we're seeing a lot of supply side inflation, right?

424
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,734
Scott: It's like people want stuff and there's just less stuff.

425
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:49,020
Scott: There's not enough video cards.

426
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,052
Scott: There's not enough, you know, uh, chips for cars.

427
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:55,204
Scott: So the cars cost the cars that do exist, cost more, right?

428
00:28:55,224 --> 00:29:03,432
Scott: So used cars cost more, you know, it's like supply of things goes down for anything that causes prices to go up, right?

429
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:04,495
Scott: Is inflation.

430
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,903
Scott: And there's other kinds of inflation that you don't even think about.

431
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:12,502
Scott: For example, let's say, you know, you go to a restaurant, right?

432
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:23,120
Scott: And the restaurant has a hard time getting staff because, or labor, uh, prices have gone up, so they can't hire as much staff, but they kept the prices on the menu, the same, right?

433
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:26,896
Scott: So you go to the restaurant, you buy the same food for the same amount of money.

434
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:32,339
Scott: It's like, well, that's not inflation, but actually it was because the level of service has gone down.

435
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,000
Rym: So the people in capital markets are starting to use the term skimpflation to cover that specifically.

436
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,577
Scott: because it's like you're getting, you're, you're still paying the same prices.

437
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:46,316
Scott: You're making the same money, but you're getting less level of quality for your money.

438
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:56,191
Rym: If you went to a hotel, like a four star hotel, not a five star hotel, not a three star hotel, but like a four star hotel, a regular old Marriott in a big city somewhere, like the nice one.

439
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:01,853
Rym: In the eighties, seventies, eighties, nineties, you'd pay an amount of money for a room.

440
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:05,949
Rym: And it's about the same amount of money today, accounting for inflation for that room.

441
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,181
Rym: But you got way more amenities for that money.

442
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:14,720
Rym: In the old days, the concierge knew a lot more about the town than the concierge today.

443
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:23,668
Rym: I'd say the last 10 times I've talked to a concierge at a hotel, they have known less than my smartphone did about anything.

444
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,363
Scott: Or the concierge would be at the hotel 24/7 at that little desk.

445
00:30:28,504 --> 00:30:30,650
Scott: How often is that little desk is usually empty.

446
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:41,802
Rym: I remember at an Otakon in 2000 and like five or six, me and Adam wanted to keep partying at the, after like everything closed at 2 AM.

447
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,450
Rym: And we were like, Oh, where can we get some food?

448
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,816
Rym: We wanted some Chinese food.

449
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:48,469
Rym: The concierge knew like the one place that had food late at night.

450
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,075
Scott: Good.

451
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:50,557
Rym: Yeah.

452
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:55,976
Rym: I haven't even seen a concierge at a desk at a hotel other than a five-star hotel in the last decade.

453
00:30:55,996 --> 00:31:02,621
Scott: I did when I was on vacation, when I was on a tropical island, the concierge at the vacation hotel was very good.

454
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:06,152
Rym: But another example of this is Disney is a really big example.

455
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:15,304
Rym: Disney has cut tons of basic things that used to just be free or accessible to people who attend Disney, but haven't reduced ticket prices.

456
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,451
Rym: So you get less.

457
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:17,932
Scott: Right.

458
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:22,908
Scott: Because things that the company has to buy are the prices on those things are going up.

459
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:34,286
Scott: So rather than keep continuing to provide the same service they did and raising prices for their customers, they're just not cutting service levels and keeping their price the same.

460
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:35,089
Scott: Right.

461
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:42,312
Scott: It's like if a bowling alley, rather than you know, raise prices on shoes, right.

462
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:48,090
Scott: For the shoe rental, they could just keep the same shoes and not buy as many new shoes and hand out ratty your shoes.

463
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:48,392
Rym: Yep.

464
00:31:48,552 --> 00:32:03,072
Rym: Or even an example in Midtown Manhattan before COVID, if you want lunch in Midtown Manhattan, like it's moderately expensive just because it's Midtown Manhattan, but there were so many lunch places that you could find tons of places that you could just walk in.

465
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:06,167
Rym: There's like two people in front of you in line, get your food, you walk out, you're good to go.

466
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,000
Rym: Now, as we're not post-COVID, but in the current state that we're in, I have to go to the office three days a week.

467
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:17,940
Rym: When I go to get lunch, everywhere that still exists that sells lunch, the prices are the same.

468
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,665
Rym: The line is out the door.

469
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,471
Rym: Absolutely out the door.

470
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:22,976
Scott: Anywhere you want to go.

471
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:25,805
Scott: Low supply plus lower service, right?

472
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:26,026
Scott: Yep.

473
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:26,870
Rym: Lower supply.

474
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:28,739
Rym: There's fewer, like half these places are gone.

475
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:38,531
Rym: There's so many empty storefronts, fewer employees, so less service, but also they're not paying the despite the fact that they're doing more work.

476
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:38,832
Scott: Yep.

477
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,140
Rym: And the prices of the food have not changed.

478
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:42,282
Scott: Yep.

479
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:46,236
Scott: So yeah, basically all these things are combining, right?

480
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:55,410
Scott: And you're seeing, you know, in the two stories about the handheld gaming devices, how, you know, the economy can affect just this really narrow category, right?

481
00:32:55,992 --> 00:33:02,872
Scott: For different reasons, you know, in the same way at the same time, but that's happening basically in everything.

482
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:03,594
Scott: Yep.

483
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,442
Scott: And I'm surprised it hasn't been disaster.

484
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:13,790
Scott: Like I'm surprised we're at this, we've somehow managed as a society to like not have, you know, we think about historically.

485
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:19,231
Scott: when you go to history class, they always teach you about like these big immediate disasters, right?

486
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:21,739
Scott: Like so-and-so invaded such a place.

487
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,044
Scott: And that was like the moment, right?

488
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,188
Scott: The boom moment, right?

489
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,542
Scott: Or the great, you know, stock market crash in 1927.

490
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,939
Rym: But the great stock market crash wasn't like click and the entire economy is destroyed.

491
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,527
Rym: That's just what basic social studies implies.

492
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:42,690
Rym: Tiny parts had a catastrophe, but it was a very long and slow spread that affected people, sectors, industries, unevenly.

493
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,693
Rym: Yep.

494
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:47,665
Scott: So we have this expectation that like a disaster is like immediate.

495
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:51,216
Scott: It's like, we're basically in a disaster.

496
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:59,800
Rym: We have been, we are in, as Americans at least, we are in four simultaneous disasters, like four real disasters.

497
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,848
Rym: And I don't know how, what the outcome is going to be.

498
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,781
Rym: One, this, the economy is actually grinding to a halt.

499
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:05,664
Rym: Like it's happening.

500
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,934
Rym: Two, COVID, like COVID is not done.

501
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:12,687
Rym: So we're in the middle of a a hundred year global pandemic.

502
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,679
Rym: We have climate change on the verge of destroying everything.

503
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,406
Rym: And we've got the rise of fascism.

504
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:25,659
Rym: So a fun times ahead in the United States of America, but also the world is seeing like other countries are grappling with the same thing.

505
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:28,426
Scott: They got their own disasters.

506
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:34,186
Rym: It increasingly feels like America is by and large a collapsing empire.

507
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,156
Rym: Like people say, oh, Rome collapsed.

508
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:36,920
Rym: Like, yeah, that's true.

509
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:42,416
Rym: It collapsed over like 80 years, like very slowly and steadily was just collapsing.

510
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:55,322
Rym: And we could just be in the middle of a long collapse of a country that became great and powerful due to mostly luck by happening to be in the right place at the right time during a big war, once, about 60 years ago.

511
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,888
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

512
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:07,151
Rym: So there are a lot of adapters out there.

513
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:18,506
Rym: Like if you want to get from HDMI to that yellow RCA cable that goes into something, there is a string of adapters you could use that would make that happen.

514
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:19,310
Rym: Like that's possible.

515
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:30,390
Rym: Some adapters are bad, like the both sides of these Christmas lights are male adapter, which exists for two purposes, killing people and accidentally killing people.

516
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:33,596
Rym: Usually Americans are on Christmas time.

517
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:40,341
Rym: But my thing of the day, the doctor has posted an adapter that the doctor made themselves.

518
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:41,264
Rym: This is a real adapter.

519
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:42,409
Rym: There's video of them using it.

520
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:46,142
Rym: And on one end of this adapter is HDMI.

521
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:49,693
Rym: And on the other end of this adapter is water hose.

522
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:51,317
Scott: H2O.

523
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,764
Scott: H2O to HDMI.

524
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,950
Scott: You only have to change the two O's to the DMI.

525
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:00,703
Rym: Really funny when he plugs this into a laptop and turns it on.

526
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,830
Rym: Like really funny.

527
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:03,992
Rym: That's all I got.

528
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:09,970
Scott: So there's a webcomic that I never heard of before today called Namesake.

529
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:10,874
Scott: I've never read it.

530
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:11,980
Scott: I don't know if it's any good.

531
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,499
Rym: Oh, I thought you knew about it and you were just linking to it because of Cursed Sword.

532
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,484
Rym: This is good biz.

533
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:17,710
Scott: I had no idea.

534
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,683
Scott: So people that create the webcomic are named Isa and Meg.

535
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:29,061
Scott: And I discovered them because on Twitter, I saw a comic that they drew with a funny little crow.

536
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,150
Scott: Everyone likes a funny little crow.

537
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:36,984
Scott: So that funny little crow comic is a new comic that they are doing.

538
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:41,198
Scott: that is on Naver Webtoon, where all the comics are these days.

539
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:44,450
Scott: So on Naver Webtoon, that's my thing of the day.

540
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,176
Scott: You can go and link to this comic.

541
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:49,146
Scott: There's only seven strips so far.

542
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,912
Scott: You can get in on the ground floor.

543
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,747
Rym: Real important to get in on the ground floor of a comic like this.

544
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:57,184
Rym: Otherwise it's like order the stick where Scott will probably never read at this point.

545
00:36:57,204 --> 00:36:59,533
Scott: It's not a serial though, so you're okay.

546
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,359
Scott: But the comic is called Crow Time.

547
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:07,070
Scott: Every all seven strips so far are excellent.

548
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:13,230
Scott: And you can go to their Patreon as well, which there is a link to their Patreon on Webtoon.

549
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:21,531
Scott: And if you give them a dollar a month, you can see the Crow Time pages a week early before they're on Webtoon.

550
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:29,920
Scott: So I actually like that because I don't really use Webtoon that often, but I check Patreon like every other day, every day, something like that.

551
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:36,400
Scott: So I'm basically paying a dollar to see the comic on Patreon instead of on Webtoon.

552
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:43,749
Scott: But yeah, if you pay even more money, you can see their namesake stuff or you can go to guess their namesake website and read that other comic.

553
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,493
Scott: I don't know if it's any good.

554
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,099
Rym: Crow Time is good news.

555
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:48,710
Scott: The Crow comic is thing of the day worthy.

556
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,863
Scott: So read the Crow comic for free on Webtoon at the very least.

557
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:55,280
Rym: And then at the moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is The Tale of Genji.

558
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,792
Rym: We will definitely finish it by the end of the year at the rate I'm going.

559
00:37:58,554 --> 00:37:58,815
Scott: Oh yeah.

560
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,807
Rym: It's my opinion of Genji has not changed.

561
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,492
Rym: That's what I'll say about that.

562
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,582
Rym: But there's a little more action is happening.

563
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:10,654
Rym: More different things have been lately.

564
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:11,256
Scott: Whoa.

565
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:11,718
Scott: Exciting.

566
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:15,091
Rym: Not that different, but it's not just, oops, he slept with the wrong woman.

567
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:15,674
Rym: Oops.

568
00:38:15,895 --> 00:38:16,778
Rym: The woman he slept with.

569
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,289
Rym: Turns out she's super ugly in the daylight.

570
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:22,569
Rym: Like we're past that into slightly more complex situations.

571
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,203
Scott: I think the funniest one is they got better at writing.

572
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:31,093
Rym: The funniest one is still, oh, shit, she's really ugly.

573
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:37,070
Rym: Otherwise, our last panel, Atari Game Design on YouTube.

574
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:41,750
Rym: I will be at PAX Unplugged 2021 doing a panel rare game mechanics on Friday.

575
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,868
Rym: Do not expect to play games with me because I'm literally after that, just going to get a bunch of people, even if you're there at the whole pack.

576
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:52,466
Rym: So you're talking about games with people you don't think you've ever played.

577
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:53,149
Scott: I don't think you've ever.

578
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:56,306
Scott: It was the last time you played a game with the listener, which listener I play.

579
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:58,074
Rym: I mean, who, what counts as any listener?

580
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,103
Rym: I played a game with Pat at the last packs we went to.

581
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,614
Scott: That doesn't count because that's a friend.

582
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:03,196
Rym: All right.

583
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,531
Rym: So what I got, I got to find someone who is not an active friend.

584
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:10,544
Rym: I played games with, I was hanging out at the last magfest.

585
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:14,718
Rym: we went to in tabletop late at night playing games with randos.

586
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:16,484
Scott: Randos?

587
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:17,950
Scott: But were they Geeknight's listeners?

588
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,673
Rym: No, they weren't the listener.

589
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:19,477
Rym: They were just randos.

590
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,623
Scott: Yeah.

591
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:22,472
Scott: When's the last time you played a game with the listener?

592
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,585
Rym: I should start a train game with a listener.

593
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:35,367
Rym: It'd be nice to play with it when it's not a crab bucket knife fight like it is with us at this point, but, uh, yeah.

594
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,613
Rym: Otherwise just stay tuned for our biz.

595
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:39,860
Rym: Our website redesign is underway.

596
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:41,345
Rym: We got stuff in the hopper.

597
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:44,515
Rym: Uh, I won't be streaming advanced words anytime soon.

598
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,863
Rym: Cause that got delayed too.

599
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,211
Scott: And let's just get right into it.

600
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:50,193
Rym: Alien.

601
00:39:50,213 --> 00:40:02,585
Scott: We did our last Thursday show on actual extraterrestrials and we'll do this one on Alien, the sci-fi franchise, all of it, as much as we have experienced.

602
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:20,510
Rym: Which I will say for myself consists entirely solely of Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Prometheus, Alien vs Predator that I saw part of on cable and Alien Fireteam, the video game.

603
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,395
Rym: And I think I'm running out.

604
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,290
Rym: Oh, and uh, I guess that, uh, USCMC mod we played of torchbearer.

605
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:27,572
Scott: Okay.

606
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:36,140
Scott: So of your list, I have not played, I have not seen Alien vs Predator, but I've seen all the Alien, the main, I guess, what is it now?

607
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:37,565
Scott: Five, six movies.

608
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,074
Scott: I've seen all six of those movies for better or worse.

609
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:40,515
Rym: Oh yeah.

610
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:41,880
Rym: I did not see covenant.

611
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:45,631
Scott: You don't need to talk about it if you want.

612
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:52,105
Scott: Um, I've played the old side scrolling alien predator video game.

613
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:57,000
Scott: I played the original Alien vs Predator FPS a little bit.

614
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:58,446
Rym: I did play that a little bit.

615
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,052
Rym: It was, it was actually ahead of its time.

616
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:06,050
Scott: I think it was, uh, it was something I played, uh, alien isolation a little bit.

617
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,813
Scott: I didn't beat it.

618
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:10,569
Scott: I got like, you know, I don't know how many hours steam says I've played.

619
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,035
Scott: Well, I'll look it up while I'm talking.

620
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:13,402
Rym: I really want to play that.

621
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:17,961
Rym: I just haven't played it yet, but, I know there's a VR mod, so I'm just going to play it in VR.

622
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,366
Scott: I played it for 90 minutes.

623
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:22,917
Scott: Um, and then I stopped according to steam.

624
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:26,326
Scott: Um, and is that it?

625
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:30,099
Scott: Have I experienced, oh, there's, I know there are alien comics, but I've never read any of them.

626
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,722
Rym: Yeah, me either.

627
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,976
Rym: So alien, alien, like it's interesting thinking.

628
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:41,738
Rym: as a kid, I always thought of like the movies that I cared about the most were all these trilogies.

629
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:50,640
Rym: So I remember thinking about, uh, back to the future, Indiana Jones, star Wars, and alien.

630
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,707
Rym: Wasn't a trilogy until 1990, what, two and alien three.

631
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:56,033
Scott: Right.

632
00:41:56,053 --> 00:42:02,971
Scott: So when I was a kid alien, before I saw it was basically like my mom who loves scary shit, right?

633
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:04,177
Scott: I know your mom loves scary.

634
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:04,579
Rym: Oh yeah.

635
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,830
Rym: Our moms would get along to a big degree.

636
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,039
Scott: Even my grandma loves, you know, loved alien.

637
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,708
Rym: So I saw alien as a little kid, right.

638
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:22,122
Scott: But my mom would, you know, like threatened me with like alien, like, ah, like it's, you know, to me before I saw it, it was like, I just imagined the scariest possible movie.

639
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:22,624
Scott: Right.

640
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:28,388
Scott: Like there could not be a movie scarier than alien, even though I didn't see it.

641
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:29,693
Scott: So I didn't actually know how scary it was.

642
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:33,303
Scott: Um, and I don't know.

643
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:36,956
Scott: I think that like, you know, is it the best horror movie, right?

644
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:43,545
Scott: It's like, I know it's obviously not that scary to an adult human being, uh, unless you're easily frightened, but well, it's scary.

645
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:50,586
Rym: It's scary more for, from my perspective, more from a future science space dystopia angle.

646
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:51,408
Rym: But right.

647
00:42:51,448 --> 00:43:01,524
Scott: I think as like, you know, cause alien one really is a horror movie, but I think just in the horror category alone, I think the thing might be the only one on top of it.

648
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:01,745
Scott: Right.

649
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:02,749
Scott: John Carpenter's the thing.

650
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,516
Rym: I could watch that again.

651
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:05,340
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,681
Scott: Why not?

653
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:06,404
Scott: Watch it anytime.

654
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:07,187
Scott: Watch it every day.

655
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:07,950
Scott: You won't get old.

656
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,558
Rym: I haven't seen it in like a decade.

657
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:10,825
Scott: That blood scene.

658
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:11,730
Scott: It's all about the blood scene.

659
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,435
Scott: Um, so, but alien, right.

660
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:19,086
Scott: Brings in not just the horror angle, right.

661
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,755
Scott: It also brings in on equal measure, right?

662
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:35,596
Rym: The sci-fi cyberpunk dystopia angle, both the cyberpunk late capitalist dystopia, and also the, the replicants will replace us dystopia, which is often the same, but not always right.

663
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:39,267
Scott: And at the same time, you know, the feminist angle, right?

664
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:45,585
Scott: So alien is like this trifecta and also to separate it from those other trilogy things, right?

665
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:51,572
Scott: When, you know, I don't really know, you know, what Ridley Scott or any of those people were thinking when they made alien.

666
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:53,662
Scott: I haven't watched all those, you know, behind the scenes.

667
00:43:53,723 --> 00:44:06,443
Scott: I'm sure alien experts know all this, but from the perspective of just a consumer, it seems like star Wars, Indiana Jones, et cetera, were originally intended to be like these franchises.

668
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:11,337
Scott: Whereas it seems like in alien was just intended to be that one movie.

669
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:17,897
Rym: Well, an alien came out at the like 1980, 1979, and then aliens was like six years later.

670
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:20,787
Rym: And then alien three was six years after that.

671
00:44:21,248 --> 00:44:21,429
Scott: Right.

672
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:27,193
Scott: It seems like they hadn't, you know, when alien came out, it was just like a that's, we just made one movie like Jurassic park.

673
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,238
Scott: We just made one movie.

674
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:28,880
Scott: Right.

675
00:44:29,262 --> 00:44:31,410
Scott: And then Jurassic park was a success.

676
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:35,806
Scott: And that's why he made more books and made more movies for Jurassic park.

677
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:36,027
Scott: Right.

678
00:44:36,348 --> 00:44:37,975
Scott: Michael Crichton didn't go into Jurassic park.

679
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,803
Scott: Like I'm making a Jurassic park too.

680
00:44:40,285 --> 00:44:40,526
Scott: Right.

681
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,736
Scott: You know, he just made the one book and then it

682
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:46,352
Rym: became, I don't, I actually don't know the full story of him, you

683
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:58,931
Scott: can't ask him now, but alien same kind of deal where there was one alien and then it became a franchise just because it was so big and so good that the capitalism couldn't help itself to make more.

684
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:08,315
Scott: Um, and I think what really helped alien was that the first one was good, but the second one also being good, right?

685
00:45:08,937 --> 00:45:17,041
Scott: That just the fact that when you have two hits, then the entertainment industry is ready to like buy in forever.

686
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:17,523
Scott: Right.

687
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:25,250
Scott: They don't, even if you keep making more crap after that, it's like there have been two, they believe that they can make more good ones.

688
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,590
Rym: Yup.

689
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:26,052
Rym: Right.

690
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:29,666
Rym: But one thing that was, that stands out also terminator, right.

691
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:32,094
Scott: They made the same director on the two also.

692
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:32,455
Scott: Right.

693
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:41,305
Rym: All these late seventies through early nineties, like things that became franchises like this that were violent, scary aimed at adults.

694
00:45:42,128 --> 00:45:48,856
Rym: I remember in childhood in the eighties, every kid knew alien, almost every kid had seen alien and the kids who hadn't lied about seeing it.

695
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,730
Rym: And even the kids who hadn't seen it knew everything about it.

696
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:56,413
Scott: For some reason, also it came out at, you know, compared to when we were born, right.

697
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,320
Scott: The timing was such right.

698
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:58,923
Scott: Yup.

699
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:03,198
Scott: It was, you know, it wasn't, I remember cause it was on VHS.

700
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:08,939
Scott: It was, you know, it's like, oh, you know, it was on TV, even edited, obviously when aliens came out.

701
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,221
Rym: Yeah.

702
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:11,932
Rym: My parents were like, well, you got to see alien before we this new one.

703
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:12,615
Rym: So yup.

704
00:46:12,715 --> 00:46:12,916
Scott: Yup.

705
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:22,609
Scott: But I guess what really stuck with me as a kid, at least, I mean, I didn't see aliens when I was four, but I saw that was still at the phase of alien.

706
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,656
Scott: One is the scariest movie in the world.

707
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:31,645
Rym: How old was I when I saw alien and alien and aliens in the nineties at some point, I definitely saw them in the later eighties still.

708
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:33,492
Rym: Cause that was still living in the one house.

709
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:35,557
Scott: Anyway.

710
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,770
Rym: So I was at most nine years old when I saw alien and alien.

711
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:49,213
Rym: that's so, but the thing that stands out the most to me today is that especially alien and aliens, which I liked the most.

712
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,317
Rym: alien three was okay.

713
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:51,722
Rym: Like I didn't, it was okay.

714
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:54,793
Scott: It's the best way I'd describe it.

715
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:56,399
Scott: I wouldn't even give it an okay.

716
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,343
Rym: I mean, okay.

717
00:46:57,724 --> 00:47:16,254
Rym: When I say, okay, that's a three out of five stars out of, I give it a three out of 10 stars, but, uh, alien and aliens are the money there because they both are in the same universe telling similar stories, but the tone of them is so different.

718
00:47:16,635 --> 00:47:19,703
Rym: And I liked them both equally for different reasons.

719
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,678
Rym: Like I don't want to, I almost don't want to say they're equal movies.

720
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:25,750
Rym: I think alien as a better made movie.

721
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:32,408
Rym: Like if I just had to try to rank the two of them, but aliens speaks to a lot of things.

722
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:37,509
Rym: I like space Marines as an aesthetic is something I'm just jacked for all the time, no matter what.

723
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,300
Scott: Well, the way I see it is the alien.

724
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,655
Scott: It's like, okay, we have this universe, this characters, right?

725
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:48,394
Scott: And alien is like, okay, we're going to do a horror movie set in that universe, right?

726
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:54,138
Scott: Aliens comes along and says, all right, we're going to do an action movie set in that universe.

727
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:54,559
Scott: Right.

728
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:56,326
Scott: And they both did a good job.

729
00:47:56,346 --> 00:47:58,836
Scott: They're like top tier, like second best horror movie.

730
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:02,350
Scott: And you know, very highly ranked action movie, like way up there.

731
00:48:02,871 --> 00:48:10,493
Scott: What I would have liked to see is like, okay, for the third movie, we'll do, you know, comedy set in that universe.

732
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:10,734
Scott: Right.

733
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:16,514
Scott: Or just pick another genre, a romance set in that universe, but obviously serious.

734
00:48:16,615 --> 00:48:16,795
Scott: Right.

735
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:17,718
Scott: Not, you know, a joke.

736
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:24,402
Scott: Um, but like, and just do like, you know, because just make a really good movie in a genre.

737
00:48:24,422 --> 00:48:28,658
Scott: And then, you know, you could sort of make alien, this skin that could go on any.

738
00:48:28,678 --> 00:48:32,271
Scott: And I do think that like, it might be hard to do comedy and romance.

739
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,375
Scott: Those are tough examples.

740
00:48:33,897 --> 00:48:34,118
Scott: Right.

741
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:39,959
Scott: But there are other genres, you know, you could do like a historical, like a documentary, right?

742
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,003
Scott: A fake documentary.

743
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:54,808
Scott: Um, you know, there are lots of film genres you could apply an alien skin to and simultaneously, you know, just try to make the best possible movie of that type and just happen to have an alien skin on it.

744
00:48:54,828 --> 00:49:07,087
Scott: And that would have been, I think what I would prefer for alien to have continued, but instead alien continued after the second to try to do all this like world building and other weird stuff.

745
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:09,113
Rym: Here's where it really fails for me.

746
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:13,047
Rym: The whole franchise after alien and aliens, especially Prometheus.

747
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:14,553
Rym: And I assume covenant.

748
00:49:15,396 --> 00:49:17,806
Rym: I am not interested in the world building of the aliens.

749
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:26,602
Rym: I'm interested in the world building of the humans who don't fucking treat those aliens with the amount of respect and care that they should because of the cat.

750
00:49:26,622 --> 00:49:29,673
Scott: Some of that world building, you get some of that, that's way more.

751
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:30,656
Rym: what I'm interested in.

752
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:41,548
Rym: The, the, the incapacity of a capitalist society like this to deal with an existential threat like the aliens is the story I am most interested in.

753
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,943
Scott: Well, I mean, that's, that story isn't for me.

754
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:45,184
Scott: Probably.

755
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:48,715
Rym: Yeah, that story is in Prometheus, but also covenant.

756
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:53,330
Rym: But I guess it was almost like it was almost comedic in Prometheus.

757
00:49:53,990 --> 00:50:01,802
Rym: How incompetent those characters were, as opposed to say in aliens where the space brains show up and are super competent.

758
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:07,023
Rym: Of course, there's big asterisk on that because we've all seen the movie, but they show up ready to kick ass.

759
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:09,171
Rym: They arguably do a lot of things right.

760
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:15,251
Rym: And it doesn't matter because the situation they were in was fucked before they even got there.

761
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:26,025
Rym: The fact that they exist in the way that they do is all means that they were already doomed to fail because they are not there to protect humans from the aliens.

762
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:34,154
Rym: They're there to uphold this like dystopian cyber thing that the rest of humanity is living on back in Earth that we don't really even interact with.

763
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:35,017
Scott: Right.

764
00:50:35,037 --> 00:50:38,510
Scott: They were going there to save the mines, which produce a lot of.

765
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,798
Rym: they're not there to save the colonists.

766
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:41,045
Rym: They're not there to save anyone.

767
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:44,760
Rym: They're just there to save the profit extraction for the homeworld.

768
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:45,121
Scott: Right.

769
00:50:45,402 --> 00:50:49,414
Scott: And also, you know, extract profits from alien biology also.

770
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:49,856
Rym: Yep.

771
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,828
Rym: But yeah, Alien as a movie was one of it's one of the.

772
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:56,837
Rym: there are a lot of horror movies that do this.

773
00:50:56,938 --> 00:50:58,970
Rym: I'm not I can't even say it's the best of them ever.

774
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:11,730
Rym: I would have to sit and think long and hard to make like a reasonable list, but it did a really good job of having huge tension that just builds and builds and builds and not giving you a release

775
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,393
Scott: way

776
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:17,290
Rym: like the release comes way later than you are waiting or hoping or wanting.

777
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,978
Rym: But it makes it so tense the whole time.

778
00:51:20,701 --> 00:51:27,848
Rym: And like like the chestburster scene to this day, like I think back to like watching that the first time, not expecting that to happen.

779
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:31,887
Rym: And that scene was so tense for so long of like, is he going to survive the surgery?

780
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,490
Rym: What's happening?

781
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:40,799
Scott: Well, I mean, the meaning of that scene, right, is like it ties in because throughout Alien, it's, you know, that scene is, I think, the most.

782
00:51:41,784 --> 00:51:46,499
Scott: it's probably the most iconic scene, but it's also the overall theme of Alien.

783
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,737
Scott: one is the things that would be scariest in life for a cis man.

784
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:54,238
Scott: Right.

785
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:56,223
Scott: It's like giving birth.

786
00:51:56,484 --> 00:51:59,492
Scott: Some something is living in your stomach and it's going to come out.

787
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:00,675
Scott: Right.

788
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:05,870
Scott: You know, there is something you can't kill with like a gun.

789
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:09,901
Scott: It's like there is a computer that won't listen to you.

790
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:14,395
Scott: The woman is the smartest and most badass person around.

791
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:14,976
Scott: Right.

792
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,401
Scott: And she doesn't take your shit.

793
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:18,047
Scott: And she won't fuck you either.

794
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:18,889
Scott: Right.

795
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:21,621
Scott: It's like she cares more about the cat than she cares about you.

796
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,676
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's pretty much like, you know, like.

797
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:32,456
Scott: not only is it, you know, feminist and showing you right, Ripley, this amazing character is a woman who gets all the shit done.

798
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:33,339
Scott: Right.

799
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:39,094
Scott: But also it's like basically horror world for straight dude.

800
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:39,675
Scott: Right.

801
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:41,742
Scott: Like every single thing about Alien.

802
00:52:42,223 --> 00:52:44,952
Scott: It's like, you know, worst possible nightmare.

803
00:52:44,972 --> 00:52:48,547
Rym: But that that feminist narrative like that, that goes way deeper than even that.

804
00:52:48,588 --> 00:52:51,541
Rym: Like along the way, like think about what happens in this movie.

805
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:53,329
Scott: What's where do the aliens come from?

806
00:52:53,510 --> 00:53:08,055
Rym: Hey, every single time, every single person or situation that should have been Ripley's ally, which would mean they're also humanities ally, had ulterior motives and was not actually an ally when push came to shove.

807
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:08,537
Rym: Right.

808
00:53:08,878 --> 00:53:12,555
Scott: The heads, the aliens heads are phallic and they have the mouth comes out like that.

809
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:12,756
Scott: Right.

810
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:14,062
Rym: Like Ash, you're here to help me.

811
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:15,568
Rym: No, I'm a, I'm an Android.

812
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:21,072
Rym: I am literally here to bring the alien back to earth and I will literally murder you once you figure this out.

813
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:22,456
Scott: Yeah.

814
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,580
Scott: I mean, that's, that's.

815
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:30,928
Scott: the other thing is, you know, a lot of movies will have some kind of, you know, like, you know, obvious or not obvious, you know, message.

816
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:31,189
Scott: Right.

817
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:34,323
Scott: So you get like a, like a Fern Gully with an environmental message.

818
00:53:34,404 --> 00:53:34,665
Scott: Right.

819
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:34,946
Rym: Yeah.

820
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:36,112
Rym: It just hits you over the head with it.

821
00:53:36,152 --> 00:53:37,538
Rym: Like, Hey, this movie is about this.

822
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:46,318
Rym: But then you get a movie like RoboCop where you just get one scene, the locker room and men and women are just in there and they're like, there's only one locker room and it's not a problem.

823
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:51,579
Rym: And that little, like there's a message there, but that I think 99% of viewers didn't even.

824
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:55,734
Scott: Well, but that's only like a one scene message right here, an alien.

825
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,734
Scott: It's like, they've managed to have several, you know, main themes and it doesn't get cluttered.

826
00:54:02,995 --> 00:54:03,236
Scott: Right.

827
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:13,934
Scott: It's like, you know, you got the, the computer theme, the capitalism theme, the feminist theme, the right, the, the not listening to the experts, you know, all this stuff.

828
00:54:13,954 --> 00:54:16,925
Scott: And it's like, normally that would like become a big mess.

829
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:19,495
Scott: Like how do we address all these different lines?

830
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:20,238
Scott: Right.

831
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:31,197
Scott: How do we keep all, you know, we can't fit all this into the short movie and have each thing get enough screen time, you know, be coherent, be significant all at once, but they manage it.

832
00:54:31,598 --> 00:54:37,495
Scott: And I think part of the reason they manage it is because it's horror, they kill people off.

833
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:38,559
Scott: Right.

834
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:43,074
Scott: It's one of those, just like dread, where there's less and less people as the movie goes on.

835
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:48,750
Scott: So that creates more space for things to exist as the movie progresses.

836
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:49,730
Scott: Right.

837
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:57,103
Scott: It's like, they don't really focus on, you know, that Android plot too much until most of the other people are dead, you know, except the Android.

838
00:54:57,665 --> 00:55:03,091
Scott: Um, they see, like, they give you a little hint of him and the early at the start of the movie, they're like, this is Android at the start.

839
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:03,814
Scott: Right.

840
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:11,142
Scott: You know, he's there and they give you a little hint, like, yeah, he's probably, you know, a bad computer, like how 9,000, you know, probably.

841
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:15,724
Scott: And then he doesn't really, that doesn't really come out till, you know, much later.

842
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:16,328
Scott: Right.

843
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:18,377
Scott: They're not, they don't spend all this time harping on it.

844
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:18,899
Scott: Right.

845
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:23,078
Scott: They go, they spend the time on the other stuff, but also a lot of those things.

846
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:28,799
Rym: just, they compliment each other because all these dangers that Ripley faces along the way are not like.

847
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:33,333
Rym: the alien is not, arguably not even the biggest threat to her.

848
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:41,945
Rym: And she and the team would have been a lot more successful, but for all these other obstacles that humanity had created for themselves and put in the way.

849
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,691
Scott: So in aliens, right.

850
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:49,407
Scott: And the second one, what they, the main, the, the second theme, right.

851
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:52,963
Scott: That they go into is like this like motherhood theme, right.

852
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:54,249
Scott: Cause you know, you're fighting, right.

853
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,881
Scott: It's like, you know, she finds the girl, right.

854
00:55:57,202 --> 00:56:00,901
Scott: And you know, at the beginning of the, if you watch the, so I guys, people might not know this cause.

855
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,550
Scott: I didn't know this until somewhat recently.

856
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:08,683
Scott: So I had only ever seen the special edition of aliens, right.

857
00:56:09,765 --> 00:56:16,766
Scott: The original, same for me, but I'm not sure the, I recently discovered the original cause.

858
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,829
Scott: I watched it by accident.

859
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:26,156
Scott: Cause it was, if you go on Amazon prime video, if you watch aliens for free for $0, they will show you the original theatrical release.

860
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:28,647
Scott: The original theatrical release is garbage.

861
00:56:28,688 --> 00:56:29,451
Scott: Don't watch that shit.

862
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:30,153
Scott: All right.

863
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:34,648
Scott: It doesn't have the mini gun auto cannon scene, the target scene.

864
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:36,877
Rym: One of the best scenes in the history of cinema.

865
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:38,122
Rym: I love that scene so much.

866
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:49,002
Scott: And it doesn't have, I thought of mentioning this because it doesn't have the scene with Ripley, you know, space texting her daughter at the start of the movie, which is the ridiculously important scene.

867
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:52,636
Scott: So it's basically missing a lot of important scenes.

868
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:56,513
Scott: So you want it, just always see the special edition of aliens no matter what.

869
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:00,747
Scott: Uh, but like I was saying that theme of motherhood, right.

870
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:06,671
Scott: She texts her daughter who basically, you know, hates her because she hasn't been in her life, even though it's not her fault.

871
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:07,413
Scott: Right.

872
00:57:07,955 --> 00:57:10,362
Rym: Um, I mean, she finds basis, right.

873
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:15,036
Scott: She finds newt in the place and is like a surrogate mother for newt.

874
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:15,677
Scott: Right.

875
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,369
Scott: And then of course the big bad is the mama alien.

876
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:23,764
Scott: It's like, you couldn't be more hit over the head with the mom theme and aliens.

877
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:24,587
Scott: Right.

878
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:27,336
Scott: And then you just combine that with awesome space Marine battle.

879
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:39,810
Rym: But keeping the same like late capitalist libertarian cyber dystopia in that the space Marines are not a military, like doing normal military things.

880
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:40,733
Rym: They're company men.

881
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:46,852
Scott: And then also aliens and alien, even though one's a horror movie, one's an action movie.

882
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:48,918
Scott: They both, I guess, spoilers.

883
00:57:48,938 --> 00:57:54,774
Scott: Uh, they have that same ending structure where you get away.

884
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:57,401
Scott: You've, there's an escape at the end.

885
00:57:58,123 --> 00:57:58,344
Scott: Right.

886
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:03,038
Scott: And then there's a, as a square boss of like, Nope, alien still here.

887
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:03,500
Scott: Okay.

888
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,263
Scott: Now you've escaped.

889
00:58:04,383 --> 00:58:04,604
Scott: Right.

890
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:06,290
Scott: They do the same exact thing.

891
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:15,378
Scott: And you can see that if you, you know, a lot of, uh, media out there that has been inspired by alien, like, I don't know, Metroid, stuff like that.

892
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,322
Scott: Right.

893
00:58:16,543 --> 00:58:17,888
Scott: Always does the same thing.

894
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:18,430
Scott: Right.

895
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,115
Scott: It's like, Oh, the mother brain is dead.

896
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,282
Scott: No, it's not.

897
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,829
Scott: It's like same exact thing goes on.

898
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,964
Scott: Um, and that may have been the, the invention of the square boss.

899
00:58:29,365 --> 00:58:29,887
Scott: Possibly.

900
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:32,560
Scott: I don't want to, you know, it's one of the oldest ones I can think of.

901
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,696
Scott: I don't want to say for sure it's the oldest, but I'd have to think, cause that would be 1986.

902
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:41,250
Scott: Well, no, first alien had the square boss too.

903
00:58:41,671 --> 00:58:42,613
Rym: Oh yeah.

904
00:58:42,714 --> 00:58:42,934
Rym: Yeah.

905
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:43,476
Rym: So 1979.

906
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:43,656
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:45,340
Scott: Yeah.

908
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:48,027
Scott: Before basically almost all video games.

909
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:54,951
Scott: So well, before I find another man, you would need to find another movie or a book where you thought it was over.

910
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:58,284
Scott: It wasn't over and you had to kill the end guy again.

911
00:58:58,324 --> 00:58:59,348
Scott: It was a secret end guy.

912
00:58:59,368 --> 00:58:59,649
Scott: Yup.

913
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,216
Scott: But probably was some book or something.

914
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:07,637
Rym: I've seen aliens again more recently, just randomly, like I watched it again, not that long ago.

915
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:13,542
Rym: And uh, so I don't want to say I enjoy it more than alien cause it's been longer since I've seen alien.

916
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:19,130
Rym: So I want to watch that again first before I say anything about these two, but I'll just say they're equally good from my perspective.

917
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:21,539
Scott: They're like top tier, you know, all time.

918
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,122
Scott: Great movies.

919
00:59:22,383 --> 00:59:22,584
Rym: Yup.

920
00:59:22,986 --> 00:59:24,753
Scott: So let's talk about some of these other movies.

921
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,638
Rym: So for me, this was just bad.

922
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:30,370
Scott: So alien three is just this weird thing.

923
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,038
Scott: I don't know why anyone likes it.

924
00:59:32,078 --> 00:59:32,480
Scott: Like it has.

925
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:41,673
Scott: no, you know, it's like, yeah, it takes place in the same universe as alien, but it's like in this weird prison place and it like really, it's just strange.

926
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,324
Scott: It's like some kind of weirdo art movie kinda like.

927
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:48,514
Scott: I just don't, there's nothing enjoyable about watching it.

928
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:55,641
Scott: Like you can understand what it's trying to say and what the ideas are, but it's like, there's no point.

929
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:56,403
Scott: It's not fun.

930
00:59:56,564 --> 00:59:58,450
Scott: It's not, there's no entertainment whatsoever.

931
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,756
Rym: I only ever saw it once.

932
00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:01,323
Rym: Like I actually never watched it again.

933
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:05,897
Rym: I just saw it the one time in the theater in 1992.

934
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:06,658
Scott: It's like, why?

935
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:07,080
Scott: Right.

936
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:13,197
Scott: Um, and then alien resurrection is, uh, you know, that's a Joss Whedon mess.

937
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:13,738
Scott: Right.

938
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,308
Scott: So I dislike it for a lot of the same reasons.

939
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:21,628
Scott: I like other Joss Whedon things, but it, you know, it really felt like a direct to TV kind of movie.

940
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:24,998
Scott: Just like lots of ridiculous stuff happening.

941
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:32,981
Rym: Apparently alien resurrection had a sequel planned, set back on earth and Sigourney Weaver said, nope.

942
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:36,651
Rym: And that seems to be a big part of why it didn't get made.

943
01:00:37,774 --> 01:00:38,155
Scott: Well, good.

944
01:00:39,379 --> 01:00:42,909
Scott: Um, so yeah, I'm not a, I'm not a fan of alien resurrection at all.

945
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:48,808
Scott: It's just like, you know, some nerd just trying to have fun with alien and making a mess instead.

946
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:50,753
Scott: Uh, it's like whatever.

947
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:55,650
Rym: Alien resurrection lost that sense of isolation that the other movies had.

948
01:00:56,892 --> 01:01:07,452
Scott: Even the, I mean the prison one wasn't that isolated, but yeah, the, I mean, they, everything lost that sense of isolation except alien and aliens for a covenant had a little bit.

949
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:10,542
Rym: I never saw a covenant had some isolation aspects.

950
01:01:11,385 --> 01:01:12,208
Scott: Um, right.

951
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,234
Scott: So Prometheus is supposed to be a prequel.

952
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:22,001
Scott: Uh, and on the one hand it's tantalizing revealing like these secrets like, yes, there was this other alien race, right?

953
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:23,126
Scott: How did these eggs get here?

954
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:31,856
Rym: One thing I remember I was like, it was surprised me how unsurprised the humans were in alien and aliens that the alien existed.

955
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:38,770
Rym: Like they were more worried about what it would do, which implied that humans had already encountered aliens elsewhere, but it didn't really get into that.

956
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,071
Scott: Yeah.

957
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:44,072
Scott: Cause the start of alien, they find this ship full of eggs and it's a big like U-shaped ship.

958
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:47,748
Scott: So in covenant of Prometheus, they're like, Oh look, it's a U-shaped ship.

959
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:50,197
Scott: This is the first time humanity found one of these.

960
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:50,658
Scott: Yeah.

961
01:01:50,698 --> 01:01:50,979
Scott: Right.

962
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:52,806
Scott: Uh, you know, so I

963
01:01:52,846 --> 01:02:02,597
Rym: came into that movie thinking, all right, we're going to find out like why humans were not surprised by the mere existence of aliens at all in alien, but

964
01:02:02,878 --> 01:02:10,121
Scott: how did the right, the company in alien one was like, you know, knew about the alien and was trying to capture it and use it.

965
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:12,872
Scott: So how did the Wayland corporation know about it?

966
01:02:13,213 --> 01:02:14,900
Scott: Prometheus answers that question.

967
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:23,509
Rym: But even in that movie, the humans involved are very unsurprised by the existence of aliens and nor do they seem to care that much about it.

968
01:02:24,471 --> 01:02:24,611
Scott: No.

969
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:32,060
Scott: Uh, well, some of them do, but yeah, Prometheus is like, on the one hand, it's sort of revealing all that, you know, world secrets.

970
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,506
Scott: Some of them at least, right.

971
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:36,620
Scott: Which is, you know, if you care about the franchise, it's kind of fun.

972
01:02:36,941 --> 01:02:40,820
Scott: And you know, it's always exciting to have terrible secrets of space, like revealed and answered.

973
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:41,061
Scott: Right.

974
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:41,865
Scott: It's satisfying.

975
01:02:42,006 --> 01:02:42,267
Scott: Yeah.

976
01:02:42,308 --> 01:02:46,143
Rym: But like even Evangelion has a better precursor race story than Prometheus.

977
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:49,595
Scott: But yeah, but the actual story in Prometheus is like meh.

978
01:02:50,638 --> 01:02:53,447
Scott: Um, and it's like, what kind of movie is it?

979
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:54,390
Scott: It's not a horror movie.

980
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:55,936
Scott: It's not an action movie.

981
01:02:55,956 --> 01:03:04,910
Rym: It's like, what's like, you know, it's like, could have been a long plotting sci-fi movie, but what it, it doesn't actually reveal enough to be that compelling.

982
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:08,926
Rym: And it ends on a, not a cliffhanger, but a, Oh, guess what?

983
01:03:08,946 --> 01:03:11,195
Rym: There's going to be a really, really long sequel.

984
01:03:11,415 --> 01:03:12,841
Rym: Uh, that like, that's where it ends.

985
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:13,523
Scott: Right.

986
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:17,136
Scott: I think what it, it was satisfying is the word I would use.

987
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:17,397
Scott: Right.

988
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:24,219
Scott: If it wanted to be a sci-fi movie, it should have gone to be, you know, some more like, you know, 2001.

989
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:24,399
Scott: Right.

990
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,348
Scott: Gets, get really abstract at some point.

991
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:27,850
Scott: Right.

992
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,119
Scott: Instead of being so concrete the whole way through.

993
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:30,702
Rym: Yep.

994
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:44,453
Rym: Um, but I guess the other thing that bothered me about Prometheus was that it, it set up this whole precursor thing and like started to tell this real story, but it did leave it reasonably ambiguous as to what the aliens were up to.

995
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:58,041
Scott: And like, what was the disaster that happened on that ship or give you, yes, they give you some answers, but then they leave just more questions unanswered and like, excuse themselves from fully building the world.

996
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:59,849
Scott: It's like, we'll do a little bit, right.

997
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,035
Scott: We'll tell you like one answer.

998
01:04:01,095 --> 01:04:02,643
Scott: Like, yes, it's like, look at that.

999
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:03,950
Scott: There were giant people, right?

1000
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:09,357
Rym: But more importantly, anything else, there were a lot of ways you could read what that civilization was up to.

1001
01:04:09,397 --> 01:04:18,931
Rym: And like, maybe they just made a mistake, but everything I've read about the canonical explanations, like what they were intending is the least interesting possible option.

1002
01:04:19,974 --> 01:04:20,214
Scott: Yeah.

1003
01:04:20,254 --> 01:04:30,477
Scott: So let's talk about alien covenant, which the aliens were up to the least interesting possible option.

1004
01:04:30,697 --> 01:04:30,838
Rym: Right.

1005
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:31,980
Rym: Oh, still coming out.

1006
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:32,601
Scott: Yeah.

1007
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:32,881
Scott: I know.

1008
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:33,102
Scott: Right.

1009
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:33,663
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

1010
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:39,554
Scott: I to Prometheus, like direct.

1011
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:51,385
Scott: Um, and it's has a lot more in common, like not quality wise, obviously, um, with a movie like silence of the lambs, right.

1012
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:56,283
Scott: Where obviously sounds the lambs of the legendary eight plus film, like alien one tier.

1013
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:57,890
Rym: I just watched that again recently.

1014
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:03,805
Scott: Uh, God damn that movie and alien covenant is a really man movie.

1015
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:09,423
Scott: Uh, I guess alien covenants better than alien three, maybe a little bit, barely.

1016
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:20,559
Rym: I mean, I saw it three in the theater and I was young, so I can't, uh, uh, but alien covenant was really focusing on like, you know, it spends a lot of time philosophizing, right.

1017
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:23,651
Scott: And it was like this one bad guy character, right?

1018
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:33,947
Scott: Like a Hannibal, but he's not obviously not nowhere near as good, uh, an interesting, a character is just a really mad character, but it's like, it's a bad guy.

1019
01:05:33,987 --> 01:05:36,375
Scott: He's philosophizing all the time, right?

1020
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:47,230
Scott: It's an examination of him and through him an examination of the situation and what the aliens were up to both the xenomorph ones and the giant ones who flew the spaceships, right.

1021
01:05:47,271 --> 01:05:51,625
Scott: What their deal was and you know what happened here.

1022
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:51,946
Scott: Right.

1023
01:05:52,006 --> 01:06:12,721
Scott: And it's like, he reveals quite a lot about what went on, but what was revealed is like, like you said, the least interesting possible explanation for things and simultaneously continues to reveal so much while also not revealing enough to fully satisfy.

1024
01:06:12,741 --> 01:06:13,363
Scott: Right.

1025
01:06:13,423 --> 01:06:17,515
Scott: Like giving you one candy from a, from a whole sleeve of smarties.

1026
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:17,896
Scott: Right.

1027
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:21,568
Rym: It's like, does it continue following that?

1028
01:06:21,628 --> 01:06:22,832
Rym: like religious angle.

1029
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:32,005
Rym: that was while it was in Prometheus, but reading like intentions from the creators, they intended it to be even stronger than it might've read.

1030
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:34,073
Rym: Does it still have the religious aspects?

1031
01:06:34,634 --> 01:06:38,707
Scott: I mean, you can always read a religious aspect into anything, I guess.

1032
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:43,355
Rym: Um, I mean, I read a thing that they intended.

1033
01:06:43,415 --> 01:06:51,584
Rym: the, the inciting incident in the alien side is there with something to do with humans, like killing Jesus.

1034
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:57,026
Rym: Like it was some weird, like trying to tie it into human religion in a really, really pedestrian way.

1035
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,041
Scott: I mean, you can read something like that into it.

1036
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,790
Scott: The fact that it's called alien covenant.

1037
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:03,413
Scott: Right.

1038
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:08,330
Rym: Um, but just give me, give me a covenant with Lilith and I'm much more interested suddenly.

1039
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:08,992
Rym: Yeah.

1040
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:10,638
Scott: But it's not, it's not like that.

1041
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:13,107
Scott: It's really, uh, it's just me.

1042
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:24,645
Rym: Um, yeah, this was, uh, I can like to, there's a, yeah, the thing where they were Ridley Scott and everyone, they're talking about like, what was the intention of Prometheus?

1043
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:29,390
Rym: And there's this idea that the aliens and Prometheus were mad because we killed Jesus.

1044
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,862
Rym: And they kind of intended that to be a literal reading.

1045
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:36,852
Rym: Uh, okay.

1046
01:07:36,872 --> 01:07:37,535
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

1047
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:45,770
Rym: I guess I could, you know, movies.com or ask Ridley Scott when you throw religion and spirituality into the equation for Prometheus, it almost acts like a hand grenade.

1048
01:07:45,891 --> 01:07:53,650
Rym: We heard it was scripted that the engineers were targeting our planet for destruction because we had crucified one of their representatives and that Jesus Christ might've been alien.

1049
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:55,477
Rym: Was that considered Ridley Scott?

1050
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:59,592
Rym: We definitely did, but then we thought it was a little too on the nose.

1051
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:02,461
Rym: So that was the direction they went at first.

1052
01:08:03,745 --> 01:08:05,871
Scott: I mean, that is the general angle, right?

1053
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:09,245
Scott: Is that the, the, the, the, you know, the big aliens, right?

1054
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,233
Scott: The one that you see a skeleton of, right.

1055
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:16,428
Scott: Where they created and used the xenomorph aliens to punish humans.

1056
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:16,709
Scott: Right.

1057
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:18,736
Scott: That's absolutely the factor.

1058
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:21,524
Scott: It's like, it's like, that's really boring.

1059
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:23,310
Scott: That is super boring.

1060
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:26,899
Scott: That is not an exciting answer to anything.

1061
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,917
Rym: Um, I'm, I'm, I'm even more disappointed now that it just follows that theme and covenant.

1062
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:33,082
Scott: Yeah.

1063
01:08:33,103 --> 01:08:47,269
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, there's a, I guess some kind of twist to it in terms of what actually happens on the planet that they're on in covenant, but you know, if you got to, you know, that time you can spend that time watching.

1064
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:47,410
Scott: Yeah.

1065
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,554
Rym: He gave a longer answer.

1066
01:08:48,573 --> 01:08:56,710
Rym: He did say that they intended for it to literally have been Jesus who was crucified was one of the aliens that then caused them to decide to destroy humanity.

1067
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:57,951
Scott: All right.

1068
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,433
Scott: Well, whatever.

1069
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,154
Rym: That's boring.

1070
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:00,962
Scott: Anyway.

1071
01:09:00,982 --> 01:09:02,367
Scott: So yeah.

1072
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:08,490
Scott: Uh, but you know, the alien franchise has spawned, you know, outside of those main movies, lots and lots of stuff.

1073
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:15,189
Rym: Well, it also, it looks large like Spider-Man, like that alien is so universally recognized.

1074
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:17,054
Scott: Mm hmm.

1075
01:09:17,656 --> 01:09:17,796
Scott: Yeah.

1076
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:22,951
Scott: And for such like HR Geiger without alien would have been like an obscure artist, right?

1077
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:33,112
Scott: Like people, despite having created so many great works with such a unique style, that is uniquely horrifying to pretty much all humans, regardless of where they're from or what their history is.

1078
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:52,875
Scott: Uh, you know, but like without alien, it's like, you know, you might know HR Geiger if you were like an art nerd and bought an art book or something, which I know a lot of people who have, but because of alien, everyone recognizes if you see, they might not know HR Geiger's name, but if they see that artwork, you'd be like, Oh, it's, it must be something alien related, right?

1079
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:54,059
Scott: You can't, you can't miss it.

1080
01:09:54,882 --> 01:09:56,408
Scott: Um, so that's huge, right?

1081
01:09:56,428 --> 01:09:59,280
Scott: To just have, you know, as a, as a visual artist, right?

1082
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,410
Scott: To get in some sort of platform for your style.

1083
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:02,994
Scott: I think of it in the same way.

1084
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:05,342
Scott: I think of like Amano and final fantasy.

1085
01:10:05,503 --> 01:10:06,225
Scott: Yeah.

1086
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:06,807
Rym: Yeah.

1087
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,192
Scott: I should talk to Amano.

1088
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:09,316
Scott: was that final fantasy?

1089
01:10:09,778 --> 01:10:10,440
Scott: Probably not.

1090
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:11,123
Rym: Yeah.

1091
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:22,220
Rym: I remember this moment as a kid, when I got, I was looking at the final fantasy too, in quotes for rule, like book had this amazing art, like the characters look so good.

1092
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:28,084
Rym: And that was what I really put the pieces together and realized that Amano had been responsible for multiple sets of art.

1093
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:30,633
Rym: I had liked not just final fantasy art.

1094
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:31,717
Scott: Yeah.

1095
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:39,954
Scott: Uh, so you got that aspect, but yeah, there's not only things officially in the franchise, but you've got so many things that are just, you know, Metroid like things right.

1096
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:43,646
Scott: Inspired by alien are actively alien, right?

1097
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:44,910
Scott: It's like that one movie.

1098
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,358
Scott: They just made a one-off movie.

1099
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:54,433
Scott: They weren't thinking about any of this, you know, that it was going to be some huge franchise or any, you know, and ended up being this cultural phenomenon that still exists.

1100
01:10:54,734 --> 01:11:01,077
Rym: And then somehow they decided to make a sequel that was nearly equally good or possibly actually equally good, but different.

1101
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:02,240
Rym: Yeah.

1102
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:03,424
Rym: That is notable.

1103
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:08,620
Rym: That is the like almost bigger accomplishment of yes, somehow made more.

1104
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:14,861
Rym: That wasn't just the same, but also still felt like it was the same and it wasn't bad.

1105
01:11:15,182 --> 01:11:17,571
Rym: And it man, it was at least as good as what you did before.

1106
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:18,816
Rym: Like that is so rare.

1107
01:11:18,836 --> 01:11:20,421
Rym: Yeah.

1108
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,168
Scott: That's like the bomb that set it off.

1109
01:11:22,228 --> 01:11:22,449
Scott: Right.

1110
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:27,489
Scott: It was like, you made something so good that you demanded a sequel and the sequel is good.

1111
01:11:27,509 --> 01:11:29,460
Scott: It's like, all right, well, I guess this is a thing forever now.

1112
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:29,923
Scott: It's like, yup.

1113
01:11:29,963 --> 01:11:30,869
Scott: It's a thing forever now.

1114
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:31,351
Rym: Yup.

1115
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:36,332
Rym: Like Terminator became a thing forever, even though really it had just one and a half good movies.

1116
01:11:37,174 --> 01:11:39,823
Scott: Well, Terminator's I think fading somewhat.

1117
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:41,368
Scott: Maybe it'll be back.

1118
01:11:41,809 --> 01:11:41,990
Rym: Yeah.

1119
01:11:46,671 --> 01:11:47,514
Rym: I think we can end there.

1120
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,667
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: So, uh, yeah.

1130
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:50,836
Rym: We, uh, really only like two of these alien movies and I feel like I'd watch both of them again.

1131
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:51,580
Rym: It's been a while.

1132
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:56,662
Rym: But, uh, for now, I don't have anything new to say, so I'm just going to leave you with... Uncle, Uncle!

1133
01:12:56,863 --> 01:12:58,550
Rym: The Droid Caravan's almost here!

1134
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:03,084
Scott: What are you so fucking delighted about the Droid Caravan?

1135
01:13:03,104 --> 01:13:10,421
Scott: I mean, you know, what a low fucking level of entertainment it is.

1136
01:13:10,742 --> 01:13:12,768
Rym: But Uncle, you grew up on Sand Planet!

1137
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:14,133
Rym: You love Sand Planet!

1138
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:15,600
Scott: No, I don't love Sand Planet!

1139
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:19,837
Scott: I grew up here, yeah, I don't fucking... Who would want to, who would love this place?

1140
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:22,006
Scott: This is an awful, awful fucking world.

1141
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:29,199
Scott: And you're all excited about it, and look, I get it, you know, I'm sitting out here too, just like you, you know, here I am, like, acting like I'm above it.

1142
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,449
Scott: I want to see the fucking weird droids.

1143
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:39,037
Scott: I want to see what fucking dumb idiot bullshit droids that they've, that they're trying to fucking peddle and, you know, sell to people.

1144
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:39,658
Scott: I want to see it.

1145
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:40,942
Rym: Droids!

1146
01:13:41,323 --> 01:13:42,807
Rym: We got fucking droids!

1147
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:44,232
Rym: We do it every week!

1148
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,019
Rym: Come on, guys, speed it up now!

1149
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,123

Scott: Every Sunday.
