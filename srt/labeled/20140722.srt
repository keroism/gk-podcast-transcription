00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,675
Rym: It's Tuesday July 22nd 2014.

2
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:12,580
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,687
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:35,034
Rym: ingress back from Connecticut completely rested Nothing to do till PAX nothing to do until the real packs.

5
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:38,506
Rym: Oh my god, you know a month from now It's so the other day.

6
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:45,094
Rym: I tried to call because Scott and I actually I through magic I got us a room in the Sheraton, but Scott has a backup room in the red line.

7
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,500
Scott: It's no longer the red line.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,403
Scott: It's now the motif.

9
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:48,849
Scott: something something or whatever.

10
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:51,659
Scott: not trusting that also there's gonna be some tabletop in there.

11
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,079
Rym: Did they announce that because they know about?

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,035
Scott: Fantasy flight said they're having a netrunner tournament and it's on the third or fourth floor of.

13
00:00:59,276 --> 00:00:59,999
Rym: well did wasn't?

14
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,928
Rym: last year There was some Final Fantasy stuff.

15
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:03,254
Rym: They're separate from tabletop.

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,545
Scott: Maybe yeah I think it's like that.

17
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:09,140
Scott: you I'm pretty sure this network determine sounds like it's a real packs netrunner.

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,354
Scott: Oh, it is because you have to sign up for it at 10 a.m.

19
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:13,379
Scott: With the enforcers.

20
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:18,260
Scott: So I think I think tabletop tournament is gonna be in the former red line.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:28,797
Rym: But guys it's like every year we go to all these conventions and like like Oh ConnectiCon really pumped out ConnectiCon and oh my god MAGFest really pumped about MAGFest and anime Boston and PAX East.

22
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:35,020
Rym: but then Then in that few weeks before PAX Prime like I remember how much I fucking love packs.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,540
Rym: They're real facts like not just so real.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,927
Rym: I'm sorry guys, but in the last few years PAX East is a good con Not as good as PAX Prime.

25
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:54,165
Rym: It is objectively worse by every measure other than number of miles I travel to get to it worse But it doesn't mean it's bad.

26
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,356
Rym: No, it's still like the third best con we go to.

27
00:01:57,537 --> 00:02:02,175
Scott: it's like oh no LeBron James not as good as Michael Jordan.

28
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:11,839
Rym: Yeah So, uh, I really looking forward to PAX and as Scott reminded me I keep forgetting that PAX is four days long.

29
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:21,191
Rym: ah Shit, I could spend a whole day doing nothing about playing like indie RPGs or dive kick And I'd still have a whole packs.

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,216
Scott: Oh No Steak not as good as filet mignon.

31
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:34,300
Rym: Oh So, yeah, hopefully panels and all that stuff will be announced soon, but we're gonna be at PAX no matter what.

32
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,831
Rym: we'll be there doing shit Emily and I'll be at PAX.

33
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:42,964
Rym: dev Scott will not but All three of us are gonna be at that Charity gaming.

34
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:43,807
Rym: What do they call that thing?

35
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:44,631
Scott: I think it's sold out.

36
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:45,414
Scott: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

37
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:46,640
Scott: It probably went to it last year.

38
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,169
Rym: Yeah, that thing we went to last year.

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,010
Scott: It's a charity dinner to benefit Like this food bank that feed people.

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,480
Scott: there will be a link to it and it's basically Thursday night before packs come to this place get dinner and tabletop game.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,258
Rym: It was super fun.

42
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:11,468
Rym: But my warning to you is that if you want to go to it and you don't pay to be a VIP It's really hard to find space to play a game because there's so many people Mmm, and a lot of the pen.

43
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:17,451
Rym: also if you're gonna go and you're like us bring your own games Most of the games people brought were baby tear.

44
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:18,013
Rym: Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:19,760
Rym: There's not a lot of non baby tear.

46
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:29,509
Rym: So if you are at this thing, which I will look up what is called and link to it Uh, let us know because if you want to come into our VIP area We might invite you in where we will have.

47
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,380
Scott: we can invite non VIPs in the VIP area.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,313
Rym: I think after dinner, we're allowed to because we're not actually special.

49
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,216
Scott: We just paid for that.

50
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:37,220
Scott: Yeah, we're not have money.

51
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,475
Scott: It's not like oh, no, they care about us.

52
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,300
Rym: Here's a pile of money.

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Rym: What are you doing with it giving it to children who might be dying in children's hospitals so they can have video games.

54
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:48,930
Rym: Okay, that that's a worthwhile use of my money.

55
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,180
Rym: I've spent more money on stupider shit.

56
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,511
Rym: So I guess there's some news because Blizzard servers are down.

57
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:55,933
Rym: Yeah.

58
00:03:55,973 --> 00:04:00,451
Scott: Well, I don't know if they're still down but basically Hearthstone right and just so people know.

59
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,320
Scott: we know the guy who made Hearthstone.

60
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:12,179
Scott: Yeah, right and he gave us beta keys way back and I played it on PC And even though I know the guy gotta be honest It was kind of a lame simple game and everyone I played it on PC.

61
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,930
Scott: I was like, this is not worth my time.

62
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,579
Scott: and then it came out for iPad, huh?

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,296
Scott: It was a hundred percent the exact same goddamn game with no differences whatsoever that I could tell.

64
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,747
Scott: there's one important difference It's on the iPad.

65
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,177
Rym: You can play it while you're pooping.

66
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:27,580
Scott: That's right.

67
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,485
Scott: Think about this right?

68
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,973
Scott: I think I think this is why I'm playing it at all, right?

69
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,240
Scott: It's pay-to-win, which is already bullshit.

70
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:39,320
Scott: It's super random right because you'd only have two of any particular card in your deck.

71
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:50,904
Scott: So and a lot of the cards are just ridiculously random in them themselves like the card that says summon a random beast Which could summon the beast that wins you the game or could totally fuck you up, you know There's a card.

72
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:55,000
Scott: It says take all the minions on the board kill all of them except one at random.

73
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:56,668
Scott: It's ridiculous.

74
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:10,617
Scott: this game is crazy, but As a game if you're sitting at your PC or you have friends nearby and you can play a board game like you can play netrunner or you can play counter-strike or you can play pretty much any game because you're sitting at a PC or with friends.

75
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:14,499
Scott: Hearthstone just sucks ass compared to those games.

76
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:22,112
Scott: But think about where you can have an iPad on a bus Pooping alone in the park booping on a toilet.

77
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:22,774
Rym: Yep.

78
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,840
Scott: What better game can you play?

79
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:27,334
Scott: Than hearthstone against a human being.

80
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:31,118
Rym: Yeah Hex I can't play against a human while I'm pooping.

81
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:31,380
Rym: I'm playing.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,045
Scott: It's really lame compared to any real game, but compared to anything else you can play on an iPad When you're alone.

83
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:41,793
Scott: in certain situations, it's actually the best.

84
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:43,860
Scott: like what else is there angry birds?

85
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:53,379
Scott: Yeah, right and even though it's pay-to-win Which is bullshit It's I guess it's less pay-to-win.

86
00:05:53,721 --> 00:06:00,860
Scott: I mean you're still paying to win if you pay to get the awesome cards Like I lose to people just because they have awesome cards all the time, right?

87
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,496
Scott: There's no question, but it's not like some games like that mech or your game.

88
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:10,460
Scott: We talked about that failed Yeah, where you can literally just directly pay-to-win super hardcore.

89
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:20,771
Scott: Anyway, so they came out with this thing today curse of Naxxramas Yeah, which is actually single-player Hearthstone right and here's how it works.

90
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:33,607
Scott: Yeah, so there's five Winglings which are like campaigns I guess and each one has basically three opponents to play against right bosses and the bosses of like unique powers and unique decks or whatever.

91
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:36,968
Scott: and The first wing is free at least for a month.

92
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,540
Scott: at the end of the month the intro whatever that wing is gonna cost money.

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,376
Scott: And so all the other wings right all the other wings are gonna cost money no matter what.

94
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:48,951
Scott: they're gonna release one Wing a week, but the first one's free at least during the intro period.

95
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:50,175
Rym: yeah, I love this.

96
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,640
Rym: the first one is free, right?

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,880
Scott: So it's a say hey, you want some goofballs, so it's a single-player thing a normal mode.

98
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,973
Scott: You just pick one of your decks and play against the three bosses and beat them.

99
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:00,737
Scott: I already did that.

100
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,480
Scott: they were chumps.

101
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,208
Scott: I beat him real easily right?

102
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,640
Scott: then they have this mode.

103
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:13,453
Scott: That's like hero challenge mode where they give you a deck For each hero and you have to beat these bot.

104
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,862
Scott: you know that you have to basically beat it with the deck They give you.

105
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:16,905
Scott: I did that.

106
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:21,160
Scott: it was balls hard because they give you shitty decks and the opponents are ridiculously strong.

107
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,260
Scott: Yeah, and I they give you two and I think when you beat them then you get some more.

108
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,626
Scott: I haven't beaten any of them So I don't know how many like.

109
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,920
Scott: so if I beat one do I get one more or do I have to beat?

110
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,482
Scott: two to go?

111
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,772
Rym: that gave me an idea for a crazy magic tournament.

112
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:40,299
Rym: imagine if you did a draft and then Everyone submitted their deck, and then you got a random deck from the draft And then you played magic.

113
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:55,320
Scott: Anyway, so the If you when you beat the three initial bosses you get some cards right that you can use in real Hearthstone right and when you beat these challenges you unlock cards you can use in real hearthstone.

114
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,547
Rym: Wow the first post here is my only one.

115
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:00,315
Rym: who thinks that the new boss cards are overpowered you right.

116
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,886
Scott: the any card actual night Any legendary card is overpowered.

117
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,090
Scott: That's how basically how the game works.

118
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,913
Rym: spectral not ever.

119
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,658
Rym: this whole thread is already people.

120
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:08,140
Rym: today.

121
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,955
Rym: Dateline five thirty two p.m.. Today.

122
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,100
Scott: this thing came out this afternoon.

123
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,710
Rym: Yes, spectral night is way overpowered.

124
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,380
Scott: all the cards in the game that are legendary are overpowered.

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,866
Scott: It's pay to win that.

126
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:23,080
Scott: the rare expensive hard to get cards are up.

127
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,275
Scott: Just better if you have them you will beat someone who does not have them.

128
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:27,320
Rym: yep anyway.

129
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:32,806
Scott: So and then they have this like super hard mode which is like I think you do this.

130
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:37,480
Scott: I haven't even try it But if you beat that you get super awesome ridiculously good cards.

131
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:41,620
Scott: But I think that I think you can use your own decks on that, but it's supposed to be ridiculously hard.

132
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:42,828
Scott: I haven't played it, so I don't know.

133
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,078
Scott: so that's the thing.

134
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,600
Scott: luckily You don't have to use real money to buy these other wings when they go on sale.

135
00:08:50,501 --> 00:09:01,970
Scott: You can use in-game money that you got just by playing the game, so I actually haven't spent any of the in-game money I've gotten for weeks just so That I don't have to pay to get this other stuff.

136
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:04,960
Rym: you engaged in forethought and planning to make this happen.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,683
Scott: Well, it's like you know.

138
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:12,459
Scott: they've been teasing this shit for a long time right, so I have like 1,700 in-game golds Which is enough to buy 17 packs of cards?

139
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,198
Scott: But I'm gonna use it to buy this shit instead.

140
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,120
Rym: Interesting how hearthstone is becoming pretty wildly popular and the people who play it are really into the competitive scene right?

141
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,462
Scott: It's like.

142
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:25,880
Scott: I'm really curious.

143
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:26,923
Scott: What if someone?

144
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:32,838
Scott: the reason it's popular is because you know it fills a niche that no other video game fills.

145
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:33,380
Scott: really it's free.

146
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,527
Scott: It's a two-player directly competitive game.

147
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:53,399
Scott: you like this custom deck building thing going on right and The interface of it the actual application is pretty much as polished and amazing as can be and it's on the iPad and the desktop And it's exactly the same and you know it's just so well made as a piece of software.

148
00:09:53,419 --> 00:10:01,460
Scott: if Someone did this for a real game that was similar, but like wasn't pay-to-win and wasn't So luck-based.

149
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,430
Scott: Imagine how well that would do if the software was just as good.

150
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:19,563
Rym: possibly poorly because as we learned from Team Fortress 2 High-tier players represent a very small minority of actual gamers and games that are actually Primarily skill based like chess tend to be very unpopular among people who aren't very good Mmm.

151
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:22,163
Scott: I just like to see Blizzard You know put the same.

152
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:31,722
Scott: you know the programmers and artists who made this so nicely to make say an online turn-based strategy Two-player game that's not pay-to-win Adventure.

153
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:38,576
Scott: somehow blizzard just buy the advance Wars license and just say they don't have to make it man So as they can just make like Starcraft tactics or some shit.

154
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:42,389
Rym: Yeah I'm really kind of married to the advance Wars aesthetic at this point.

155
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,653
Scott: I'll take space Marines.

156
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:44,476
Rym: Okay.

157
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:48,509
Scott: We are space Marines That's right, so that's the deal with that.

158
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:57,860
Rym: so in other news a games coming for the 3ds But I'm actually not gonna buy right away because my policy on all things Nintendo has gone from buy out of hand to wait and see.

159
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:07,916
Rym: Yep, even this Tetris ultimate was announced with the most pathetic Teaser trailer I have ever seen in my life.

160
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:09,322
Rym: I did.

161
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:12,692
Scott: how else can you what else gonna show from Tetris blocks falling?

162
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,180
Rym: It's literally just the word Tetris.

163
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,654
Scott: That's all you need to know.

164
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:17,280
Scott: that's the trailer.

165
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,124
Scott: What else do you need to know?

166
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,893
Rym: so I'm worried about it in a few ways.

167
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:31,166
Rym: on one hand is probably gonna be fun but the biggest fun of Tetris on the DS was that a whole bunch of us would play live multiplayer Right, and also it had this one awesome.

168
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:35,740
Rym: Yes themes and yes, this one does not appear to have any NES themed stuff.

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:43,168
Rym: it's more me themed and they list the modes that they've got here and The battle mode says one to four player brawl.

170
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,412
Rym: Mmm the fuck.

171
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:46,880
Rym: Where's my 16 player brawl?

172
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:48,685
Scott: Where's my 128 player?

173
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,633
Scott: Yeah has to be a power of two.

174
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:52,180
Scott: We can't have a 17 player brawl.

175
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:57,965
Rym: Well, unless you had the Turbografx-16 sure Five player games.

176
00:11:58,246 --> 00:11:58,728
Scott: I mean it's some.

177
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:00,715
Scott: one person gets a Tetris everyone else dies, right?

178
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,000
Scott: It's not it's not good.

179
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,326
Rym: So anyway, I'm curious why.

180
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:11,209
Rym: because that really wide multiplayer battle in the DS was 90% of our play of that game.

181
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,660
Rym: the other 10% was that weird dual mode.

182
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,000
Rym: We're throwing Tetris like at each other in the middle.

183
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:21,300
Scott: The point is Tetris is official and unofficial have been released for pretty much every hardware platform known to man.

184
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:30,430
Scott: But the best ones the true Tetris's are always the ones in the portable Nintendo system the Game Boy one The NES one kinda the DS one.

185
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:31,153
Scott: Definitely.

186
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,918
Scott: I guess the SNES and n64?

187
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,127
Scott: well SNES had Tetris and dr.

188
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,276
Scott: Mario which is an okay cartridge, but wasn't it.

189
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:40,641
Scott: and then Tetris 64.

190
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:51,291
Rym: So Tetris ultimate is also being launched later this summer on PlayStation 4 Xbox one PlayStation Vita windows, but I mean 3ds is gonna be the legit one.

191
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:51,632
Scott: right?

192
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,775
Scott: who's gonna play those other ones.

193
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,742
Rym: I Don't know.

194
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:57,640
Rym: I mean, what about all the people who didn't buy a 3ds for the same reason?

195
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,337
Scott: So all of know all of nobody there's people who didn't buy 3ds.

196
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,708
Scott: Who do you know that does not have a 3ds Emily?

197
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,792
Scott: She has a DS.

198
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:04,495
Rym: She has a DS.

199
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,077
Rym: Yeah, no 3ds.

200
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,012
Scott: I think she'll be fine.

201
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,533
Rym: Yeah We'll see.

202
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,919
Scott: This is legit Tetris right here.

203
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:20,429
Rym: But I worry that this is gonna be like the WarioWare situation where it's gonna be a legit Tetris that just isn't as Good as the previous one.

204
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,680
Scott: like it always says you don't think it'll be good as DS Tetris.

205
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,076
Rym: I worry it might not be the only thing I think it'll let.

206
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:25,720
Scott: it's lacking.

207
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:32,853
Scott: Knowing nothing about it other than the name I predict it won't lack anything except the cool NES themes and the many-player battling.

208
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:39,576
Rym: four players is enough Tetris battling Yeah, but we almost always when we were doing this have more than four players wanna play tetranet.

209
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,584
Rym: Oh Yeah, tetranet.

210
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,211
Scott: Tetranet is hardcore Tetris.

211
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:43,673
Scott: You can't play it.

212
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:44,777
Scott: You'll just lose immediately.

213
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:46,783
Scott: Yeah people like No.

214
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:51,320
Rym: as an aside, uh, we talked about this a lot at least everyone over here in our crew except Scott.

215
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:59,629
Rym: but we finally got together and played a multiplayer game of the newest most updated most expansion civilization 5 ain't gonna know.

216
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:05,347
Rym: I got time for that and you know what it's working really well and Let me do it technologically.

217
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,771
Rym: Yeah, I'll get to that.

218
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,540
Rym: So all at one it took us an hour to start the game.

219
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:10,389
Rym: Okay, already.

220
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:21,919
Rym: No one got time for that But once we got it going I just want to let you guys in on one of the one of the reasons why our gaming Group is so closed and insular and why no one will game with you out there.

221
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,966
Rym: We set no turn timer No turn limit.

222
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:33,200
Rym: You can take an hour to take your turn and everyone has to wait Because we trusted everyone playing and you know what?

223
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,904
Rym: It was not a problem.

224
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:46,560
Rym: if you play games with any person where you would not trust To leave that option the way that we left it your gaming group is someday going to explode in drama and fail.

225
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:52,040
Scott: Or if you're the person who says no, no, we need to make it unlimited because I need to think you're the problem.

226
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:53,358
Scott: Yeah, take your turn.

227
00:14:54,321 --> 00:15:00,660
Rym: So it was super fun and they fixed most of the issues like the look like how does the timing issue work now?

228
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:10,498
Scott: Like if I'm got guys next to each other and I'm gonna attack you You were going to attack me if you do something that would cause war including just declaring war.

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,279
Rym: it Reminds you like are you sure?

230
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,721
Rym: Fucking sure.

231
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:21,898
Rym: and then what it'll do is everyone who's not at war can take their turns per turn simultaneously.

232
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,000
Rym: Then the people at war take their turns sequentially.

233
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:30,760
Scott: So if I'm not at war I get to go first or second or third or whatever, right?

234
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,592
Rym: But I mean, it's just it's parallel with everyone else is not at war.

235
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:33,953
Scott: Right?

236
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,620
Scott: So let's say you're warring with Scott Johnson.

237
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,872
Scott: Yes, I want to jump in and attack you.

238
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:42,623
Scott: I get to do that before you do your war with Turn.

239
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,220
Rym: if you attack it says attacking will declare war.

240
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,942
Rym: Do you want to?

241
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:51,300
Rym: and if you say yes, and then you get added to the turn order of all of us going to war.

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,304
Scott: So I get my turn.

243
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:55,055
Scott: that turn gets shifted as basically art your turn stops.

244
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:56,180
Scott: You'll get to continue it later.

245
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,860
Rym: You'll basically yes your turn now will be in the sequence.

246
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:02,978
Scott: Well, my my attacking dude gets a move before your guy.

247
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:03,420
Rym: it depends.

248
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,559
Rym: So you obviously have not played this at all.

249
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:11,619
Rym: So in multiplayer, it shows all the people who are in the game left to right at the bottom And it shows you who didn't fucking take their turn yet.

250
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:17,533
Rym: Yeah But - if there's war They the order will always go left to right on that.

251
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:18,900
Rym: that's just set at the beginning of the game.

252
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,320
Scott: So, you know, that order doesn't change ever.

253
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,060
Rym: Yes, cuz if you play without hybrid mode and just pure turn-based it just goes in that order for the entire game.

254
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:32,920
Rym: Okay, so in hybrid mode of the people at war it goes in that order every turn for them.

255
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:44,160
Scott: So if I always go before you from the start of the game any war we have then I can just nuke you before you can Respond, you know one turn I declared war against link eg primarily because he was to the right.

256
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:45,465
Scott: That's a good idea.

257
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:45,907
Rym: Also.

258
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:48,800
Rym: We founded fucking Humber right next to my capital.

259
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,770
Rym: It's like dude, you see these six catapults.

260
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,452
Rym: I built right?

261
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,339
Rym: What do you think's gonna happen?

262
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,382
Scott: Actually

263
00:16:56,402 --> 00:17:00,239
Rym: horsemen, so I went over and I stole his worker and then I was like

264
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:00,882
Scott: fuck Yeah,

265
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:07,660
Rym: and then I was immediately like I will gladly sue for peace If you don't want to have the returns take forever because of this war, but he tried to get the worker back.

266
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:15,380
Rym: Hold the worker hostage in your capital Yeah, so I ran and then he cut me off so I couldn't get the worker back to one of my city.

267
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:18,038
Rym: So eventually I ran north and north and north bandit.

268
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,877
Rym: So I threw it into a city-state and I tried to gift it to that city-state.

269
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:27,410
Rym: Yeah, even better Yeah, and then this work better more than disbanding it.

270
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,900
Rym: So later his I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

271
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,949
Rym: There's some crazy bullshit happened.

272
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,978
Rym: So there's this this is going on.

273
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:34,480
Rym: We're at war.

274
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:39,298
Rym: I'm giving the play-by-play on the all talk voice chat because there's a bunch of us in this game.

275
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,869
Rym: Mm-hmm And everyone's like, how's the war going Rym?

276
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,360
Rym: And I'm like, I've got Humber down to half health.

277
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,207
Rym: I got Humber down to a quarter health.

278
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:51,615
Rym: Scott Johnson out of nowhere declares war Marches in and takes Humber.

279
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:52,279
Scott: Yeah.

280
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:54,420
Rym: So now Scott Johnson has Humber.

281
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,644
Scott: Humbert's hot and Hans is you tonic.

282
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:57,026
Scott: Awesome.

283
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,132
Rym: Yeah kinda sucks in our world.

284
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,199
Rym: It's mostly in the desert, right?

285
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,205
Rym: He considered raising it.

286
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,072
Rym: So now Scott Johnson has it.

287
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,960
Rym: So, of course, I have to declare war on Scott Johnson.

288
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,895
Scott: I thought you meant the rows like the real world.

289
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:09,419
Scott: I was like what?

290
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,218
Scott: Humbert is not in the desert.

291
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,146
Rym: So I declare war on Scott Johnson.

292
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:18,820
Rym: we fight a little bit and now we gotta back up a little bit like eight turns prior.

293
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:28,849
Rym: I proposed peace To link eg as a show of good faith because I was gonna turn my fucking army around on Scott Johnson Mm-hmm and and just end the wars.

294
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:33,192
Scott: We were thinking of ganging up on you wisely But I don't vote for him to win the vote.

295
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:33,755
Scott: who wins game.

296
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:37,046
Rym: So I yeah I'll tell you who we actually voted for to win.

297
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:38,611
Scott: I had Johnson.

298
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:43,426
Rym: Scott Johnson gives it to me to end our war Partly because he realized it sucks.

299
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:44,872
Rym: He was like, I'm out.

300
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:48,660
Rym: It's cost more to have it than yeah I want it cuz it's next to my capital.

301
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,758
Scott: So just expand it and move it.

302
00:18:51,361 --> 00:19:09,050
Rym: So I have it but it's a little tenuous cuz I have my army marching over to like secure it and like fill it Out and then link eg gets a bunch of guys near it attacks it suddenly and takes it from me no big deal like I'm literally surrounded with my catapults and Then accepts the peace overture that I didn't realize you could rescind.

303
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,698
Rym: and we're at guaranteed peace for ten turns.

304
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,168
Scott: Oh So clever.

305
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,842
Rym: that was so beautiful It was.

306
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:17,947
Rym: it was the thing to see.

307
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:24,126
Rym: so so this these wars are ongoing in Foxton for a while.

308
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,633
Scott: Why did you rescind your piece?

309
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:26,938
Rym: I didn't know you could.

310
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:33,080
Rym: I Did not when he was like what the fuck just happened to Hamburg and I hear him in the voice chat just laughing.

311
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,671
Scott: He knows he knows the game better than you.

312
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:41,513
Rym: so meanwhile We're all on one continent except for cold guy and Pegu.

313
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,839
Rym: They're alone on the other continent.

314
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:54,016
Rym: cold guys score has just been steadily rising faster than all of us and We're kind of waiting for the black ships to come over and fuck up our continent.

315
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:56,968
Scott: So Pegu is not having a good time.

316
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,936
Rym: Thank you is not doing so well over there.

317
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:06,600
Rym: So Anyone in my continent We need to present a unified front against cold guys.

318
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:10,175
Rym: Expected foreign aggression with his superior technology boats.

319
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,664
Scott: So Anti-boat weaponry.

320
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,770
Rym: I really need Hamburg.

321
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:18,040
Rym: So and all the city-states so I can lead that charge.

322
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,565
Rym: I need you guys to help.

323
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,549
Scott: you can lead the charge.

324
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:27,396
Scott: other words vote for him to win because if he leads your side of The world and then you beat the other side of the world is the only threat to him then he wins.

325
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:28,059
Rym: nothing wrong with.

326
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:38,204
Scott: You should vote for a different leader on your side of the world because that's who's going to win the game Assuming that you can even Pretty fucking ahead.

327
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:38,746
Rym: We're gonna have.

328
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:41,113
Scott: you guys are gonna have like trucks.

329
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,200
Scott: You know, we invented the truck and I guess stealth bombers.

330
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,486
Rym: But yeah took us an hour to start the game.

331
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,331
Scott: invent radio and then what do you hear?

332
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,833
Rym: like Rufus got his sieve 5 crash Nine times he was like guys like I'm sorry.

333
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:58,980
Rym: I need to look at a computer.

334
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:02,394
Rym: I know sieve 5 just like disconnected him from the game for like no reason.

335
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:09,785
Rym: other people got disconnected Randomly every now in the game and just the game would just be like well fuck and then we'd all go to a loading screen For like 10 minutes.

336
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,720
Scott: Yeah, so glad I didn't waste my time on that.

337
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,220
Rym: It's super fun mostly because we were just hanging out in the voice chat.

338
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,520
Rym: But seriously sieve 5s multiplayer is like it is a millimeter above the line of unplayable.

339
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:21,943
Rym: I can't.

340
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,674
Scott: we just do the play by mails or whatever.

341
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:25,543
Rym: I Want to.

342
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:26,446
Rym: we'll see.

343
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:28,030
Rym: I kind of like hanging out.

344
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:29,073
Scott: I got time for that.

345
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:30,257
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

346
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:38,778
Rym: We'll see things of the day.

347
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:42,160
Rym: Just watch this video just to see what the deal is with this.

348
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,346
Rym: There's a game an ancient game.

349
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:49,760
Rym: in the year 1994 epic mega games released a game called one must fall.

350
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,100
Scott: 2090 talked about this on a recent GeekNights.

351
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:55,298
Rym: We've talked about it a lot But we haven't really gone into detail.

352
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:56,785
Rym: Watch this video.

353
00:21:57,046 --> 00:22:03,347
Rym: this game has some of the greatest music of its era and it's interesting because Scott and I love this game yet.

354
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:07,120
Rym: It does the kinds of things that we typically say are shit in games.

355
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,180
Scott: Well, it's a fighting game, but as RPG elements.

356
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,941
Scott: So imagine if like my Ryu has a leveled up fireball, so it doesn't matter how good I am at the game I just beat you cuz my reuse level 100.

357
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:25,414
Rym: Yep, it goes to show that when we complain about like statefulness or all these things in games It's not because any of these concepts are universally bad.

358
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:26,920
Rym: It's just that they're applied poorly.

359
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:31,200
Rym: This is a game that does many of the things that we think are bad in most games.

360
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,939
Rym: It does them well, and as a result, it was a good game.

361
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:42,227
Rym: However, it is not a good fighting game by the modern definition of fighting game Good music and cool robots.

362
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:43,654
Rym: It's also the kind of I have a chance at.

363
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:48,989
Scott: So here's another game is it?

364
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:58,276
Scott: apparently this game existed called Matrix path of neo which is some sort of matrix based like third-person walk-around action game.

365
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:03,029
Scott: that based Basically retells the three matrix movies one two three, right?

366
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,000
Scott: Yeah, and you play as neo doing whatever and it's not a very good game.

367
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,757
Scott: I guess it could be worse, but it's not good.

368
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:17,612
Scott: The interesting thing about this game is that it's got so much videos in it right and like the Wachowski brothers actually worked on this game directed it

369
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:18,535
Rym: like they're in it

370
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:27,548
Scott: like it was a movie and They changed the ending because the ending of the third matrix movie while also bad as a movie would even be worse as a video game.

371
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:27,897
Scott: yeah.

372
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:32,672
Scott: So the ending of the video game is completely different and incredible.

373
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:37,740
Scott: and his YouTube video where you can watch it without having to Acquire or play this horrible game spoilers.

374
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,060
Rym: Also, I guess that are we pirating the game?

375
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:46,413
Rym: No, no the book club book is a canticle for Lebowitz.

376
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:51,553
Rym: I'm on my fifth novel I'm beginning that I've read since I finished it waiting for Scott to finish it.

377
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:53,000
Scott: I haven't read any books.

378
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:55,266
Scott: Yeah, I'm doing up the stuff.

379
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,517
Rym: We were at ConnectiCon video and stuff is coming as you.

380
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:03,160
Rym: if you follow me on Twitter You might have seen that we did something that other cons just don't fuck.

381
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Scott: I don't think any con has ever done what we're doing.

382
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,620
Rym: We publish the detailed stats of who is how many people were in panel rooms for the entire con?

383
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:14,990
Rym: Like the half-hour by half-hour breakdown?

384
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:19,824
Rym: mmm as soon as I predict all the internal notes We have in the full stats.

385
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,047
Rym: I'm publishing it all.

386
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:24,055
Scott: so how many people went to each individual panel?

387
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:27,887
Rym: yup exact numbers Room capacities everything.

388
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,613
Scott: well that might you know.

389
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:36,400
Scott: you aren't some guests gonna get upset when we Publish the fact that like 20 people went to the panel only 10 people came to our 8 in the morning.

390
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,678
Rym: Why no one will game with you panel that's true.

391
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:41,468
Rym: yet We filled the room for our anime panel.

392
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,230
Scott: when was that?

393
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:45,240
Rym: uh one two I forget.

394
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:48,207
Scott: Kinetic ons crowd is anime.

395
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:51,796
Rym: what was very interesting is that there we had so few anime submissions.

396
00:24:52,177 --> 00:24:56,789
Rym: yet the anime panels We did schedule were pretty much universally some of the most popular shit We had.

397
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:09,117
Rym: yeah But also this data was crucial because multiple people complained that the panels they wanted to get into were full And I could look at the stats and tell them actually there are more than a hundred seats free.

398
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,564
Rym: you could have just walked in At any point.

399
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,660
Scott: you didn't need to wait in line for that panel.

400
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,552
Scott: And you know I tell people you don't do wait in line for this.

401
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:18,914
Scott: just show up and walk in unless you want to sit In the front you don't need to do that.

402
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:28,141
Rym: more important We have learned that a majority of the people who say they've tried to go to a panel, but it was full were lying Lying.

403
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,086
Rym: they said a panel was full.

404
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:34,720
Scott: that was objectively not full unless our panel staff were lying.

405
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,669
Scott: No, they were not clickers.

406
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,352
Scott: They weren't lying.

407
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:42,499
Rym: yep one guy was like Oh, I saw someone with a clicker count in line and assumed that I wasn't gonna get in.

408
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,657
Rym: it's like Why would you assume that?

409
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,708
Rym: Like I was the clicker walked past you and kept clicking.

410
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:48,892
Scott: people are just really bad.

411
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:52,505
Scott: a lot of people complain about lines because they Know nothing about lines.

412
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:55,357
Scott: they see a line and they're like though that lines too long and never gonna get in.

413
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:57,527
Scott: it's like yeah That line goes all the way down the hallway.

414
00:25:57,547 --> 00:25:59,053
Scott: That's like 200 people.

415
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,600
Scott: that room has four or five hundred seats.

416
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:01,140
Rym: Oh my god.

417
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:10,118
Rym: there were these home stocks in line to get into one of the much the very large rooms and I'm walking down the line counting and This kid and his and all his friends are like we're not gonna get in are we?

418
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:10,823
Rym: hey hey Do you that?

419
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,780
Rym: are we gonna make it and I look down the line?

420
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,197
Rym: I'm like there's like 40 people in front of you.

421
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:22,878
Rym: kid This room seats 400 and he was like dumbstruck one that there were so few people in that line.

422
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:27,320
Rym: yep So yeah ConnectiCon fucking awesome, but next count for us is packs.

423
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,346
Scott: I'm actually I gotta tell the story.

424
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:35,246
Scott: so there's some people waiting for a panel way early in advance 90 minutes to an hour two hours in advance why?

425
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:43,848
Scott: and there's like ten of them and it's a gigantic room and I know 100% it's not gonna fill that they could just walk right and I go to them and I'm like Why are you guys waiting here?

426
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,800
Scott: You could just go enjoy the con and come back.

427
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,508
Scott: I guarantee you will get in this room.

428
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:47,970
Scott: I swear.

429
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,189
Scott: and they were like no Kind of want to wait in line.

430
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:57,456
Scott: one guy had his 3ds And he's just like I'd either be playing this 3ds here somewhere else, so what difference does it make?

431
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:04,504
Scott: yeah, and I'm like Seriously, it's like you paid to get to this con and all you want to do is sit around and play your 3ds That you could do at home.

432
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:04,986
Scott: You don't want it.

433
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:07,959
Rym: We do that for the omega-thon finale every year at PAX.

434
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:13,757
Scott: Yeah, but if we walk right in just at the end we won't get near the front or anything.

435
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,899
Rym: yeah I said you actually we always go up and sit in the fucking balcony anyway.

436
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,085
Scott: well But it's the point is it's like You know.

437
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,949
Scott: I said if you don't actually care about being in the front Then you could just walk right in.

438
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,840
Scott: true true, but I cared about being actually.

439
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,392
Rym: I'm just I don't trust anyone, and I'm afraid I'm not gonna get it.

440
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:31,020
Rym: I've never missed an omega-thon.

441
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:32,264
Scott: I did.

442
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:36,550
Scott: I miss one I know and I missed the ones in 07 oh six oh five.

443
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:42,255
Rym: I got to watch the cornhole one from backstage And it's I watched the Cornell one from right near the cornhole.

444
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,480
Rym: Yeah, or no I saw a bunch of people in Williamsburg playing cornhole.

445
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:50,158
Rym: Oh Colonels not that fun, but it's not unfun.

446
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,410
Scott: Listen you could do worse than cornhole, but you can also do better.

447
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:55,157
Rym: You know what worse would be?

448
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:55,940
Rym: horseshoes?

449
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,025
Rym: Yeah, better.

450
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:58,574
Scott: better would be bad men.

451
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:02,988
Rym: ah bocce Bocce's way better.

452
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:03,932
Rym: Shuffleboard's alright.

453
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:04,334
Rym: Curling.

454
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:05,297
Scott: Curling sucks.

455
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:05,900
Rym: Curling's awesome.

456
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,899
Rym: Anyway anyway, so a while ago I talked on GeekNights about Ingress because you know I had Android and I'm kind of trying to do all the Google stuff, so I played it.

457
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,311
Rym: I did it like a preview review, but Scott couldn't play it.

458
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,860
Rym: Emily couldn't play it cuz iPhone and now it's on iOS.

459
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:28,580
Rym: Everyone can play it and as a smartphone it as I said before and Scott will concur.

460
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,382
Rym: now He's been playing it.

461
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,932
Rym: it is if I had to give it a genre.

462
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:39,093
Rym: It's in that like ARG space But it's pretty much a multiplayer versus candy box.

463
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:46,354
Rym: It is candy box in the sense that You are better at it if you click more within it like just do more.

464
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:46,895
Rym: Yeah, there's.

465
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,420
Scott: no there's no real skill.

466
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,677
Scott: There's some strategies, but they're obvious.

467
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,145
Scott: But most of the game is just.

468
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:57,640
Scott: you will be able to do better shit if you spend more time playing this game.

469
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:01,776
Rym: Yep, I mean I'm level seven and I got that almost level four.

470
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:06,800
Rym: so I got to level six Just by five just by kind of like idly playing like at work like I just heck stuff.

471
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,877
Scott: Are there nodes like you can reach from your office port?

472
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:09,942
Scott: Yes Yeah, I can't.

473
00:29:10,203 --> 00:29:12,251
Scott: I have to like move around a little bit to get hit some.

474
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:17,680
Scott: I can hit three portals pretty reliably from my Office like there's a bunch near my house, and there's a bunch near my work.

475
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,616
Scott: But I actually like go outside and walk around a little bit.

476
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:20,060
Rym: yep.

477
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:24,020
Rym: So if I walk around I can hit like 30 portals in about five minutes.

478
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:26,582
Scott: I can hit like maybe 10.

479
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:30,774
Rym: East City Hall Park is a hive and it'll be all of late's.

480
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:33,804
Rym: blue green blue green Like day by day.

481
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:38,840
Scott: if I take the subway to work I can hit so many portals just riding the subway above ground.

482
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:42,770
Scott: And if I go walking around work at lunch I can hit a ton of freaking portals.

483
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,642
Scott: the most portal if I bike to work I can't.

484
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,480
Scott: I could hit probably a zillion, but the problem is I can't really do it while I'm biking.

485
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:55,313
Rym: Yeah That's the one thing cuz I'd and I also don't want to stop biking like when I go home like I don't hold my phone Bike slowly stop at every portal.

486
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:55,777
Scott: fuck that.

487
00:29:55,918 --> 00:30:04,359
Rym: yeah I'm like there's a really good high-level portal at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge that I captured at one point While I was waiting for Emily like I fucked that thing up blew my whole load on it.

488
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:10,740
Rym: But the most I ever hacked at once was when I was taking a cab in London to the airport from my hotel.

489
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,511
Rym: I just had it open and I just hacked everything I passed.

490
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:15,975
Rym: I hacked like a hundred portals.

491
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:18,258
Rym: I Had so much shit.

492
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:23,982
Scott: I have a lot of shit because I mostly what I do riding when I rode the subway and I'll probably ride tomorrow cuz it's Gonna rain.

493
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:24,907
Rym: a lot of shit Scott.

494
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,819
Rym: I have like 300 level one resonators.

495
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:28,265
Scott: I have like a hundred.

496
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:28,345
Scott: huh.

497
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:32,120
Scott: I had like in the like even the level three resonators the ones I can use.

498
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,521
Scott: I like.

499
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,295
Rym: pity thing is I got a ton of level aids that I can't use mmm.

500
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:37,539
Scott: I don't have anything as level eight.

501
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,020
Scott: Yeah, you know they'll talk about that.

502
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,538
Scott: They only give you something that's one level higher than you because that way when you level up you have stuff to use.

503
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,977
Scott: yeah Which is brilliant yeah, but they don't let you get like.

504
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:47,540
Scott: I'm level three.

505
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,236
Scott: I can't get level five stuff, which I might give to you.

506
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,660
Rym: yeah, but again It's brilliant game design like this little bit.

507
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,300
Rym: So the way the game works in a general sense is that you have an Android phone or an iPhone?

508
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,137
Rym: You can walk around like it's GPS enabled and there's portals on shit like.

509
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:05,773
Scott: there's just a portal Map of the real world and there's portals in the real world and they're actually.

510
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:14,416
Scott: each portal is attached to a physical object in the real world like murals or Post offices the fire alarm thingies on the street near me.

511
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:17,466
Scott: those are all portals Statues in the park.

512
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:19,938
Rym: pretty much every work of art in City Hall Park is there.

513
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,608
Scott: yeah There's a zipcar that has the portal on it.

514
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:24,797
Scott: Yeah, I think that might be a paid advertisement.

515
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:25,299
Scott: I'm not sure.

516
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,627
Rym: no I've added portals for weird stuff like that.

517
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,393
Scott: anyway has a zipcar logo in the game.

518
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:30,839
Rym: Yeah, you can do that all right.

519
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:32,548
Rym: So uh you go.

520
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:39,240
Rym: if you if you're physically next to a portal You've got to be really close, then you can hack it and get items out of it and get XP.

521
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:42,053
Scott: It doesn't matter if it's good friendly or neutral.

522
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:45,067
Rym: now if it's a good portal Green means good.

523
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,136
Scott: if you're not in the green team go fuck yourself.

524
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:49,329
Scott: Yeah Let's talk about.

525
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,549
Scott: let's talk about the story Let's do a little cuz.

526
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:59,830
Scott: I don't give a shit about the lore But there's the tiniest bit of lore is when you turn the thing on for the first time it says Which team do you want to be?

527
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,280
Scott: and it's a permanent one-time decision?

528
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:11,094
Rym: And it gives you a little bit of info about like the vague idea that both are Fighting for right the blue team the shit team right is the rebellion and the green team.

529
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:13,259
Scott: the enlightened are the smart good people.

530
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,863
Scott: The smart good people are like Technology is awesome.

531
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:23,137
Rym: a little bit further so the plot is that there's so you know the golden compass dust.

532
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:25,554
Rym: yep Dust is falling on earth.

533
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:28,428
Rym: spice Dust spice is falling on earth.

534
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:31,640
Rym: Yeah, and it's coming out of these portals that are just appearing everywhere.

535
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,442
Rym: Mm-hmm.

536
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:39,540
Rym: so the green people the smart people say wow this dust is powerful and makes humans who use it powerful.

537
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,780
Rym: Let's use this to evolve humanity to the next level of awesome powerful existence and be awesome forever.

538
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:49,140
Scott: How is that not the greatest and in totally in line?

539
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,245
Scott: Philosophies of GeekNights.

540
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:53,956
Rym: the blue team is like human exceptionalism.

541
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:54,880
Rym: don't evolve.

542
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:59,880
Rym: Avoid this scary shit from space fight it off maintain our life.

543
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,396
Scott: This is why we're going to use our awesome powers and just kill everyone in the blue team.

544
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:11,880
Rym: yep pretty much so You get you join a team and then if a portal is oh by the way the evil blue team is outnumbering the green team.

545
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:12,985
Rym: Oh, we flipped it back.

546
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:13,748
Rym: Just recently.

547
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,114
Rym: It's it's a pretty close fight right now.

548
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,359
Scott: Yeah, let's fuck him in the ass.

549
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:35,148
Rym: So basically if you if a portal is unclaimed you can put resonators around it in the real world to claim it And if you get eight port resonators around it then it's like fully loaded and then Resonators have levels and the average of all the all the resonator levels that you've got in a fully loaded portal Determine the portals level.

550
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:42,094
Rym: the higher level the portal the more energy It's collected and got the further you can make links from it to like.

551
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:45,306
Rym: you can make miles miles miles away links But you don't really want to.

552
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:46,873
Scott: you know I mean in New York you don't need to.

553
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:47,697
Scott: it's got her to make.

554
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,067
Scott: is the idea You want to link portals together?

555
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:55,106
Scott: is you capture them for your team and two portals are captured for your team And they're fully loaded with resonators.

556
00:33:55,126 --> 00:34:04,460
Scott: you can link them together, and if you make a triangle between three You know portals full of resonators that triangle fills together and becomes a field.

557
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:11,985
Scott: So the best thing to do is the game doesn't care how big the field is it just cares that it's a field and the field Unit field you're.

558
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:19,295
Rym: basically you bring the brains of the humans who are not Enlightened enough to realize this war is happening in the lore.

559
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:22,665
Rym: you basically Augment their brain.

560
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:31,149
Rym: so you have sort of like your faction sort of controls the collected mental energy of the people Under that based on a statistical model of actual population.

561
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:35,880
Rym: so a tiny field like in Manhattan is a lot of points.

562
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:38,728
Scott: Yeah, and so those MU's the mind units.

563
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,254
Scott: those are the actual points.

564
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:42,139
Scott: you that score for your team, right?

565
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,143
Scott: That's the real points.

566
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,772
Scott: That's the victory points in this game.

567
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:45,274
Rym: Yeah, right.

568
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,967
Scott: so when you look at the chart That shows blue slightly edging out green.

569
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:50,851
Scott: That's mind unit points.

570
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:51,915
Scott: It's counting right.

571
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:53,580
Scott: so there you go.

572
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,667
Rym: Yep, so you make these fields.

573
00:34:55,706 --> 00:35:02,566
Rym: your goal is basically to control a majority of Earth's population Or your faction And set up portals.

574
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:04,333
Rym: they do like air just things all over the world.

575
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:04,854
Rym: you should see.

576
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:06,420
Rym: I actually I got into a huge war.

577
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,064
Rym: I still have.

578
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:11,597
Rym: I had a portal that I took over in Turkey and I eventually lost it.

579
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:17,332
Rym: But my faction still hold nadu, and I got the key so I can check out about it every now And then mmm every time I go back there.

580
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:17,996
Rym: I fuck it up.

581
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:32,566
Rym: Yeah And then you can attack portals too, so if a portals on the enemy team you can hack it But you can also attack it and if you destroy the resonators you can take down its links Take it down completely reclaim it for your own team and The attacks are also physical.

582
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,560
Rym: you gotta physically go find that fucking portal and attack it.

583
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,073
Scott: Yeah, attacking it kind of sucks depending on the weapons you have.

584
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:42,860
Scott: I think the only weapons I've seen are X MPs which are sort of these radius attacks.

585
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:49,520
Scott: Yeah, and when you use them It's like slow, and it takes a lot of energy it takes a lot of time, and they're not very strong.

586
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,923
Rym: Yeah, wait.

587
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:58,764
Rym: Yeah, so my high level ones like if I use a level 7 X MP I'll take out like in one shot every level one resonator within like 500 meters.

588
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:00,049
Scott: oh they have a bigger radius.

589
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:03,180
Rym: the higher level ones have bigger radius and do way more damage.

590
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:05,000
Scott: I didn't know they bigger radius

591
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:06,561
Rym: Can

592
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:12,121
Scott: fuck some shit up and then as these ultra strikes which are like nukes and they're harder to get I only have a few They

593
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:14,169
Rym: they hit a tiny area devastatingly

594
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,860
Scott: yeah, but it's like if you want to take out one portal just use the ultra strike.

595
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,720
Rym: Yeah Like go over to one individual level 8 resonator and just drop two ultra strikes on it can probably take it out.

596
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:27,159
Scott: So the other thing is that you know when you're capturing a portal putting resonators on it You can put these mods on there.

597
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,950
Rym: Yeah Like shields and heat sinks and I like it.

598
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,551
Rym: the turrets.

599
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:33,396
Scott: the turrets are good because the turret does.

600
00:36:33,436 --> 00:36:41,128
Scott: is anyone tries to fuck up The portal or hack it and it's an enemy the turret will fuck them up and drain their energy So that it's harder for them to attack it.

601
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:44,694
Scott: You know constantly because they'll basically run out of their energy They need to attack with.

602
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:55,199
Rym: yeah We held out as in portals near City Hall for a while because there were three portals like right next to each other like as Close as they can be and all of them had two turrets and two of those like attack enhancer items on them.

603
00:36:55,682 --> 00:37:01,506
Rym: So if you walked over there and you were blue and you hacked anything it was just like And it also.

604
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,039
Scott: the shields are also really strong.

605
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,551
Scott: Yeah They make it really hard for anyone to attack it You know and gives you plenty of time to go over and fix it.

606
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:13,880
Scott: cuz like they'll run out of weapons and energy before they Kill it and the shield holds on and the next day you come and recharge it and put the shields back.

607
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:17,937
Rym: so this game is basically a hundred percent replaced.

608
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,636
Rym: the Nintendo 3ds friend Street pass whatever candy box.

609
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:23,460
Scott: Oh, yeah screw that.

610
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,213
Rym: This is my soul candy box because for a candy box game.

611
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:28,336
Rym: It's perfect.

612
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:29,340
Rym: Just hey, I'm bored.

613
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:31,140
Rym: I wonder if there's a portal near here.

614
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,540
Scott: The other thing is that it's team candy box, right?

615
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,039
Scott: You could go and have a fun act.

616
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,534
Scott: You could actually use this candy box to support things that are not just stupid candy box.

617
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:45,059
Scott: For example, you could say hey everyone Let's all of us have this game.

618
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:48,760
Scott: Let's go around the neighborhood and find portals and you'll discover things in your neighborhood.

619
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:49,700
Scott: You didn't know they were there.

620
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:56,262
Rym: You know how many streets I've biked or walked down just to go to a portal and hack it that I never in my life Would have gone down Otherwise.

621
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:59,860
Scott: there are like there's an owl statue in a park that I didn't know was there but I had a portal on it.

622
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,363
Scott: So I found it.

623
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:01,852
Scott: Yeah, right stuff like that.

624
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:08,301
Rym: Also people like the other day I was biking right and I stopped at a stoplight and I looked at my right and there's a guy in a car and he's Cleared.

625
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:10,753
Rym: him and his friend both have it open on their phones.

626
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:11,335
Rym: Mm-hmm.

627
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,300
Scott: Were they on the green team?

628
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:13,706
Rym: So I look and they're green.

629
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:20,656
Rym: so I tap on the window and the guy looks like what the fuck cuz it's New York You don't talk to people and I hold up my phone and he's like, yeah.

630
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:22,660
Scott: Yeah Let's go green.

631
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:25,964
Scott: But like if you get a team of people together Right, you can.

632
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:29,653
Scott: you get eight level eight dudes together and you go somewhere.

633
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,360
Scott: you can fuck shit up big-time all together.

634
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,260
Scott: Because what you can do is you can all use your weapons at once and destroy a portal really fast.

635
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:38,623
Rym: One and two.

636
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:44,720
Scott: you can all put and a level eight resonator on the portal together and then make a max level portal.

637
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:52,160
Rym: Because the way it works is like I can put any number of level ones on a portal but higher level ones One person can only put like one level eight.

638
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:59,911
Scott: Yeah, if you're level eight and you go to a portal and you try to fill it up with resonators all by yourself It's only gonna let you put like one level eight like a couple.

639
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,787
Rym: level seven five four four three Like I can't like.

640
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,820
Rym: I'm getting down to my low levels real quick, right?

641
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,585
Scott: But if you have eight level eight people you can all put one level eight resonator and make a ridiculously strong portal No one can mess with easily.

642
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:17,740
Rym: Put four of the ultra rare 60 defense shields up on that shit.

643
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,704
Scott: Yeah, and it's like well We've got this.

644
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:25,900
Scott: and then you all since you all have a whole bunch of portal keys You can all send links out of that thing like crazy, right?

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,700
Scott: It's like, you know, someone might be lacking the energy or whatever.

646
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:33,140
Scott: So if you're all together you can actually, you know, make some friends and go around fucking shit up.

647
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,660
Rym: Yeah, and the game is like a built-in chat that actually works like you can chat with the enemy and message each other.

648
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:40,420
Rym: There's a secure chat just for your faction.

649
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:46,673
Rym: There's only two factions right now But wouldn't be surprised if something weird happens at some point because apparently You're saying they're gonna add a red team?

650
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:47,360
Scott: Fuck you red team.

651
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:48,799
Scott: I'm just saying Green team for life.

652
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:58,360
Rym: The game's had a bunch of events and weird shit that I actually never really Interacted with and there's a whole bunch of lore and crap in there that I've been mostly ignoring.

653
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:59,235
Scott: Don't give a shit about lore.

654
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,520
Scott: All they care about is green team.

655
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:02,002
Rym: Like.

656
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:06,800
Rym: level 8 used to be the highest level but they just recently added eight more levels that do weird shit.

657
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:06,981
Rym: Like.

658
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:12,500
Rym: I've seen people who have clearly done things that as far as I know break the rules, right?

659
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:17,460
Scott: There's a dude in Astoria named Atrocitus and I've run into that fucker.

660
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,430
Scott: That guy is the most evil blue team guy.

661
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,400
Scott: if I and like I'm I'm like worried about this game.

662
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:31,429
Scott: Like if I'm going around Astoria and I'm you know, biking around hacking and I see this dude Should I beat him up just take his phone?

663
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,252
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

664
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:34,380
Scott: should I take his phone throw it on the ground and run away?

665
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:36,928
Scott: It's like I feel like I should.

666
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:37,691
Rym: so I've seen.

667
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,599
Scott: I'm also afraid so it might do that to me.

668
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,620
Rym: I've seen in the community reports actually of in some especially in college towns.

669
00:40:44,982 --> 00:41:00,179
Rym: Like if a college is mostly blue or mostly green The people who are in that faction Kind of go like prison Stanford prison study on each other and get really Into the game in a bad way.

670
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:04,412
Rym: Like I've seen some reports of that happening, which is understandable.

671
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,940
Rym: Like I can see why people I mean people do that about sports ball.

672
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:08,608
Scott: I know I don't think I would do.

673
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:15,320
Scott: it's like imagine if we have a group of eight people we go around To capturing portals and we get the email that says your portal has been attacked.

674
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,504
Scott: Like we just captured that portal.

675
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:23,570
Scott: we turn around and there's someone there and there's eight of us and yeah one blue team guy Just stand next to each other.

676
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:24,478
Scott: What are we gonna do?

677
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:25,424
Rym: You know you do?

678
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:28,100
Rym: you have someone go over and talk to them like hey, what's up?

679
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,245
Rym: Like blah blah blah blah.

680
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:31,837
Rym: act like they're on their faction to distract them.

681
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:37,136
Rym: Mm-hmm Meanwhile, you just fuck the portal back up in the right direction take their phone and throw it in the street.

682
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:40,884
Rym: Yeah This is probably.

683
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:44,760
Rym: I mean honestly a lot of people have tried to make games in this ARG space.

684
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:52,940
Rym: We're like there's a game overlaid on the real world and people playing the game see it Like I remember seeing so many of these booths at like old paxes and other conventions.

685
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:55,567
Rym: It's probably the best one anyone's ever made.

686
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:56,630
Rym: Mm-hmm.

687
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,379
Rym: Not great, but I'm still playing it.

688
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,305
Rym: Yeah, like Scott's playing it.

689
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:08,900
Rym: Yeah, it's it's a good thing to get into because it's it's fun It's social you meet people it forces teamwork.

690
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:15,127
Rym: And I've actually met a lot of people playing this game because you see you know, we've never met anyone playing candy box or cookie Clicker.

691
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:19,071
Scott: Nope And you don't even really meet people doing Street pass, right?

692
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,200
Scott: You sort of say you'll see people on Street pass.

693
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:30,840
Rym: Street passes Hey a Person you will never meet in your entire life who is similar and cool because you don't need to do anything with the person you Meet on the street pass, right?

694
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,779
Scott: It's like you just get there me and it's like you don't need to interact with them in real life in any way.

695
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:40,260
Scott: and I guess Nintendo doesn't want you to either because you might be a child predator and the 3ds is probably owned by a child.

696
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,307
Scott: But with this it's like no you.

697
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:50,160
Scott: if you see people in your area like capturing portals and they're on your team It's like you got to find them so you can you know, it's like hey, you know, do you have energies?

698
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,190
Scott: I need some energies or hey you got any weapons.

699
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,320
Rym: It also gives fun content portal key for this.

700
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,568
Scott: I want to make a field here.

701
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:03,765
Rym: months ago katsu and a bunch of us we went out just to go get dinner and drinks like after work and I pull out my phone and Open ingress for a second.

702
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:14,571
Rym: and a new guy who we didn't really know each other yet when I caught his friends It's like ingress and I was like, yep, and I kind of pull my phone back and he's like And there's this dance of like.

703
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:15,919
Scott: are you on the blue team?

704
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:17,759
Rym: Yep, and then suddenly I was like.

705
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:28,029
Rym: I'm just gonna work on my portal here and he looks and then he sees the portal under attack and he was blue and then We just were like, ah, I'm like spamming XMPs.

706
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:28,470
Rym: He's trying to.

707
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:31,059
Scott: why didn't you take his phone and like put it in his drink?

708
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,110
Rym: But I'd recommend I've got a bunch of invites.

709
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,836
Rym: if you guys want invites like I don't need invites You can just join this thing really?

710
00:43:40,957 --> 00:43:43,191
Rym: Yeah Because you need an invites for a long time now.

711

Rym: join the green team And you know what?

714
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,943
Rym: We're actually kind of playing it.

715
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:55,080
Rym: so we should meet at a convention like PAX and then all go out on a hunting expedition.

716
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:59,719
Scott: We should find we should see if we can find on the internet like PAX and lighten meetup and go to it.

717
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,209
Rym: Yeah, actually, you know people do the button trading.

718
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:02,792
Rym: Maybe this is it.

719
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:04,017
Rym: We should make a green team button.
