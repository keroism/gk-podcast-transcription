00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:23,401
Rym: We're talking about the concerns of the bathroom possibly part 1.

5
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,111
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,934
Rym: So Scott I heard you had some pretty good opening bit for the show.

7
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:30,958
Scott: we had opening bit.

8
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,043
Scott: last time I forgot it.

9
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,216
Scott: I know we went out to eat and I remembered it.

10
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:39,072
Rym: and I told you Told me and you were like, I'll tell you so that we don't forget.

11
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:44,409
Rym: and I even thought then at first I was like Oh, yeah There's no way I'll forget that as I always think.

12
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:50,715
Rym: but then today today Rym Remembered that it is literally impossible for me to remember a show idea.

13
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:55,164
Scott: Yeah Happen, I don't remember what the opening bit was Like.

14
00:00:55,224 --> 00:01:00,592
Rym: I have lost your ideas forever because I had erased a whiteboard The only one that I have in my Google keep.

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,020
Rym: I have a. where is it?

16
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:04,420
Rym: Thing that says news topics.

17
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:05,939
Rym: I have things just show ideas.

18
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:11,460
Rym: The show ideas has one thing in it and that thing has been there for more than six months.

19
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:12,726
Scott: Oh, I know what that is.

20
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:19,067
Rym: Yeah, that's actually a really good idea for a show, but it requires Maybe an hour or two of preparation.

21
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,653
Scott: That's why it's a bad show that it never happened.

22
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,203
Rym: Yeah, it's a good show though It'll be a really good show.

23
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:27,300
Rym: I think I think we actually we could live stream it like plan like we could do good stuff.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,877
Rym: Maybe we'll see.

25
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,660
Rym: Yeah, so I'll talk about this more on the next Monday show.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:41,559
Rym: but you know, I pulled the trigger on buying that new computer and a bunch of the components have arrived and That feeling of building a computer.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,320
Rym: It's real powerful and you might if it's been a while you might forget what it feels like to build a brand new computer.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:02:08,931
Rym: Especially because I realized something Every time I have built a computer in my life with the exception of the first one it was always a computer that I needed quickly and I was in a hurry because it was always like My old computer literally is failing or stop working.

29
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,979
Rym: I need a new computer as soon as possible.

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,889
Rym: Oh fuck, but research by the components.

31
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:22,031
Rym: build it like as fast as possible in one day and throw together Like one time when my old computer started crashing the previous one before.

32
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,036
Rym: this one has some voltage errors.

33
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:29,780
Rym: It was basically Preventing us from safely doing GeekNights until I built the new computer.

34
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:34,717
Rym: So like the parts came and like I built it as fast as possible that day to do the show.

35
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:38,489
Rym: this time I'm replacing a perfectly functional computer like this.

36
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:43,897
Rym: computer's only fault is that it's slow and one of the USB headers I disabled because I think it has a problem.

37
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,526
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

38
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,200
Rym: Anyway, I got any news on the lounge this Thursday episode of GeekNights.

39
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,426
Scott: I do have a news the news.

40
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,480
Rym: No one cares about but me something with kpop eyes.

41
00:02:55,261 --> 00:03:01,260
Rym: It's either netrunner kpop maybe kpop team appearing as a cameo in a netrunner card.

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,896
Scott: I figure right, you know, I try not to bust out those things that no one cares about.

43
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,060
Scott: but me Rym has no shame.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,065
Scott: He just busts out the thing.

45
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:08,749
Scott: He cares about it.

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,680
Rym: No, you think I have no shame.

47
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,176
Rym: What you've read what you don't realize is that to become a monster to fight monsters.

48
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,180
Rym: You must become a monster.

49
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:16,859
Scott: That's not true.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,787
Rym: The things that I show that I share as things of the day that you think are horrible Internet's things related like potato conditions are the mere surface of your evil.

51
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,492
Rym: that is the AT field.

52
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:36,558
Scott: sure by showing you that I dissuade you from going deeper point is I have self-restraint, but Sometimes the wells a bit dry.

53
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:45,505
Scott: So, you know, I'll dip into that pool right and maybe someone will jump in the pool with me because it's you know It's not evil stuff.

54
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:46,107
Scott: It's just.

55
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:49,280
Scott: it's just stuff that no one else cares about and I don't want to make you care about it.

56
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,253
Scott: I know that.

57
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:52,260
Scott: see the thing is right.

58
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:59,030
Scott: I know that guy that guy who comes up to you and tells you all about that thing He really cares about so much that you don't care about at all.

59
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:00,396
Scott: And that's an annoying guy.

60
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,460
Scott: I want to make go away.

61
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:05,619
Rym: So Scott the train Tell you about the W train, you know.

62
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:10,779
Scott: so I do not want to be that guy and that's why I don't use these sorts of things of the day or news.

63
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,527
Scott: is that often?

64
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,310
Scott: but whatever.

65
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:21,404
Scott: so the most important kpop group in the history of ever is Big Bang Bang bang bang.

66
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:26,100
Scott: Yeah, right and even if you don't like kpop you must like Big Bang.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,567
Rym: Did they also do that GGGG song?

68
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,650
Rym: No, that was someone else.

69
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,076
Scott: Those are not even the same gender.

70
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,400
Rym: I don't I don't know.

71
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,287
Scott: Big Bang is dudes.

72
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:36,950
Rym: Okay.

73
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:43,319
Scott: Anyway, there's In South Korea.

74
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,048
Scott: Military is mandatory.

75
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:55,166
Scott: It is mandatory conscription, even if you're G dragon You have to go in the military.

76
00:04:55,768 --> 00:05:00,580
Scott: in case they have to shoot North Koreans in the face or get shot by them.

77
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:04,092
Scott: They have to go to the military for like two years, right?

78
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:21,020
Scott: Yeah, even if your name is G dragon, so next year Big Bang is gonna go literally bang bang bang Instead of just singing bang bang bang and So the last chance for them to do any music stuff for the next few years is like right now.

79
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:27,893
Scott: So last year in 2015 They released four little albums of two songs each that were called made.

80
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:44,079
Scott: the first one is M. The second one was a D and the fourth one Inexplicably was F. We don't really know why and the fourth one was E and that was pretty much the music of the year in Especially the song bang bang bang.

81
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:47,493
Scott: But they promised that there would be a full album.

82
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:48,900
Scott: That was just called made.

83
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:50,618
Scott: Yeah, that didn't happen.

84
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:53,428
Scott: But now I like the last second.

85
00:05:53,488 --> 00:06:10,370
Scott: before they have to go shoot people or practice shooting fake people They're gonna do it and they've added three new songs Which I forget the names of but it doesn't matter because the first song which I assume is the title song The featured song is called fuck it.

86
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:14,778
Rym: Yeah, I believe it is technically called fxxk it

87
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:35,699
Scott: sure But I mean that's a good thing to say if you're about to go Conscription And that's coming out like In a week or two like way soon and that's gonna blow the doors off and you know You might be thinking it's still crappy pop music in the end.

88
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:45,993
Scott: Yes, and no because let me tell you big bang is unique in the history of boy bands and that unlike all the others They are a actually talented.

89
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:51,144
Scott: Yeah Be not short-lived Right.

90
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:53,179
Scott: They've been around for like nine ten years already.

91
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,991
Rym: Say that the new kids on the blog are still around.

92
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,860
Scott: they came back, but they went away.

93
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:01,091
Scott: Big bang has been there consistently.

94
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:01,854
Rym: Oh my god.

95
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,200
Rym: They're doing a tour now.

96
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:04,705
Scott: Yeah, sure, but they were.

97
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,772
Scott: we went away for like a decade plus.

98
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,658
Scott: yeah, they haven't been around since.

99
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,943
Rym: okay They're 90s.

100
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:17,126
Rym: So they were only active for a decade sure and now there's been hair back as a Big bang still going.

101
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:17,487
Scott: they're not.

102
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:21,660
Scott: they haven't stopped it except if it wasn't for going to the military they'd keep going anyway.

103
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:39,254
Scott: but also They kind of make their own music sort of right like if you look at the credits It's like, you know music lyrics G Dragon G right and also other people but also them Whereas I don't think the new kids on the block have made a song ever.

104
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,920
Scott: Yeah, right.

105
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,538
Scott: So that's what sets them apart there.

106
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:51,999
Rym: so I fly a lot and This news some I don't know how many of you fly a lot versus don't fly at all.

107
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,798
Scott: But even if you fly moderately like a few times a year like me, it's enough.

108
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,614
Rym: Yep So United Airlines is not the greatest airline to begin with.

109
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,740
Rym: No, I think that is a bad airline.

110
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,013
Scott: I will say that much.

111
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:14,899
Rym: I think 3/4 of all the attempts I have ever made to fly with United Aided with me not getting to my destination.

112
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:15,100
Scott: right now.

113
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,306
Scott: It's not the worst airline like some Ryan air.

114
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,114
Scott: it spirit garbage right, but it's real bad.

115
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:28,930
Rym: So apparently they announced starting in 2017 that if you have a carry-on bag and You want to put it in the overhead bin?

116
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,718
Rym: It's gonna cost you good.

117
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:31,099
Scott: Fuck you.

118
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,780
Rym: So on the day, so here's the problem with that.

119
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,506
Rym: I have at least other than the fact that.

120
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:40,429
Rym: so there's this sort of like, you know, the whole post truth era Thanks to US politics.

121
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:48,800
Rym: They have been Repeatedly saying all over social media press conferences everywhere that that is not true.

122
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,759
Rym: They're not charging people to put things in the overhead bin.

123
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:57,200
Rym: What they are doing is on their own words is offering more fare options.

124
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:01,556
Rym: So there's a lower budget tier of people who have like the no frills experience.

125
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:02,740
Rym: You can fly somewhere super cheap.

126
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:15,700
Rym: However, they also say in a separate place that the fares for this new basic economy That does not include bin privileges will be about the same as what their current economy tickets cost, right?

127
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,780
Scott: So the thing is people don't realize this even though I might have explained it on the show before.

128
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,180
Scott: The baggage fees and things like that aren't actually baggage fees.

129
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,460
Scott: What they are is that most people buy plane tickets today from sites like kayak, which are aggregators.

130
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:36,080
Scott: Yeah And they search for their their home and their destination and they sort by price of the lowest price first and that's what they buy.

131
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:43,120
Scott: Yeah, whatever is cheapest no matter what right that price that the lowest price Right is the price before all the fees.

132
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:50,383
Scott: So it's costing you the same if you pay for the checked bag and the overhead bin and the whatever other Privileges.

133
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,067
Scott: you were right.

134
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,260
Scott: It cost you the same as a plane tickets cost before.

135
00:09:53,641 --> 00:10:08,387
Scott: they're just taking as many things out of the base price and moving them to a fee as they can in order to have a Lower advertised price in the aggregator so they can show up first when you search for your tickets Which you're not actually like you.

136
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,620
Scott: it feels like you're getting ripped off when you pay the 20 bucks for your checked bag fee.

137
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,509
Scott: But really it's no.

138
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,318
Scott: you're actually saving 20 bucks for that.

139
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:22,779
Scott: one time You don't have to check a bag and the 20 bucks you pay when you do check a bag Is it 20 bucks you were gonna pay before?

140
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:29,811
Rym: in this case Their prices for economy will be the same except by default.

141
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:31,596
Rym: You don't get bin privileges anymore.

142
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,120
Scott: Well, that's also good.

143
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,006
Rym: So they're not actually lowering the prices.

144
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,109
Scott: Well, that's interesting.

145
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,480
Scott: Yeah, but also fuck people who use the bins.

146
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:41,127
Rym: I use the bin.

147
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,151
Scott: Here's the bin.

148
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:43,457
Rym: Well, where do you put your shit?

149
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,200
Rym: Cuz I bring two bags.

150
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,026
Scott: I check my shit.

151
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,953
Rym: Yeah, usually I also check my shit.

152
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,000
Scott: My shit goes under my seat and I check it.

153
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,018
Scott: I don't put anything in the bin.

154
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,702
Scott: There's nothing.

155
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,728
Rym: there is nothing in theory wrong with the bin.

156
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:57,320
Rym: here are however, my primary complaints about the bin number one.

157
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:01,940
Rym: People fly with bags that are bigger than you're allowed to and they don't fit in the bin, right?

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,300
Scott: There's a thing at the front of the airport That's like here's how big the thing can be and people bring stuff on that's bigger than that thing and no one stops them.

159
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,953
Scott: Right, it shouldn't they enforce it and be like, hey your things too big.

160
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:16,949
Scott: It's bigger than the metal, you know rectangle primarily a US problem because I want to check that.

161
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:26,446
Rym: fuck you when I fly overseas I have Repeatedly been getting on flights where they stop someone who said yeah, we're taking that to check it You can't bring it on the plane.

162
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:26,828
Scott: good.

163
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:36,487
Rym: I like I see that happen all the time good but at the same time I also fly premium economy or business usually overseas and You remember the fuck you want.

164
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:47,599
Scott: then they're like, so well if you're paying for, you know Whatever you could bring your check the giant shall I take sirs jacket and hang it in the closets in the golden closet in the golden hanger?

165
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,659
Rym: But to people in general.

166
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:58,600
Rym: I don't know if this happens elsewhere in the world because I don't have enough sample size of people in general.

167
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,889
Rym: But when I find that you ask a lot of people I see Seem like they pack Way too much shit.

168
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,980
Rym: Like I don't know how long you're going to where you're going.

169
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:12,293
Rym: There is no way you need that many bags under any circumstances.

170
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,511
Scott: Yeah, unless you're going like Let's say I'm going on a trip for months.

171
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:20,417
Scott: right like months and months I'm gonna be just permanently away living out of a bag.

172
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,020
Scott: There's a limit to how much stuff that I can is like a maximum, right?

173
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:33,620
Scott: It's like well This is enough clothes to get from laundry to laundry and it's all the stuff I need to live every day Travel for a month and decide they're never going to do laundry.

174
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,980
Scott: It's like a full set of toiletries the equipment I need for everyday life like computer and camera and whatnot.

175
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:49,423
Scott: Yeah, electronic bit I even better if I'm going Enough enough clothes to get from one laundry to the next laundry and then that's the maximum I could need no matter how long the Trip is.

176
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:54,768
Rym: but if I'm going somewhere longer than two weeks, I Actually, like I don't bring any toiletries.

177
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,756
Rym: I buy all that shit in the other destination.

178
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,419
Scott: You can do that, too.

179
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,440
Scott: Yeah, buy some temporary stuff on the other end.

180
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,261
Scott: I mean, I'm sure if the trip is long and if you're gonna be replacing you're gonna run out of soap and have to buy More.

181
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,488
Scott: Yeah, right, but still so.

182
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:11,052
Rym: the third thing is that a lot of people are getting on planes And I make exception.

183
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:15,128
Rym: like there are people who have legitimate Handicaps or concerns very.

184
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,360
Scott: they get on first the separate their separate boarding just for them.

185
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,025
Scott: So it's all good.

186
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:33,345
Rym: the number of able-bodied Young adults who seem to pack bags that they are incapable of lifting over their own heads and putting into the bin Shocks me if you cannot pick up you like I'm weak in the arm Right.

187
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,300
Scott: I can't do the push-up.

188
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:42,139
Scott: Yeah Like Scott's legit weak in the arm But I can take a bag of luggage a carry-on bag lift it over my head and push it up and down.

189
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,860
Rym: now What I notice is that it doesn't seem to be an issue of strength like these people.

190
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,980
Rym: It's not like they're feeble in some like ridiculous way.

191
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,440
Rym: What I see is that they lack basic coordination and like movement planning abilities.

192
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,489
Rym: The other thing they're standing there and they're like trying to lift it like straight up in front of their body like this and then Turn it like pivot at 90 degrees.

193
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:07,425
Scott: you put a hand put a hand under it and do like a hookshot Right.

194
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,500
Rym: It's like the people's job.

195
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:11,099
Rym: I'll be sitting in a plane and these jackasses behind me.

196
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:17,680
Rym: Well, I grab the top of my seat and yank it like they're killing someone to stand up Like they can't stand up under their own power.

197
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,780
Scott: The other thing is that people can't seem to put a bag in the bin from their seat.

198
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,132
Scott: They have to stand in the aisle making everyone stop walking.

199
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:35,780
Scott: It's like when I get to my aisle I put it in from the seat I step into the aisle seat letting people go past and I can toss my thing into the bin if I have to.

200
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:42,802
Scott: I do this on the bus usually right while people are walking past me so I don't delay anyone at all Right.

201
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:43,585
Scott: It's like.

202
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,734
Scott: this is why it's like screw you people using the bin.

203
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,098
Scott: You're too damn slow, right?

204
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,533
Scott: We just and you're not using anything in that bag on the flight.

205
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,880
Scott: You don't need to bring it on the flight.

206
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,249
Scott: You could check it now.

207
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,719
Rym: So this is where my make my counterpoint to you.

208
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:11,611
Rym: Most of the time when you fly you do check bags So you getting off the plane those people being slow as fucking delaying you don't actually delay you because there is no way You will get to that carousel after your bags get there.

209
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:15,740
Scott: Yeah, you know at first I was thinking yeah You know these people right?

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,542
Scott: It's like if we.

211
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:22,340
Scott: it's like that time you're losing boarding and D planning with all these slowness of people who can't deal with the bins.

212
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:31,000
Scott: Oh, it's like if you save that time then suddenly, you know That's that's way more time than the time you're losing waiting for the carousel.

213
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:41,439
Scott: But it's also true that even with the slow as D planning I have never gotten to the carousel before it starts moving and spitting bags out.

214
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,665
Rym: now I have.

215
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:54,118
Rym: but that's just because if I do if you do fly business class one of the secrets is they let you off the plane like right away, even if they don't let the economy people off and Those bags are flagged and they're almost always waiting for you.

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,823
Rym: But like

217
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:59,803
Scott: they go up to the plane right away open it up take those bags out and rush them over to the carousel They put them

218
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:03,509
Rym: in a separate like you'll see a little car sometimes depending on the flight Run off the plane

219
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,879
Scott: grab bags and then run back to.

220
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:04,960
Scott: the

221
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,770
Rym: Bags are usually put together in one area and

222
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,360
Scott: then they and then someone comes to get the rest of the bags like yeah

223
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:18,440
Rym: All right I have more than half the time when I fly business like get gotten to the carousel and my bags are not even going around.

224
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:23,699
Rym: They're just sitting with all the other business class bags next to the carousel like waiting for me.

225
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,229
Rym: There's usually a person standing there But I don't get like.

226
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:33,216
Rym: I don't fly business in my normal life Like I only get to do that when I'm traveling for work because somehow that's separate from life.

227
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:34,080
Scott: Well, it's dead.

228
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,666
Rym: Well in that I'm not paying for it.

229
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:40,622
Rym: I would not pay that much money to fly If I were.

230
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:44,313
Rym: I'd have to be pretty rich to where that amount of money would seem like.

231
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:45,496
Rym: okay, whatever it's worth it.

232
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:56,039
Rym: Yeah But you also like you don't lose that time in the way in either because it feels like it takes everyone forever to get on The plane but the plane scheduled leave at a time.

233
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,000
Scott: Anyway, now there's only one counter-argument to this right which is if this is across the board.

234
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:09,902
Scott: You know Deplaning and planning times or deep boarding times were decreased because of people not loading bins and not being able to close them and all that Other bullshit.

235
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,989
Scott: they could reschedule the plane.

236
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,598
Rym: Nope, because all they would do is start boarding later.

237
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,449
Scott: They could flight leaves at six.

238
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,380
Scott: they could add extra flights and squish it.

239
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:29,260
Scott: JetBlue actually one of their big deals was like hey look we can like land a plane and just take it off again real quick Because like we're cleaning the plane while it's in flight saving time.

240
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,917
Scott: You could save a lot more time if you didn't have any bins on there and right.

241
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:33,500
Scott: it's like yeah.

242
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:41,460
Scott: But then air airport slots, which you know I'm just saying is like, you know, they were all about saving those few minutes not having to clean the plane.

243
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,360
Scott: Yeah, you could save a lot more minutes by not dealing with these stupid bins.

244
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,055
Rym: Also the last few times I've flown JetBlue the planes are kind of dirty.

245
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:52,128
Scott: so What plane is super clean and fancy?

246
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,833
Scott: That's not a luxury amazing plane.

247
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,758
Rym: Actually domestic Delta flights are usually pretty good.

248
00:17:55,778 --> 00:18:02,556
Rym: Mm-hmm Like I. actually I flew enough this year for the first time in my life I've status so I get like all the free upgrades.

249
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:03,100
Rym: It's weird.

250
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,919
Rym: The problem is I don't know if I'll fly enough next year to maintain it.

251
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:09,479
Rym: So I'll get one year of this and I got to go back to pleb land.

252
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:18,196
Rym: But the I guess the final thing is that when I do fly and I don't check bags It's always because I'm doing a short trip.

253
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:21,120
Rym: like one time I flew to Hong Kong and I was literally only gonna be there for a couple days.

254
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,675
Rym: So I just brought a backpack and in that case put it under your seat.

255
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:25,880
Rym: No, it wouldn't fit.

256
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,840
Rym: It was a. it was a like carry on back, but at least it's small, right?

257
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,261
Scott: So like

258
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,600
Rym: it was the size that you are officially allowed to put in the bin

259
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:40,245
Scott: I mean if you put that in the bin It's not sticking way out and not being able to close not some hard rectangular thing that's like five inches too long

260
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:45,764
Rym: that the lady puts in sideways because it doesn't fit and she's trying to hide that fact before the Stewardess comes and takes it away.

261
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:46,949
Rym: Yeah and gay checks it.

262
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:47,250
Rym: Mm-hmm.

263
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,495
Rym: I don't know the moral is.

264
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:52,840
Rym: I hate everyone I fly with and Mary flying domestically is just awful.

265
00:18:53,021 --> 00:19:02,139
Scott: I think the rule should simply be this right if your bag is you know a bag with a firm Rectangular shape and wheels and such you have to check that shit.

266
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:04,564
Scott: That's not dumb.

267
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:05,932
Rym: I think it with a better way.

268
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:06,696
Scott: we're going in the bin.

269
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:07,500
Scott: It's gotta be squishy.

270
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:12,195
Rym: No, the the real way to handle that which is how some airlines do handle it.

271
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:18,500
Rym: if it goes in the bin It has to go in the official way and if you can't fit it in that way they take it away from me.

272
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,810
Rym: They don't let you fly and they tase you.

273
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,879
Scott: Oh, okay.

274
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,952
Rym: So see I have a more relaxed rule, but a more severe punishment.

275
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:43,998
Rym: I Think the real fundamental problem though is just that this is sort of like almost systemic of just American culture in general which I think is actually driven by the fact that our economy has gotten kind of increasingly Fucked and there's a huge gulf between have enough money to live and don't have enough money to live.

276
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,685
Rym: that Flying either.

277
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:54,639
Rym: you just buy normal tickets and don't care cuz like you're like us like we're flying to pegs We just buy whatever ticket and we're not gonna ever fly like crapos spirit.

278
00:19:55,342 --> 00:20:04,535
Rym: But if you don't have a lot of money and you've got to fly to like a wedding or a funeral or something Even even if you might argue like culturally Americans just get the cheapest one.

279
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,620
Rym: They don't care about the quality.

280
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,963
Rym: There's no like middle ground anymore.

281
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:13,480
Rym: There arguably might not be enough of a middle class to pay for or demand that middle ground.

282
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,160
Rym: That's why premium economy is like two rows of seats and then there's like a hundred rows of shit economy.

283
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:25,600
Scott: So I think there's also like regulations about how many rows of what you know, you can't just make a whole flight.

284
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,424
Scott: That's first class.

285
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:31,733
Rym: So premium economy counts as economy because they're in the same Like this, you know those rules.

286
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,800
Scott: they can't just do whatever they want.

287
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,534
Rym: Well, the rules are why we don't need every every couple years like because people on LinkedIn like to share this shit all the time That concept design of these standing airplane.

288
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:50,960
Rym: Ooh Meaning you can buy a super cheap seat, but you stand leaning against this like pad with armrests Hmm, and it's all short flight as is cheap enough.

289
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,492
Rym: Yeah, you're what's wrong with America's got?

290
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,979
Rym: I like standing Stay on a plane for an hour.

291
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,349
Scott: Oh the front like the seats are not really that comfortable.

292
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,280
Scott: right standing might be more comfortable for depending on people.

293
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:03,121
Scott: Yeah for me It might.

294
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:08,080
Rym: anyway the rules prevent that kind of thing because that exceeds the density you're allowed in the case.

295
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Scott: I assume that's also dangerous even though it might be more comfortable.

296
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:18,800
Rym: There may not be depending on who you are But I just people usually like to cite things like this as an example of how Americans go for the cheapest bullshit.

297
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,880
Scott: Why can't we have a plane with like bunk beds, right?

298
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,127
Scott: So it's like I could be on tier.

299
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,400
Scott: like you could use the height of the plane to fit more people.

300
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:30,578
Scott: I actually know why I could lay down and be on the third way up top.

301
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:31,000
Scott: I don't care.

302
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,948
Scott: At least I'm laying down.

303
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,220
Scott: everyone's laying down horizontally.

304
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,220
Scott: You can't get more comfortable than that.

305
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,745
Rym: Have you seen the concept designs to put two seats like this and then one seat kind of up and one seat kind of down to like stagger and out?

306
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:46,985
Rym: the problem with all those fancy designs like the bunk beds is They're fine for flying.

307
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,336
Rym: they are in patently unsafe and deadly.

308
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:51,540
Rym: in an emergency.

309
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,440
Rym: You can't evacuate that plane quickly.

310
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:54,965
Scott: I'm fine with that.

311
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,559
Rym: Yeah egress is the reason why?

312
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,927
Rym: Cool designs like that don't work.

313
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:06,818
Rym: the FAA regulations on egress are very strict And in fact the fact that they're so strict is probably the only reason you can still sit down on a plane.

314
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,931
Scott: I don't need to egress if I'm gonna.

315
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,098
Scott: if I'm gonna die I'm gonna die.

316
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,720
Scott: Right, it's like I'll be super luxurious.

317
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,900
Scott: I'll be lying down horizontally taking a nap on every flight except for the one flight that crashes.

318
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,445
Rym: Okay in the words of Homer Simpson, I had a good run.

319
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:24,467
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

320
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:32,799
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

321
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:45,720
Rym: so every time you know, if you build computers all the time or You're in high school and you're a nerd You just always stay on top of like the current state of computer building design in general.

322
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:52,329
Scott: But I only stay on top of those times when I have to build the PC and otherwise I forget and I don't see what's happening.

323
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,739
Scott: And when I check again, it's like oh look at everything that's changed.

324
00:22:55,081 --> 00:23:05,436
Rym: so subtle things that have actually changed in the last five or six years that you might not expect like Like water cooling five years ago was dumb and now like it's kind of matter now.

325
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:06,559
Scott: You can't get yourself wet.

326
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:08,460
Scott: but

327
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:27,359
Rym: the best that the thing that we have now like way more than we've ever had before is that you can just go to YouTube and there will be like a hundred videos of people installing the Exact weird thing you bought in the exact case you have with the exact motherboard and the exact everything,

328
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:27,620
Scott: right?

329
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Scott: It's like back in the day I used to just go to Newegg and you have to look at the reviews and it's a look at the questions and look at All the specs to figure out like it's all this stuff gonna work together.

330
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,630
Scott: But now I mean you're we're normal people.

331
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,156
Scott: we're gonna buy this stuff on Newegg.

332
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:41,160
Scott: That's super popular.

333
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Scott: We're not buying some rare one egg stuff, right?

334
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,900
Scott: We're buying the highly rated stuff that everyone else is buying.

335
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,639
Scott: There's already thousands and thousands of people who have bought the exact same product and PC building is a big industry that makes a lot of money.

336
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:58,360
Scott: So, of course, there's people on YouTube making videos of building PCs all over the place.

337
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:10,746
Scott: You can get all your questions and all those little fiddly subtleties of the exact stuff you're thinking about buying by watching a YouTube video of someone else who bought the same thing already and it Answers the good that.

338
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:15,009
Rym: the thing they helped me with in particular is they answer the questions You're not really sure about like like.

339
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:17,180
Scott: how exactly do I mount this?

340
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,391
Rym: Yeah, this back panel does it go on front ways or back ways?

341
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:22,660
Rym: because it kind of fits both ways, right?

342
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,001
Scott: It's like.

343
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,570
Scott: will this video card actually fit in this case?

344
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,694
Scott: It says it will.

345
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:27,035
Scott: it's like.

346
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:30,580
Scott: it says it's a. you know Short enough, but I'm gonna put this radiator in there.

347
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,495
Scott: Is that measurement include the space of the radiator or not?

348
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:34,440
Rym: now as an aside?

349
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,213
Rym: It looks like the better channels here like this video.

350
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:48,842
Rym: I'm gonna link to from this channel I found only has like 200,000 views and it looks like The companies all I can tell and g-skill and aces just give her Everything.

351
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:55,120
Scott: Yeah, if you're making videos of products and reviewing them and making high-quality youtubes people sponsor you with stuffs.

352
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,864
Scott: That's how it works.

353
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,760
Rym: But this channel Joanne tech lover is actually pretty great for this.

354
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,148
Rym: So it's my thing of the day and I'll link to a particular video from it.

355
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:07,890
Rym: The title is Skylake build part 1 LGA 1151 z170 ddr4 USB 3.1 and she also puts in the Kraken x61.

356
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:15,240
Scott: If that's a. if you're buying a gaming PC today, that's what you're gonna buy.

357
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,485
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna build this exact computer just in case December 2016.

358
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:19,867
Scott: Seriously.

359
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:24,582
Rym: I'll get a different case because the case she's building is Radonculous.

360
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:29,527
Rym: it is so big and so crazy Trying to get to it.

361
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:31,980
Scott: Also that RAM looks dumb, but not as dumb as your RAM.

362
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:33,309
Rym: Yeah, because you're the public.

363
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,860
Rym: all g-skill RAM looks dumb.

364
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,648
Rym: He's gonna live with it or pay.

365
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,380
Rym: you actually have to pay more to get less dumb-looking RAM.

366
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:43,468
Scott: Yeah, actually crucial RAM is more expensive But it's just RAM chips the RAM I bought.

367
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:56,256
Rym: the reason I got it is that a lot of the higher-end Spec ddr4, especially if you get a 16 gigabyte module, which you got to get They actually run a little over voltage which can over time fuck up your core i7.

368
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:56,939
Rym: interesting.

369
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:02,960
Rym: So make sure if you have DDR and also people are dumb and like they don't realize that ddr3 and 4 are different.

370
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,906
Rym: DDR4 is 1.2 volts.

371
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:09,738
Rym: never ever use RAM that says it uses more than 1.2 volts ever.

372
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,779
Rym: If you think you're the exception you're not.

373
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:14,864
Rym: And it don't.

374
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:17,720
Rym: and if you start saying well, what about ddr3 LV shut up?

375
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,445
Scott: So you gotta think of the day.

376
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:27,828
Scott: I do so, you know often in the past you've had things of the day Pertaining to the other Korea the North Korea best.

377
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:30,494
Scott: I'm doing it to Korea the day, right?

378
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:31,436
Scott: There's only one Korea.

379
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:32,078
Scott: No this too.

380
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:38,376
Scott: So At least now there is and there didn't used to be and there might not be in the future, but there is now.

381
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:51,093
Scott: yeah, so North under our former North Korean things of the day have usually been like Russian guy takes train into North Korea takes photos or Someone goes into North Korea officially here.

382
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:52,038
Scott: photos.

383
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:56,652
Scott: they took Accounts of a person who went there and interviewed, you know, whatever.

384
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,578
Rym: well like that heart-wrenching one of the guy who escaped.

385
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,760
Scott: and right Here is something I have never seen before ever.

386
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:05,187
Scott: These are people who escaped.

387
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:07,153
Scott: they are North Koreans.

388
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:09,460
Scott: They live there their whole lives and then got away.

389
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:15,439
Scott: The one girl got away by going over the frozen river into China during the winter.

390
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,298
Scott: Oh just by walking over the ice ice right not getting shot.

391
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:29,298
Scott: and They're in South Korea now and this person just interviews them about what North Korea is actually like.

392
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:32,546
Scott: this looks Fastness is information.

393
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:36,916
Scott: That is none of its information that like you completely wouldn't expect.

394
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:37,377
Scott: like nothing.

395
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:39,582
Scott: that'll like blow you away But it's like.

396
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:48,446
Scott: it's more like confirmation right of like things you think you know are definitely for reals and It's like whoa.

397
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,880
Scott: that person actually lived there and they got away whoa.

398
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,820
Rym: Those perspectives are also just very interesting and I've never seen anything like this before.

399
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,480
Scott: I'm sure someone will point to some link somewhere where other escaped people, right?

400
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,507
Scott: But this is the first one I've seen.

401
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:06,297
Rym: yeah, well, especially because it's more.

402
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,074
Rym: well I haven't watched the video yet But I was clicking around through it and looking at some of the comments.

403
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:10,899
Rym: what the questions are?

404
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:24,027
Rym: This looks like very more like daily life and like from the perspective of someone Who lived there then saw real Korea and the rest of the world and then had that perspective like all at once over time.

405
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:32,870
Rym: in the moment the book club book is Rebecca some listener tweeted me like they finished it already and I'm like, all right I'll start reading it cuz I just finished.

406
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:37,409
Rym: well, so I watched a bunch of Black Mirror Netflix on my phone with the download mode.

407
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,031
Rym: It works great.

408
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:43,894
Rym: Okay, like mirrors super good It's and it's only like seven episodes total and they're all.

409
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:49,394
Rym: they're basically all mini movies Like kind of Asimov style like short sci-fi dystopian pointed.

410
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:53,308
Scott: Anyway, oh, it's like the Twilight Zone Yeah, but all focused around.

411
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:56,079
Rym: Yeah, I'll show you one but they're like one of them that you'll probably really like.

412
00:28:56,822 --> 00:29:09,175
Rym: It's just this story about this world where people are like riding on exercise bikes and doing things and they get merits And then they use those merits to like trick out their avatars But they don't seem to actually interact in the real world anymore.

413
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:09,577
Rym: And it's just.

414
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:10,160
Rym: it's real.

415
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:18,266
Rym: It's like that Harrison Bergeron made-for-tv move and I already know this story, but it's not the Harrison Bergeron story It's just like that.

416
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:19,130
Scott: Okay.

417
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:24,739
Rym: It's not the story of make everyone the same It's a way different story and it's just way good.

418
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:27,700
Rym: But I watched all that and I read all that.

419
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:30,149
Scott: Is it the rat in the treadmill story?

420
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,012
Scott: Cuz it's just the matrix.

421
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:32,276
Rym: No, it's.

422
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:33,541
Rym: it's not that either It's.

423
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:40,331
Rym: I was surprised and very interested in how that episode ended Surprised at many things that don't surprise me.

424
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:45,333
Rym: Ah, very little surprises me But anyway, I'm done with all those things.

425
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:47,967
Rym: I'm gonna start reading Rebecca tomorrow.

426
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,048
Scott: If anyone doesn't I mean like.

427
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:55,072
Scott: if anyone doesn't know why we inappropriately go Rebecca We should link to cat bug.

428
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,038
Rym: I'll link to cat bug.

429
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,243
Rym: Otherwise.

430
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,580
Rym: the GeekNights Politics Club is also doing his thing.

431
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:07,540
Scott: It is Rym and Scott but a different Scott because bad Scott.

432
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:09,647
Rym: Yeah, that Scott's pretty good bad.

433
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:15,078
Rym: And the first book we did we recorded the first of two episodes about it And the second episode will be up pretty soon.

434
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,039
Rym: It's Evans the coming of the Third Reich Might be a little on the nose.

435
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:27,613
Rym: I'd recommend you read that book and just synthesize the information in it and decide Why don't we read the going of the Third Reich?

436
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,139
Rym: Uh That's just every World War two book.

437
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:35,384
Rym: I did just read a couple of books about that like the you know The end of World War two.

438
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:36,409
Rym: all that nonsense.

439
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:43,720
Rym: the next book in the GeekNights Politics Club I'll post a link to it, but it's basically a book on the current modern history of voter suppression.

440
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,629
Rym: So we'll be doing that and we doing podcast.

441
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:48,035
Rym: It'll be Rym Scott and Andrew.

442
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,340
Rym: Yeah different Scott.

443
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,851
Rym: Yeah, you know you want to talk about real things.

444
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:52,160
Rym: I just want to talk about Rebecca.

445
00:30:55,981 --> 00:31:01,320
Rym: Yeah, check out the GeekNights YouTube channel, which is actually just my channel and Scott's channel.

446
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,929
Rym: They both have stuff Scott still has not uploaded.

447
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,373
Scott: When was I supposed to do this?

448
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:07,476
Scott: between the past two days?

449
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:15,911
Scott: the world wonders When what what what hour during the past two days I supposed to do this And we will be live at Pac South.

450
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:28,072
Rym: at least one of our panels is Scheduled and that is going to be in the cactus theater on Friday January 27th at 4 p.m We are doing another iteration of that grinding panel.

451
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:29,175
Scott: cactus isn't an animal.

452
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:31,799
Rym: I Guess that's true.

453
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,070
Rym: Huh end of an era.

454
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,419
Scott: it's not even a fictional animal.

455
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:41,279
Rym: Well, maybe cactus is the name for an animal in a fantasy world.

456
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,066
Scott: Could it at least been the cactuar theater?

457
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:46,474
Rym: Yeah, it sure that might be trademarked.

458
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:47,818
Scott: I don't give a shit.

459
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:55,978
Rym: Yeah Anyway, this is similar to the grind panel we did before but updated with much more information and sort of focus better.

460
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,536
Rym: So We might do other panels, we'll see.

461
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:02,488
Rym: if that happens We'll also be a magfest being on like five panels.

462
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,936
Scott: a magfest concert schedule was released.

463
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,625
Rym: I didn't even looked at it yet I also saw some rumblings.

464
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,270
Rym: I didn't look into what this is yet.

465
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:15,660
Rym: Multiple people have said there appears to be a Castlevania themed escape the room puzzle at magfest this year.

466
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:20,415
Scott: It was a. the poster that listed all the concerts was Castlevania themed.

467
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:31,080
Scott: Yeah, also You know machine everything Is playing magfest again and Immediately afterwards they are going on the US tour.

468
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:43,980
Scott: So they're gonna play New York like immediately after magfest and daddy can't - yeah but If you don't aren't live in magfest territory, you should go and see where they at.

469
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,139
Scott: Yeah, at least get a fraction of a magfest near you.

470
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,850
Scott: So there you go speaking of Castlevania themes.

471
00:32:50,930 --> 00:33:00,700
Rym: if you're a patron of the patreon for GeekNights I am reading like an e-book the entirety of FX 9's worlds of power Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest novel ization.

472
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:06,399
Rym: So in my bathroom, well one of the two bathrooms in this apartment, but you have a concern in there.

473
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:07,645
Scott: Well, I have.

474
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,213
Scott: so I don't mind that concern.

475
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,460
Scott: I don't have any concerns whatsoever.

476
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:11,363
Rym: It is my.

477
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:14,253
Rym: it's one of the favorite things in my house your bathroom.

478
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:17,865
Rym: No in the bathroom group sign I have a poop sign right?

479
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:29,275
Rym: It's shaped like a stop sign, but it says the word poop and it is set down Low so that if you sit down to say have a poop It is staring you directly in the face at eye level

480
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:32,348
Scott: and telling you not to poop Or telling you to stop and poop.

481
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:33,895
Rym: this comes up every time.

482
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:37,713
Scott: this sign is Sorry, a stop sign says stop on.

483
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:38,799
Scott: it's telling you what to do.

484
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:51,786
Scott: Yeah, but a sign that is shaped like a stop sign Even if it doesn't say stop on it is somehow still saying stop but when it has the word poop on it, it's sort of telling you to poop and But it's also telling you to stop.

485
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,420
Rym: Yeah, but the way I handle this is a simple series of two questions.

486
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,284
Rym: I ask a person.

487
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:58,234
Rym: What do you do to stop sign stop?

488
00:33:58,354 --> 00:33:59,440
Rym: What do you do to poop sign?

489
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,184
Scott: But it's not a poop sign.

490
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:01,908
Scott: It's a stop sign.

491
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:04,220
Rym: It's a poop sign that has a shape like a stop sign.

492
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:07,729
Scott: It's like it's like when the word green is written in the color blue.

493
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:19,552
Rym: I Always crack up a little bit when I see that ever since Ever since it was pointed out to me that that's a thing because I had never encountered that in my life You write the word yellow with a red pen.

494
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:20,579
Rym: Yeah, it's good stuff.

495
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,032
Rym: That's probably the most interesting feature of my bathroom those that poop sign.

496
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:30,475
Scott: my bathroom doesn't have interesting features I thought we were gonna talk about like shampoo soaps and things.

497
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:31,620
Rym: those are concerns the bathroom.

498
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:31,920
Rym: We start.

499
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,370
Rym: we'll start with the products of the bathroom.

500
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:37,020
Rym: What kind of soaps do you use in the bathroom?

501
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,485
Scott: So this is actually a big deal.

502
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:48,406
Scott: So for my whole life at first when I was young days, right the baby times I used the Johnson baby oil, which is the Shampooing the nut for everything right?

503
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:48,907
Scott: It was like the.

504
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:49,830
Scott: no more tears.

505
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:53,060
Rym: No more tears my ass just as many tears.

506
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:56,989
Scott: Yeah, it's lying first But it is safe for babies.

507
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,780
Scott: if you have a baby or you're tiny.

508
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,940
Scott: That's what you should use the baby so that you know that you know the shit I'm talking about.

509
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:04,004
Rym: How does that pain notice?

510
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:05,832
Scott: how that product doesn't have a lot of competitors?

511
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,719
Scott: Yeah, it's cuz it's legit.

512
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:13,300
Scott: And after that, I would use the most cheapo gennaro soaps.

513
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:15,797
Scott: I could get the ones that smelled good like.

514
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,003
Rym: yeah I smelled a little.

515
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:22,304
Rym: so the problem is that occasionally when you like RIT you'd use like the cheapo shit soaps Like we had the Irish sprang.

516
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,332
Scott: all that meant was an Irish spring.

517
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:26,881
Scott: Irish spring is actually way better than that free stuff We got.

518
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,506
Rym: yeah, that free stuff was the worst.

519
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:29,810
Scott: Yeah, but disintegrated.

520
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,277
Rym: and the times you would use the Irish spring.

521
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:33,747
Scott: all that man I didn't use.

522
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:34,980
Scott: I never used Irish spring in my life.

523
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,455
Rym: Whatever bar soap you use I use coasts that you said smelled good.

524
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:39,480
Scott: It does smell good.

525
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:43,140
Scott: Oh, it smells like you're like it's like it makes you feel like you're on the beach.

526
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:51,320
Scott: It's like it has pictures of waves on it But like I know that's just marketing but literally like if I bust out a bar coast It feels like aha Beach.

527
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:57,279
Scott: Aha, and then if you use it while you're at the beach and outside shower for some reason it just doubles in power somehow.

528
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,920
Rym: from My perspective it just smelled violently like soap like you smelled so strongly of soap that it was notable.

529
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:03,885
Scott: Smells like it's.

530
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:06,196
Scott: now it feels like you're on the like the tropical.

531
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:07,020
Scott: It's so good.

532
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:07,884
Scott: It's just.

533
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:13,950
Scott: it's like this our and it makes you feel so clean to it like oops My all the oil just cuz like blasted away from your body.

534
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:16,600
Scott: Like you just got hit with like an anti-oil fire hose.

535
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:17,463
Scott: It's like boosh.

536
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:24,855
Rym: So my whole life I used for shampoo at least in soap, especially soap Whatever the family bought because I was a kid.

537
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:25,399
Rym: I didn't give a shit.

538
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,077
Scott: One of my family had their own biz.

539
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:33,298
Scott: There were five people there were five shampoos There were five people in five soaps.

540
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:37,500
Rym: See, I feel like other people in the family like cared more and like bought different stuff.

541
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:43,482
Rym: But I just used randomly whatever was in the shower when I went to use the shower Mm-hmm.

542
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:46,874
Scott: And when I went as soon as I did that in other people's houses sometimes.

543
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,540
Scott: Yeah, but not in my own house.

544
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:57,074
Rym: but when I got to RIT and I had to get so I Decided to be modern and use only like basic liquid soap.

545
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:57,916
Rym: No bar soap.

546
00:36:57,956 --> 00:36:59,260
Rym: No that old-style nonsense.

547
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:05,818
Scott: Yeah, I did for you know, I was I was buying like Swayve Yeah, and you know very Gennaro soaps.

548
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:13,260
Rym: I think I bought some fruity one like fuck to see something because it was on sale at Wegmans Like it was all day on sale.

549
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:23,440
Scott: It was also a time in my life when I had some dandruff actions and I was buying the strongest shit We got to separate between shampoo and so very different discussions.

550
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:27,700
Scott: But anyway, the point is, you know, I was using coast and I was using Gennaro liquid soaps.

551
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,937
Scott: But eventually, you know, I went on Amazon and I searched and I searched.

552
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:32,740
Scott: I'm like I need to fight.

553
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,443
Scott: You know cuz like.

554
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:36,718
Scott: usually when you use a product like you're way happy with it.

555
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:40,939
Rym: You're like wow This is the shit for me, but or you don't notice it and don't think about it, right?

556
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,033
Scott: But like liquid soap I realize like hey I keep buying whatever is cheap because I don't like whatever I buy.

557
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:47,600
Scott: like I'm not super in love with any of these.

558
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:54,220
Scott: Let me find a soap for the shower that like I'm fucking down with and I found the greatest shit.

559
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,871
Scott: It is Neutrogena rain bath.

560
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:58,116
Rym: you and your fucking Neutrogena.

561
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,561
Rym: You're like obsessed with this stuff I don't know.

562
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:04,200
Rym: So Neutrogena rain bath is like yes, we know it's pronounced Neutrogena Scott's just weird.

563
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:12,105
Scott: Yeah, so you can buy it in like this giant, you know liquid plunger thing and it's what like a gallon It's really.

564
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:16,346
Scott: it's like a liter bottle with this with a plunger on top Because it's really style.

565
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:20,080
Scott: it's really expensive but you got to see you gotta buy it in bulk to get value, right?

566
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,955
Scott: But when you use it, it feels and smells like luxury hotel.

567
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:28,770
Scott: It's like ah luxury Oh, so now it's like every single time I take a shower.

568
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,920
Scott: I feel like I'm in a five-star hotels.

569
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,522
Scott: The great.

570
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:36,360
Scott: it's totally worth the five to ten dollars more it costs compared to the genero.

571
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,660
Scott: So so I was usually gets you so clean and like a tiny bit lathers up like crazy like other soaps that were cheap.

572
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:45,420
Scott: I'd have to use a whole bunch of it to get it to lather enough.

573
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:51,639
Scott: But like the rain bath I can plunge like half a plunge even and it'll go into the foofy the poof.

574
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:52,794
Rym: Oh, you use the loofa.

575
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:57,540
Scott: Yeah, you I bought like a bag of like cuz the poofs quality is like you can't find a good one.

576
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:00,039
Scott: So I bought a bag of like 20 cheap ones.

577
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,818
Scott: Like I have a sack of them.

578
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:09,420
Scott: so I like half half a plunge onto a poof will make a Million suds everywhere and you can shower your whole body.

579
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:13,111
Rym: Interesting because I You I you when I was younger.

580
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,660
Rym: I'd use washcloths for the washing.

581
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:20,915
Rym: I still use a washcloth like on my face and say RIT I would use like I had a loofah or two or whatever for the last decade.

582
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:21,839
Rym: I don't use anything.

583
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:27,700
Scott: You my hands you just put goop on your hand and so and I get any friction the fraud.

584
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:31,242
Scott: So I went to a dermatologist for an on.

585
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:36,426
Rym: this is like a decade ago to cut out like an unrelated like little cyst I had like on my face a little tiny one.

586
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:40,414
Rym: and They you know, I feel like dermatologists.

587
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:44,780
Rym: if you come in for something minor They just really want to tell you all this advice about skin.

588
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,231
Scott: Yeah but every other every dermatologist tell you something different.

589
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:49,644
Rym: so this one was just like Cuz I cuz.

590
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:53,826
Rym: I was just asked me all these questions about skin and everything and she was like So what do you wash with?

591
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:54,790
Rym: I was like I use a loofah.

592
00:39:54,810 --> 00:40:00,720
Rym: she's like, yeah that pretty much just like Exfoliates you for no reason and it'll actually make you more prone to acne or whatever.

593
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,826
Rym: Like you'll get more pimples and stuff.

594
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:02,590
Rym: and I was like sure I do.

595
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,252
Rym: and she was like look at your fingers My fingers and she's like they've got little ridges.

596
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:07,834
Rym: They got friction.

597
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:08,497
Rym: Just use your fingers.

598
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:09,200
Rym: They'll be fine.

599
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:12,731
Rym: Uh-huh, so I started doing that and it was great.

600
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:15,420
Scott: and I had a biology teacher in high school ones.

601
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,580
Scott: He said yeah, I ain't gonna vaccines and I didn't get any polio.

602
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:21,911
Scott: So it'll be fine up.

603
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:22,635
Rym: So I just want out.

604
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:23,279
Rym: do I smell bad?

605
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:28,333
Rym: Have I've gotten a stye in the entire time that you've known me.

606
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:31,745
Scott: I don't really pay attention to anyone's styes I've ever got.

607
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,130
Scott: you don't smell good.

608
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,996
Scott: You don't smell like luxury hotel like I do.

609
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:36,040
Rym: I think I smell pretty good.

610
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,037
Rym: No, I think I smell more like like a human as opposed to a luxury hotel.

611
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:41,900
Scott: Wouldn't you rather smell?

612
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:46,600
Scott: Or a human who just stayed in a luxury hotel?

613
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:55,620
Rym: But so I do use soap now But I use that shitty liquid soap at RIT for like couple years same same deal as you buy the cheapest crap.

614
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,060
Scott: Never liked it when I ran out didn't have a lot of money.

615
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:02,900
Rym: Yeah, I'd buy whatever the cheapest crap was and one day I ran out of soap and I just kept washing myself.

616
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,164
Rym: I just basically would rub myself down with my hands with the water and I'd shampoo But I would never soap.

617
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:13,157
Rym: Well also and that worked fine and I stopped using soap for like six years.

618
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:13,678
Scott: That's gross.

619
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,463
Scott: Also You know what?

620
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:16,648
Scott: It is true.

621
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:19,038
Rym: No, it was like I was fine.

622
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:26,160
Scott: Sure It is true to some extent at the greatest trick the devil ever pulled is telling you that shampoo and soap are two different things.

623
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,745
Rym: So there are differences.

624
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:31,072
Scott: there are but you can if you have.

625
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:33,700
Scott: you can clean your body with shampoo and you can clean your body.

626
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,207
Scott: Let's clean your hair with soap.

627
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:39,706
Rym: No, so if your hair is longer than like two inches You cannot clean your hair with soap.

628
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:41,030
Rym: I'll fuck your hair up.

629
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:45,940
Scott: Also while you must use soap on your body I don't think you have to in the shower.

630
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:50,236
Scott: Do not have to actually use shampoo or any sort of thing to clean your hair.

631
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,492
Scott: You can clean your hair with just water it depends.

632
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,149
Rym: so Dandruff has also been a problem for me.

633
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,220
Scott: So yeah, so dandruff is a different issue.

634
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,380
Scott: But if you're just talking about cleaning hair without a dandruff problem, you just need to what you know water.

635
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:14,113
Rym: So I use dandruff shampoo occasionally like whenever I need to but if I don't use that I don't use any shampoo ever So I don't have hair.

636
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,680
Scott: Yeah, you still get dandruff.

637
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:20,755
Scott: So the secret I learned right is cuz actually I'm not really shit.

638
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:22,560
Scott: I don't really have dandruff as a problem anymore.

639
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:25,390
Scott: I have this thing called the seborrheic dermatitis.

640
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,794
Rym: No, cuz that's what I get.

641
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,400
Scott: It's called tinea versicolor.

642
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:30,085
Rym: Oh, we have two different dandruff.

643
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,673
Scott: So tinea versicolor is not a dandruff.

644
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:33,476
Scott: It is a fungus.

645
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,265
Rym: Oh I know why you and fungus is.

646
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:47,146
Scott: it's basically there's like this yeast that's everywhere right tinea and on some people their skin goes ah yeast and makes like colors and Most people it doesn't.

647
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,453
Scott: but for some they don't even know.

648
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:52,736
Scott: like they don't even know about this Like I don't think anyone's researching it enough or anyone cares.

649
00:42:52,756 --> 00:42:54,846
Rym: Oh, well, yeah The info is like em.

650
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:57,860
Scott: a lot of people get this because it doesn't do anything to you.

651
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,689
Scott: It just shows up as like colored patches on your body.

652
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,080
Scott: Yeah, and the way to make it go away is with selenium sulfide.

653
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:12,270
Scott: So when I went to a dermatologist they prescribed for me like 2% selenium sulfide and the instructions were like Shampoo your body with this and wait a while and then rinse it off.

654
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,518
Scott: but selenium sulfide is the same thing.

655
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:18,052
Scott: that's in Selson which is selenium salt, right?

656
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:18,373
Scott: Yep.

657
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:19,618
Scott: It's in the name now.

658
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:25,180
Rym: before that I remember you used to use the stuff that had like coal tar in it, but that's carcinogenic, right?

659
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,255
Scott: Well tea people didn't know that when I was using it first of all And that was I used that like way back in the day and that was for dandruff.

660
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,984
Scott: now that I have no hair Right.

661
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:33,507
Scott: I'm mostly.

662
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,440
Scott: I'm worried about this, you know versicolor.

663
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:41,271
Rym: So shit, I don't get like nor like, you know, it's stereotypical like dandruffy people Like there's just white flakes like all over their clothes.

664
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:41,914
Rym: Yes.

665
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:43,060
Rym: I don't get that.

666
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,886
Rym: I get the seborrheic dermatitis style.

667
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:56,177
Rym: or basically if I don't use a dandruff shampoo on a regular basis Then if you did like if I dig my fingers into my scalp and I go like this I'll pull out a bunch of flakes, but they don't come out on their own.

668
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:56,580
Rym: Mm-hmm.

669
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,600
Rym: But if I use this stuff it basically is a hundred percent not there at all.

670
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,103
Scott: So the seek.

671
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:02,068
Scott: so the thing is I start.

672
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:10,500
Scott: I tried to use the selced instead of the prescription For the same thing cuz I didn't renew the prescription in time and I ran out so and it wasn't working.

673
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:19,300
Scott: But then I realized and this is important if you read the instructions It says leave that shit on your head it don't just rinse it out right away like normal shampoo.

674
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,432
Scott: So when I was like, oh, maybe I'll actually try doing that like it.

675
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:24,797
Scott: see it works doesn't?

676
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:25,620
Rym: it's like night and day.

677
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:29,180
Scott: The instructions also tell you like do it twice and I'm like, that's bullshit.

678
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,443
Scott: You're trying to make me waste product and spend twice as much money Which they are.

679
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:40,314
Scott: but what I do is I get in the shower and I put it on my head Yep, and I don't rinse it off until the very end of the shower same strategy.

680
00:44:40,435 --> 00:44:49,072
Scott: and now tinea versicolor No longer shows up like on my shoulders or my back or anywhere where it used to show up You know, even though I'm only putting it on my head.

681
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:50,639
Scott: I guess it sort of flows down, right?

682
00:44:51,020 --> 00:45:02,660
Rym: Yeah, well, so the funny thing is with the with the dandruff you stuff I'll get it on my head like that's normal But if I if I'm not careful It'll appear in my sideburns and occasionally on like one area of my chest the exact same area.

683
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:08,120
Rym: So I wash those areas with selson, but I don't otherwise use soap in those areas.

684
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:14,639
Scott: So you just you got to put it on there and at the beginning of the shower and rinse it off at the end And that's long enough for it to sort of have its effects.

685
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,052
Scott: Yep, well son if you do that every shower, you'll be fine.

686
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:22,655
Scott: those instructions were there for a reason But don't do it two times because then you're just wasting stuff and spending twice as much money.

687
00:45:22,835 --> 00:45:26,927
Rym: Yep, but Intern conditioner, I guess you don't know.

688
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:33,635
Scott: also, you know, we weren't paid to promote any of these products In any way shape or form in case anyone was thinking that.

689
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:34,540
Rym: so, oh, yeah.

690
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,220
Rym: So before I get to condition, I haven't used soap for many years, but I started using soap again recently.

691
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:45,920
Rym: Oh, you started using soap because Emily's mom got me just as a gift randomly a bunch of other other stuff this like bar.

692
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,151
Rym: So like fancy bars though, weren't you all like?

693
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:51,083
Scott: bar soap is the worst Cuz.

694
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:56,291
Rym: I had a hitherto every bar So but ever used been some like Irish sprang bullshit.

695
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:58,360
Scott: coast is so good coast is not good.

696
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,816
Scott: I still you like even though I clean it myself with a rain bath I still use coast to like clean up between my toes and stuff like that.

697
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:10,070
Rym: Ah so I Usually I've scrubbed my feet more so than put soap on them.

698
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:10,592
Scott: Hmm.

699
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:12,800
Scott: I mean, you know, it's gonna get some soap down.

700
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,900
Rym: Yeah, but you use the heavy scrubbing, but this soap has like big chunks of salt embedded in it everywhere.

701
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,307
Scott: So make to make it scratching.

702
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,180
Rym: Yep, and it's just like the most comfortable soap.

703
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,212
Rym: So I use it now, but I only.

704
00:46:26,232 --> 00:46:27,580
Rym: I basically only does the George Carlin.

705
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,144
Rym: I wash the.

706
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,360
Scott: you could always use lava soap if you want scratchiness.

707
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,075
Rym: So I also super clean eyes separately have some.

708
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,360
Rym: it's basically lava.

709
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,426
Rym: So like that kind of.

710
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:38,136
Scott: so you're gonna get the lava brand lava soap.

711
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:39,183
Rym: Yeah, it's not long It's not.

712
00:46:39,344 --> 00:46:41,620
Rym: it's not the full-on pumice II situation.

713
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,605
Scott: Oh, that's so good.

714
00:46:42,826 --> 00:46:48,249
Rym: It's got real lie in it and I use that if I get like Bicycle grease on my hands lava soap.

715
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:51,180
Scott: It's always good to have one bar of actual lava brand lava.

716
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,426
Scott: So but that's what we used to use back in like art class when we were kids Clean paint and stuff.

717
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:58,660
Rym: I used it as a fireman to get you know fire off his head.

718
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:11,075
Scott: It's like when you're in a situation where like you're not taking a shower or something You are just literally usually your hands But any part of your body is actually filthy from something and you must get it clean.

719
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,462
Scott: something like grease Right.

720
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,344
Scott: It is like it is.

721
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,167
Scott: it's pumice.

722
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:16,771
Scott: It works based on friction.

723
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,657
Scott: It is the powerful soaps.

724
00:47:18,777 --> 00:47:19,800
Scott: It will get the job done.

725
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,660
Scott: You got to have some of that because you never know when you're gonna like get something gross all over you from a dirty job.

726
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:28,931
Rym: So I guess you don't use conditioner.

727
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,480
Scott: I've never used conditioner.

728
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,117
Scott: I in fact once I bought a conditioner by accident and I couldn't figure out like how it worked cuz like it was.

729
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:42,600
Scott: so the like the The liquid was such that like I couldn't even get it had hair.

730
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Scott: Then I bought a conditioner by accident thinking it was shampoo, but I literally couldn't get it in my hair.

731
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,937
Scott: It was like a almost nearly solid kind of goop.

732
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:51,460
Scott: It didn't work.

733
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,079
Rym: So what's interesting is that if your hair is short, you pretty much don't need conditioner.

734
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:57,840
Rym: You only really need it if your hair is like fucked up in some way.

735
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,563
Scott: I mean I've used.

736
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:04,066
Scott: there were times when I used a shampoo that was also a conditioner and I didn't notice any difference between That and a regular shampoo.

737
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:09,751
Scott: The only thing I use conditioner for cuz remember I don't really use Conditioner is like a made-up product just to get by more.

738
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,956
Rym: So here's the main thing is long, right?

739
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:17,740
Rym: My hair gets like a little bit tangled over the course of day like tangles appear The you put the conditioner in my hand.

740
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,580
Scott: I mean if you put a bunch of wires next to each other they get tied in dots just naturally.

741
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:21,841
Scott: So

742
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:34,800
Rym: all I use conditioner for is I put it in my hair and then while I'm in the shower While the conditioner is in my hair I take a wide-tooth comb and I comb my hair and the conditioner is like the lubricant to untangle the hair 100% and then I rinse it out and that's what I usually for that.

743
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:36,888
Rym: No shampoo does not lubricate.

744
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:40,863
Rym: shampoo in fact dries out reduces the oil makes the tangle more Mm-hmm.

745
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:42,916
Rym: So the conditioner replenishes.

746
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:46,979
Scott: my you know Co method would mark on my you know bucket of cables.

747
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:54,599
Rym: Spray conditioner into your Christmas lights and then start combing them and see what happens.

748
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:55,624
Scott: It could work.

749
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:57,373
Rym: that could be a funny YouTube video.

750
00:48:57,573 --> 00:48:57,915
Rym: Sure.

751
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,880
Rym: That'd be like a key and peel.

752
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:05,131
Scott: So Shaving wise I you already talked about shaving in a whole episode.

753
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,619
Rym: we can so I changed though for a long way back.

754
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:11,460
Rym: you and I both use the the like pre-whipped bowl of fancy.

755
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,167
Scott: I still use the premium bowl of fancy stuff.

756
00:49:13,227 --> 00:49:14,773
Scott: one bowl last me like five years.

757
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:15,717
Rym: Yeah, I have one.

758
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:21,480
Rym: You know that fancy soap I start was using That stuff is the best shaving soap I've ever used in my life.

759
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:27,764
Rym: You're using the same soap for your body and your shave So I have to pie of a puck of it that I got Four years ago.

760
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:32,880
Rym: that is in my shaving cup and it's fine and I use it every time I shave.

761
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:37,964
Rym: It is like it is the best shave like fuck every other shaving soap I have ever used.

762
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:41,360
Rym: using this soap in a shaving cup is like the best.

763
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,607
Scott: I've used different soaps and I haven't noticed a difference really well I think they're all good enough.

764
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:47,300
Rym: my beard II gets thicker than yours.

765
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,972
Rym: I also do a for I do an against-the-grain shave like super close.

766
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:54,537
Rym: Mm-hmm, which I think you don't do for curly reasons.

767
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:56,139
Scott: I'm just sad.

768
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,353
Scott: Any difference between any soaps besides how they smell.

769
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:02,739
Rym: I've noticed significant differences.

770
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:09,240
Rym: granted Of course the bigger difference is gotta actually change your blade regularly, but mmm the soap makes a big difference.

771
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,329
Scott: Yeah.

772
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,806
Scott: So blades I've been by.

773
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:14,400
Scott: I bought on Amazon like 10 pack like 10 different blades.

774
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,324
Rym: Try them all.

775
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:17,854
Rym: the Ross free platinum is still like the Merkur one.

776
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,480
Rym: like every other blade has been garbage.

777
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:21,690
Scott: No, the Merkur one's actually not so good.

778
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,157
Rym: Ross free the food good one.

779
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:26,271
Scott: Not the cheap one I don't know, but the one that I tried.

780
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:27,456
Scott: that was actually way good.

781
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:28,220
Scott: like of the pack.

782
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,108
Scott: There was like a whole bunch of different ones in there and I'm like surprised that all these blades are still made Like there was one with a soccer ball on it.

783
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,156
Scott: They're like so many different kinds.

784
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:37,320
Scott: It was kind of hilarious, right?

785
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,865
Rym: Like that is the best blade still.

786
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:42,700
Scott: I couldn't believe that there were so many but the one that I of the pack.

787
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:44,028
Scott: So I haven't even finished the pack.

788
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:44,993
Scott: There are ten blades in there.

789
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:49,532
Scott: I bought it like over a year ago It's how outright but there was one that said feather on it.

790
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:51,720
Rym: And now that's the alternative brand.

791
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,786
Rym: That's like the second one.

792
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:53,972
Scott: That was the best one.

793
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:55,400
Scott: yet was the one that said feather.

794
00:50:55,782 --> 00:51:00,060
Scott: It was so sharp and it lasted a little bit longer than the other ones and whatnot.

795
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:06,587
Scott: So if I had to buy a whole pack of blades that were all the same and not a sampler I would get the feather one.

796
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:08,816
Scott: I still think depending how much it costs.

797
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:12,875
Scott: I prefer the Merkur But I also those one that was like bluebird.

798
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:13,920
Scott: That one was really bad.

799
00:51:14,021 --> 00:51:14,606
Scott: I got you.

800
00:51:14,787 --> 00:51:15,453
Scott: you couldn't even use it.

801
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:16,300
Scott: once I had to throw it out.

802
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,662
Scott: It sucked.

803
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:18,735
Rym: but I use feather blades in because I have a little.

804
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:27,940
Rym: I have another shaving key another device basically that I bought years ago that I've been using and It takes this tiny like weird quarter blade.

805
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:43,930
Rym: That's like wide on one end and it's like three millimeters wide on the on the small end And I use it just to shave the tiny bits of hair that grow right at the inside of the bottom of my nose Because I can't shave that with my big razor.

806
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,280
Scott: I just sort of pull my nose up and shave you with my real razor.

807
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,470
Rym: I've tried that but I've cut myself a few times.

808
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,816
Rym: My nose has like a little ridge there.

809
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:51,660
Scott: That's just you know.

810
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,926
Scott: Yeah, it's a little bit annoying.

811
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:55,840
Scott: I could see how a specialized tool would make that nice.

812
00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:57,380
Scott: I just don't feel like it's necessary.

813
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,779
Scott: Especially to buy something needs reusable blades just to do that one tiny thing.

814
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:06,397
Scott: So the other thing I sometimes like if it's really bad It is one that I can't get with it.

815
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,725
Scott: I'll just get a scissor in there.

816
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:11,942
Rym: but it also means I can shave my eyebrows and like do a little bit of sculpting and Stuff if I need to.

817
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,689
Scott: yeah, I don't shave my eyebrows.

818
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:16,800
Rym: I do otherwise they get a little they get Bell dandy thick.

819
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:18,459
Scott: What's wrong with that?

820
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:28,676
Scott: One thing I will do though is if there's sometimes they'll be one eyebrow hair this by itself or really long That's by itself and it's like double thick and way long and like.

821
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:31,500
Scott: I can feel it Like it's like one monster eyebrow hair.

822
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:38,181
Scott: Like imagine if you were an octopus with a bunch of tentacles and one tentacle was just like super buff Like.

823
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:51,600
Rym: yeah, this is my super strong tentacle and all the other tentacles just like I really like clean mine up because I had In the middle like, you know going out I had a bunch of hairs in my eyebrow that were as long as my entire eyebrow.

824
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,151
Rym: Like you had to comb them with the eyebrow.

825
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:56,080
Rym: they were like more than an inch long.

826
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,234
Scott: So if one of those appears which is like once every beer or so, they'll be one like that.

827
00:53:00,254 --> 00:53:01,659
Scott: I have tweezers.

828
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,853
Scott: They're tweezer man tweezers.

829
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:06,144
Scott: They're like, it's a Surgically pointy.

830
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:09,416
Scott: It's a little more expensive than other tweezers, but it's so pointy.

831
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:14,140
Rym: I don't want the pointy I want the like wider but with us like a razor edge.

832
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,819
Scott: I need it to be so pointy so I can grab just that one hair and yank its ass out.

833
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:24,880
Scott: Otherwise you're grabbing like a whole bunch of hairs and it's like ah, I want to grab just one.

834
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:27,067
Rym: So hand soap.

835
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:29,958
Rym: I use the foaming stuff.

836
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:32,425
Scott: I Tried so many hand soaps.

837
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:34,230
Scott: first methods sweet water.

838
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:40,020
Rym: foaming stuff has the best smell the best feel and that Little like the pump of it lasts forever.

839
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,000
Scott: So at first I was using the soap that smelled like melon just because it smelled the best.

840
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,270
Scott: But then that soap had tricklesand and we learned better.

841
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,473
Scott: so I stopped using that.

842
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:52,844
Scott: so then I tried the Myers whatever.

843
00:53:53,286 --> 00:53:57,000
Scott: but that soap had a problem and that it was like had oil.

844
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:58,940
Scott: I didn't realize when I bought it it had oil in it.

845
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,209
Scott: So when I wash my hands with it, my hands didn't feel clean.

846
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:02,394
Scott: They felt oily.

847
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:03,800
Scott: I want hands a feel clean.

848
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:09,978
Scott: So then I got the foamy soap and I got the pear variety and that's okay.

849
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:10,600
Scott: I've used that one.

850
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,191
Scott: It smells great and my hands feel so clean.

851
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,240
Rym: You can buy the bulk refill, right?

852
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,080
Scott: My hands feel so clean after washing with the foamy soap.

853
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:20,056
Scott: So that's the best.

854
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:26,159
Scott: right now I was trying to find a hand soap that was like Neutrogena rain bath of hand.

855
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,090
Scott: so They don't make such a thing.

856
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,740
Scott: Neutrogena doesn't make a hand soap.

857
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:34,935
Scott: There's no luxury hotel hand soap available that I could find outside of luxury hotels.

858
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:37,989
Scott: So if anyone knows of one Let me know.

859
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:45,453
Rym: in public bathrooms Whenever there's that like Hanging vat of generic pink soap the pink stuff.

860
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,419
Rym: I don't touch that stuff I just wash my hands without soap.

861
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:59,040
Rym: I cuz one time I was at work right and that vat was there and the top was like kind of open and I Opened it the rest of the way and looked in and there was a layer of dead flies on top of it.

862
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:01,072
Scott: All right, usually it's a plastic bag.

863
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,464
Scott: Yeah hooked up to the front So it doesn't matter if this flies.

864
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:06,533
Rym: outside the bag there were flies like having drowned in it.

865
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:11,900
Scott: It looked like alright, but anyway And my work they just have built-in plungers.

866
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,399
Scott: You don't see what brand of soap it is.

867
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,866
Scott: But yeah normal soap comes out.

868
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:19,389
Rym: that stuff always smell you will usually smells weird though Like I don't like to smell a lot of that public.

869
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:20,374
Scott: So I don't know.

870
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:21,420
Scott: but it's not pink stuff.

871
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,569
Scott: It's just the same soap you'd buy at the grocery store.

872
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:25,757
Scott: They just buy it in bulk from like Amazon or something.

873
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:32,827
Scott: Yeah But yeah, if I'm in a public restroom the foamy stuff where you put your hand under and automatically comes out That's the best stuff.

874
00:55:32,887 --> 00:55:35,340
Scott: That's like I was at the doctor's office and that's what they had there.

875
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,174
Rym: It's automated goes like and you're like a puff in your hand.

876
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:39,380
Rym: Yeah, that's the good stuff.

877
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,082
Scott: That's the good stuff.

878
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:42,690
Scott: If you're making a public bathroom install those.

879
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:44,215
Rym: I think we've.

880
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:45,700
Rym: this is almost an hour long.

881
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,344
Rym: I think that worked.

882
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:47,613
Rym: Okay, we did a show.

883
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:48,620
Scott: we didn't even talk about toilets.
