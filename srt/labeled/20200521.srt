00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:34,295
Rym: Uh Nothing happened in the last few days.

Scott: Yep.

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,710
Rym: I Started making some cookies last night, but I had to chill the dough.

14
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:57,530
Rym: So I was too lazy to actually wait until the dough was chilled to cook and I wasn't gonna not chill the dough.

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,757
Rym: Cuz that's how you make shitty cookies.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,030
Rym: So we make those cookies today.

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,860
Rym: That is the most exciting thing that's happened to me in the last since the last time we did a show.

18
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:06,970
Scott: All right.

19
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:08,928
Rym: So, I guess we'll just skip that.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,010
Scott: Similarly prosaic anecdote is a US holiday on Monday, but I already stay home every day.

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,417
Scott: So what's I don't know?

22
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,949
Scott: I guess I just don't have to do work while I'm at home that day.

23
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,799
Rym: I mean my company I might.

24
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,650
Rym: my days are at least structured to where my work is So busy like it's the same as normal except I'm not there.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,805
Rym: So weekends and holidays mean a lot because it means I don't have to do work.

26
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:30,890
Rym: I can go like bike or something.

27
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:38,287
Scott: I mean, yeah, but it's like I still Don't do you know, I only do a few now that I'm actually at home, right.

Scott: you can only do certain things right?

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,763
Scott: So it's like I could read.

31
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,530
Scott: go watch a YouTube during lunch.

32
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:04,567
Rym: Yeah, you know I could read some news, you know at other times They can't be like I'm gonna go do a lunch bike ride and then get back to work.

33
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,026
Scott: exactly I can be all over Twitter while I'm working on the second monitor, right?

34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,930
Scott: You know, it's I can read reddit so I can do all kinds of stuff, but there's certain things I can't do.

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:21,424
Scott: I can't play a video game or I can't cook right like, you know this morning It's like I have bagel and I ran out of cream cheese.

36
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:22,550
Scott: Well, I cooked egg.

37
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:28,009
Scott: I didn't have any bacon either but Cooked an egg and I put melted cheese on it right and I put that on the bagel.

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,692
Scott: Like.

39
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,218
Scott: you can't do that if I'm at the office.

40
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:31,423
Scott: I got to pay someone to do that.

41
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:36,462
Rym: true office doesn't have a stove But I guess partly just because my job is so busy.

42
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,670
Rym: I don't actually have any more of that free time.

43
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:44,979
Scott: So like it's meeting see so I wake up and it's like yeah I'm doing you know the same amount of actual work.

44
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,770
Scott: work right on the work computer the bad screen which is over here next to me.

45
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:49,978
Scott: Yeah, it's closed right now.

46
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,509
Scott: It's not opening until next Tuesday.

47
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,935
Scott: But The Was I saying right.

48
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:07,342
Scott: but you know all that time that I was spending in the office not working doing other stuff Can now be spent doing absolutely anything.

Scott: I can play a video game at two o'clock I can cook of lunch I can you know, I just can't like go for a bike ride.

50
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,658
Scott: Yeah, because that would be.

51
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,850
Scott: I can't get too far away from the bad screen.

52
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:23,090
Scott: I have to stay close enough to it, but my option I can clean the kitchen, right?

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,808
Scott: I'd clean the kitchen a lot during work time, which I normally could When I'm in an office far away from the kitchen.

54
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,824
Scott: Yeah, oh yeah having a day off my company decided yeah, no one has to work.

55
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,958
Scott: not only do we not have to work Monday We don't have to work tomorrow.

56
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:39,945
Scott: It should be Friday the 22nd either.

57
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,140
Scott: So I'm basically today was Friday.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,790
Scott: I'm done now until Tuesday.

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,430
Rym: Yeah, I do have to work tomorrow, but I do not have to work Monday.

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,237
Rym: So long weekend means a lot to me.

61
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:58,569
Scott: still even in these roads like I guess I can bike but I still You know Not a lot of other differences.

62
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:04,120
Rym: See any news because the world is still happening to a degree sure.

63
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:10,940
Scott: so all the sports, right are Separately figuring out what the hell to do because they all canceled.

64
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,890
Scott: Yeah, right NBA stopped NHL stopped.

65
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,642
Scott: I think the Bundesliga in Germany.

66
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,990
Scott: I heard is playing to empty crowds.

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,370
Rym: Yeah, I saw I saw a bunch of rumblings of like non-us sports doing the empty crowd thing for a lot of places.

68
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,150
Scott: Yeah, so that's interesting.

69
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:42,373
Scott: so it actually seems like you know perhaps out of a Desire to make money or greater need to make money because it's smaller League our favorite the NHL You know, they're.

70
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:47,169
Scott: they've been rumors swirling ever since they stopped over what this the comeback would look like.

71
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:57,290
Rym: Yep, because it's complicated because we were near the end of the regular season But exactly not close enough to the end to where they know who would officially be in the playoffs.

72
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,339
Rym: Like it could change the Rangers could have.

73
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:04,405
Scott: maybe NBA was in a similar spot though It is it doesn't seem to even be trying to come back.

74
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:16,210
Rym: Yeah But the at least as far as I can tell yeah, but it was this point where you couldn't just be like, okay Let's just do a playoff to eliminate the eliminate having to deal with all the teams because like Rangers can make the playoffs like who?

75
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,158
Rym: Knows what would have happened.

76
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,210
Rym: There's a lot of games anyway.

77
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,997
Scott: so All the rumors have been swirling.

78
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,210
Scott: but you know, the NHL has always just been like, yeah, those are all rumors.

79
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,656
Scott: Yeah, no of things.

80
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:31,310
Scott: we've just you know, we've discussed lots and lots of things and none of them are set in stone.

81
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:39,670
Scott: Well now as of like today yesterday There is one rumor that is still not some guaranteed official thing.

82
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,929
Scott: But is it is gaining strength as a more than just rumor like possible strong consideration, I guess.

83
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,723
Rym: Yep It's recent definitely because this is you sending me.

84
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,010
Rym: this link is the first I heard of it.

85
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,078
Scott: Oh, you didn't heard of it.

86
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,924
Scott: So I heard of it.

87
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,151
Scott: I heard of it like yesterday there.

88
00:05:54,272 --> 00:06:06,790
Scott: the plan a possible plan that the NHL is strongly considering supposedly is to have a 24-team playoff and the way it would work is the top four teams in each conference.

89
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,802
Scott: So east and west they just go to the real playoffs like they don't have to do anything right.

90
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:20,151
Scott: the remaining eight teams Right would play play in series Best of five.

91
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:27,400
Scott: so supposedly the Rangers would play the Hurricanes best of five and if you win your play in series best of five.

92
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,576
Scott: So there's eight teams in playoff and in these playing games, right?

93
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:40,245
Scott: Yeah, so they obviously get cut down to four and Then those four that had to play in the best of five play in series would then go meet The eight.

94
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:45,345
Scott: the remaining four that said skipped it because they were the top four To form an eight.

95
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:59,837
Scott: so you'd have eight in each conference total of 16 and then you would have a normal playoffs with best of seven series and They would play these games supposedly in two different locations With no fans out somewhere who knows where.

96
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,450
Scott: yeah Just like take two cities two arenas.

97
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:04,480
Scott: play all the games in those two places.

98
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,545
Rym: You know probably do something like all the players go into special hotels their quarantine for a few weeks Then they play.

99
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:16,149
Scott: they can't leave that place until like they're eliminated like who knows Who knows if the Union will go along with it.

100
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,032
Scott: right who knows?

101
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:19,260
Scott: so even though you don't have fans there.

102
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,715
Scott: Right which greatly done, which does greatly cut down the number of people, but there's a lot of staff.

103
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,204
Scott: right when you don't have fans It's like okay.

104
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:27,365
Scott: Well.

105
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,793
Scott: You don't need hot dog salesmen.

106
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,204
Scott: You don't need merch salesman You don't ticket taker.

107
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,227
Scott: You don't need Usher.

108
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:36,960
Scott: You don't need the scoreboards only photographers trainers medics.

109
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,011
Scott: Yeah, you don't need music guy.

110
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,539
Scott: You know you don't need all this stuff.

111
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:47,020
Scott: But what you do need is like what Rym said you need the trainers you need the staff you need the TV crew.

112
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,012
Scott: Especially the TV crew is even more important.

113
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,119
Scott: They brought it to bring more people.

114
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,666
Scott: Yeah, because there's.

115
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:57,139
Rym: that's the only way anyone's gonna damn booty like you got someone on the Zamboni I got all the black around gonna shovel all the ice.

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,828
Scott: The refs gotta come right.

117
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,740
Scott: every NHL ref is probably gonna go to the one of those two cities and just stay there.

118
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:13,420
Scott: Yeah, right, so they'll probably split between the two And so we'll see if this happens how it happens if anything happens, so it's interesting.

119
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,008
Rym: I was reading it.

120
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:19,706
Rym: another thing I don't have a link to in handy but it was talking about how The lack of fans doesn't matter.

121
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:23,039
Rym: because no what they don't make enough money from the like the ticket sales to matter.

122
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,746
Scott: that well Depends on the league.

123
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:25,711
Scott: it does depend on the league.

124
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:33,720
Scott: so for example baseball Makes all its fucking money on ticket sales and TV is less in most markets depending on the market, right?

125
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,597
Scott: Although makes all its money from TV and advertising makes football makes like doesn't give a shit about losing his ticket sales.

126
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:49,224
Scott: the NHL Kinda does care about losing the ticket sales And I think that's not as much as a choice or like some friends not as much as baseball does But they do.

127
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,818
Scott: it does hurt the NHL not to sell the tickets.

128
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,740
Rym: yep Like MSG charges a lot for those tickets.

129
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:56,488
Rym: They make a lot.

130
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,460
Scott: MSG is one of them.

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,693
Scott: You know there's like a few that charge insane prices and the rest charge normal price.

132
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,054
Scott: Yeah, right.

133
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,301
Rym: so I still remember when we Montreal.

134
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:11,200
Rym: it would have been cheaper for me to get a discounts flight to Detroit to see the Red Wings play the Rangers there.

135
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:15,399
Rym: Then it would have been to get two tickets to go see the Rangers at MSG?

136
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:17,854
Scott: Yeah, depending on where you sit.

137
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:25,291
Rym: Yeah, yeah See equivalent seats, but this was assuming things like we didn't have season tickets So I'd have to buy like scalper tickets.

138
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:26,880
Scott: it depends on a lot of things.

139
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:37,227
Rym: So uh it'll be interesting what happens because on one hand I really want to see hockey But on the other hand if the players don't want to do it like if the people involved don't want to do it Then I don't want them to feel like they have to.

140
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:41,689
Scott: I definitely do not want the players to play in an unsafe Dangerous way.

141
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,080
Scott: right what's the point of watching?

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,786
Scott: You know your team play.

143
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:55,206
Rym: if a a right lose and get sick They're already in enough danger of like breaking themselves just by playing the sport in the first place exactly Or even.

144
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:56,691
Scott: so it's like you lose and get sick.

145
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:57,715
Scott: That's way bad right you?

146
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:57,896
Scott: what?

147
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:58,719
Scott: why did you even go?

148
00:09:59,362 --> 00:09:59,724
Scott: Yeah, you go.

149
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,558
Scott: imagine winning and getting sick, okay?

150
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:04,492
Scott: We won the Stanley Cup, and then I died.

151
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:05,376
Scott: right.

152
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:05,899
Scott: it's like that.

153
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,963
Scott: I mean winning.

154
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:13,185
Scott: the Stanley Cup is pretty up there in terms of things that are worth it to sacrifice to achieve But not dying.

155
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,634
Scott: dying is not something that is worth doing.

156
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:17,200
Rym: yeah, it's Lord Stanley's Cup.

157
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,509
Rym: It's not wizard Stanley's magic cup right.

158
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,778
Scott: It's like lose a finger to get the Stanley Cup.

159
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:24,480
Scott: Maybe right?

160
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,946
Rym: Yeah, lose some teeth.

161
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:27,348
Scott: Yes.

162
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,737
Scott: I'll lose some teeth to get my name on the Stanley Cup.

163
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:30,360
Rym: I mean don't lose.

164
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:31,843
Rym: They're already.

165
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:35,038
Rym: they're paying teeth just to buy the lottery tickets to have a chance to get in the cup.

166
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:35,540
Scott: right.

167
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,312
Scott: It's like lose an arm is borderline dying.

168
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:38,734
Scott: No.

169
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:40,100
Scott: Yeah, not worth it.

170
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:48,115
Scott: I did see a thing a while ago that said fact if you could if my name was already on there And you said Scott we're gonna kill you or take your name off.

171
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,079
Scott: I'd say take the name off.

172
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:59,465
Rym: I saw a lot of talking about how they a bunch of US sports leagues were doing players union things where they were doing an anonymous ballot of the players Asking if what might would return.

173
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,011
Scott: that's exactly what my office did.

174
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,280
Scott: they sent out an anonymous survey to all employees.

175
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:07,336
Scott: Yeah to figure out how what we feel about doing yeah, which I think is the right way.

176
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:10,780
Rym: that way people can actually Say what they actually feel and I feel pressured.

177
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,564
Scott: Yeah I said you know what I said.

178
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:18,875
Scott: I said look the building we work in right has a little bike dock in the loading dock Right where you can hang your bike on the wall.

179
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,289
Scott: Yep And that's cool right you've been used.

180
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:30,610
Scott: I used it all last year right it was it was fine but I feel like if they let us come back to work people are gonna be using that thing like crazy.

181
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:37,771
Scott: and If there's no room on that thing Guy yeah, let me bring my bike upstairs in the office.

182
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,917
Rym: Yep, not taking the subway under any circumstances No, so that's what I said.

183
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:47,940
Rym: So the other sad and scary thing there was a 538 article and a bunch of buzz about this.

184
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:57,929
Rym: But it showed that different sports fandoms in America care more or less about the safety of the players based solely on whether or not they're a Democrat or a Republican.

185
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:04,899
Rym: and obvious and sports fandom in America is also tied very much to which side of the political spectrum you're on.

186
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,250
Rym: Fascists not news.

187
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,320
Scott: That's just common sense.

188
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:12,940
Rym: So you say that but there's a difference between saying something is common sense and having actual evidence to prove it.

189
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:20,160
Scott: The I mean I think it's been pretty well established that pretty much the two political parties in the u.s.

190
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,588
Scott: Regardless of what their stated You know ideologies are.

191
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:35,731
Scott: I mean there's the regular ones the true ideology that the only thing that you will find consistent between all of the Positions of the two parties that the bad ones are all on one side.

192
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:51,980
Scott: the democratic positions are we kind of care about other human beings and the Republican position is You believe these things if you only care about yourself Most close to you and you fuck everyone else, right?

193
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,830
Rym: Democrats are amazing ideas and bad ideas.

194
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,220
Rym: The Republicans are literally only bad ideas.

195
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:04,954
Scott: but the thing that all the ideas have in common is the Republican ideas are all ideas of someone who doesn't care about other people.

196
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:05,837
Rym: but the polling show.

197
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:14,781
Rym: Democrat ideas Like everyone who identifies Republican by and large want sports to continue even if it risks the players because they don't care about other People.

198
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:18,112
Scott: they say you other people you athletes die for my entertainment, right?

199
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,500
Scott: They only care about themselves, right?

200
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,320
Scott: It's like this gets me a penny but a thousand people die.

201
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:28,659
Scott: Okay, yeah, but and that gets me a million dollars and a random person dies hammer the button.

202
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:35,103
Rym: I just think of that comedy sketch for the person's like so this button will I think I immediately hits it just like that look like Kids.

203
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:41,940
Rym: it immediately and then he's like every time you hit that button It'll kill someone and he just starts hitting the button a few more times and he's like, does that mean I make even more money?

204
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:46,144
Rym: And the guys like wow, okay That's right.

205
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:46,707
Scott: So that's all there.

206
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:58,365
Rym: That's obvious that you know, since that's true Yeah, but they're like no one ever no one had ever done a poll trying to sort out the ideological divide in sports And the results.

207
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:01,220
Rym: it's that thing where everyone felt like they knew the answer.

208
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:05,483
Rym: but the evidence came out and the evidence said yes, you're Obviously biased.

209
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,809
Rym: worldview was in fact 100% accurate.

210
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,013
Rym: you were correct all along.

211
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:09,895
Scott: Yes.

212
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,400
Scott: I have always been correct.

213
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,584
Rym: You've always been correct.

214
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,890
Rym: I feel like you've been wrong about things.

215
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:17,855
Scott: no, no, I'm saying it this thing.

216
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,420
Rym: Well, yeah this thing obviously.

217
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:27,412
Rym: So in some other news Twitter really seems to only want to release features for reasons.

218
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:31,262
Rym: You can probably imagine that protect brands and Fascists.

219
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:35,160
Rym: so they're not banning Nazis or pedophiles or anything on Twitter.

220
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:42,260
Rym: But what they are doing is now saying that whatever you tweet You can choose to say no one's allowed to respond to this tweet.

221
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:58,918
Rym: Okay So it seems like the sole use of this is for horrible people to say horrible things without anyone dogpiling on them and for brands to be able to post ads without People just dragging the brands for their ads as usually happens.

222
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:00,900
Scott: So it's all I mean.

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,627
Scott: So the first one I can see is a positive right because you have to figure the Twitter Algorithm is looking at tweets.

224
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,811
Scott: They get lots of activity.

225
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:16,000
Scott: Yep, right and then it is You know highlighting those tweets right and those users is like important or whatever.

226
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:27,020
Scott: so if you're a horrible person you post a horrible thing, right and Now there's nobody who can quote tweet you or reply to you because it's to argue with you.

227
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:30,572
Rym: I think you can quote tweet but not reply specifically.

228
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:32,538
Scott: Oh, it depends right?

229
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,805
Rym: That's what the Features does currently.

230
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,614
Scott: I guess then you could just quote tweet and you're not gonna.

231
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:41,645
Scott: but the point is is that if you can't Write interact with that tweet.

232
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:42,930
Scott: It just doesn't get replies.

233
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,596
Scott: Yeah, it's getting less activity.

234
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,506
Scott: It's getting less notoriety It's being shared less right?

235
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:52,000
Scott: You know, I guess you're gonna have the horrible people retweet it, but the good people right?

236
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,699
Scott: I see it as a lot of problems of good people retweeting horrible people.

237
00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:01,660
Scott: shit Yeah, and that increases the numbers on the bottom of the horrible person tweet giving them greater.

238
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:09,165
Scott: You know analytics in the system and it's like don't it's up, you know, even when you're Counter-arguing a shitty person.

239
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,712
Scott: you're still amplifying their voice, right?

240
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:15,985
Scott: And uh, you know at least based on the way algorithms work I don't think that's a good strategy.

241
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:23,977
Scott: So making people forcing people away from that strategy I think is good and people can still I think you know sub tweet right.

242
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,425
Scott: the horrible tweets Yeah Which is the right way to go.

243
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,048
Rym: never get like.

244
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:34,673
Rym: if you want to call something out never link directly to the thing because at percentage of people will get tricked by the thing right you sub tweet it.

245
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:47,877
Scott: you say horrible person say, you know, You know, how many tweets do I see every day where someone you you know, they don't go at president right orange They say, you know, the orange guy said this don't you know this and this?

246
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:51,031
Scott: and this is the counter-argument I don't link retweet the original tweet.

247
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,056
Scott: They don't reply to it.

248
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,704
Scott: They don't link to it They don't like it right.

249
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,839
Scott: and that's what people will do if they can't reply to a horrible thing.

250
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:03,160
Scott: The second issue yelling at brands right when they are doing bad stuff.

251
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:08,824
Scott: I think that actually hurts the brands more than Right.

252
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,310
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think it definitely.

253
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:16,579
Rym: I definitely I've definitely seen like brands are Terrified of the replies to their tweets being people pointing out their bullshit.

254
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,384
Scott: Right, but okay.

255
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,667
Scott: So now no one's replying to you.

256
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,012
Scott: No one's retweeting you.

257
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:21,454
Scott: No one's cute.

258
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,358
Scott: You'll just be ignored.

259
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,387
Scott: exactly It's like.

260
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,531
Scott: it's like Any attention is better than no attention.

261
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:29,840
Scott: Even the negative attention is better than no attention.

262
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,588
Scott: Your whole point is your marketing right.

263
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,940
Scott: you want attention, even if it's bad, right?

264
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,440
Scott: If you make a mistake, you got turned into something good, right?

265
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,137
Scott: Trying to hide right is a either going to succeed which is not what you want.

266
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:48,588
Scott: If you're a brand successfully hide Or be Streisand effect.

267
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,029
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,053
Scott: All right, you can't.

269
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,680
Scott: there's no other way it can go for you.

270
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,165
Scott: So basically what they're?

271
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:59,478
Scott: this feature is simply adding a trap for bad people to fall into And it's optional.

272
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:03,820
Rym: Yeah, so yeah, that's that you kind of actually just got to the point.

273
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,384
Scott: I was gonna make this article if a good person uses it to avoid say harassing replies Great also seem.

274
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:11,928
Scott: that also seems good to me.

275
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:13,813
Scott: Yeah, I don't it's just.

276
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:14,014
Scott: it's.

277
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,140
Scott: as long as you know, they add optional feature.

278
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:17,713
Scott: Okay, so

279
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:34,167
Rym: yep My broader meta point was one more that Twitter tends to always add these increasingly esoteric features that may or may not have any Like may not actually do what anyone intends them to do rather than doing obvious things like banning Pedophiles or banning Nazis or banning races.

280
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:37,214
Scott: They still you know, this is nowhere near enough, but it's not.

281
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,349
Scott: this isn't necessarily bad or good It's just a thing.

282
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like, okay

283
00:18:41,460 --> 00:19:00,389
Rym: But the reason why I think it'll be okay in the end is that the first tweet I saw from one of the few Twitter accounts that has access to this when they're trying it out was Officially from the official overwatch and they tweeted saying if this tweet gets a hundred replies We will make the next character in the game.

284
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,413
Rym: Jeff Kaplan himself.

285
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,336
Scott: Oh And you can't reply can't reply to it.

286
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,277
Rym: so That alone means I'm okay with this feature because if that is how the first people have access to it use it.

287
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,896
Rym: that all is Right with the world nice way.

288
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:19,837
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

289
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:20,259
Rym: what he got?

290
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:22,364
Scott: What did I have?

291
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,231
Rym: you have not not the miracle on ice?

292
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:25,195
Scott: No, no.

293
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,400
Scott: No, this is the sudoku miracle.

294
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:34,472
Scott: So sudoku is not a great puzzle, but a listener In our forum posted this in the thing of the day thread.

295
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:36,900

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:56,680
Scott: It's a sudoku puzzle by a person named Mitchell Lee and it is on a YouTube channel called the Cracking the cryptic cracking the cryptic which is a YouTube channel about solving puzzles a lot of sudoku's.

300
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:03,420
Scott: And normally in a sudoku right you have a you know, it's it's nine by nine, right?

301
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,275
Scott: It's a big 81 square box separated into nine.

302
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:17,396
Scott: nine square boxes Right and in each of the boxes are the digits one through nine and in each full column and full row are the digits one through nine.

303
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:26,311
Scott: So you can't have two twos in the same vertical column two twos in the same horizontal column or two twos in the same box Because that would you know, and they would not be one through nine.

304
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:44,380
Scott: Yeah, and the way most sudoku's work is You get this empty box and they start you off with a few numbers Legally placed revealed numbers and it's up to you to use logic in the process of elimination To figure out where all the remaining numbers are and to fit to legally fill in the rest of the box because they're only.

305
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:49,540
Scott: There will be at least one legal way to fill in the rest of the boxes given those starting numbers.

306
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,045
Rym: Yep, and it's cross.

307
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,774
Rym: It's not necessarily the greatest puzzle, but it's very meditative.

308
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,380
Rym: A lot of people use it as a calming thing.

309
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:56,808
Rym: It's just a chill activity.

310
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,740
Scott: Yeah, it's just a chill activity.

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,440
Scott: You could you know, you just use presentation to figure out the puzzle.

312
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:01,661
Scott: There's.

313
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:11,860
Scott: uh, it's similar to the ones you see in in puzzle books that are like, you know Joe came before Jill, but Jill has green hair and you know, it's like a logic puzzle.

314
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:16,140
Rym: Yeah, but the answer to that one is easy because before all came the darkness, right?

315
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,999
Scott: So usually when you have a sudoku even a really hard one like a big one or something like that, right?

316
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,620
Scott: They give you quite a few starting numbers, right?

317
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:30,513
Scott: They can't just give you like, you know a couple because then there won't be enough right to solve Or there'll be too many possible solutions.

318
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:31,720
Scott: It'll be boring, right?

319
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:39,339
Scott: So here this sudoku has a Only two starting things is a one and a two and that's it.

320
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:40,725
Scott: And it's like this.

321
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,167
Scott: guy's like.

322
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:44,160
Scott: he thinks that this guy is an expert puzzle solving guy.

323
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,792
Scott: He was a YouTube channel about puzzle solving right with 600,000 views and 200,000 subscribers.

324
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:52,144
Scott: He's like this.

325
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,489
Scott: he starts off this video.

326
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,755
Scott: being like this is some bullshit.

327
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:55,960
Scott: This is just a practical joke.

328
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,990
Scott: I'm gonna call them up and give him an earful.

329
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,880
Scott: try to fool me with this bullshit, right?

330
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:04,100
Scott: He's like this is either like they're pulling my chain or this is a work of genius.

331
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:07,369
Scott: Of course, it wouldn't be thing of the day if it wasn't the latter.

332
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:10,517
Scott: So there's some additional rules on this sudoku.

333
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,400
Scott: Is that?

334
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:19,060
Scott: No number can be a knight's move like a chess From an identical number, right?

335
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:30,275
Scott: Also, no number can be a king's move from An identical number which is orthogonally and diagonally adjacent.

336
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:40,300
Scott: and no Number can be orthogonally adjacent to a number that is one away from it, right?

337
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,033
Rym: So that last one is what fucked me up.

338
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:46,830
Scott: that last one A one cannot be directly adjacent to a two.

339
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,898
Scott: a two cannot be directly adjacent to three or four.

340
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:50,560
Scott: Yeah, right.

341
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,714
Scott: So those that crazy combination of things.

342
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,120
Scott: you're thinking this is impossible.

343
00:22:56,804 --> 00:23:04,077
Scott: But it just so happens that with all of those restrictions Right in place and those starting numbers one and two, right?

344
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:18,360
Scott: There's so many restrictions that actually this very few places you can actually put Numbers and in this video you can see how he solves the puzzle one through nine Which is obviously how you would do it and discovers that it wasn't a practical joke, and it's just a genius.

345
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,144
Scott: Sudoku too bad.

346
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:21,730
Scott: They're not all Sudoku's.

347
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,613
Scott: They're as good as that one.

348
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,520
Scott: Otherwise, you'd you know have fun doing them all day.

349
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,964
Rym: Yep, I love.

350
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,736
Rym: one of the YouTube comments right at the top is this is simply not humanly possible.

351
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,100
Rym: beats puzzle to death.

352
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,163
Scott: Yeah hands down.

353
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,128
Scott: This is the best Sudoku I've ever seen.

354
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:36,372
Scott: absolutely unbelievable.

355
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:39,340
Rym: Like this is basically the AGDQ of Sudoku.

356
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,963
Scott: Yes Yeah, basically.

357
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,774
Scott: Yeah, they should have an AGDQ where people solve puzzles.

358
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:46,199
Scott: That'd be pretty good at that kind of event.

359
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:47,616
Rym: Yeah, I would watch it.

360
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:55,180
Scott: Yeah Do some Nintendo pie-crossy like speedruns, you know, we always criticize games a lot.

361
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,872
Scott: You know ortho games that are like actually puzzles, right?

362
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,600
Scott: That's not to say that puzzles are bad.

363
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,334
Scott: It's just like hey you were supposed to be a game.

364
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,100
Scott: Why are you a puzzle?

365
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,149
Rym: Yeah, it's like if I order an omelet and I get a hamburger like not that I don't like hamburgers But that is not what I wanted right now, right?

366
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:10,500
Scott: We're talking about games here, but you know puzzles are a thing.

367
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,624
Scott: They're good, right?

368
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,073
Scott: I think you know, you gotta pay attention to the puzzle world.

369
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:18,787
Scott: The puzzle world is a cool nerdy world Very adjacent to the math and game worlds.

370
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:23,220
Rym: So recently I bumped into this thing that was called Star Trek intakes.

371
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,504
Scott: So, okay.

372
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:36,279
Rym: These are amazing because I've never seen I don't know if anyone's ever done this before and I want to see it done In non Star Trek things now, so huh what this is?

373
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,466
Rym: You know the concept of an outtake.

374
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:45,696
Rym: right like the actor flubbed the line like it's one of the takes before they finished the shot Like in a movie like the blooper.

375
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:46,460
Scott: Oh that kind of right.

376
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,440
Scott: So yeah, they cut it out of the movie because the guy messed up and you have to redo it.

377
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,991
Scott: but then you get you know, it's really fun.

378
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:54,626
Scott: you watch outtakes from Super super old movies.

379
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:56,192
Rym: Yeah, and they talk like normal people.

380
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:58,521
Scott: That's that's really the best They're like.

381
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:01,149
Rym: I do declare that my oh fuck me like.

382
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,537
Rym: they just sound like a normal person like from today.

383
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:04,159
Rym: It's exactly.

384
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,800
Rym: But so what the what Ryan's edits this YouTube channel has done is I don't know they invented this concept.

385
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,759
Rym: I do I cannot find an example of this.

386
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:22,589
Rym: They made an intake where instead of just having a blooper reel of all the outtakes which are great and funny on their own They take a scene from Star Trek.

387
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,427
Rym: That is normal like the final version that was published on TV But part of that scene.

388
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:36,074
Rym: they replaced the official version with one of the outtakes Not at the end but in the middle.

389
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,040
Rym: so you get a scene.

390
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:46,660
Scott: We're like so you're watching a full Star Trek episode and then the actor actually flubs the line And breaks the third wall in the episode that you're watching but they never break the fourth wall.

391
00:25:46,740 --> 00:26:10,709
Rym: What they do instead is they just continue the scene and it actually makes it weirdly more human and real like it's a weird experience to watch these cuz like Picard will be giving this epic speech and he kind of flubs it and like loses his place and then someone reminds him like oh And then he continues and then they continue the scene like normal and it actually makes the dialogue a lot more natural Like how normal people talk in the real world.

392
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,339
Scott: yeah, I mean that's part of why I like.

393
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,900
Scott: You know I think I first encountered you know this style.

394
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,400
Scott: I think I've mentioned this before on like Korean variety shows, but I'm seeing it.

395
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:30,720
Scott: I'm seeing it in other places especially on YouTube right like my new you know everyone's favorite thing now Which has been my favorite thing for like maybe a year, so the Bon Appetit YouTube channel.

396
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,429
Scott: Yeah, and it's all about you know.

397
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:33,951
Scott: It's like.

398
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:41,514
Scott: There's not hiding that they're on TV right it's like yeah, so recording video, but it's like.

399
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,400
Scott: the people behind the camera are people.

400
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,366
Scott: They're not invisible right you're not.

401
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:47,352
Scott: not everything is scripted.

402
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,564
Scott: You know and in perfect and beautiful right It's showing you.

403
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:52,274
Scott: you know sort of what like.

404
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:52,737
Scott: it's.

405
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:58,860
Scott: it's not Reality TV in the sense that we're spying and showing you every detail of every of someone's life.

406
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,713
Scott: Right with the hidden cameras and all that kind of shit like 24/7 Truman show.

407
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,992
Scott: But it's also not reality.

408
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:06,435
Scott: you know.

409
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:14,220
Scott: reality TV I think also got blurred a lot with competition game shows in especially in the US right, but it's actually more reality.

410
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,503
Scott: It's like okay this person's here making this TV show right, but we're not hiding the reality that We're.

411
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,293
Scott: what you're watching is the video of this person making the TV show.

412
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:28,009
Scott: you're not watching a produced TV show like from the 90s.

413
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:30,500
Scott: yeah right or earlier right you're watching.

414
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:33,650
Scott: Just cameras are on and a person is making a show.

415
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,960
Rym: yep, so watch these cuz they're just there.

416
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:38,675
Rym: I've never seen someone do something like this.

417
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:42,400
Rym: I feel like This could be a YouTube thing.

418
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:54,700
Scott: I think this could be applied to a lot of movie media and be interesting right, but I think it's Star Trek in particular Especially the long-running TV series is yeah, right happen to have lots and lots of outtake footage available.

419
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,149
Scott: Right something like a Star Wars.

420
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,434
Scott: There's only so much.

421
00:27:58,454 --> 00:28:00,080
Rym: yep, cuz they don't give us all of it.

422
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,719
Rym: They put like and there's only a bit of it.

423
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,884
Scott: There's only a few movies.

424
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:07,379
Scott: you have to find a long-running live-action TV show because there's no outtakes of an animation.

425
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:07,580
Rym: yep.

426
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,636
Scott: And the other key I did is voice acted outtakes of an animation right like Thundercats famous outtakes.

427
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:15,154
Scott: Yep, not Semiflange.

428
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:24,565
Scott: Right you need to access to live-action TV shows that have tons and tons of content And I think even for something like a soap opera It's like.

429
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:25,736
Scott: I don't think it's gonna work.

430
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,124
Scott: eat that Because it also.

431
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:31,280
Rym: it can't be outtakes that like break the fourth wall or just like really like look at the stunt fails.

432
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:31,904
Rym: They have to be.

433
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:32,710
Rym: outtakes were like.

434
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,984
Rym: it's plausible But just weird.

435
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,188
Rym: what happens like the other?

436
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:36,931
Rym: because they because they.

437
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:45,678
Rym: it's like that normal normal the outtake Then it cuts to the character Reacting like everything was normal, and that's the moment of the humor.

438
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:48,789
Scott: right I think it's only gonna work if you do it to.

439
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,696
Scott: you know Star Trek.

440
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:59,174
Scott: I think is the one example That's kind of like different in a way, right I think it's mostly gonna work best if you somehow got the archives of like a family matters.

441
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:09,620
Scott: Oh, yeah a Seinfeld Full house Coach or any of those white people sitcom shows yeah.

442
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:13,520
Rym: But what I appreciate about this channel too is all these clips like where they put these together.

443
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,274
Rym: They're only like a minute long like they do their setup.

444
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:17,480
Rym: They do the joke and they're done.

445
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:18,366

00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:55,508
Scott: calm.

Scott: yeah There's actually a GeekNights' Facebook page.

466
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:09,716
Scott: That is I guess they think the automatic posting to it stopped working.

467
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:11,059
Scott: Maybe I'll fix it.

468
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:19,316
Scott: It's the only reason I haven't deleted my Facebook is because I Go, and I check that page occasionally and apparently there are people there.

469
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:29,366
Rym: Yeah, so Weirdly like you know one thing that Comes up a lot that I find people actually do comment on our YouTube videos And they're usually good comments to like.

470
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:30,129
Rym: weirdly right.

471
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,260
Scott: so we have a Rym has a YouTube channel where most of our stuff is.

472
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,577
Scott: But I also have a YouTube channel where some of our stuff is yeah, and also personal stuff.

473
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:44,399
Scott: on both of those We have a discord that is like an unofficial official discord you can come chat in.

474
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,112
Scott: I'm pretty sure the IRC died a long time ago.

475
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,559
Scott: I checked on it recently is dead.

476
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:51,408
Scott: What else do we have?

477
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,577
Scott: those that those are the biggies.

Scott: We're calm like we read them all and as GeekNights' newsletter.

Scott: You can subscribe to yep.

482
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,984
Rym: The newsletter is a plus.

Rym: We got the patreon where there's extra bonus stuff in there all sorts of places.

484
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,838
Scott: You can find our biz and you can find GeekNights the podcast on just about every podcast platform.

485
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,808
Scott: That's out there Spotify iTunes Fucking everything in case whatever.

486
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:20,933
Scott: you're listening to it on now.

487
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,260
Scott: You don't like and you want to switch up.

488
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:33,900
Scott: I guess if you're listening to this you've successfully found GeekNights, so I guess You found it on some platform, but if there's some other podcast platform you prefer and for some reason GeekNights is unlistenable there.

489
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:37,035
Scott: Let us know via any of the previous methods.

490
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,365
Rym: yep Alright, so we'll get right into it.

491
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:51,416
Rym: We couldn't come up with an idea for this show that didn't require a lot of effort and We thought about bailing, but this I feel you have Thursday show ideas, which is pretty much anything.

492
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:57,273
Scott: That's not technology Science gaming or animation or art or comics related.

493
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:58,095
Scott: yep.

494
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,983
Scott: send them to any of the things I just mentioned in the minute moment Yeah,

495
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:06,825
Rym: and we will probably do a show on it Or we'll link you to where we already did a show on it And that's why we're having so much trouble right now

496
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,750
Scott: or reasons why we won't do a show on it.

497
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:22,064
Rym: yep, but our vague idea here is We're gonna try to just go through all the stuff We've bought recently like over some arbitrary period of time and review those things no matter what they are Right.

498
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:26,469
Scott: I had this idea recently because someone brought up QVC Which is the if I don't know how many ever.

499
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,640
Scott: everyone knows about that the old people tricking.

500
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,059
Rym: It's basically a TV network that tricks old people into giving them their credit card number.

501
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:34,700
Scott: Yeah, it's it's all done.

502
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,854
Scott: They mail them garbage before there was an internet to buy things on.

503
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,240
Scott: I think it still exists QVC.

504
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:40,562
Scott: But yeah You know you would.

505
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:46,660
Scott: you go on TV, and you watch this TV channel and people come on and demonstrate products in like an infomercial style.

506
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:56,340
Scott: But it's like a constant infomercial that keeps changing products constantly And you know what they actually do and the products aren't necessarily bad and the prices aren't necessarily bad either.

507
00:32:56,822 --> 00:33:07,306
Scott: It's just this marketing method where you know you you sit at home You have nothing to do you turn on this channel, and you open your wallet whereas if that channel wasn't there You wouldn't have spent that time buying.

508
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:13,108
Rym: yep, but unlike say advertising which I despise I'm not that like.

509
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:16,080
Rym: I'm okay with the QVC kind of model because this is more.

510
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:20,463
Rym: It's more like I want to see ads to see if there's anything in there I want to buy.

511
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:23,920
Rym: it's like the old world equivalent of going to Amazon and just poking around.

512
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,160
Scott: Anyway, I thought it would just be kind of funny.

513
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:39,680
Scott: We had an idea the other day because something that the QVCs have sort of been famous for there's a lot of outtakes you can You can get from them when they're selling certain products Is that the people selling the products are not particularly that knowledgeable about the products especially?

514
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,387
Scott: When those products are in the nerdy realm right.

515
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:47,800
Scott: so it's like when they're selling a jewelry or something or or something like that.

516
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,880
Scott: It's like usually the people are pretty knowledgeable and can say things about it because they sell a lot of that on those networks.

517
00:33:53,442 --> 00:34:01,291
Scott: but you know the in this in the 90s like they would sell computers and stuff on there like desktops and The people selling them would not necessarily be computer experts.

518
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:04,364
Scott: It would say dumb shit, so I was like hey How would it be?

519
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:07,660
Scott: it would just be fun and cute right even if it wasn't successful?

520
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:21,606
Scott: It could just be cute entertaining and fun to have say a twitch stream Right or any kind of stream on the internet where nerds who knew about the products were selling Right nerdy products.

521
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:26,219
Scott: they could not only sell them well right and and be honest.

522
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,516
Scott: But they would also be able to like respond to the chat because it's 2020 so people ask questions or whatever.

523
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,574
Scott: right like it would Be kind of a cool.

524
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Rym: Yeah, like imagine me and Scott just got in a studio had a pile of board games and just QVC'd them for four hours.

525
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:43,246
Scott: Right that could be.

526
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:43,929
Scott: it could be a thing.

527
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,717
Scott: Yeah, you know even if it doesn't make any money.

528
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:46,179
Scott: It could be fun.

529
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,271
Scott: So it'd be fun to make even if no one watches.

530
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:52,685
Scott: so since I had that idea And we didn't have a Thursday show idea.

531
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,190
Scott: I was like hey even though.

532
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,016
Scott: We're not streaming or anything all right.

533
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:57,000
Scott: We're just podcasting.

534
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,168
Scott: Let's just grab random products.

535
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:01,016
Scott: We have around that no one's sponsored.

536
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,441
Scott: We don't have any fucking sponsors Right?

537
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:08,295
Scott: just shit that we bought recently ish or you know they haven't talked about on the show.

538
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,383
Scott: that wouldn't be stuff that we wouldn't Review right?

539
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:11,207
Scott: so a video game.

540
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:12,714
Scott: I'd review on a Tuesday.

541
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,536
Rym: I wouldn't talk about it now But I don't review like the sunscreen brand.

542
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:24,145
Scott: I tried Exactly, so let's just look around see what shit we got And just discuss it.

543
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,960
Scott: and that's it and you know until we run out of time all right.

544
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,888
Scott: Okay, you pick pick something go first.

545
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,940
Rym: I'm just gonna go in reverse chronological order in my Amazon purchases.

546
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,625
Scott: Okay, I just I got it.

547
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,810
Scott: I got a random assortment.

548
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:36,814
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna skip.

549
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,220
Rym: obvious like I'm not gonna skip.

550
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:42,025
Rym: I bought some baking soda on Amazon because it's hard.

551
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,093
Scott: I get a review baking so not gonna be baking soda.

552
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:44,916
Rym: It's a chemical.

553
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:45,800
Rym: it just works.

554
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,951
Scott: It wasn't things that make sense to review right.

555
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,400
Rym: I mean it could have been like I bought this baking soda.

556
00:35:51,602 --> 00:35:53,280
Rym: It was actually a different chemical.

557
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:56,624
Rym: Sure Or fuck baking.

558
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:58,330
Scott: it wasn't sodium bicarbonate.

559
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,631
Scott: Oh, no.

560
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:00,056
Rym: Yeah, I prefer cream of tartar.

561
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,320
Rym: I don't eat baking so anyway.

562
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:07,900
Rym: So uh I did buy some Coppertone sport SPF sunscreen because I was out of sunscreen.

563
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:14,128
Rym: I've tried a lot of different brands of sunscreen over the years like even you with your Neutrogena Which honestly it's not that good.

564
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,460
Scott: and the Neutrogena one I liked.

565
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:20,273
Rym: I like it unless I sweat at all because it's not actually sport.

566
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:23,986
Rym: even though it says like it's good for your face it Immediately melts into my eyes no matter what.

567
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:27,340
Scott: the thing I liked about the Neutrogena one is that it was dry touch.

568
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,923
Scott: It was way way less greasy than the other Sunscreens and that was why I liked it and used it for so long, but actually I have changed Sunscreens as well.

569
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:44,751
Rym: yep, so I have tried actually over the years many many brands of sunscreen, and I've settled Recently and I bought this now on just the basic Coppertone sport.

570
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:46,014
Rym: It's the best sunscreen.

571
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:46,776
Rym: I've ever used.

572
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:48,280
Scott: Oh United States.

573
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:56,199
Rym: Because the best sunscreen I've ever used is the Australian government sunscreen that I've got in Australia And I brought as much home as I could the last time I was there.

574
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,831
Scott: Which is the sunscreen that I got?

575
00:36:58,871 --> 00:36:59,133
Scott: I'm not.

576
00:36:59,254 --> 00:36:59,475
Scott: I got.

577
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:01,546
Scott: if I got to find it I think I bought it at the.

578
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:02,892
Scott: I'm not seeing so.

579
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:07,047
Rym: Coppertone sport sunscreen SPF 30 and SPF 50.

580
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,793
Rym: I use the 30 most of the time.

581
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:21,594
Rym: the only time I use the 50 is if I go to the beach, and I'm gonna lay there all day or If I already got a sunburn I'm gonna use the 50 on the places I have the sunburn instead of the 30, but I keep both that I generally use the 30.

582
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:31,749
Scott: I can't recommend my sunscreen brand because I don't see it online, and I'd have to get up and Get up and like go to the bathroom, and I'm tired.

583
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:34,319
Scott: I'm physically cabled into the computer.

584
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:34,660
Rym: That's fine.

585
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,651
Rym: I reviewed my Coppertone sport sunscreen.

586
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,233
Rym: It was fine.

587
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:38,856
Scott: Oh, that's all.

588
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:39,920
Scott: that's all you have to say about it.

589
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,345
Rym: Yeah, it's great It just works.

590
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:46,940
Rym: the cool part is I get it all over my face And it does not melt into my eyes at all even after like four hours of biking.

591
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:49,227
Scott: That is a very important feature.

592
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,580
Rym: most sunscreens fail at that even the like super stick.

593
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,729
Rym: I am good for sports sunscreen now.

594
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,220
Rym: They're lying just a palace full of lies.

595
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:02,140
Scott: Alright, I can't find the sunscreen that I bought on the internet, so I guess I can't discuss it.

596
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,680
Scott: So we'll just move on what you got you.

597
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,350
Scott: I want to talk about an electronic device that I have purchased recently.

598
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,713
Scott: ish right.

599
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:13,910
Scott: so what I wanted to do Was you know I pretty much have like.

600
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:21,080
Scott: I have no need for additional Speakers or sound systems right I've got like a 5.1 sound system in the living room.

601
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,147
Scott: I got bookshelf speakers in the office.

602
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:24,611
Scott: You know I got iPad.

603
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:25,434
Scott: I got an iPhone.

604
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:28,645
Scott: those actually have amazing speakers in them Right they don't need it.

605
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,958
Scott: They don't need any help right or anything like that.

606
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:36,350
Rym: I mean I even got that Sonos and gave me just hanging out right.

607
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:44,459
Scott: I got tons of You know headphones right I don't need any additional headphones anywhere or anything like that right.

608
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,449
Scott: But what I did get recently.

609
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:48,233
Scott: Where is it?

610
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:49,900
Scott: I gotta get the exact right?

611
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,420
Rym: I love we've been doing the show long enough.

612
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,913
Rym: I can hear the tone of voice that you do because I have a similar tone of voice of.

613
00:38:55,335 --> 00:39:00,120
Rym: I am actually killing time while I find a thing or remember what to say because we both do a lot in panels.

614
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:11,779
Scott: Correct all right, so the thing that I got that the one place right that I did not have any audio system Right was the shower, right?

615
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,478
Scott: I Was always taking a quiet shower right which is fine.

616
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,760
Scott: sometimes I still take a quiet shower right, but there's other times not so much lately.

617
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:31,759
Scott: But you know when I was working I would listen to some podcast in the shower because I lost a lot of my podcast Listening time when I would bike to work because I don't listen while I'm biking right we're subway times.

618
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:36,560
Scott: I would do a lot of listening to podcasts, but you know biking times no.

619
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:41,060
Scott: So it's like okay if I'm biking to work at least I can listen to some podcast in the shower before I go to work.

620
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:48,940
Scott: So I went looking for a waterproof Bluetooth speaker so I could have my phone outside the shower and the speaker in the shower.

621
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:49,582
Scott: You know it?

622
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,450
Scott: start the podcast get in the shower.

623
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:54,040
Scott: what podcast is so long that I'm gonna.

624
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:56,547
Scott: It's good for so short that.

625
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,834
Rym: well our podcast is really compelling.

626
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,020
Rym: you just stay in the shower for like 45 minutes.

627
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:02,539
Scott: Yeah, that hasn't happened.

628
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:08,068
Scott: So you know I kind of wanted a Bluetooth speaker before But it's like I just didn't.

629
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:09,033
Scott: I never bought one cuz.

630
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,079
Scott: like when would I use it?

631
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:10,280
Rym: yeah?

632
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,698
Rym: Yeah, the only place I could think of it is maybe if we went to the beach a lot more often than we do like.

633
00:40:16,262 --> 00:40:25,562
Rym: It seems Prefer beach sound just quiet sound Exactly, I want to have a little music party like if I'm there for a week Right.

634
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:30,349
Scott: it just always seemed like a useful thing to have but when I thought about it It's like when would I actually use it?

635
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,663
Scott: I would probably end up carrying it everywhere I never use.

636
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:36,422
Rym: you know where we would have used it when we were at RIT instead of that boombox Right.

637
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:46,260
Scott: so the times that I end up you know these days like all the times where I would have used Bluetooth speaker I end up just Opening the iPad and using the speakers built into the iPad.

638
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:53,604
Scott: I don't really need a separate Bluetooth speaker yep, so I went, but I wanted the shower speaker, so I said aha Let's see what they got.

639
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,248
Scott: so I found this thing.

640
00:40:55,288 --> 00:41:00,200
Scott: It's the ultimate ears wonder boom - it's like a little pod guy right.

641
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:05,568
Scott: It's just a big plus/minus on the front of it And it's a waterproof Bluetooth speaker.

642
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:11,447
Scott: It's been in the shower for like all year basically And it works like it was new.

643
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,811
Scott: I have only had.

644
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:18,260
Scott: I actually haven't had to recharge it but I have recharged it one time just because.

645
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:27,620
Scott: So yeah in a whole year of using it for showers I've had to recharge it one time right to keep its internal lithium-ion battery up to power.

646
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,550
Scott: It connects perfectly.

647
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,930
Scott: Bluetooth wise it's actually maybe the best Bluetooth audio connecting device I've ever had.

648
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,214
Scott: Wow like I turn my phone.

649
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:37,678
Scott: I turn it on it's connected.

650
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:39,244
Scott: I turn it off It's disconnected.

651
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:43,400
Scott: if I walk away with my phone and leave it on it figures it out and turns itself off.

652
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:49,154
Scott: The buttons on it for volume up volume down pop play/pause work perfectly.

653
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,060
Scott: it sounds great in the shower.

654
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,680
Scott: It makes surprisingly more bass than you would imagine.

655
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:59,659
Scott: It has a feature where supposedly you could get more than one of them to get stereo sound.

656
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,748
Rym: That's pretty common with those kinds of things.

657
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:04,560
Rym: the Sonos I got will do the same thing if I get two of them.

658
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,268
Scott: Yeah, I have not tried it.

659
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,595
Scott: I haven't bought a second one.

660
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:08,640
Scott: I have no reason to buy a set.

661
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,206
Rym: Yeah, you don't really.

662
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:10,400
Rym: I mean stereo in the shower.

663
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,089
Rym: You're already compromising a lot on the audio quality.

664
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,337
Scott: It seems pretty stupid to have two in the strike.

665
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:15,959
Scott: one is enough.

666
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:22,033
Scott: So yeah, if you are looking for a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for the beach.

667
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,356
Scott: That's portable right.

668
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,660
Scott: there's a long-lasting battery.

669
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,424
Scott: You know maybe it'll.

670
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:27,206
Scott: it could just be.

671
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:28,610
Scott: you're also Bluetooth speaker.

672
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:34,723
Scott: if you ever have non shower uses for one I I Recommend this one.

673
00:42:34,783 --> 00:42:37,213
Scott: the ultimate ears wonder boom post a link whatever.

674
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:38,497
Rym: post a link to me in the discord.

675
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,440
Rym: one so I can link To it for the show and two because I kind of need one.

676
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:43,103
Scott: You can anyone?

677
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:43,927
Scott: this is the shower.

678
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,840
Scott: the shower it comes in it's 80 bucks, and it comes in five colors.

679
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,499
Rym: Yeah, just post a link there cuz I'm gonna link to all the things I talk about too.

680
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:52,453
Scott: Why why now send every time I talk about a thing?

681
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:53,860
Scott: I'll send you a link to the room.

682
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,839
Rym: Yeah, so I then cuz I actually also bought some speakers recently, but I did something very different.

683
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,591
Rym: I And for the longest time.

684
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:13,900
Rym: I had that giant mixer for gig nights And I had plugged into the like control room out of that mixer a bunch of adapters And then the same shitty computer speakers that I brought with me to RIT because I was lazy.

685
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:15,648
Rym: They didn't work that well.

686
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:16,270
Rym: They finally died.

687
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,440
Rym: I got rid of them, and then I upgraded all my equipment.

688
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:20,730
Rym: I needed real speakers.

689
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:22,860
Rym: I have real professional equipment in this room.

690
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:29,420
Rym: I needed real studio monitor speakers the kind that take a balanced input from a professional audio device.

691
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,194
Rym: These are not like normal speakers that I couldn't use.

692
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,240
Rym: the normal kind of speaker.

693
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:40,779
Rym: You'd like plug into your phone or plug into like your hi-fi system Because I don't have like speaker wire out on this thing.

694
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:43,917
Rym: And I've been a fan of PreSonus their tech their kit.

695
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,571
Rym: like there It seemed like they're really much ahead of the game on modern audio tech.

696
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:55,200
Rym: so I did the research and I bought PreSonus e4.5 near field studio monitor speakers.

697
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:57,068
Scott: Okay, they are.

698
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,472
Scott: were they?

699
00:43:57,855 --> 00:44:04,237
Rym: they were 200 bucks total for the pair which was the right call because there is a step up from these.

700
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:14,996
Rym: that are individual speakers that are way more powerful and way better in every way and as much as I Wanted them because I'm a nerd and I wanted the much better speakers.

701
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:15,840
Rym: I was not stupid.

702
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:18,999
Rym: I did not need more than 50 watts of output in this tiny room.

703
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:21,992
Rym: So I buy smartly bought these smaller ones.

704
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:24,020
Rym: Holy shit are these things amazing?

705
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,471
Rym: They are crazy crazy high quality speakers.

706
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:28,876
Rym: They work automatically.

707
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:40,099
Rym: They do have Unbalanced input so I could plug consumer level stuff into the back of them in addition to my pro stuff and Like I cannot stress enough how?

708
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,065
Rym: Perfect these speakers are.

709
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:51,620
Rym: they even have configuration options depending on how close to the wall They are very or how close to the corner of the room they are so that they will give a flat frequency response.

710
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,740
Rym: They're not the normal kind of speaker you'd use like in your living room.

711
00:44:55,081 --> 00:45:01,340
Rym: They're specifically designed to be arranged such that the sound that comes out of them is completely neutral and uncolored.

712
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,790
Rym: You use these to like master audio.

713
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,239
Rym: You don't use them to listen to a song you like.

714
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:10,635
Rym: so After buying them like they're worth every penny.

715
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:23,877
Rym: if you need Real like good studio monitor speakers, and you don't need something that's like crazy gigantic for like a giant studio This is probably the best value of dollar per quality you could possibly get.

716
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:24,058
Rym: like.

717
00:45:24,098 --> 00:45:25,002
Rym: I can't write But these are.

718
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:27,091
Scott: but these are good for if you're doing audio work.

719
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:29,260
Scott: They're not for I want to enjoy music in my house.

720
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:29,964
Rym: Yes, you could.

721
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:32,499
Rym: you would not want to plug these into like your TV.

722
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:35,636
Rym: You would not be happy with them if you plug them into your TV.

723
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:40,039
Rym: a cheap Oh soundbar would probably do a better job than these plugged into your TV.

724
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:43,459
Rym: But if you make a podcast Yes, exactly.

725
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,512
Scott: but the You're basically using them instead of headphones when possible.

726
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:52,600
Rym: audio production, but the reason they're so good Is that all the other monitor speakers?

727
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,096
Rym: I've seen from other pro companies were kind of hard and fiddly to use or like like.

728
00:45:57,136 --> 00:45:58,180
Rym: the UX was not great.

729
00:45:58,461 --> 00:46:00,146
Rym: Physical objects have a user experience.

730
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,895
Rym: these have all these little minor niceties like.

731
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:04,400
Rym: there's a headphone jack in the front.

732
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,609
Rym: That seems like a good idea.

733
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:07,894
Rym: a lot of the ones I saw didn't have that.

734
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:10,004
Rym: they expect you to plug your headphones into a Headphone bus.

735
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:11,311
Rym: I don't have a headphone bus.

736
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,940
Rym: I want to plug these headphones right up in there.

737
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:14,729
Rym: They've got a line in on the front.

738
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:16,860
Rym: pros don't often need that but you know what?

739
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,709
Rym: That's super handy to have like.

740
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:19,373
Rym: I really like that.

741
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:20,499
Rym: There's that line in on the front.

742
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,284
Scott: Mmm, okay.

743
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:23,067
Scott: Seems good.

744
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:23,408
Scott: Yeah.

745
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,031
Scott: All right.

746
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,940
Scott: The next thing I want to review is not an Amazon.

747
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,367
Scott: You everybody knows the local businesses.

748
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:35,046
Scott: Some of them are actually doing better and some are doing worse in these times right of trouble Troubled times.

749
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,960
Scott: Yeah, so one such business, especially in New York City.

750
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:41,554
Scott: Usually most of the businesses are doing worse because they're getting no foot traffic.

751
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:43,060
Scott: you they're used to tons of foot traffic.

752
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:44,931
Scott: They're tourist attractions.

753
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:45,735
Scott: There's no tourists.

754
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:54,900
Scott: Yeah, right and There are neighborhoods where the people are not going outside and such and such and their rents are high high high very high rents.

755
00:46:55,842 --> 00:47:02,800
Scott: So one such place that is a somewhat troubled is a place that even New Yorkers love which is called economy candy.

756
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,920
Scott: It's a candy store as you would imagine.

757
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:06,580
Scott: People like to buy there.

758
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,459
Scott: I see a lot of people wearing like economy candy shirts like is like they just it's one of the.

759
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:14,713
Scott: you know It's like a diner and they're selling shirts with like the diners logo on it and it's like.

760
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:23,840
Scott: I'm not gonna advertise your friggin diner right, but sometimes the business is You know a business that you actually like so much that is is itself a brand.

761
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,819
Rym: I mean I had that sure t-shirt that I wore until it wore out.

762
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:31,454
Scott: Well, I mean how many people wore Hard Rock Cafe shirts for how long?

763
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:33,040
Scott: yeah stuff like that.

764
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,839
Scott: So economy candy is that kind of place?

765
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:36,735
Scott: Except actually good.

766
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:42,959
Scott: So what they are selling is these candy care packs right now or their new thing?

767
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,724
Scott: Relatively new right?

768
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:49,540
Scott: So the way it works is you pay some money and they send you a fucking box full of candy in the mail.

769
00:47:50,463 --> 00:47:54,799
Scott: So he purchased we purchased a candy care combo pack for 50 bucks.

770
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:58,738
Scott: Send a loved one or yourself a candy care, right?

771
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:00,561
Scott: Right?

772
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:03,293
Scott: an assortment of candies chocolates dried fruits and nuts.

773
00:48:03,374 --> 00:48:04,720
Scott: Each care package will be unique.

774
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:05,825
Scott: so I guess they just they.

775
00:48:05,845 --> 00:48:14,586
Scott: basically when the box arrived it looked like someone had Grabbed random shit and thrown it in a box From the candy supply.

776
00:48:14,988 --> 00:48:21,007
Scott: there were small mini candies And a wide variety of them too, right?

777
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:22,673
Scott: So like there was like a tiny Butterfinger.

778
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:25,302
Scott: All right, whatever it was like a tiny There's.

779
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,676
Scott: a bunch of someone grabbed a handful of yuzu gummies in there.

780
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:32,520
Scott: It's like, oh great You know, it's like, you know, there was a full-size Milky Way.

781
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:35,448
Scott: There was also like a full-size.

782
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:36,311
Scott: was it called Halva?

783
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:37,013
Scott: whatever it is.

784
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,096
Scott: Is that the name of it?

785
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:39,200
Scott: You know that stuff?

786
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,115
Scott: I know that stuff Halva, right?

787
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:46,360
Scott: Yeah There was a bat a bag of nuts assorted nuts.

788
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:49,878
Scott: There was a bag of assorted dried fruits because that's the one we chose, right?

789
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:59,199
Scott: But yeah, it was just like someone filled like a. basically it looks like I think it was a UPS like You and that UPS USPS flat rate.

790
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:06,180
Rym: Here's a flat rate box filled with assorted candy, right?

791
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,820
Scott: They just fucking filled it with candy and we got it in the mail.

792
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,957
Scott: We opened it and now we have enough candy to last us until Halloween, right?

793
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,088
Scott: So You're gonna get some candies in there.

794
00:49:16,128 --> 00:49:16,610
Scott: You don't want.

795
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:18,640
Scott: you're gonna get some candies in there.

796
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,349
Scott: You really want and eat really quickly.

797
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,444
Scott: You're gonna get some candies in there that are so good You hold out on them.

798
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:34,378
Scott: Like I got to eat that that at the right time, you know, so it's not just like, you know you know, I can't go down and buy candy at the you know, the Bodega as easily these days.

799
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:41,894
Scott: So yeah, if your your candy supply is low and you need some sugar You want some random sugar and not just a whole bunch of this.

800
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:45,897
Rym: can't be a super picky person Who's like I only eat the Mars bar, right?

801
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:51,026
Scott: Exactly You know, and we got some pop rocks All kinds of stuff.

802
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:52,615
Rym: I both love and hate pop rocks.

803
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:56,260
Scott: exactly We're gonna love and you're gonna love and hate the stuff.

804
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,519
Scott: I Think some of the stuff we got in the box is gonna sit there forever until a visitor eats it.

805
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,630
Scott: Yep And and some of it disappeared as soon as we open.

806
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,631
Rym: the trick is once we can get together again when we all converge on Your apartment for like a football game or something.

807
00:50:10,932 --> 00:50:12,139
Rym: Well, you take that box right out.

808
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,969
Rym: Yeah But don't get any other food out.

809
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:18,020
Rym: just have that candy out first and then order pizza later.

810
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:23,520
Scott: People will get desperate and be forced to eat the candy and I'll only put out the candy that I know we're not gonna eat.

811
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,360
Scott: Yeah, so if you're looking for a box of candy, they're shipping.

812
00:50:28,002 --> 00:50:30,169
Rym: So I ran into a conundrum the other day.

813
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:54,400
Rym: cuz way back like before the quarantine it in winter I was an REI buying some ski stuff and had a clearance rack and on the clearance rack There was some really expensive nice bike jerseys and like chamois and stuff that were like 80% off and There was one item on that entire rack That was not a stupid size and it was a really nice pearl azumi like racing Jersey.

814
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,554
Rym: This is really nice and it was like 80 90 percent off.

815
00:50:57,575 --> 00:50:58,760
Rym: like it was a ridiculous cheap price.

816
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,158
Rym: I just bought it and I lied it looked great, but I buried it in the closet and forgot about it.

817
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:05,128
Rym: This is getting toward a review.

818
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,616
Rym: I'm not reviewing that bike Jersey though.

819
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,159
Rym: It was great.

820
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:10,579
Rym: During the quarantine I decided you know what?

821
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,294
Rym: I should get out that bike Jersey for when I go biking and I went to put it on.

822
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:17,219
Rym: I felt something weird on my Back and I took it off.

823
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,211
Rym: The anti-theft thing was still on it.

824
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,180
Rym: They forgot to take it off when I bought the fucking thing.

825
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,803
Scott: Don't don't don't.

826
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:27,316
Rym: so I needed a very powerful magnet to be able to remove it.

827
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:28,280
Rym: I did not own a very.

828
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:32,973
Scott: You get your own anti-theft removal bring it to the store and shoplift.

829
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:33,414
Rym: Yep.

830
00:51:33,735 --> 00:51:40,557
Rym: So those of you who don't know Most of those anti-theft tags are removed by just a strong magnet.

831
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:40,958
Rym: That's it.

832
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:41,660
Rym: That's the secret.

833
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:42,986
Rym: You don't need anything special.

834
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:44,914
Rym: So I went online and for $14.

835
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:51,700
Rym: I bought a DIY mag 40 by 20 millimeter super strong neodymium disc magnet.

836
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:53,866
Rym: Mmm, it was.

837
00:51:53,886 --> 00:52:03,120
Rym: it was basically the smallest amount of extremely powerful magnet I could buy because I don't want to have a lot of extremely powerful magnets around my house.

838
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,402
Rym: Those things are dangerous as fuck Like.

839
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:06,786
Rym: I cannot stress enough.

840
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:12,445
Rym: powerful may habits are non obviously dangerous to you in ways You will not expect do not?

841
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:16,000
Scott: I have a. I have a like a little sleeve.

842
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,820
Scott: It has like, you know, five or six little neodymium disc magnets.

843
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:26,612
Scott: Yeah, and it's it came in like a little package with like, you know A foam sleeve and a box to help them in.

844
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:28,199
Scott: and yeah, if I can keep them in there.

845
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,355
Scott: Yep, so Mike so Mike's are they stay unless I absolutely need.

846
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,019
Scott: if I need them for something I'll take them out.

847
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,681
Rym: So my brothers were the biggest danger of those magnets is if you have more than one you can literally crush yourself with them Like.

848
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:43,654
Scott: yeah, they're set that each one is separated by a foam disc from each other.

849
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:45,501
Scott: so you could pry one off when you need It.

850
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:49,100
Scott: Yep, and when you put it back you have to make sure you don't get your finger in between them.

851
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,940
Rym: Yep, so I my parameters where I wanted one Neodymium magnet that was strong enough to remove anti-theft devices.

852
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:59,620
Rym: I did not want to have to get multiple of them because I don't want to have multiple of them in my house.

853
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:00,243
Rym: So I got.

854
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:03,180
Scott: I have the ones that I have sound weaker than the one you had.

855
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,863
Rym: Oh, this one's.

856
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:04,947
Rym: so this one's.

857
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:06,674
Rym: this one's four centimeters in diameter.

858
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:07,276
Rym: It's pretty big.

859
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,085
Scott: Oh, okay That's bigger than I think.

860
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:11,199
Scott: the ones I have are maybe two centimeters in diameter.

861
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:12,865
Scott: but yeah, they're they're.

862
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:19,335
Scott: they're quite strong like they could hold a Like a sizable stack of paper to a fridge or something like that.

863
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:24,839
Rym: Oh, no this one If I let it touch the side of my fridge, I would have difficulty getting it off.

864
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:28,452
Scott: Yeah, these I could probably like slide off the side of the.

865
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:30,500
Scott: my fridge isn't magnetic at least not in the front.

866
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,524
Rym: Neither is mine only the side.

867
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:35,280
Scott: I could slide it off the side and then like yank it off.

868
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,066
Rym: This one is powerful enough to where even in its box surrounded by foam It will hold.

869
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:47,431
Rym: I can hold a stack of paper to it with a piece of non-magnetic Metal just like on the outside of the box.

870
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,640
Rym: So it's off in the corner by itself significant.

871
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:51,969
Scott: So it sounds like it's stronger than the ones I got.

872
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,355
Scott: Yep, and I got more.

873
00:53:53,415 --> 00:53:54,640
Scott: I got more of them and they're smaller.

874
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:56,746
Rym: It worked perfectly.

875
00:53:56,846 --> 00:54:01,340
Rym: It was exactly if you if you were in the situation where you need to remove anti-theft devices.

876
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:04,031
Rym: This is basically the magnet to buy.

877
00:54:04,353 --> 00:54:06,060
Rym: it's small enough to not be that dangerous.

878
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:09,136
Rym: There's only one so you don't have to worry about crushing yourself.

879
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:12,460
Scott: unless you're really well You can crush yourself between it and like a piece of iron.

880
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:14,973
Rym: Yeah I guess you could but it is.

881
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:20,274
Rym: this is the like Minimal safest option to be able to remove those things on your own if you need to.

882
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:28,993
Scott: so if you find you like holding it In your hand right and it's in your palm and you're walking down a hallway and there's like a nail in the wall and the Nail comes out of the wall into your hand.

883
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:29,779
Rym: It's not that strong.

884
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,135
Rym: Okay, it is it is not that strong like.

885
00:54:33,498 --> 00:54:37,692
Rym: honestly It's pretty safe unless you like try to hurt yourself with it.

886
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:46,180
Rym: primarily though because I only have one of them I would recommend not buying two because one is enough to deal with almost any anti-theft tag you will ever encounter.

887
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:49,171
Scott: I don't know how we're doing on time, but I'm definitely doing this.

888
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:49,673
Scott: next thing.

889
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:51,180
Rym: Let's do like four more then we're done.

890
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,478
Scott: Okay, so in my previous apartment, I had my human scale freedom chair, which I'm sitting in right now.

891
00:54:58,603 --> 00:55:01,153
Scott: It had these plastic casters on the bottom of it.

892
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:01,956
Scott: Just like every chair.

893
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:07,099
Scott: Yeah every chair comes with the same casters which are wheels right on the bottom of the chair.

894
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:19,025
Scott: and In the apartment we had in the house, we had in Beacon right there We were renting I had a plastic mat on the carpeted floor so that the chair would move because on carpet those casters aren't going Anywhere right.

895
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:21,340
Scott: you need especially not fluffy carpet, right?

896
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,020
Scott: Maybe it's a thin office kind of carpet, but not on a not in a fluffy carpet.

897
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:32,215
Scott: So you need a plastic mat to roll around in your chair And that was fine because the plastic mat protected the floor.

898
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:37,115
Scott: in my new apartment I had a hardwood floor and I just really didn't want to do the plastic mat.

899
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:44,202
Scott: I was just stubborn And I ended up damaging the floor a whole bunch with the the plastic Casters.

900
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:48,794
Rym: the floor under both mine and Emily's chairs are pretty chunked up because I also.

901
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:53,348
Rym: they were fine for like four or five years But over time by the time.

902
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:54,271
Scott: it's over time.

903
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:55,335
Scott: It's like I was just stubborn.

904
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,560
Scott: I didn't like the plastic mat.

905
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,352
Scott: I was on a hardwood floor the wheels worked and it was insidious.

906
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:02,980
Rym: like years went by and there was no visible damage.

907
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,879
Rym: So I felt like okay, I'm pretty good, but then more years went by.

908
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:10,640
Scott: Yeah, when I moved out the suit the guy looking at the apartment definitely noticed that damage to the floor.

909
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:12,673
Scott: But I got my full security deposit back.

910
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:13,760
Scott: so whatever not a problem.

911
00:56:14,444 --> 00:56:15,469
Scott: I mean, it's not hard to fix.

912
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,540
Scott: you just sand it and you know stain it or whatever.

913
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,074
Rym: Yeah, or worst case if you replace a few panels in the floor like it's not.

914
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:26,777
Scott: it wasn't like insane damage But there was noticeably like this circle where the floor was worn out and the rest of the floor is shiny.

915
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:34,588
Scott: Yeah, okay Anyway, so in the new apartment, we got a we got a floor which is sort of I think like some kind of fake woodish Material right?

916
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:35,879
Scott: It's a more modern kind of floor.

917
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:37,887
Scott: It's actually not highest quality.

918
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:38,389
Scott: like these.

919
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:41,620
Scott: building is pretty new but some of the planks are like sticking up a little bit.

920
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:42,646
Scott: It's not the best floor.

921
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:44,115
Scott: They checked out on the see our building.

922
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:45,040
Rym: the floor is really good.

923
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:46,579
Rym: What they cheaped out on is all the fixtures.

924
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:48,740
Scott: Anyway, I mean they cheaped out on those.

925
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,784
Scott: Really not too much actually.

926
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:53,473
Scott: But anyway, so I learned my lesson.

927
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,760
Scott: I didn't want to mess up the floor again, right?

928
00:56:56,921 --> 00:57:01,300
Scott: So I said, okay, I'll buy the plastic mat for the floor to not mess it up this time, right?

929
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:04,212
Scott: So the plastic mat is a plastic mat, it's okay.

930
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:04,875
Scott: It's not perfect.

931
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:06,040
Scott: Sometimes you roll off of it.

932
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,171
Scott: Yeah, it's not that big right it had.

933
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:09,880
Scott: the plastic mat sometimes slides around.

934
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,348
Scott: It's not perfect, but it does what it does.

935
00:57:12,408 --> 00:57:15,980
Scott: I still have it under me at least at this plastic mat flattened out perfectly.

936
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,020
Scott: So it's not bumpy, but I don't want to talk about the plastic mat.

937
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:23,100
Scott: I want to talk about something else that I learned about after I bought the plastic mat.

938
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,109
Scott: And if I had learned about it before I bought the plastic mat, I might have not bought the plastic mat.

939
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:27,710
Scott: and what this is?

940
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:29,073
Scott: You can buy.

941
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:34,490
Scott: the ones I'm linking to are just the ones I bought but there are many many competing identical products.

942
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,163
Scott: I don't think it matters which one you get.

943
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:36,950
Scott: they're all the same.

944
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:40,360
Rym: Yeah And I think your mounts are all the same format too.

945
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:50,330
Scott: exactly almost every office chair that you buy Has the same exact mount mechanism for attaching the casters slash wheels to the chair.

946
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:52,679
Scott: You could just tip your chair over and yank them out.

947
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,025
Scott: There's no screwing involved.

948
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:55,250
Scott: There's no turning or twisting.

949
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:59,486
Scott: You just pull them straight out, and then you put new ones straight in and that's it.

950
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,330
Scott: That's all you got to do.

951
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,106
Scott: It's it's easy as pie.

952
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:03,511
Scott: It.

953
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:10,228
Scott: changing casters is the simplest thing ever and so you can get casters from anywhere from any furniture supply.

954
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:10,830
Scott: anything, right?

955
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,273
Scott: It's like you could.

956
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:16,222
Scott: probably if you have like I'm rolling file cabinet You probably take the casters right off of that cabinet and slap them on your chair.

957
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:16,704
Scott: Yep, right.

958
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:17,749
Scott: It's probably gonna just work.

959
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:23,287
Scott: There might be a few that have weird non-standard ones, but you know whatever.

960
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,475
Scott: so What these are?

961
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:26,638
Scott: they're casters.

962
00:58:26,678 --> 00:58:30,390
Scott: they have the same attachment that go into the holes in the bottom of your chair.

963
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:35,684
Scott: But the wheel part is not some shitty plastic wheel.

964
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,910
Scott: that stuff gets stuck in and all that garbage.

965
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:44,969
Scott: The wheel part is just a fucking off-the-shelf regular old rollerblade wheel which is brilliant like that's.

966
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:49,037
Rym: look shitty luggage Luggage has.

967
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:51,290
Scott: my luggage has skateboard wheels which are different.

968
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:55,570
Scott: The skateboard wheels make sense for luggage because your luggage is mostly going straight.

969
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,181
Scott: It's moving a long straight distance like a skateboard right.

970
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:04,155
Scott: the rollerblade wheel a skateboard wheel on the spinning Caster is gonna be very awkward.

971
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:06,240
Scott: I guess it could work, but it weird right.

972
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:12,379
Scott: the rollerblade wheel is centered right it lasts a long time It's cheap, and it's soft right.

973
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:17,967
Scott: It's made of this soft rubber that wears out not this hard plastic That's gonna pick up dirt and grind on the floor.

974
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:28,510
Scott: Yeah So I mean I guess you could wear out the floor even with these rollerblade wheels On your chair because they could pick up dirt, and then you know sort of rub that dirt around.

975
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:31,903
Scott: It's definitely a lot less, but definitely a lot lot less.

976
00:59:32,144 --> 00:59:33,590
Scott: you roll a lot smoother.

977
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,870
Scott: They're way more comfortable just moving around.

978
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:38,317
Scott: They are quieter by a lot.

979
00:59:38,377 --> 00:59:41,205
Scott: the plastic ones rattle like a freaking snake right.

980
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:45,319
Scott: the rollerblade wheels are smooth like You see in Japan.

981
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:47,230
Scott: every these people have like office chair races.

982
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:47,832
Scott: It's like man.

983
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,321
Scott: am I cheating if I slap these on my office chair?

984
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:51,966
Scott: is that man right?

985
00:59:52,267 --> 01:00:00,230
Scott: Yes, probably But I see no reason that a why don't all office chairs everywhere come standard with these wheels?

986
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:02,730
Scott: They're better on literally every surface in a home.

987
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,452
Rym: Yeah Why do we know?

988
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:05,759
Rym: why did we settle on that shitty old caster format?

989
01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:09,010
Scott: the plastic casters are better on exact zero?

990
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,123
Scott: Surfaces that I can imagine compared to the rollerblade wheels.

991
01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:13,930
Scott: the rollerblade wheels aren't that expensive.

992
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,437
Scott: This is these are 40 less than $40 for a set of five.

993
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,801
Rym: I guess I spent a thousand dollars on the chair.

994
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:22,870
Rym: I can spend another $40 on some wheel right?

995
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:26,650
Scott: I guess if you have a really cheapo chair that was $40 then it might not be worth it.

996
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,319
Scott: But I think I've seen cheaper ones than this.

997
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,707
Scott: you don't have to get these ones right.

998
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:37,910
Scott: you can also Just buy like you go to the hardware store get casters And then get wheels at the rollerblades to a sporting goods store and put them together.

999
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:42,970
Rym: That'd be tough because rollerblade wheels have a particular mounting through their axel.

1000
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:59,404
Scott: If you have an office chair because you're a nerd and you spend a lot of time in it you need these yep like yesterday Even if you and I bet those stupid gamer chairs don't even have this shit, and they absolutely should right Rollerblade wheels on your office chair.

1001
01:00:59,424 --> 01:01:05,418
Scott: it is Game-changing if you spend a lot of time in an office chair And it will protect your floor and everything's better.

1002
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:11,330
Scott: the only thing is that make sure your chair is height adjustable Which every chair is fucking height adjustable?

1003
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,983
Scott: But just in case because they're hot you're gonna lift your chair up.

1004
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:25,469
Rym: no every game every damn gamer chair I'm looking at has garbage casters, but the casters have like Gamer mouse looking shit on the sides of them like rims, but they're still just casters.

1005
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:31,550
Scott: Anyway, the point is it will raise your chair like a few centimeters up higher than the casters that were originally on there.

1006
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,323
Rym: Yeah, so if your chair is all the way at the bottom you probably have to.

1007
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:35,690
Scott: you'll have to lower your seat.

1008
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:38,720
Scott: Yeah, if your chair is all the way at the bottom Then this is gonna make your chair higher.

1009
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:44,570
Scott: if your chair is not all the way at the bottom You're gonna have to lower your seat a little bit, otherwise you'll feel higher.

1010
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,822
Scott: It's like just enough to make you feel higher.

1011
01:01:46,862 --> 01:01:54,490
Rym: when you put these on all right I'll do one more cuz we've got a little over an hour here And then you can do one more if you want or it could end, but I'll see if I have anything.

1012
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,222
Scott: That's that's as good as rollerblade wheels on your show

1013
01:01:57,483 --> 01:02:09,990
Rym: got power strips computers and everything And I when I was redoing this room I bought a bunch of cable channels And I really just like cable managed the fuck out of my computer desk like I was done with cake because I got too many audio cables everywhere.

1014
01:02:10,592 --> 01:02:15,626
Rym: But the power cables are always tough because power strips are always awkward and there's never enough holes.

1015
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:17,693
Rym: there can't be enough holes for all Things I gotta plug in.

1016
01:02:18,356 --> 01:02:22,050
Rym: so I bought these Trond brand power strips.

1017
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:32,033
Rym: but the deal with them is that one the Plug that goes into the wall for the power strip can rotate so you don't have to worry about awkward positioning And it's flat.

1018
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:32,956
Rym: so it'll be flush.

1019
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:35,024
Rym: nice - they are.

1020
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:40,630
Rym: they have a bunch of USBs in them So they'll just charge USB with like a real like the same kind of thing that's in an anchor.

1021
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:42,419
Rym: Which great computer.

1022
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:43,910
Rym: I got a lot of USB stuff like the spotlight.

1023
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:50,938
Rym: I don't need to plug that into the computer or one of my chargers like it's plugged into the power strip But three they come built into.

1024
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:55,290
Rym: them are four holes to screw them into a surface permanently.

1025
01:02:55,752 --> 01:03:00,670
Rym: So I bought a bunch of them, and I mounted them into the inside of my desk.

1026
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:04,039
Scott: Okay, so they're mounted above.

1027
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,129
Rym: so all my power cables for the computer.

1028
01:03:06,169 --> 01:03:10,164
Rym: now Everything goes down onto the desk and never reaches the floor.

1029
01:03:10,425 --> 01:03:11,830
Rym: It's all plugged into the desk.

1030
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:14,689
Rym: It's like there's power outlets built into the desk.

1031
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:16,435
Rym: These are super cheap.

1032
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:17,879
Rym: They're like 20 bucks like that's.

1033
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:20,186
Rym: that's what a real power strip cost.

1034
01:03:20,206 --> 01:03:30,250
Rym: if you buy power strips that are $5 They probably don't have like surge protection or anything in them But these just work, and they're great, and I've had no problems with them.

1035
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,690
Rym: They've been installed for like a year at this point with no problems.

1036
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:40,338
Rym: they're not wearing out and I'd recommend these to anyone who needs to get more holes in their desk and Wants to clean.

1037
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,470
Rym: do better cable management.

1038
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,154
Scott: All right, that's it.

1039
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:43,637
Rym: That's it.

1040
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:44,079
Rym: They're great.

1041
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:44,421
Scott: Okay.

1042
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:44,824
Scott: I'll do this.

1043
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:45,990
Scott: this one won't take long all right.

1044
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,708
Scott: So I used to buy dental floss which I still buy right.

1045
01:03:49,748 --> 01:03:51,736
Scott: but And then they came out.

1046
01:03:51,756 --> 01:03:55,170
Scott: you know all these like plastic toothpicks right instead of wooden ones.

1047
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:57,902
Scott: And then they have a little piece of floss on the other end right.

1048
01:03:57,922 --> 01:03:59,610
Scott: so you get the floss end and then the pick end.

1049
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,823
