1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,738
Rym: It's Thursday, September 16th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:09,999
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,510
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,939
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:19,927
Rym: Tonight we are talking about beverages, like soda or pop or water.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,448
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:37,250
Rym: So, uh, because of the nature of my desk, like the desk I've just been using for a long time, it's one of those desks that has, like, the top surface that's a little higher than you'd want, and then it has the little tray that you can put the keyboard and mouse on that comes out.

8
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:38,610
Rym: So I can push that out of the way.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,569
Scott: Not a fan of the tray.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,204
Rym: I really like the tray, because I'd like to be able to get the keyboard and mouse out of the way if I'm using the desk for something.

11
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:44,750
Rym: Like, there's a lot.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,189
Rym: It just works out really nicely.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,062
Scott: I just have more desk than we use.

14
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,069
Scott: a different area for the...

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,690
Rym: Yeah, because my desk is in the tiny room, and the big, big room is the bedroom.

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:02,791
Rym: So anyway, I used to just have a little mouse pad, but the mouse pad was, like, kind of an awkward size having a full-size keyboard down there as well.

17
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:08,549
Rym: So eventually, I ended up acquiring, through PAX, I didn't pay for it, I just got it.

18
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:14,430
Rym: You got it from Tableton, I think, that My Little Pony Luna card game play mat.

19
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,250
Rym: that happens to be the exact size of that little tray.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,949
Rym: So I can put my keyboard and mouse on it.

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,880
Scott: Card game play mats from, you know, collectible card games are really good as under-keyboard mouse mats.

22
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:28,868
Rym: They're basically the same...

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:36,648
Scott: They're that same material, right, where it's, like, I forget what it's called, and that has the stitching, the stitched, like, textile on, like, on top of it.

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,658
Scott: It's basically just a big... They're literally just big mouse pads.

25
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:41,640
Scott: Same exact thing, so...

26
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:43,146
Rym: Yep.

27
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,959
Scott: They're cheaper than... If you go looking on the internet for, like, "I want to buy a giant mouse pad," they're expensive.

28
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,110
Scott: You know, they're all gamer ones.

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,463
Rym: Oh, so even worse, I was doing some research on this because I was like, "Oh, I'll buy a good gamer one or see what the deal is,".

30
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:56,950
Rym: and even not talking about price.

31
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:08,758
Rym: There are basically, like, most of the sites, even like Logitech, that sell those things don't have any way to search by size or even see the sizes unless you, like, click on a prod and go all the way in.

32
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,182
Rym: Like, they just assume you don't care about the exact size of this thing.

33
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,844
Scott: So... They probably only sell, like, one size.

34
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,070
Rym: Yeah, so I dug in more, and it seems like that industry did, in fact, standardize.

35
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,455
Rym: They just don't say it.

36
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:25,610
Rym: Like, everyone just, like, they just assume everyone knows these sizes, but...

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,282
Scott: It's usually, like, large and extra large.

38
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,390
Scott: I think they're not really, you know...

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:37,490
Rym: There are four sizes that pretty much every company sells, and none of them are even close to the size I would need or could use for this tray.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,605
Scott: Well, you're looking for a real... You're trying to get a specific size.

41
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:47,558
Scott: I think most people just have a desk, and they just plop it on, and if it's too... If there's extra desk or if it's, you know, it's like... It fits on the desk.

42
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,330
Scott: They don't give a shit if it's the exact inches.

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,531
Rym: I did.

44
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,262
Rym: So I looked into that.

45
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:51,890
Rym: Most of the... You're just really particular.

46
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:55,569
Rym: Oh, no, I just... The space I have is exactly 24 inches wide, and...

47
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,429
Scott: No, that's also... I think most people have gotten... The drawer is a very old style.

48
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,850
Scott: It's, like, a 90s style, you know?

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,330
Rym: Yeah, I think it's a good style, though, for... Especially the kind of stuff I do with my desk.

50
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,354
Rym: I like that drawer a lot, but... So, basically, all mousepads... Most people have a pad just for their mouse.

51
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:21,297
Rym: The people who even put their keyboard on the pad are pretty rare, and the people who want that, the ones they sell, are actually... They're only, like, a foot tall, and they're super wide.

52
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,441
Rym: Like, 48 inches.

53
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,625
Rym: Like, ridiculously wide.

54
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:24,809
Rym: And that seems to be...

55
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,740
Scott: If they're gaming type ones, yeah.

56
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,530
Scott: Like, meant for computer PC gaming.

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:35,390
Rym: But if you look at card game playmats, 24 inches is a standard size.

58
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,474
Rym: Like, the 24 inches is...

59
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:46,277
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we got ours from, like, one of those custom... The places where you can send them a JPEG, and they'll print you a mat of, like, you know, various sizes and stitching, you know?

60
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,656
Scott: And their whole business was not catering to video games, but was catering to card games.

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,546
Scott: So, we got these big ones.

62
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:58,050
Scott: We have one on each desk, and it's, like, you know, you put the keyboard on the left, mouse on the right.

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:10,630
Rym: So, of all places, I went to Inked Gaming, which primarily is for... You want to make a custom one for yourself, either for, like, your card game or the board game you play, or for whatever reason.

64
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,870
Scott: Several companies that do the same thing, they all seem to be just as good as each other.

65
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,451
Rym: Yep.

66
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:18,786
Rym: So, I went to them, and I just was like, "All right, 24 inches is your standard

67
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:19,108
Rym: size.".

68
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,819
Rym: I got some art from the Utena movie.

69
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,689
Rym: I just slapped it into their template, made sure...

70
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:28,310
Scott: They say don't send us copyrighted stuff, but they will totally print copyrighted stuff.

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,330
Rym: Unless it's, like, literally just Mickey Mouse, they don't give a shit.

72
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,655
Scott: They may or may not.

73
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:40,509
Scott: Mine is actually... I took a photo of the murals outside, and then I cropped the JPEG and sent it to them.

74
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:51,290
Rym: Yeah, I just got this, like, that thing in Utena, the movie, on the top of the whole Dueling Tower area, where there's, like, the roses and the weird cut-out tower.

75
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,595
Rym: So, I just put that on there.

76
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:57,280
Rym: It's absolutely perfect, but the funniest thing was I just ordered it, like, didn't even make an account.

77
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,650
Rym: I just ordered this thing, like, that's it.

78
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,736
Rym: I'll use this thing for 10 years.

79
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:08,028
Rym: The only reason I even replaced the My Little Pony one is that that one was so old that it wasn't made out of that new modern material.

80
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:26,850
Rym: It was the old style mouse pad with the plasticky stuff on one side and that, like, sort of squishy material glued to the back of it, and the squishy material had absorbed grease from my hand over time, and then suddenly, over the span of, like, three days, started disintegrating under my wrists.

81
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:27,952
Scott: Oh, yeah.

82
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:46,387
Scott: Yeah, the Netrunner mats I have, you know, are definitely, like, thinner and sadder than the fancy big one that I had, you know, custom made, which has, like, you know, like, the Netrunner one, it's, like, clearly, like, the fabric was just, like, you know, glued onto the, you know, the surface of the whatever rubbery stuff is.

83
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:51,563
Scott: It's really thin, like, maybe a millimeter thick, and then they just, like, cut it out, right?

84
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:58,268
Scott: This one actually has, like, stitching all around the edges, but the edges aren't just, you know.

85
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,860
Rym: And it's, like, a unified bonded one-piece thing.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,895
Rym: It's not, like, old mouse pads that were literally two different materials just glued together, so

87
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:06,118
Scott: it's great,

88
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:18,155
Rym: but the funniest thing was, so then they sent me an email, this company, and they're, like, "Hey, make sure you tell us which influencer told you to buy it so we can credit them,".

89
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,098
Rym: and I was, like, "What?

90
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,042
Scott: Fuck?".

91
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,126
Scott: Oh, okay.

92
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:22,029
Rym: I've never heard of that.

93
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:23,494
Rym: I bought this from a store.

94
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,903
Rym: I didn't even, like, make an account with you, WTF.

95
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:30,863
Rym: So, I think what I'm gonna do tonight is just be, like, "Yeah, those GeekNights guys really sold it,".

96
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:36,501
Rym: and see if they come to us and see what happens.

97
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,667
Rym: It was a weird email that I got from them.

98
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,252
Rym: It almost looked like it was written by hand.

99
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:40,633
Rym: I don't know.

100
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:41,094
Rym: We'll see.

101
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:54,323
Rym: I feel like that is a world that we just don't see because of our aggressive ad blocking coupled with our issuing of that entire, like, I don't watch streamers who are, like, in that influencer class.

102
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:59,221
Rym: Like, the streamers I watch are doing, like, it's the other guy watching people playing a game.

103
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:00,970
Scott: They're focused on the game they're making.

104
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,693
Scott: They're playing.

105
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:02,477
Rym: Or making.

106
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:07,982
Rym: A lot of times I'm watching someone who's, like, playtesting a game they're making, but, yeah, I'm not watching the popular streamers.

107
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:16,035
Scott: Like, you know, sometimes I might watch someone who does have a sponsor, but, like, they really don't talk about the sponsor much at all, right?

108
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,350
Scott: Except for they're just, they're talking about the game they're playing.

109
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:34,138
Rym: Also, I've gotten to the point on YouTube, if I'm watching, like, SciShow or any one of those, like, YouTube channels, they're like, there's the moment where they haven't started the ad read yet, but there's a different cadence in their voices for, like, oh, the ad read's coming and I got to the part where I can just stop the video before the ad read.

110
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:39,663
Scott: Even Sausage Guy is, like, this Will It Blow is brought to you by, and I'm like, pause, skip, unpause.

111
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:40,708
Rym: SciShow is funnier.

112
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:53,986
Rym: They're like, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, and there's this slight pause that's longer than normal, and then they're, like, speaking, like, from a script, and suddenly they're, like, speaking of blah ba blah, and they're immediately going to talk about whatever fucking direct-to-consumer bed.

113
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:54,730
Rym: they're advertising.

114
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:07,314
Scott: There is a website, there is a website out there where people, uh, I think it's a, like, a plug-in for your browser or something, where people crowdsource the timings on particular videos of, like, when the ad is.

115
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,200
Scott: Oh, that's like old school ad block.

116
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:25,836
Scott: Right, one person watches the video, they put in the time codes of, like, ad starts here, ad stops there, and now if you've got the plug-in in your browser, it looks it up every time you go to watch a video if there's any, you know, shared time codes and it will auto skip for you.

117
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:34,931
Scott: And if you're mostly watching really popular stuff or people think things that are popular with people have that plug-in, then it's going to work really well for you.

118
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:38,780
Scott: It has quite a lot of users, so it's, but I don't use it.

119
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,326
Scott: I just know it exists.

120
00:08:40,827 --> 00:09:00,070
Rym: So, in the news, we'll get right into this, because this is a huge deal, and what's fascinating to me is I am not seeing people talking about this outside of this industry right now, but if what we're about to talk about actually happens, this is a, like, this is a foundational change type issue if it occurs.

121
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,201
Rym: If you're not familiar, there is a union called the IATSE.

122
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,324
Rym: Nazi?

123
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:06,647
Rym: Yeah, you'll see.

124
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:07,790
Scott: Five, sixes, baby!

125
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,575
Rym: So, if you're in the entertainment industry or the convention industry, we'll get back to that, this could cause a pax to that.

126
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:19,652
Scott: Pretty much anything that involves stages, performances, etc.

127
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:29,773
Scott: Yeah, this is an old-school union from the, like, this is one of the, like, like, if you see the logo, you'll be like, hey, I've seen that somewhere, probably at the end of a movie down near all those other logos.

128
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:39,134
Rym: Or you've seen it at convention centers when you're, like, at a theater.

129
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,259
Scott: So, it's all, there are a lot of people.

130
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:52,816
Rym: Founded in the late 1800s and affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which, if you don't know what that union is, I don't know, take a, take, take fifth grade social studies, because what the fuck?

131
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:53,600
Scott: It's the first one.

132
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,673
Rym: That's the, that's, like, the one you learn about in American schools.

133
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:04,116
Rym: But the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, it's a whole long thing.

134
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,082
Rym: Like, this covers a lot.

135
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:14,358
Scott: It includes, like, you go to a concert and, like, someone, you know, let's say you go to a music festival, there's that giant stage they build and then take down when the festival's over.

136
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:14,740
Scott: Yeah.

137
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,328
Scott: All the people who put that shit together.

138
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:27,951
Rym: Or the people who, like, deal with the cables to mic up a stage or run cameras or plug shit in in a convention center or set up the stage for a Broadway play, it's all this one union with over 150,000 people.

139
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:32,260
Scott: Projectionists, you know, everything.

140
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,848
Scott: Audio, lighting, screens, all this stuff.

141
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,096
Rym: So, this union is real close to striking.

142
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,500
Rym: Like, yeah.

143
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,306
Rym: This has been simmering for a while.

144
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:46,680
Rym: In fact, I queued this news up from September 8th to talk about it, because it was such a big deal.

145
00:10:47,403 --> 00:11:04,334
Rym: There's updated news today that the union is now mobilizing and planning the strike to be ready to do it at a moment's notice as they await the final response from, like, the producers and all the Hollywood companies that they're negotiating with.

146
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:09,793
Rym: They're basically deciding relatively imminently whether or not they're going to strike.

147
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:17,925
Scott: And what that would mean, it wouldn't be as bad as, like, when the sanitation workers go on strike and the street is literally covered in shit, which happened.

148
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:25,613
Rym: But this is, like, an order of magnitude worse for the, not worse, I shouldn't say worse, because it would be a good thing if they strike.

149
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:32,920
Rym: This would be an order of magnitude more impactful than the writers' strike, which some of you might be old enough to remember.

150
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:39,062
Rym: Where, remember when American TV pivoted to a lot of reality, like, a lot of reality TV?

151
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,070
Rym: That's because the writers were all on strike.

152
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:50,139
Scott: Yeah, well, so this is the thing that's happened, right, is that when you have a strong union, right, like the baseball union, I always use the example of the strong union.

153
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:50,780
Rym: They're a real good.

154
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:59,290
Scott: this is a lot of baseball players, right, they play a lot of fucking baseball.

155
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,107
Scott: If they go on strike, you know, they can't really play baseball when it's cold.

156
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,117
Scott: It's like you're losing games, you're losing money.

157
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,456
Scott: Most, a lot of the money comes from people going to the stadium, right?

158
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:10,962
Scott: You know, that's a big deal.

159
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:17,064
Scott: But when football players went on strike, they just got some fucking replacement football players, right?

160
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,670
Scott: They're just like, "Scabs, come on

161
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:18,951
Scott: in.".

162
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:23,847
Scott: They did replacement refs too, and everyone hated it, but they did it anyway.

163
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:27,396
Scott: And so the NFL's unions are weak, right?

164
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:37,673
Scott: It's like, you know, going on strike wasn't enough leverage to get people kept watching the football, even, you know, in some ways people complain so much about the shitty refs.

165
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,604
Scott: It's like, well, that means you're watching the game.

166
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,573
Scott: You saw how shitty the refs were, right?

167
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,584
Scott: So that's why, you know, that's what it turns out.

168
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:48,198
Rym: That doesn't matter that much to how the money gets made, right?

169
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:57,552
Scott: But when the writers went on strike, you saw, like Rym just said, strong, but not as strong because they came in with the reality shows that aren't written, right?

170
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,500
Scott: Necessarily, right?

171
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,010
Scott: Under at least the same, I don't know how they define that.

172
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:15,290
Rym: Yeah, and let's stay away from the fact that the video game industry is so non-unionized, despite many of the people in that industry doing the exact same kinds of jobs that these union employees in the Hollywood and television and convention industries do.

173
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:22,375
Scott: But if Yahtzee goes on strike, depending on exactly which people go on strike for how long before you get into that.

174
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:27,834
Rym: So the witch right now is of the hundred and fifty thousand members of the end of this union.

175
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,864
Rym: There is unanimous backing from the executive board.

176
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:36,523
Rym: The initial strike would be sixty thousand of them, primarily the West Coast locals.

177
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:39,675
Rym: Not to like I'm not going to explain how unions work to you.

178
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,025
Rym: Read a book or take fifth grade social studies.

179
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,150
Rym: That's more like Hollywood.

180
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,193
Rym: That's like seventh grade.

181
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:44,414
Rym: Yeah.

182
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:45,318
Rym: Social studies.

183
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:54,054
Rym: But usually unions are actually organized a lot political parties in America in that there will be a national union that basically just coordinates and organizes.

184
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:58,090
Rym: But the real power is the locals, meaning you watch old movies.

185
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:10,773
Scott: If you live in the United States and you've driven around or walked around anywhere, you've probably seen like some house that has like some logos and it says like local number, number, number.

186
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:14,873
Scott: It's like that's a union headquarters for the local branch of whatever unions.

187
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:15,355
Scott: Right.

188
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:16,742
Scott: They're all over the place.

189
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,274
Scott: Even in this neighborhood, there's plumbing ones, electric ones.

190
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:20,723
Scott: The electric one always has a cool logo.

191
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,275
Scott: It's like a hand with a bunch of lightning bolts and stuff like that.

192
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,138
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:24,439
Rym: Yep.

194
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:36,579
Rym: So they're negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which basically their argument is they are treated like shit and paid nothing from an industry that makes billions.

195
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:37,924
Rym: That's true.

196
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:38,506
Rym: Literally.

197
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:42,522
Scott: All the money goes to the big name actors and the producers and whatever.

198
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:47,560
Scott: And they always do shenanigans in Hollywood to mask how much money is really being made.

199
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,512
Rym: Despite the fact that, you know, forget star power.

200
00:14:52,194 --> 00:15:01,804
Rym: There are very good actors a tear down from the A-listers that could do probably a fine job at that part of moviemaking.

201
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:02,065
Rym: Right.

202
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:14,053
Scott: But that Hollywood argument, the Hollywood argument is like, you know, hey, if we got a different, you know, that top name actor, right, at least they believe that the top name actor is with selling the tickets right to the show.

203
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:21,565
Scott: And if they switched out all the lower actors or if they switched out the whole crew, people would still come see the, you know, some Marvel movie.

204
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:27,695
Scott: It's like, well, as long as you have all the actors for the superheroes that are famous, we could change everyone else and we would sell just as many tickets.

205
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,947
Scott: So also that's the producer Hollywood added.

206
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:31,670
Rym: But I go further.

207
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:43,125
Rym: It's kind of moot because even if that is true, those people are not as important to make the movie at all as these union people are, because exactly.

208
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:49,413
Scott: That's why you need the union, because without a union, it's like, OK, well, it doesn't matter which camera guy I have, the movie will sell as many tickets.

209
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,720
Scott: Well, but what if no camera guy will work for you?

210
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:56,275
Rym: And sure, you might get a scab for a camera guy.

211
00:15:56,295 --> 00:16:01,153
Rym: There's a million YouTubers out there and like amateurs like I'm a pretty good videographer, like for real.

212
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:11,522
Rym: However, the skill set to be a good camera worker on a Hollywood movie or a sports broadcast or a concert, that is a difficult skill.

213
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:17,559
Rym: I would do a materially worse job than the shittiest union camera worker.

214
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:18,762
Scott: Right.

215
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:28,460
Scott: What you'll have is if you do hire a scab who isn't as skilled and I can't imagine someone having the skill and not being in the union, that would be a strange like that would be a rare person.

216
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,821
Rym: Let's say somehow I am better than like the worst unionized camera worker, but worse than the rest of them.

217
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:41,916
Rym: Even then, I wouldn't walk through a. I would not be a scab because I have that skill and I have solidarity with those workers, of course.

218
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:56,761
Scott: But, you know, you if you go if you're a director, right, and you're trying to make a movie and you have to deal with a scab camera guy or a scab lighting person and you're like, you know, you tell the lighting people like, hey, do this kind of lighting set up and then you come back, expect ready to shoot the scene.

219
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,390
Scott: And the lighting is not what you just said.

220
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,242
Scott: Yeah, you lose, you know, much time and money you're losing from having to tell them to change it or having to do it yourself because the director knows.

221
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:05,704
Scott: Right.

222
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,117
Scott: The director, obviously, you know, went to film school.

223
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:11,334
Scott: They could figure, you know, they could like to give them more specific instruct.

224
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:11,796
Scott: Oh, yeah.

225
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:12,780
Rym: But here's the thing.

226
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,669
Scott: But that losing time and money.

227
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:14,970
Scott: Right.

228
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:16,978
Scott: It would be in deep, deep shit.

229
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:18,083
Scott: You would be better off.

230
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,193
Scott: You know, you still have to pay the scab something.

231
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,244
Scott: You'd be better off, you know, paying the pros.

232
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,934
Scott: You'd actually save money by giving the pros a higher salary.

233
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:30,548
Rym: But also, there are a lot of jobs that have to be done.

234
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:41,026
Rym: So even someone thinks, oh, the process that makes non-unionized YouTube and Twitch content might be good enough for like not Hollywood, maybe, but for a lot of other things.

235
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,870
Rym: The problem is that pipeline, which is similar to the pipeline Scott and I have, it's not that complicated.

236
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:57,564
Rym: And people who are very good at that lack knowledge and lack the knowledge that they lack the knowledge of all the parts that go into even a slightly bigger production.

237
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:58,728
Scott: Yep.

238
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:05,820
Rym: So basically, if they went on like when we did that fucking late show at PAX in ancient times, we lacked the knowledge of what we lacked.

239
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,664
Scott: We lacked the staff.

240
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,614
Scott: There was people that they didn't show up.

241
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:09,036
Scott: Yeah.

242
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,020
Scott: But that wasn't that.

243
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,969
Scott: But we had other problems as well.

244
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,574
Scott: I don't want to say that was our only problem.

245
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:20,597
Rym: What I'm saying is that that staff has a material impact on being able to make anything.

246
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:26,904
Rym: And that is the staff that is invisible to a lot of people who do small productions because they think, oh, smart people can just do this.

247
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:33,005
Rym: They don't realize, like, how many people do you think it takes to light a stage for a concert?

248
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,931
Rym: It is way more than you're guessing.

249
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,556
Rym: Like way more.

250
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:55,995
Scott: So anyway, if these people go on strike, what's going to happen most likely is a lot of things that are coming soon from Hollywood, Netflix, you know, your HBO maxes, all your streaming services, all your movie theater stuff, TV stuff that comes from California, right?

251
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,867
Scott: Any shows that record regularly in California, right?

252
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,300
Scott: I know some of the late shows are in New York, some are in California, things like that.

253
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:12,566
Scott: All kinds of stuff out there will either be delayed, a hiatus, you know, canceled maybe completely.

254
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:17,043
Scott: Things that, like, haven't started filming yet might never start filming.

255
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:21,084
Scott: And then when the strike's over, eventually they might choose to film something else instead.

256
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:24,099
Scott: Like someone might have their whole, you know, movie that was going to get made.

257
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:31,574
Scott: Well, I guess someone else's movie's getting made now instead just because bad luck of timing, you know, that my thing was going to start, you know, shooting when a strike happens.

258
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:47,421
Rym: But also, though all like that gigantic impact would just be if the first 60,000 strike, if the rest of the union strikes, if the entire union goes on strike, I want to share with you what the IATSE Local 11 does.

259
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:51,651
Rym: That's an East Coast local iteration of this union.

260
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,338
Rym: They run the BCEC and the Hines.

261
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,564
Rym: No Anime Boston, no Paxis.

262
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:59,735
Scott: Well, they could run it with scabs, right?

263
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:00,580
Rym: I don't think they could.

264
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:01,868
Rym: I don't think they would be capable of doing that.

265
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,388
Scott: But there are certain parts of it they could run with scabs, certain they couldn't, right?

266
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,814
Scott: And things they might mess up, right?

267
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:10,488
Scott: It might be run poorly if they did try to get scabs in there.

268
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:16,573
Scott: Also, I wouldn't attend a convention if there was a picket line of the convention center workers, that's for sure.

269
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:17,800
Rym: Oh, but you know what else they run?

270
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:21,293
Rym: Fenway Park, Gillette Stadium, TV Garden.

271
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:26,130
Rym: You talk about how American society only survives because of bread and circuses.

272
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:35,080
Rym: Well, this would cut off a lot of the circuses, and it would cut them off instantly because this is a union you don't fuck around with.

273
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:35,845
Rym: They know what they're doing.

274
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,212
Rym: They've been around for over 100 years.

275
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:45,308
Scott: Yeah, and you know, things like if there might be like a music festival that was scheduled, a band that was touring that was coming to your town on a particular day.

276
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:54,263
Scott: Well, if that band just happens to be unlucky and the strike is happening while they were in a particular town, they're going to lose a lot of tour dates and a lot of money, right?

277
00:20:54,645 --> 00:21:01,813
Scott: So that band is going to want to go to, you know, the producers who are making the deal and be like, "Hey, why the fuck aren't you paying the...".

278
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:02,315
Scott: Right?

279
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,867
Rym: So, so far, like you can read these articles.

280
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:15,706
Rym: I'll link to a bunch of things to give you the history and context of this because if you are not unionized, figure out why, if there is an activist movement in your industry and try to be part of it.

281
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:20,109
Rym: If you are a union, make sure you're involved in it and understand what it's doing and try to lean on it.

282
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:21,354
Scott: And keep it from being corrupt.

283
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,921
Scott: Make sure it's doing good stuff like this.

284
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:29,571
Rym: Especially because this is a sign of something bigger because this is not the first bit, like Nabisco workers are on strike right now too.

285
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:34,169
Rym: Aside, don't fucking buy Nabisco products, especially not those Pokemon Oreos.

286
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:42,400
Rym: Like, there are times and places where someone can cross a picket line because we live in a cruel and evil world and like we live in a society.

287
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,590
Rym: But don't cross a picket line for an Oreo cookie.

288
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:45,792
Scott: Right.

289
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:46,474
Scott: It's one thing.

290
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:53,543
Scott: if like, you know, let's say you live in a town and the Walmart workers are on strike, which really they should have been doing that decades ago.

291
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:54,669
Rym: But you gotta eat.

292
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,097
Rym: And if there's literally nothing else in town...

293
00:21:56,117 --> 00:22:01,082
Scott: But it's like if you live in a town where the only fucking thing is Walmart, it's like you don't have much choice, right?

294
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:04,495
Scott: You can go and get food, but you don't need Oreos.

295
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:12,401
Scott: You can buy Hydrox if they still have them or you can just buy fucking, I don't know, make cookies, buy sugar in Toll House.

296
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:13,425
Scott: Is Toll House Nestle?

297
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,554
Scott: Oh no, Toll House is Nestle, so it's not Nabisco.

298
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,908
Rym: Nestle is a piece of shit company too, but they do not have...

299
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:20,378
Scott: Nestle is a piece of shit too, but it's not on strike right now.

300
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:20,719
Scott: Exactly.

301
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:25,841
Rym: But this is a sign of something bigger and this is a topic for another show.

302
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:29,916
Rym: or maybe you listen to some people who are experts in labor and not two white guys doing a podcast.

303
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:49,590
Rym: But this is because on a fundamental level, due to a confluence of factors ranging from hyper capitalism to low taxes, the extreme wealth disparity in America and COVID, labor is extremely powerful right now.

304
00:22:50,430 --> 00:23:03,819
Rym: Labor holds all the keys to the kingdom because for all the tech automation and everything out there and the things that like me and Scott do for a job, our entire society grinds to a halt if the people who do the actual physical labor decide not to.

305
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:07,150
Scott: And you mentioned COVID, right?

306
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,143
Scott: The sad reality, a lot of people who did physical labor are dead.

307
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:18,412
Rym: Yep, because we forced them to keep working in inhumane, unsafe conditions to keep the circuses going and to keep the bread flowing.

308
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:28,271
Rym: Imagine a society where we paid the people who are keeping grocery stores stocked like quadruple wages during COVID because they were literally risking their lives so we could eat food.

309
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:45,020
Rym: So yeah, it is so weird to me how little press this is getting outside of industry circles, which means if they strike, I think this is going to be shocking news to the vast majority of Americans who have no idea.

310
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:51,971
Scott: It'll only be shocking news to them when they start realizing it, which might take a little while depending on which person it is, right?

311
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:57,054
Scott: Some people won't give a shit at all because their circuses are who knows what, something else is unaffected.

312
00:23:57,857 --> 00:24:04,700
Scott: Some people might be heavily affected, like they had their hearts set on going to a thing and, you know.

313
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,850
Rym: Yeah, imagine if my packs got canceled because of this.

314
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,731
Scott: Yeah, my hope is that we can get out, that the strike happens sooner and we can get out of our hockey tickets.

315
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:16,857
Rym: So you got any news?

316
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,781
Scott: I do have a news.

317
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:32,804
Scott: So in New York City, right, a few, well it's not just a New York City problem, but it came to New York City a few years ago, there's this bug insect, literal insect, called the spotted lanternfly.

318
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:41,254
Scott: And if you see one, it looks like a really fucking interesting kind of beautiful insect that like belongs in a, you know, like a zoo or something, you know, in the whatever.

319
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:45,322
Scott: But they're not.

320
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:46,325
Scott: They're really bad.

321
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:54,490
Scott: They're so bad that literally, right, normally you're like, oh I don't want to kill things, I'm a vegan or whatever, right?

322
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:06,033
Scott: And it's like, you know, okay, literally every environmentalist, you know, plant people, insect people, like yeah, you know, if you're like in New York and you see these things, fucking kill them.

323
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:25,521
Scott: Like basically what they do is they, the most dangerous, they do a lot of bad things, but the most dangerous thing they do is they eat the sap from a lot of plants and trees and in eating all the sap, those plants and trees now become, are not protected anymore, because I guess the sap is a protection mechanism.

324
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:28,193
Scott: I don't know too much about plants, but this is what I read on the internet.

325
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:35,778
Scott: And so if these things, which, you know, are not from here, right, they were, you know, what's the word for it?

326
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:41,999
Rym: I mean, these are just full-on invasive species that reduce the resiliency.

327
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:43,844
Scott: Someone brought them here by accident.

328
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:50,108
Scott: And it's basically all the trees and plants and shit will die if we don't get rid of these things, right?

329
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,340
Scott: So if you see one, it's really easy to spot one.

330
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,353
Scott: They're not that small and they're really distinct.

331
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:58,585
Scott: So you're not going to be squishing something else by accident.

332
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,994
Scott: So you don't have to be afraid.

333
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:00,860
Scott: You're not going to be worried.

334
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,939
Scott: Like just look at one picture and you'll be like, oh, there's no way you could miss one of those.

335
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,066
Rym: But also check out this article.

336
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:11,930
Rym: If you do murder one of these things that you should report where you saw it when you killed it.

337
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,504
Scott: So that they can come in and see if there's more in that area, right?

338
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:16,910
Scott: Nesting or some shit breeding.

339
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:28,815
Rym: Part of what they go after is there's a particular kind of tree that is extremely common in American cities on the East Coast, especially New York City, because it is very hard to have a tree that can grow in this environment.

340
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:34,637
Rym: And this one tree is extremely resilient and good at growing in a place like New York City.

341
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,850
Rym: And they attack that tree fucking specifically.

342
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:38,872
Scott: Yep.

343
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:43,025
Scott: And so if all these trees die, the climate damage from that is real bad.

344
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:43,868
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:44,470
Scott: So never mind.

346
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,935
Rym: Like I like there's a lot of structural racism in New York in terms of where people are forced to live and what they have access to.

347
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:56,463
Rym: But generally, the fewer trees there are in a neighborhood anywhere in New York, the hotter it is in that neighborhood.

348
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:58,853
Rym: Like literally it is hotter if you are outside.

349
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:05,642
Scott: And anyway, if you see this bug probably and not just New York, but probably anywhere in the United States, I'm guessing make sure that it's.

350
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:07,450
Scott: it's probably an invasive species.

351
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,258
Scott: wherever you are listening to this.

352
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,648
Scott: It's like most likely not, I guess, not guaranteed.

353
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:12,512
Scott: Check with experts.

354
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:18,339
Scott: But yeah, you probably want to kill these if you see them and you'd be like, oh, well, what difference does it make if people kill them when they see them?

355
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:20,910
Scott: Well, it turns out that historically.

356
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:29,694
Scott: way back in the day, you know, like feudalism times there was a there was a thing where they would I don't know how true this is.

357
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:39,410
Scott: I read it on the Internet, but I believe it for now where they told peasants, right, the peasants intentionally went out to kill certain kinds of insects.

358
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:45,864
Scott: And they did such a good job that certain kinds of birds ran out of food.

359
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:49,815
Scott: And that met and those birds also ate the locust.

360
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,079
Scott: So the locust came back.

361
00:27:52,483 --> 00:28:05,822
Scott: Humans going out and intentionally squishing bugs like in mass is effective if we enough people are doing it, especially in a place where there's people walking around like New York, even though there's less people walking around now than there used to be.

362
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:08,872
Scott: So I think especially in a city.

363
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,638
Scott: So, yeah, learn what they look like.

364
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:12,525
Scott: Figure out if they're invasive in your area.

365
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:16,340
Scott: And if you see them, squish them and don't feel bad about taking life.

366
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,104
Scott: There you go.

367
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:18,345
Rym: Yep.

368
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:19,351
Rym: So one last little news.

369
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:28,230
Rym: We're not going to talk about this long because we do want to get into our main bit, but I just want to and I'm not talking with this on Monday because the technology aspect of this is not interesting.

370
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:35,052
Rym: Ars Technik has an article, a ton of leaked documents prove something that Facebook had been up to.

371
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:39,868
Rym: that explains a lot of Facebook's bad behavior and the ill effects it's had on society.

372
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,385
Rym: There's another article that had a different problem that broke recently.

373
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:45,370
Rym: I was talking about on Twitter.

374
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:46,435
Rym: This is not that.

375
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,825
Rym: This is an unrelated bad Facebook thing.

376
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:54,505
Scott: Basically, it's one of those situations where like everybody knew this deep down, everybody knew.

377
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,453
Scott: And now the documents came out.

378
00:28:56,513 --> 00:28:57,015
Scott: What do you know?

379
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:59,083
Scott: We were right all along again.

380
00:28:59,464 --> 00:28:59,744
Rym: Short.

381
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:13,333
Rym: The short version is again, again, Facebook has rules like you can't say something super racist, like they have they have an ostensible set of rules and they do to a degree enforce them by deleting posts and removing accounts.

382
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:16,387
Rym: Like a lot of people get that enforcement happening upon them.

383
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:20,124
Rym: You can tell by looking at right wing blogs and people freak out their Facebook accounts get deleted.

384
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:26,182
Rym: But there was a list of five point eight million special people.

385
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:28,792
Scott: who is that many special people on earth.

386
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:29,976
Scott: That seems like a high number.

387
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:30,960
Rym: Yeah, it does.

388
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,468
Rym: That's actually part of why these documents are fascinating.

389
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:45,652
Rym: Facebook kept adding to this list of people constantly to the point that as of when these documents leaked, there were five point eight million individual human beings on this list.

390
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:51,694
Rym: And any account that was on this list, basically, even if a Facebook moderator was like, whoa, shit, delete that.

391
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,582
Rym: The platform just wouldn't.

392
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:59,202
Rym: And Facebook would go out of its way to make sure those accounts were not hindered in any way.

393
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:11,147
Rym: And the arguments for why they did this were to avoid drama and to avoid appearing partisan, because one aspect of this that's not talked about that much in this article, but is very commonly talked about.

394
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:14,962
Rym: And if you read the following articles and the links from this, you'll see it more.

395
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:23,309
Rym: It's mostly conservative voices that are deemed for takedown, but are also deemed too important and thus not taken down.

396
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:31,680
Rym: If Facebook actually cut off everyone who posted racist shit, they'd cut off a huge percentage of American conservative politicians.

397
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,150
Rym: And they're afraid of the government coming down on them.

398
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:45,613
Rym: But they're also afraid of like, if a soccer player says something anti-vax, they're afraid that if they delete that soccer player's account, like all of Europe will rise up against them.

399
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:48,043
Rym: Like, literally, that's one of the examples that happened.

400
00:30:49,047 --> 00:31:00,202
Rym: I don't have a lot more to say about this, except Facebook is literally a company that has done material harm to society in the world, not just by accident, but also by design.

401
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,551
Rym: And I urge you to delete your Facebook account.

402
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:11,040
Rym: Like, I say that a lot, but Facebook is literally objectively worse than any other non right wing social media platform on Earth.

403
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:13,892
Scott: And this goes straight to the Zuckman, right?

404
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:21,466
Scott: It's like there were quotes in some of these things that were like, he basically was like, you know, you know, like, yeah, we should, we'd let you know, let's not do that.

405
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:24,338
Scott: if it's going to damage, you know, our monies.

406
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:24,780
Scott: Right.

407
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,549
Scott: It's like, you know, it's going to hurt.

408
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,311
Scott: It's going to cause, you know, that someone would suggest to him, like, let's do this to increase safety.

409
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:40,666
Scott: And he's like, he's like, well, you know, let's maybe not because it's going to damage our wallet, our engagement, whatever other metric was more important than safety.

410
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:41,209
Rym: Oh my God.

411
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:51,489
Rym: That other article we're not even going to talk about around the algorithms driving engagement and the objectively proven harm those algorithms cause specifically and primarily.

412
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:57,108
Scott: I don't understand who thought the algorithm, like, I don't understand when they started with the algorithm business.

413
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:57,530
Scott: Right.

414
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,458
Scott: It was like, just put everything.

415
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:02,995
Scott: everyone just wants every, if I follow someone, I'm friends with them.

416
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:07,456
Scott: I want to see everything that they post in chronological reverse chronological order.

417
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:07,858
Scott: That's it.

418
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,263
Scott: That's all anyone ever wanted.

419
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:10,006
Scott: Right.

420
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:15,365
Scott: The algorithms have never solved anything for anyone other than the companies, the users.

421
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:16,870
Scott: There's no user.

422
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,165
Scott: I think that finds any benefit from any algorithm managing their feet.

423
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,976
Scott: The algorithm has been invented as of today.

424
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,687
Rym: The algorithms don't exist to make anyone's experience better.

425
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,920
Rym: The algorithms exist to drive people to engage with the platform.

426
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,623
Rym: Regardless of how they engage with the platform into clicking on it more and typing on it more full stop.

427
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:40,053
Scott: Also, just on the most basic level, right?

428
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:44,292
Scott: Let's say you do do reverse chronological order and you only see things from people you follow.

429
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,558
Scott: And that's it when you know.

430
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:49,579
Scott: what happens is the same thing that happens to me on Twitter, because that's what I see on Twitter.

431
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:54,038
Scott: I see reverse chronological order when I see people I follow and I don't see any ads.

432
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:55,443
Scott: because I don't, I don't see ads.

433
00:32:55,503 --> 00:33:02,384
Scott: So, uh, what happens to me is I scroll and then I hit the end, the end, and then I'm done.

434
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:07,847
Scott: And then I close that shit and I don't come back to it for quite a while because it's not filling up that fast.

435
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:09,092
Rym: I read the whole Twitter.

436
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,000
Rym: Like I pointedly don't file.

437
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,481
Rym: If I ever get to the point where I'm not reading my entire Twitter feed, I start unfollowing people.

438
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:15,024
Scott: Yeah.

439
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:17,375
Scott: There's no, there's no doom scrolling because it ends.

440
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:20,588
Scott: But if I open up Instagram, which I do rarely, right?

441
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:23,157
Scott: You scroll, you scroll, right?

442
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:27,553
Scott: And it's like, you're seeing some things from people you follow, not everything.

443
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,969
Scott: And it's not in the, it's not in the same order as last time.

444
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:34,605
Scott: And there's always something new because there's something they've held back that you haven't seen.

445
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:35,710
Scott: Right.

446
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,533
Scott: There's always more.

447
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:43,587
Scott: And then if you really go to the end and they've got nothing left to show you, they just start showing you stuff from people you don't even fucking follow.

448
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,375
Scott: There's ad, all kinds of stuff in there.

449
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:46,460
Scott: Like you can scroll forever.

450
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,066
Scott: And it's like, uh, that's a problem.

451
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:50,049
Rym: Yep.

452
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:56,106
Rym: But uh, yeah, Facebook is objectively harmful to society to the point that we should destroy it.

453
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:59,400
Rym: Like the evidence is overwhelming at this point.

454
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,960
Scott: Or at least take it and, you know, turn the algorithm off and enforce all its rules.

455
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,864
Scott: Enforce, enforce rules they don't even have also.

456
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:09,446
Rym: Yep.

457
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,208
Rym: Or also just enforce your fucking rules.

458
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:25,967
Rym: If important it was a lot, not all, not even the majority, but a lot of the harms Facebook causes would disappear instantly.

459
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,915
Scott: They also have that oversight.

460
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:33,678
Scott: They also had that oversight board and some of this stuff was, some of that stuff was hidden from the oversight board.

461
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,120
Scott: Oh yeah.

462
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,320
Rym: It's like the oversight board was hobbled to an extreme degree to the point that they could be in it.

463
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,489
Rym: Kind of like when New York had the ethics board.

464
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,043
Rym: that, uh, was basically directed by the people who were violating the ethics the most.

465
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:45,987
Scott: Right.

466
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:51,259
Rym: Um, but anyway, things of the day.

467
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:53,022
Rym: So, uh, check this out.

468
00:34:53,623 --> 00:35:03,651
Rym: I did not think I would ever talk about a new doom mod in my life, unless I made one myself.

469
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:08,025
Scott: If you said there might be a new doom mod one day we're talking about, I'd say, yeah, that makes sense.

470
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:12,287
Rym: I just didn't expect to cause it's, uh, it's, it's, uh, it's actually kind of a lost art.

471
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:16,125
Scott: It is, it is extremely, there's definitely a community around making doom mods.

472
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:20,465
Rym: The community is bigger than I thought because after seeing this, I went and dug into the tools they use.

473
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:25,126
Rym: Someone made a modern version of dehacked that doesn't require like the DOS command line to function.

474
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:31,189
Scott: The tools have gotten better, but, uh, yeah, these things all have communities around them that wax and wane.

475
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,153
Rym: Doom modding is the only modding community I actually got actively involved in back when doom was a thing.

476
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:37,300
Rym: Like I made a lot of doom mods.

477
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,325
Rym: I like know that engine inside and out.

478
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:47,828
Rym: And, uh, very recently, in fact, on September 24th, that's, uh, the reason this is coming out.

479
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:51,882
Rym: Like I recommend you wait until December, September 24th and then play it.

480
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:59,703
Rym: There is a doom mod that, and the story of this doom mod is it is called, uh, Thatcher's tech base.

481
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:06,825
Rym: Margaret Thatcher's tormented soul is trying to escape from hell and you have to make sure she fucking stays in hell.

482
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,490
Scott: That is the plot.

483
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:14,391
Rym: It's a full on doom mod with a bunch of maps and a full new soundtrack and all this fun stuff.

484
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:18,024
Rym: And also Margaret Thatcher is an absolute monstrous person.

485
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,297
Rym: We are better as a society that she is no longer around.

486
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,963
Rym: It's a shame that she ever held power.

487
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:42,175
Rym: And I encourage you, if you don't understand the depth of her depravity, to go find that video from a recent anniversary of her death, where, uh, I think it was actually during her, it was during her funeral, some reporter asked the Scottish woman, like, don't you think it's disrespectful to like protest her existence on the day of her funeral?

488
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:46,348
Rym: And the Scottish woman's response is beautiful.

489
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,253
Rym: It is delightful.

490
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,035
Rym: And it is true.

491
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,359
Rym: Fuck Margaret Thatcher.

492
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,703
Rym: And I encourage you to play this mod.

493
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,285
Rym: So what do you got?

494
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:58,932
Scott: Uh, so, you know, I've been watching some factory type videos on YouTube because everyone loves watching factories.

495
00:36:59,013 --> 00:36:59,354
Rym: Oh yeah.

496
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:03,429
Rym: That particle board one was real good, but the plywood one, not the particle board.

497
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:04,633
Scott: Oh yeah.

498
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:05,235
Scott: That one was good.

499
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:08,368
Scott: Uh, so I guess, I guess, yeah, I've been watching them recently.

500
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,319
Scott: So YouTube keeps recommending more, right?

501
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,406
Scott: But uh, there we go.

502
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,015
Scott: There's an algorithm that's doing something.

503
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:14,960
Scott: Get out of here, YouTube.

504
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,310
Scott: Um, this one, it might be one of the best I've seen.

505
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,662
Scott: It is from the lodge cast iron factory, right?

506
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,994
Scott: Everyone, at least most people know lodge cast iron cookware.

507
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:31,849
Rym: Um, it's the only brand I can name off the top of my head.

508
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,480
Scott: Oh, there's, there's Le Creuset and there's Staub.

509
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:37,706
Rym: And I've heard of Le Creuset.

510
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:38,630
Rym: I've never heard of that other one.

511
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:39,796
Scott: Staub.

512
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:40,017
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:45,303
Rym: Anyway, I don't know if mine is larger of mine is unbranded because I got it at that weird outlet store in Atlantic city so long ago.

514
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:46,506
Scott: Who knows?

515
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:57,060
Scott: Anyway, anyway, uh, it's a really fascinating view of the factory because it's not just like most factory videos, just showing you footage of all the parts.

516
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:09,476
Scott: This is like a really detailed walkthrough of every step from literal pile of scrap metal sitting there to, you know, pots and pans being put into boxes.

517
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:10,680
Scott: Like literally every step.

518
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:19,658
Scott: There's a guy walking around, who's the YouTube channel dude, and a person who works at the factory explaining, you know, they're zooming in, they're showing you carefully.

519
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:21,465
Scott: So you can really see how each part works.

520
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:22,932
Scott: They make the molds.

521
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:24,739
Scott: This is the most fascinating part to me.

522
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:29,531
Scott: They make the molds out of sand, right?

523
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:32,620
Scott: They pack the sand so tight into a mold shape.

524
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:35,790
Scott: Then they put the cat, the iron into it, right?

525
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:40,527
Scott: Then the pot or pan comes out, they wash out, and then the sand just collapses.

526
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:46,892
Scott: And then they make a mold out of sand again, repeatedly just reusing the sand until eventually.

527
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:53,997
Rym: Because my hobby is not watching the how factories make stuff videos, but the post-mortem on factory disaster videos that come from the.

528
00:38:55,322 --> 00:39:00,487
Rym: I've learned a lot about that sand process because it's not uncommon in a lot of this type of factory work.

529
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:06,880
Scott: The other thing is that, you know, they were really something about this particular video because they're talking to all the people in the factory.

530
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,905
Scott: The people are great.

531
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:10,098
Rym: Like every one of them had a lot of fascinating input.

532
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:13,049
Rym: It's like, I like the guy wearing that really cool Dragon Ball Z shirt.

533
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:18,730
Scott: But the people in this factory were just so happy, right, to like be working there.

534
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:23,129
Scott: I guess that's because, you know, it's a film of the cameras on, right?

535
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:24,919
Scott: So who knows if the working conditions are crappy.

536
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:25,903
Scott: They didn't look crappy to me.

537
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:33,040
Rym: Oh, well, again, because of the videos I watch, this factory looks pretty on top of things compared to the videos I've seen of factories that had incidents.

538
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,121
Scott: But the thing that really stood out to me was how like proud and happy the people were to work there.

539
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:46,184
Scott: Not because of the conditions, but because they're reminded like, hey, I just made this pot or pan, right?

540
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:50,480
Scott: Like someone's going to be making dinner with this in like a week, you know?

541
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:57,343
Rym: It's almost like, getting back to that union conversation, there should be dignity and a living wage in all labor.

542
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:12,424
Scott: So there's a lot of dignity and pride in this labor of making cast iron cookware that you don't see in, you know, a lot of other videos that sort of enhance the experience.

543
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:17,888
Scott: You also feel like you've just learned like enough to work at this place because go into such detail on everything.

544
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:24,230
Scott: It's like, oh man, I could work there, but I wouldn't because still really dangerous, hot melted iron.

545
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:29,749
Rym: But imagine a society where we paid like real, honest wages for this kind of labor.

546
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:32,882
Rym: This wouldn't be a terrible job compared to a lot of other jobs out there.

547
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:33,082
Rym: It

548
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:43,781
Scott: also makes you, the one last thing is it makes you feel good about buying from them because in the video you can see how particular they are about rejecting anything that's like, yeah,

549
00:40:43,802 --> 00:40:49,127
Rym: when they're in front of the scrap thing and you see like a pan just comes down while they're talking and they go look at

550
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:49,228
Scott: it.

551
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:51,843
Scott: And it's like a perfect, looks like a freaking perfectly good pan.

552
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,530
Scott: They're like, nope, something was wrong with that one.

553
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:56,524
Scott: So we sent it back and they just melt it down again.

554
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:57,267
Scott: It's cast iron.

555
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:03,671
Scott: It's like, they'll just keep using the same metal over and over again until, you know, they get a good pan.

556
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,216
Rym: My favorite guy is the guy.

557
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:09,093
Scott: So they're still losing a lot of energy in the melting process, right?

558
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:17,283
Scott: They're not energy, I don't know how energy efficient they are in terms of the furnace, but materials wise, they're not, they're, you know, they're doing their best.

559
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:20,538
Scott: Just keep using the same iron until we get a good pan, right?

560
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,146
Scott: So they're buying as little iron as possible.

561
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,964
Rym: Also, thankfully iron, unlike a lot of other metals as a pretty low working temperature.

562
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:30,324
Rym: So it doesn't use as much energy as you think compared to like aluminum or uranium or something.

563
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:36,525
Rym: But two, my favorite guy is the one who is sitting there burning off the little drip at the end.

564
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:36,846
Scott: Yup.

565
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:38,874
Scott: The drip oil, the oil guy.

566
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:41,465
Scott: Cause they show you the, uh, the seasoning process, right?

567
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:42,268
Scott: That's really good too.

568
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:43,172
Scott: I like the, yeah.

569
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:43,634
Rym: Yeah.

570
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:48,277
Scott: Cause they used to sell them back and then he unseasoned and now they season them before they send them to you.

571
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,845
Scott: And he's like, yeah, this is how he seasoned the pans.

572
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:53,784
Scott: And it's like, aha, if that's how they season them, then I know, I didn't know how I could season them.

573
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:57,464
Rym: If that's how they season them, it ain't gonna work in my like residential oven.

574
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:01,838
Scott: Well, you don't have a conveyor belt, the hook where their pots hanging.

575
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:02,964
Rym: Well, what did they say?

576
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:12,433
Rym: They, they only cure, they only season them for 15 minutes with that oil, but I did, I don't think they said the actual temperature, but the way they talked about it, I think my oven would struggle to be at that temperature.

577
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:15,526
Scott: Oh, I think my oven could reach the temperature.

578
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,694
Scott: It was four or 500 Fahrenheit, something like that.

579
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:17,975
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:21,067
Scott: Anyway, really good factory video, lodge cast iron.

581
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:24,178
Scott: If you need cast iron cookware, I recommend them.

582
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:27,857
Scott: unless you want the enameled kind, then you're going to have to pay a lot more money from someone else.

583
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:28,219
Rym: Yup.

584
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:33,442
Rym: In the meta moment, geek dies book club book, which we are both actively reading the tale of Genji.

585
00:42:33,462 --> 00:42:34,909
Rym: Uh, follow along with us.

586
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:35,712
Rym: We've picked the next book.

587
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:36,737
Scott: I read some yesterday.

588
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:37,701
Rym: I'm going to read a lot.

589
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:42,224
Rym: I'm thinking I'm going to read a lot this weekend because last weekend do a knee issue that I've since resolved.

590
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:43,409
Rym: We didn't do a long bike ride.

591
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,447
Rym: So this weekend I have a two hour train ride in the morning before a bike ride.

592
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:48,251
Rym: That's a lot.

593
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:52,674
Scott: Lodge does have some enameled cast iron, but I've never, usually they're known for their non enameled.

594
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:55,930
Scott: So I don't know if it's any good or not, but it is obviously more money if you get enameled.

595
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,231
Rym: Yeah.

596
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,561
Scott: Uh, otherwise they didn't pay me for this.

597
00:42:58,621 --> 00:42:59,966
Scott: I just recommend them honestly.

598
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:00,447
Rym: Yeah.

599
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,488
Rym: Our, uh, our most recent packs panel from packs, uh, east online 2021 is on YouTube.

600
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:07,191
Rym: You can just watch it.

601
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:11,287
Rym: Uh, I'm working on a couple of panels, like the research that's required for the future.

602
00:43:11,348 --> 00:43:12,452
Rym: So stay tuned.

603
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:13,034
Rym: I don't know.

604
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:16,788
Rym: I doubt we will be at physical conventions in person anytime soon.

605
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:19,096
Rym: Like there is no universe.

606
00:43:19,136 --> 00:43:26,582
Rym: Gen Con is happening right now and hell no, even though there seems to be very little evidence of spread or significant spread.

607
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:29,715
Scott: at least one person went to Otakon and then was sick after.

608
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:34,771
Scott: I don't haven't heard of anyone who was at Connecticut on who was sick after yet.

609
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:38,884
Rym: There's a people posting their negative tests weeks out.

610
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:41,814
Rym: And so far no one said, but again, that's all Anic data.

611
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:43,118
Rym: So why MMB?

612
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,820
Rym: But, uh, two, regardless of anything, the next con is coming up PAX Unplugged seems like one.

613
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,764
Rym: I haven't heard anything yet.

614
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,350
Rym: So who even knows if it'll happen?

615
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:59,564
Rym: Uh, magfest, they did announce all their measures and while I applaud them for requiring vaccinations, I don't trust going to conventions yet.

616
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:02,131
Rym: So I is very unlikely we'll be at magfest.

617
00:44:02,813 --> 00:44:12,047
Rym: And even if somehow things are safe enough for us to go to like a magfest, there is no way the state of Texas will be safe enough to go to a convention in January.

618
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,576
Rym: I can't imagine PAX South happens this year.

619
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:15,660
Rym: Nevermind.

620
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:17,545
Rym: Oh, next year.

621
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:21,056
Scott: I'm not going to Texas, even if COVID like goes away.

622
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:21,277
Rym: Yeah.

623
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:25,209
Scott: The problem has to do a lot of other fixing before I go.

624
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:34,183
Rym: Texas has done so many dangerous and egregious things legally just in the last six months that I can't in good faith travel to that state again for any purpose.

625
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:38,337
Rym: Like it would be unethical for me personally to go to Texas for any reason.

626
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:46,361
Rym: So even if it's somehow safe to go to PAX South, you will very likely not see us there for those reasons.

627
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:56,251
Scott: I would go to PAX South if it moved to a better state or Texas somehow miraculously fixes itself and COVID somehow quote ends.

628
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:56,592
Scott: Right.

629
00:44:56,612 --> 00:45:10,067
Scott: I don't think it'll end like the way smallpox ended, but it'll end in such a way that no masks or any special precautions are needed anywhere in general public society, uh, ends.

630
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:10,528
Scott: Right.

631
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,013
Scott: So yeah, beverages.

632
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:19,969
Rym: We haven't, we've done a food show a while and somehow we've never done this as a topic and it's Thursday and I haven't watched anything non-animated for some time.

633
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:21,496
Rym: So we don't have anything to review.

634
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:25,159
Rym: I guess I should watch some of those movies you've watched just so we could do a review show at some point.

635
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:27,802
Scott: Yeah.

636
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:35,013
Scott: I've watched, I've watched and read a lot of things that you have not watched or read that you could or, and played that you could watch, read or play to get a show.

637
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:45,579
Rym: Uh, try, you know, so I mean, vice versa could be true too, but at least there's a lot of animation that we're both going to watch or have watched that we have a pretty decent backlog of Wednesday shows.

638
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,663
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

639
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:51,198
Rym: Beverages are a broad topic and we're not going to like get in.

640
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:52,725
Rym: We're not, this is not the podcast.

641
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:54,996
Scott: I feel like we did this show already and you deleted it.

642
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:57,645
Scott: or maybe it was a show we did and it failed.

643
00:45:57,665 --> 00:46:03,201
Rym: I looked for the words juice, beverage, bev, drink, alcohol, pop, soda.

644
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,446
Rym: Like I dug around.

645
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,313
Scott: I feel like we did shows on it.

646
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,084
Scott: Like we had to have done, but I guess we somehow haven't.

647
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,451
Scott: or maybe it was a show I do.

648
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:11,878
Scott: We thought we would do and we didn't do.

649
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:16,156
Scott: or we, I don't know what happened, but if we can't find, maybe someone else can find it.

650
00:46:16,196 --> 00:46:16,879
Scott: That's okay.

651
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:18,587
Scott: But yeah, it's fine.

652
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:21,883
Scott: We can't, if we can't find an episode cause room deleted it, then I guess we'll do the episode.

653
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:31,440
Rym: It's a fun topic too, because if you're, if you haven't listened to geek, like if you're, if you're a long hauler who'd been listening to the show for a long time, one thing you know about us is that there are very few liquids Scott will put in his mouth.

654
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:35,652
Rym: And meanwhile, I drink a wide variety of liquids though.

655
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,517
Scott: I will eat most foods.

656
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:42,154
Scott: The only exceptions of foods like this, I don't like all foods, but I like a lot of foods.

657
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:44,322
Scott: I say more than average person.

658
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:47,072
Rym: I've seen you try foods that you know, you don't like.

659
00:46:47,153 --> 00:46:55,213
Scott: just to see like, yeah, like, you know, I don't like lobster and someone had lobster and like, couldn't believe I didn't like lobster while I ate the lobster again and I still didn't like it.

660
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:56,359
Scott: You know, it's like, okay.

661
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:04,979
Scott: Um, sometimes I'll even eat a whole meal if, even if it's not the meal I would choose just cause it's the meal that's there, even though I don't like it, I'll eat it anyway.

662
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:05,642
Scott: Cause I'm an adult.

663
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,445
Scott: So I'll do that.

664
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,256
Scott: You know, not, you know, not have allergy.

665
00:47:09,457 --> 00:47:14,038
Scott: allergy would stop me from eating it, but the only things I won't eat, some allergies won't stop.

666
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:22,483
Rym: Like there's that, there's an article a long time ago, there's a long form podcast and like NPR, this dude, who's definitely allergic to shellfish once a year, he eats a bunch and then just checks himself into the hospital.

667
00:47:23,446 --> 00:47:23,587
Scott: Yeah.

668
00:47:23,627 --> 00:47:27,240
Scott: I think I'm like, we, I think we discussed, I have a tiny apple allergy.

669
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:28,523
Scott: I'm eating apples.

670
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:29,266
Scott: It's apple season.

671
00:47:29,286 --> 00:47:35,548
Rym: I have the, the oral, I have a serious OAS with apples where my throat will swell up a little bit, but apples are also delicious.

672
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:41,389
Scott: So anyway, but, uh, I'll eat almost any food other than unethical things.

673
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:45,888
Scott: Like I won't eat, you know, like a monkey brain or a shark fin or a octopus.

674
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:49,383
Scott: I don't like to eat, you know, Takoyaki is a big deal, but like octopus is too smart.

675
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:50,669
Rym: I can't be, I avoid it.

676
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,376
Rym: I try to minimize pork consumption.

677
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:52,899
Rym: Similarly.

678
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,226
Rym: These are real smart.

679
00:47:56,247 --> 00:48:03,079
Rym: Uh, if you're going to go down that road, just saying, just saying, you opened a door, I can open it a little further, but I'm not claiming I'm not hypocritical.

680
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:09,078
Rym: I'm just saying society, but, uh, I'm not going to drink when it comes to beverages.

681
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:09,459
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:21,794
Scott: When it comes to beverages, there is a very limited range of beverages that I will, let's say the breath of beverages that I will drink is narrow, but the depth is large.

683
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:22,316
Scott: Right.

684
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:29,566
Rym: So it's like, nevermind if we get into the method and manner by which you consume these beverages, which is also a conversation.

685
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:30,369
Scott: Right.

686
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:33,940
Scott: So it's like the only things that I will drink are water.

687
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:35,202
Rym: Right.

688
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:36,728
Rym: Uh, but he won't drink fancy waters.

689
00:48:36,768 --> 00:48:37,813
Rym: Like Scott will avoid.

690
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:44,357
Rym: like mineral water, fizzy water, just regular ass fucking water, tap water, or maybe like filtered water.

691
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:45,864
Rym: is the extent of what Scott felt.

692
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:46,105
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,897
Scott: Like a, you know, a bottled water is fine, but no, right?

694
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:52,295
Scott: No special, I won't eat the, what's the thing of the green bottle, right?

695
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:53,962
Scott: That mineral shit, whatever that is.

696
00:48:53,982 --> 00:48:54,705
Rym: I love that stuff.

697
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:56,030
Scott: Oh, that's awful.

698
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:56,391
Scott: Anyway.

699
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:59,201
Scott: Um, so water is my primary beverage.

700
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:07,781
Scott: I will drink dairy based, uh, beverages, milkshake, milk, uh, mango lassi yogurt type drinks.

701
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:12,738
Scott: Um, I will drink, uh, wait, wait, so what, uh, and juice, right?

702
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:19,860
Scott: Something that is fruit-based, but it has to be, sometimes I'll drink a fruit juice that is not really juice.

703
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,228
Scott: That's corn syrup or sugar.

704
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:25,218
Rym: It's funny because that's something I really won't drink.

705
00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:27,325
Rym: I'll only very, it's very rare.

706
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,038
Scott: Most of the time I demand that it be actual fruit, right?

707
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:35,180
Scott: That I'm drinking and like an, you know, an orange juice where someone squeezed a fucking orange, right?

708
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,935
Scott: And not, you know, a bunch of sugar water and some orange flavor.

709
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:44,380
Rym: And while orange juice is fundamentally just sugar water for reasons that are beyond the scope of the show, I still love it.

710
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:46,869
Rym: And it's good for me because I need galleries.

711
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:50,362
Scott: Well, I mean, I used to drink orange for a lot of my life.

712
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:54,700
Scott: I drank pineapple orange slash orange juice, like every single morning, no matter what.

713
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:56,607
Scott: And sometimes even more than that.

714
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,517
Scott: But lately, like I cut that out years ago.

715
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:06,593
Scott: Now in the morning I drink, you know, uh, fiber because I'm an old man.

716
00:50:06,613 --> 00:50:19,341
Rym: If I am active, like during the summer and there's orange juice in the house, I will drink like, I'm not even joking, like a full pint of orange juice just immediately when I wake up and I'll probably drink another pint of it before lunch.

717
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:20,184
Rym: Yeah.

718
00:50:20,204 --> 00:50:20,565
Scott: I mean like.

719
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:26,568
Scott: I will drink orange juice if it's around, but I don't, I don't buy and always have orange juice like I used to.

720
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:30,161
Scott: It used to be like a mandatory thing to have in the fridge.

721
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:33,575
Scott: Now, extremely rare that I will have the orange juice.

722
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:34,559
Scott: But if it's there, I'll drink it.

723
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:37,609
Rym: Up until now, I'm the opposite.

724
00:50:37,649 --> 00:50:46,637
Rym: Like I would drink almost as a kid, I would drink fucking anything and I drink more soda slash pop than you can possibly imagine.

725
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:47,119
Rym: Like I would.

726
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:47,480
Rym: Right.

727
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,781
Scott: So, right.

728
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,892
Scott: So the, so the inverse right is I don't drink.

729
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:51,614
Scott: Right.

730
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:55,328
Scott: Well, I mean, I guess I'm, oh, I'm not opposed to drinking tea.

731
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:56,814
Scott: I've just never liked it.

732
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,259
Rym: You have an allow list of drinks.

733
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:00,910
Rym: You'll get into your gullet as opposed to a denialist like I have.

734
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:01,392
Rym: Right.

735
00:51:01,673 --> 00:51:02,355
Scott: But I won't drink.

736
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,688
Scott: I haven't found any tea that I like, you know, boiled leaf.

737
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,362
Scott: Even though if I found one that I liked, I would drink it.

738
00:51:09,422 --> 00:51:10,185
Scott: I would be okay with it.

739
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:13,056
Scott: I don't drink coffee of any kind.

740
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,329
Scott: I really don't drink any, any caffeinated beverage period.

741
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:17,393
Scott: I won't drink.

742
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:23,296
Scott: I won't drink any alcoholic beverage and I won't drink any carbonated beverage, which is those things alone.

743
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,742
Scott: That's most beverages that people drink.

744
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:30,584
Rym: So as a kid, like on the opposite side, I like, I liked wine and alcohol even though I was a little kid.

745
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:34,726
Rym: Like I wouldn't get access to it often, but I loved the shit out of it and sought it out just for its flavor.

746
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:36,273
Rym: Not even it's intoxicating.

747
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:41,037
Scott: I mean, I've had wine and every time I had wine, I was like, this is grape juice with poison in it.

748
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:42,063
Scott: I'll just drink grape juice.

749
00:51:42,123 --> 00:51:43,270
Scott: Why would you want to drink this?

750
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,565
Rym: Cause when I drink it, it's like, Ooh, this is good grape juice and good poison.

751
00:51:46,906 --> 00:51:48,891
Rym: Like it just, the poison tastes like poison.

752
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:53,407
Rym: Outside of GeekNights, we have this conversation a lot.

753
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:59,856
Scott: Forgetting about all the other problems of drinking alcohol for a moment that it's, you know, the cause of all societal problems.

754
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:00,378
Rym: Forget all that.

755
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:04,790
Rym: I specifically enjoy the flavor of alcohol.

756
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:07,518
Scott: I do not enjoy the flavor of alcohol.

757
00:52:07,618 --> 00:52:10,309
Scott: It tastes like I'm drinking something from the science lab.

758
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:10,771
Scott: It's awful.

759
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:11,052
Rym: Yup.

760
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:18,277
Rym: Like I'll drink a non-alcoholic beer because I like the things in beer, but an alcoholic beer tastes different.

761
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:19,541
Rym: And I like that taste.

762
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:22,726
Rym: I would drink alcohol if it had zero intoxicating effects.

763
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:41,670
Rym: So, but as a kid, I would drink soda, as I say now, cause I've lived in New York for like 15 years, but a day, like literally zero exaggeration, six to eight cans of mostly Dr.

764
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:49,171
Rym: Pepper and a little bit of Coca-Cola, some Mountain Dew sometimes, a squirt, jolts, all that nonsense.

765
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:53,903
Rym: Like I just drink so much soda that it was shocking as a kid.

766
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:57,095
Scott: I mean, when I was young, I obviously understood that soda existed.

767
00:52:57,496 --> 00:53:00,749
Scott: It was hard to not know that when you watch TV in the nineties.

768
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:01,070
Rym: Right.

769
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,271
Rym: Yup.

770
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:08,436
Scott: Um, so I was aware of the existence of Coke and Pepsi, but it was, you know, years into my life before I just ever had any.

771
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:13,943
Scott: Um, and there would be occasions where it would be annoying that, you know, I'd be like at a party or something.

772
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:15,672
Scott: And that was the only beverage that they had.

773
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:16,255
Scott: Yeah.

774
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:18,344
Scott: And I wouldn't drink it, but I did try it.

775
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:24,707
Scott: at one point when I was young, I had like a can of Pepsi or something and I tried, I was like, Oh, okay.

776
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:35,345
Scott: I can't just say it was like, I, you know, I tried it and I tried it maybe a couple of times after that, you know, you know, different Coke or whatever, and it tasted.

777
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:40,016
Scott: it's even, I'd rather drink it like beer than drink soda carbonated.

778
00:53:42,461 --> 00:53:42,682
Scott: Yeah.

779
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:45,373
Scott: So the car, so that's the two had two bad things.

780
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:46,699
Scott: Number one, it tasted like shit.

781
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,978
Scott: And like, I understand it, look at the bottle and it says, this is mostly corn syrup.

782
00:53:51,058 --> 00:53:53,629
Scott: And I'm like, why doesn't this taste like delicious candy?

783
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,436
Scott: It doesn't, it tastes awful.

784
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:55,818
Scott: Right.

785
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:57,824
Scott: And then two, the carbonation just hurts.

786
00:53:57,884 --> 00:54:03,266
Scott: I'm like, I like in theory, you, I imagine the carbonation as being refreshing.

787
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,253
Scott: That's what the commercials tell me.

788
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:06,257
Rym: That is my experience.

789
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:07,020
Rym: It is object.

790
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,242
Scott: It makes sense.

791
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:09,386
Scott: I imagine bubble.

792
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:13,600
Scott: I imagine bubbles in my throat tingling and that imagination.

793
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:15,807
Scott: I imagine refreshment.

794
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:22,152
Scott: Like I, my throat wants bubbles, but if I actually tried to drink the bubbles into my throat, I only feel pain.

795
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:24,744
Scott: And I'm like, that was not what I was expecting.

796
00:54:24,764 --> 00:54:25,849
Scott: This is not good.

797
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,276
Scott: Why didn't you do what you're supposed to do?

798
00:54:27,317 --> 00:54:28,040
Scott: Get the fuck out of here.

799
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,848
Rym: But see, that's what I always find so fascinating.

800
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,203
Rym: It is literally a refreshing feeling to me.

801
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:33,946
Rym: I seek it out.

802
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:37,440
Rym: I'll drink carbonated, unflavored water, just soda water.

803
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:46,949
Scott: I mean, if, if I, if I felt the refreshment that I imagine I would feel, I would also drink and prefer carbonated water to regular water.

804
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:53,010
Scott: So one thing I'm curious about, I've attempted to drink sparkling beverages of various kinds over many years.

805
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:57,726
Scott: Not once have I felt the, the feeling that I believe I'm supposed to feel.

806
00:54:57,746 --> 00:54:59,331
Scott: I only feel pain.

807
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:04,328
Scott: Like, you know, I guess it's not as bad as if I drank a Drano, we'll say like diluted Drano.

808
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:09,005
Scott: Like, like there is some burning sensation in my esophagus and it's not good.

809
00:55:09,086 --> 00:55:17,077
Rym: So what I'm curious, the thing I'm curious about is one carbonation also imparts a flavor because of the acidic nature of carbon dioxide.

810
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:17,940
Rym: Like it actually does.

811
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,792
Scott: Well, I wouldn't know that, but okay.

812
00:55:20,993 --> 00:55:27,211
Rym: So it makes a flavor, but two, you can nitrogenate beverages instead of carbonating them.

813
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:32,668
Rym: Those bubbles are smaller and less like fizz fizzy.

814
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,709
Rym: And I wonder if you would have a different or the same experience if you tried a nitrogenated beverage.

815
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:41,123
Scott: I have never attempted to drink a nitrogenated beverage.

816
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:48,605
Rym: Nitrogenated beverages also don't impart a, nitrogenization does not impart a flavor on the beverage.

817
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:49,970
Rym: Whereas carbonation does.

818
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,074
Rym: Right.

819
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:53,704
Scott: Well, I mean, I've never noticed the flavor on the carbonated one.

820
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:55,691
Scott: So get me a nitrogenated beverage.

821
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:56,113
Scott: I'll try it.

822
00:55:56,133 --> 00:56:02,100
Rym: The problem is as long as it's not, you know, there are really only two classes of beverages that get nitrogenated.

823
00:56:02,782 --> 00:56:06,522
Rym: There's really only two, you know what you just said, there's only two kinds of beverages that they nitrogenate.

824
00:56:07,023 --> 00:56:08,968
Rym: Number one is coffee.

825
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:10,833
Rym: And number two is beer.

826
00:56:11,675 --> 00:56:14,484
Scott: Well, so, and I can't think they're canceled on other merits.

827
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:16,936
Rym: Now we could manually nitrogenate orange juice.

828
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:19,907
Rym: Like I could, I could get some equipment and make that happen.

829
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:20,610
Rym: It's not that hard.

830
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:22,157
Scott: No, that's all.

831
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:24,826
Scott: If you're so dedicated to that, I really don't care.

832
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:26,371
Scott: I'm open to it.

833
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:28,719
Rym: I'm like 1% dedicated right now.

834
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:29,502
Rym: So the odds are pretty low.

835
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:31,431
Scott: I do not care enough to go seek it out.

836
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:33,560
Scott: I'm just open to the possibility.

837
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:39,382
Rym: Oh, a listener is like asking about what about nitrogenation because the stream is delayed from the chat.

838
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:40,789
Rym: So they don't realize we just talked about it.

839
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,854
Scott: So, uh, I never, I actually never heard of nitrogenation before just now, although it makes perfect sense.

840
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:52,260
Scott: So all that aside, uh, I've heard of liquid nitrogen nitrogen involved, but for to make cold beverages.

841
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:00,684
Rym: I literally drank over a thousand calories of soda a day from like fourth grade until like well into while I was at RIT.

842
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:13,444
Rym: But at RIT, partly because I was busy and I didn't have access to like my bike and a lot of the exercise I used to do when I was living like in high school with no responsibilities, uh, we can only play DDR so often.

843
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:16,672
Rym: I didn't need as many calories.

844
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:28,833
Rym: So I basically lost all desire to drink soda while I was at RIT because the main reason I drink soda prior to that was because of all those calories I needed and use those calories.

845
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:29,456
Rym: Like I'm skinny.

846
00:57:29,497 --> 00:57:30,180
Rym: I'm still skinny.

847
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:43,240
Rym: So, uh, once I didn't drink soda much, what I discovered when I tried it again after like not really having it for a year and a half is that it tasted like shit to me like absolute shit.

848
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,326
Scott: But you also drink Red Bull instead.

849
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:46,732
Scott: I won't drink.

850
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,560
Rym: I think Red Bull is absolutely delicious.

851
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,085
Rym: I love energy drinks.

852
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,313
Scott: I won't drink any weird energy drink either.

853
00:57:52,494 --> 00:57:59,157
Rym: So I will drink Red Bull as an energy drink, but I will not drink Monster and all those other things.

854
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:01,365
Rym: The difference being one, they taste different.

855
00:58:01,426 --> 00:58:03,394
Rym: Like Red Bull tastes good to me.

856
00:58:03,474 --> 00:58:04,920
Rym: Like that flavor profile is good.

857
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,421
Rym: But I also still like, well, I don't like pop soda, like the pop culture soda that normal people drink.

858
00:58:10,923 --> 00:58:15,960
Rym: I do like like proper old colas that are taste more medicinal and weird and aren't as sweet.

859
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:22,482
Rym: But Monster and all the energy drinks that a lot of people drink, they're just like concentrated Mountain Dew.

860
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:27,584
Rym: Like they're the same high fructose corn syrup, just more concentrated with a bunch of fake vitamin crap in them.

861
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:34,009
Rym: Red Bull at least has a radically different flavor profile because it's not high fructose corn syrup.

862
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:34,953
Scott: I tried Red Bull once.

863
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:35,636
Scott: It tastes like shit.

864
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:36,119
Scott: I didn't drink it.

865
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,271
Scott: But I wouldn't drink it anyway.

866
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:41,375
Rym: It might taste like shit.

867
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:43,141
Rym: I actually just was drinking one right now.

868
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:46,171
Rym: I've got it here just as a no surprise.

869
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:47,195
Rym: Finish that off.

870
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,062
Rym: One, Red Bull's not that many calories.

871
00:58:49,102 --> 00:58:55,886
Rym: And two, it tastes radically different from other energy drinks, even though I respect that you might not like either.

872
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,854
Rym: It does taste very different.

873
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,560
Rym: So Monster tastes like garbage to me.

874
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,260
Scott: Even if it tasted good and I liked it, its energy nature would make me not drink it.

875
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,125
Rym: Ah, but it's energy nature.

876
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:05,759
Scott: I would need like the no energy version.

877
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,646
Rym: But the thing is, I need that energy.

878
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:18,612
Rym: Part of my life as I've just, especially during the quarantine, it got to the point to where I have fundamentally changed my relationship with food and calories by the nature of how much I work out and do exercise.

879
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:25,682
Rym: I struggle to get enough calories into my body in a day, partly because you know what food I can't eat, which is on the scope for this show?

880
00:59:26,324 --> 00:59:33,788
Rym: Most food that bodybuilders and athletes eat to keep their calories up, I often find that food flavorless or disgusting.

881
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:39,147
Rym: So trying to get the five-ish thousand calories I need a day in the summer.

882
00:59:39,428 --> 00:59:41,900
Scott: Like those people that eat like 10 chicken breasts or whatever.

883
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:42,803
Rym: I can't do that.

884
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:43,867
Rym: My stomach's not big enough.

885
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,014
Rym: And also that's just bland food.

886
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:54,691
Rym: Making fresh food and the kind of food I like and the kind of food that we eat just in our day-to-day lives, the sheer amount of it I'd have to eat is too much.

887
00:59:54,992 --> 01:00:00,154
Rym: So I supplement that with a lot of energy drinks, a lot of sugar, a lot of cookies, a lot of snacks.

888
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:03,085
Rym: I have a whole thing I got to do just to get to my minimum calorie targets.

889
01:00:03,526 --> 01:00:05,011
Rym: So I drink a lot of energy drinks.

890
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:09,425
Rym: I also eat energy goo when I run, even though it's just disgusting.

891
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:10,992
Rym: But it's a tool.

892
01:00:11,032 --> 01:00:11,554
Scott: I don't do that.

893
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:12,578
Rym: It is a tool.

894
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,848
Rym: It is not something I drink or eat for enjoyment.

895
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,222
Rym: I would not eat or drink those things if I did not have a specific need.

896
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:24,399
Rym: But anyway, that aside, I also very much enjoy the flavor of cocktails.

897
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:34,336
Rym: Like cocktails are some of my favorite beverages on earth to the point that I seek out non-alcoholic cocktails to scratch that itch because I don't always want to be drinking alcohol.

898
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:43,867
Rym: Even if I crave the flavor of, say, a Negroni or an Old Fashioned, I do not necessarily want the intoxicating component of that flavor profile.

899
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:52,136
Rym: But it is almost impossible to get that flavor profile without alcohol because the flavor of alcohol literally causes some aspects of those profiles.

900
01:00:52,598 --> 01:00:54,647
Rym: So there's a lot of mixology I'm deep into.

901
01:00:54,727 --> 01:01:00,209
Rym: that's a little too much to talk about in this show, but suffice it to say, that's a big part of my beverage life.

902
01:01:01,152 --> 01:01:07,130
Scott: I do respect and actually have a lot of appreciation for the whole cocktail science.

903
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:11,002
Rym: It's real easy to make a real shitty cocktail and it's real hard to make a good one.

904
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:13,511
Rym: And the simpler a cocktail is, the harder it is to make.

905
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:13,792
Rym: well.

906
01:01:14,655 --> 01:01:30,568
Scott: Right, but not only is there the art of figuring out a good combination of liquids and other ingredients to create a beverage that otherwise does not exist as a single ingredient, like the juice of a fruit or water from a water source, right?

907
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:39,637
Scott: It's also, you can tell, right, that cocktail people are doing extra stuff or doing stuff in a particular way because it's fun.

908
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,525
Scott: And I agree, it looks way fun, right?

909
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:47,410
Scott: Like shaking up, shaking up something in a weird shaker, making an ice cube that happens to be smooth just because.

910
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:51,628
Rym: Don't even get me started on my weird ice cubes, we've talked about that before.

911
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:54,260
Scott: Using a funky looking glass just to make it look cool.

912
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,112
Scott: It's like, you know, I respect that as a visual art, right?

913
01:01:58,272 --> 01:02:01,362
Scott: And as an activity, as a hobby, right?

914
01:02:01,422 --> 01:02:02,365
Scott: It's totally awesome.

915
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:08,124
Scott: It's just that even, you know, limiting to only the non-alcoholic beverages, right?

916
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:20,169
Scott: There has basically been, I've tried, you know, there's been quite a few times, not recently, where I've gone into like a bar, there's like a party at a bar I can't avoid or whatever, a company holiday party or something, right?

917
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:25,569
Scott: And, you know, the bartender agrees to make a non-alcoholic thing, right?

918
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:30,289
Scott: And they mix up all whatever stuff I'm willing to drink, and it doesn't taste good.

919
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,240
Rym: Well, because I've realized something just in this conversation.

920
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,188
Scott: I'm like, you have orange juice, you have water.

921
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:35,998
Scott: I'm like, that's what I'll take from you.

922
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,646
Scott: You don't have anything good back there.

923
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:46,380
Rym: You universally do not seem to like beverages that are savory or that are not in some way sweet or completely neutral.

924
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:53,907
Rym: Like you like the flavor of orange juice, but I don't think you'd like the flavor of just orange without the sugar.

925
01:02:54,972 --> 01:03:03,222
Scott: Well, no, I drink, I have actually trained, you know, most of my not drinking orange juice has been replaced by just eating fucking oranges instead.

926
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,731
Rym: Ah, but those are also extremely sweet.

927
01:03:05,831 --> 01:03:10,428
Rym: I'm saying you have to remove the sugar and like just eat orange zest.

928
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:12,897
Scott: Orange zest is delicious.

929
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:13,438
Scott: What are you talking about?

930
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:14,905
Scott: I put it in like cookies and stuff all the time.

931
01:03:14,945 --> 01:03:20,489
Rym: Yeah, but just eat it like, okay, because that's how you make good non-alcoholic cocktail is those kinds of flavor profiles.

932
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:21,533
Rym: Citrus flavors are awesome.

933
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:24,564
Rym: There's a brand.

934
01:03:24,785 --> 01:03:36,814
Rym: Now, this is not an ad like don't even think that this is, but Seedlip, they basically, it's a company that makes botanicals to use to make cocktails that are not alcoholic and that are designed to be able to make good cocktails.

935
01:03:37,195 --> 01:03:39,764
Rym: Like, for example, one of them, you know what's in it?

936
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:49,891
Rym: It's basically just like water with some orange peel, lemon peel, lemongrass and ginger, but zero sweetener of any kind.

937
01:03:50,513 --> 01:03:57,880
Rym: And you use like teaspoons or tablespoons of that mixed with other beverages to together make a flavor profile that would be good to drink.

938
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,570
Rym: I'm really curious if you would like a Seedlip.

939
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,922
Scott: It's like a little slightly fancy, you know, I mean, like.

940
01:04:02,962 --> 01:04:05,616
Scott: I really like it when you get like a cucumber water, right?

941
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:09,672
Scott: It's like, I obviously would prefer like a, you know, a lemonade, right?

942
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:13,628
Scott: But, you know, if you just put a slice of lemon in a water, it's like, that's not bad.

943
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:16,942
Scott: You know, you know, cucumber water at the hotel, that's good.

944
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:18,488
Scott: Celery water, I like a celery water.

945
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:19,311
Rym: I don't like the tomato drink.

946
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:26,173
Rym: That's too, you know, I'm not a fan of V8 is just tomato soup in a different can.

947
01:04:26,213 --> 01:04:26,614
Rym: It's the same.

948
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:40,625
Scott: And while I enjoy dairy based things and, you know, fruit based things, even like celery cucumber, when they get like those, like the smoothies, like, you know, your Jamba Juice type action where you got like lettuce in there and shit.

949
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:41,648
Scott: I can't drink that.

950
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:42,651
Scott: I can't do right.

951
01:04:42,752 --> 01:04:49,158
Scott: So part of what's going on there is that even carrot, like I love carrots in carrot cake, carrot juice is too much.

952
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:50,504
Scott: I can't drink a carrot smoothie.

953
01:04:50,544 --> 01:04:51,187
Scott: It says too much.

954
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:59,764
Rym: So with cocktails, the conventional wisdom is generally the simpler, older cocktails are just better because there's a reason they've persisted so long and it's harder to fuck them up.

955
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:06,228
Rym: Really complex cocktails, 90% of the time are garbage designed by someone who has no idea what they're doing.

956
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:14,764
Rym: So a complex cocktail that's good is relatively rare and a place that can make a complex cocktail that actually tastes good and doesn't just look fancy.

957
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:22,977
Rym: That is like, that's like when we go to a restaurant and they have a pastry chef with a name as opposed to cheesecake and chocolate cake on the menu.

958
01:05:22,998 --> 01:05:25,788
Rym: Like that's one of those, like the opposite of a red flag.

959
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,976
Scott: But I mean, it makes, it makes sense.

960
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:29,743
Scott: A cocktail is at its heart, right?

961
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:34,102
Scott: You're mixing some beverages together or ingredients together that will still be liquid.

962
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:34,463
Scott: Right.

963
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:36,930
Rym: And can be just whiskey is not a cocktail.

964
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:37,612
Rym: That's whiskey.

965
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:38,876
Scott: Exactly.

966
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:46,102
Scott: But if you mix things, it's like, it's really hard to, you know, any flavor is going to overpower another flavor.

967
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:49,676
Scott: It's like you had a glass of fucking, you know, it's like lemonade.

968
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:53,451
Scott: It's like, all right, you can add a lemongrass might do a little bit to it.

969
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:53,732
Scott: Right.

970
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:58,053
Scott: But it's like, it's like, you're either going to overpower the lemon with too much other shit.

971
01:05:58,093 --> 01:06:01,089
Scott: And like, you're not going to taste that hint of mint you tossed in there.

972
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:06,250
Scott: If you got too much other crap in there, it's only a limit to go in or like, or even just the craft of it.

973
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:10,444
Rym: and like balancing everything in old fashioned with one is sugar cube in.

974
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:11,808
Rym: it tastes fantastic.

975
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,418
Rym: One and a half sugar cubes tastes like sweet garbage.

976
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,809
Rym: less than a one sugar cube tastes like just poison.

977
01:06:19,853 --> 01:06:28,144
Scott: One thing I have seen people do that obviously I haven't partaken of is they'll make like these layered drinks by making sure that the ingredients are like densities.

978
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,129
Rym: Those are good to drink.

979
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:42,710
Scott: But what I, I am my, my imagination is that, you know, if, you know, you're basically, you're just putting three beverages or however many in the same glass and you're drinking one after the other.

980
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:42,830
Scott: Right.

981
01:06:43,915 --> 01:06:47,949
Scott: So that at least of, you know, you get some fanciness to it, right.

982
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,079
Scott: And the flavors won't overpower each other.

983
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:52,285
Scott: Cause they're not actually mixing.

984
01:06:52,305 --> 01:06:56,967
Scott: You're just, it would be the same as if you had three separate glasses and drink one, then the next one, then the next one.

985
01:06:57,007 --> 01:06:57,168
Scott: Yeah.

986
01:06:57,248 --> 01:06:58,453
Rym: So it's actually worse than that.

987
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:02,551
Rym: So I actually applied to be a bartender at that bowling alley.

988
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:09,201
Rym: that later got the DDR machine at RIT, you know, cause I know a lot about cocktails and I always have, and I like cocktails and I can make them well.

989
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:15,545
Rym: And they asked me like in the interview, they asked me some questions and they asked me what a puss cafe was.

990
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:16,691
Rym: Cause I didn't know about them.

991
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:18,420
Rym: That's what that kind of drink is called.

992
01:07:19,062 --> 01:07:21,228
Rym: They're literally designed for show.

993
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:36,653
Rym: And generally imagine if someone very, if someone orders one, it is one of those red flags at a bar where the person ordering it is telling the bar tender that they are a piece of shit.

994
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:43,378
Rym: who doesn't understand the labor of a bartender and is trying to impress some third party with their knowledge of cocktails.

995
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:49,303
Rym: It basically is telling the bartender charge this fool, a lot of money for something that's going to taste like garbage.

996
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:50,527
Scott: Yes.

997
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:55,103
Rym: But two, they're primarily used by bartenders to show off themselves.

998
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:58,254
Rym: So a bartender will sometimes offer to make one for fun.

999
01:07:58,735 --> 01:08:00,301
Rym: Like if they got some free time or like.

1000
01:08:00,321 --> 01:08:04,737
Rym: there's a lot of reasons someone to make one, but they never taste good.

1001
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:17,075
Rym: It is impossible to make them taste good or at least so challenging that it's, you know, but like most of them are designed to be very striking visually or craft wise as opposed to, to be drunk.

1002
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:22,310
Rym: But a lot of times they involve flame and other like weird, like fun.

1003
01:08:22,813 --> 01:08:36,515
Rym: And once you get into that kind of beverage, like the beverages that use liquid nitrogen, if made properly, flaming beverages like that are on fire when you drink them, kind of, but imagine if it was still on fire.

1004
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:41,028
Rym: or beverages that literally have liquid nitrogen in them.

1005
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,542
Rym: It is possible to make those so that they can be drunk safely.

1006
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,871
Scott: However, if you fuck up, you hurt people.

1007
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,836
Rym: If you fuck up, you can kill people.

1008
01:08:51,358 --> 01:09:01,893
Rym: So of course you never drink a beverage that involves an alcoholic beverages that involves flame because alcohol flames, if they're still burning are often invisible.

1009
01:09:02,194 --> 01:09:03,037
Rym: You cannot see them.

1010
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,187
Rym: You will burn yourself before you realize it.

1011
01:09:05,469 --> 01:09:08,142
Rym: And the liquid nitrogen drinks can just fucking kill you and it'll be too late.

1012
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:09,868
Rym: You'll drink it and you're dead.

1013
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,015
Rym: And bartenders fuck these up a lot.

1014
01:09:12,157 --> 01:09:14,604
Rym: No ethical bartender will make that shit for you.

1015
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:19,002
Scott: That that's the only make it like the bartending competition or whatever.

1016
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:32,189
Rym: But non-alcoholic keg tails get even more complicated because one thing I've noticed having cooked a lot of vegan food over the last couple of years is that to make food that involves any meat is almost like easy mode cooking.

1017
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:37,749
Rym: It's kind of hard to fuck up most meat and it's really easy to salvage meat if you don't cook it that great.

1018
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:39,916
Rym: And meat can just save a dish.

1019
01:09:40,438 --> 01:09:47,523
Rym: If you can't lean on meat and you're working solely from vegetables and things, it's harder to make a really good flavor profile.

1020
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:48,587
Rym: You're doing a lot more.

1021
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:50,274
Rym: like it takes a little more skill.

1022
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,665
Rym: Cocktails are kind of the same way.

1023
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:56,360
Rym: Alcoholic cocktails lean heavily on the history of cocktails and on alcohol.

1024
01:09:56,921 --> 01:10:02,077
Rym: So it is actually a difficult skill to design a non-alcoholic cocktail that's good.

1025
01:10:02,438 --> 01:10:06,699
Rym: Most bars have half-assed bullshit non-alcoholic cocktails because they don't make any money off of them.

1026
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,658
Rym: So if you find a bar that has good non-alcoholic cocktails, that is like an S rank bar.

1027
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:15,927
Rym: Their alcohol cocktails will blow you away.

1028
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:17,413
Rym: And they're also very rare.

1029
01:10:18,116 --> 01:10:19,542
Scott: So the show's getting a little long I think.

1030
01:10:19,602 --> 01:10:20,044
Scott: I'm hungry.

1031
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:21,952
Rym: You want to cover one last glass of drinks?

1032
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:25,326
Scott: No let's do like best beverages right?

1033
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,350
Scott: So best beverage.

1034
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:27,917
Rym: Like do you want to do it by class?

1035
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:28,580
Rym: By weight class?

1036
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:31,005
Scott: Eh just whatever.

1037
01:10:31,045 --> 01:10:31,627
Rym: Top five?

1038
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:32,109
Rym: I don't know.

1039
01:10:32,129 --> 01:10:35,720
Rym: My number one is still slightly cool tap water.

1040
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,785
Rym: Like that is the number one beverage for me on earth.

1041
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:46,974
Scott: The best possible water would be water directly from an actual natural spring.

1042
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:48,660
Rym: I've drunk that on many occasions in my life.

1043
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,024
Scott: That is cold as fuck.

1044
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:52,733
Rym: Okay okay if we're going down that route I agree with you.

1045
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:57,030
Rym: That is my favorite drink on this earth.

1046
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:59,200
Rym: Not just my favorite water but my favorite drink.

1047
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,106
Rym: There is something pretty high up there.

1048
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:11,482
Rym: There's something that feels so magical about drinking water like from the ground in the wild knowing confidently that it is safe to drink and just tasting it.

1049
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:14,934
Rym: Like what a. uh it's hard to get past that.

1050
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,663
Scott: It's even better than New York tap water somehow.

1051
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:18,246
Scott: I don't know how.

1052
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:28,040
Rym: My favorite all right cocktail like my one of my favorite beverage is honestly an old-fashioned cocktail of just very well-crafted old-fashioned cocktail.

1053
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,415
Rym: Other than the fact that it would kill me if I did this I would just drink them all day.

1054
01:11:31,758 --> 01:11:36,995
Rym: I don't because I the physics and biology limit how many of those I can drink.

1055
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:38,741
Rym: So I don't drink them that often.

1056
01:11:39,284 --> 01:11:43,059
Rym: but a proper old-fashioned is one of my favorite things on earth to put in my mouth.

1057
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,221
Scott: Not yet.

1058
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,228
Scott: uh you know don't drink alcohol kids.

1059
01:11:47,192 --> 01:11:48,095
Scott: It causes cancer.

1060
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:48,999
Scott: no joke all right.

1061
01:11:50,042 --> 01:12:05,142
Scott: Uh I guess also an amazing beverage that I will also would order much more often if a more places made it properly and b it cost less and c was healthier to drink is a milkshake of some variety.

1062
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:06,125
Rym: I'll just see right.

1063
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:09,256
Rym: I with my calorie needs milkshakes and ice cream.

1064
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:10,903
Rym: uh we'll just talk about the beverages.

1065
01:12:11,846 --> 01:12:17,228
Rym: I will drink milkshakes all the time just to get to my calorie and protein needs for a day and I can correct.

1066
01:12:17,408 --> 01:12:26,720
Scott: a properly made milkshake will be made with you know obviously high quality ice cream high quality milk but in a tall metal glass with the mixing machine.

1067
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,121
Rym: You better give me that fucking metal thing so I can fill my glass after I drink the first half of the milkshake.

1068
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:34,815
Scott: Exactly if they just give you a cup it's like you got screwed.

1069
01:12:35,057 --> 01:12:37,187
Scott: they were supposed to give you the tall metal thing.

1070
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,719
Scott: then you pour it into a glass and it stays in it right.

1071
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:44,462
Rym: Remember that scene in Pulp Fiction where the guy's like wait that milkshake is that expensive and it's alcoholic?

1072
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:49,377
Rym: yeah a good milkshake will cost as much as an alcoholic beverage and be that good.

1073
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:57,323
Scott: Yeah it'll be like seven dollars or plus to get a milkshake usually and also the milkshake if it's flavored which often it is.

1074
01:12:57,344 --> 01:13:03,460
Scott: it should only be flavored with a real vanilla right extract.

1075
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,471
Scott: none of that fake vanilla flavoring syrups or any kind of bullshit like that.

1076
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:14,795
Scott: b real fruits of some kind actual strawberries actual banana slices something like that right d some.

1077
01:13:14,976 --> 01:13:17,763
Scott: if it's chocolate it has to be fox's.

1078
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,227
Scott: you bet chocolate syrup?

1079
01:13:19,547 --> 01:13:21,693
Scott: no hershey's bullshit right.

1080
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:27,388
Scott: and if you want to do cookies and cream you can't use oreos because Nabisco on strike.

1081
01:13:27,448 --> 01:13:31,139
Scott: so wait until they're not and then Oreos in there.

1082
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:33,765
Rym: So you're talking about that.

1083
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:41,195
Rym: that's like that's A tier A plus tier edging into S tier but for me S tier not just the mango lassi which is one of my favorite beverages.

1084
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:53,662
Rym: mango lassi's S tier but you gotta sometimes they don't make it as good oh no but uh even a shitty mango lassi's S tier the secret tier above S because this is traditionally only for certain kinds of celebrations.

1085
01:13:54,103 --> 01:14:03,106
Scott: the rose lassi holy fucking shit if you know that's that's edging into the tea territory where like you're eating like flowers.

1086
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:07,319
Rym: basically rose lassi's are so so good.

1087
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,508
Rym: caveat i love the flavor of rose.

1088
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:11,116
Rym: anyway i'm like homer hiding the bathroom.

1089
01:14:11,136 --> 01:14:12,060
Scott: you just love eating flowers.

1090
01:14:12,201 --> 01:14:15,676
Rym: in general flowers are delicious and roses are particularly delicious.

1091
01:14:15,757 --> 01:14:16,440
Rym: i will just eat them.

1092
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,705
Scott: candy flowers are for looking at.

1093
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:21,399
Scott: never had a candy rose but i've eaten plenty of flowers.

1094
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:22,282
Scott: they never tasted good.

1095
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:25,733
Rym: uh i i make a lot of cocktails with violet and lavender extracts.

1096
01:14:27,177 --> 01:14:32,232
Rym: yeah i know in terms of juices it's uh it's tough because orange juice is like my standby.

1097
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:41,804
Rym: but my actual favorite juice might have to be if you can get it mango juice but that kind of edges into being a smoothie depending on how you get it.

1098
01:14:42,467 --> 01:14:45,782
Scott: and sometimes when you get it it's actually nectar and it's like got a lot of.

1099
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:49,135
Scott: you know it's not just squeezed mango which i like nectars a lot.

1100
01:14:49,437 --> 01:14:52,948
Scott: but uh apple cider is the king right you can't beat apple cider.

1101
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:57,922
Rym: um so in america apple cider is not alcoholic right.

1102
01:14:57,942 --> 01:14:59,971
Scott: so we had i guess we had to cover this right.

1103
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:07,803
Rym: so this cider which obviously i'm not drinking because it's alcoholic if it's uh thin and yellow you got juice there fella if it's taking.

1104
01:15:07,843 --> 01:15:14,748
Scott: in the united states there's a thing that we call apple cider which is literally just pressed apples into a into a jug.

1105
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:18,843
Scott: um and you know it's all brown and has sort of so good it's floating in it.

1106
01:15:19,124 --> 01:15:22,581
Scott: i think a lot of other places on earth call that apple juice because that's what it is.

1107
01:15:22,642 --> 01:15:23,546
Scott: it's a juiced apple.

1108
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:26,137
Rym: and when they say apple cider they mean for men.

1109
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:30,572
Rym: they basically mean apple beer not really but they mean alcoholic apple juice.

1110
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:35,210
Scott: right then there's a third thing that is called apple juice in the united states.

1111
01:15:35,471 --> 01:15:41,871
Scott: that is basically apple cider that has been filtered and may be concentrated and watered down again.

1112
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,421
Scott: it depends but it's like a clear yellowish thing.

1113
01:15:45,763 --> 01:15:48,773
Scott: it doesn't taste bad although it's i don't like it brand you get.

1114
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:49,375
Rym: i liked it.

1115
01:15:49,456 --> 01:15:56,860
Scott: some are it's always worse than apple cider slash right um but there are some brands that are better than others.

1116
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:03,622
Scott: i used to drink it a fuck ton but now i basically don't drink it rarely if ever i don't drink apple juice at all.

1117
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:05,307
Rym: as a kid there's a stop.

1118
01:16:05,949 --> 01:16:14,782
Rym: when i was young i loved apple juice and over the course of a week at one point in my young childhood i drank so much apple juice that it made me moderately seriously ill.

1119
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:27,392
Rym: but uh i uh apple cider and the year the the british definition i prefer to american apple cider because i do like that bite of the alcohol in it.

1120
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:34,258
Rym: and the further extreme of that is something called apple jack which i think is almost exclusively american.

1121
01:16:34,318 --> 01:16:38,274
Scott: that's like that's like apple vodka so the way apple jack used to be made.

1122
01:16:38,335 --> 01:16:41,627
Rym: they don't make it this way anymore because it's moderately dangerous to make it this way.

1123
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:44,236
Rym: yeah apple cider take it.

1124
01:16:44,256 --> 01:16:48,860
Rym: now you take apple cider and you do something called uh freeze just different terms for it like freeze jacking.

1125
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:54,499
Rym: you just freeze the barrel turn it sideways cut off the ends thought freeze it again.

1126
01:16:54,579 --> 01:16:57,550
Rym: turn it sideways cut off the ends thought yeah that's smooth.

1127
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:02,069
Rym: that's how you make you know it's actually moderately safe to make it that way.

1128
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:06,125
Scott: compared to using three x's on the side of that barrel that's only two x's.

1129
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:06,747
Rym: do it.

1130
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:10,037
Scott: yeah two two x's because both your eyes will go blind.

1131
01:17:10,077 --> 01:17:15,835
Rym: it was relatively recently legalized to like make legit apple jack in the u.s.

1132
01:17:15,996 --> 01:17:17,440
Rym: there's only a few places that can do it.

1133
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,066
Rym: uh i get it when i can.

1134
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,953
Rym: it's so fucking delicious.

1135
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:21,555
Rym: oh i like it.

1136
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:22,860
Rym: i prefer it to whiskey.

1137
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:24,024
Rym: i'm just gonna be blunt.

1138
01:17:24,947 --> 01:17:26,452
Scott: so i love me a grape juice.

1139
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:32,758
Scott: uh but the best grape juice is basically when you take fancy wine grapes and you just don't make wine you just squeeze them and that's it.

1140
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:41,796
Scott: uh and i there's a few places you can buy it from one that i buy from on occasion and they basically make two different kinds a white kind and a red kind and they're both delicious.

1141
01:17:41,816 --> 01:17:44,868
Scott: uh and i always have some in the in the little cabinet over there.

1142
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:46,674
Scott: yeah that's excellent.

1143
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:47,698
Scott: a plus beverage.

1144
01:17:47,879 --> 01:17:50,108
Rym: in terms of hot beverages i really like the.

1145
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:50,750
Rym: i like coffee.

1146
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:51,212
Rym: i do.

1147
01:17:51,273 --> 01:17:53,904
Rym: i really like tea especially matcha like proper like.

1148
01:17:54,064 --> 01:17:57,880
