00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,163
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday June 5th 2013.

Rym: We're gonna review from the new world Shinsekai Ori.

5
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:21,932
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:29,260
Emily: So we're doing kind of the same thing we did with the wolf children reviews that Scott just doesn't watch anime anymore.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,849
Emily: I guess yeah, you don't read comics right?

8
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,197
Rym: I have rice boy somewhere.

9
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:34,819
Rym: Did you move it?

10
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,013
Rym: That's the one for my mom.

11
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:40,427
Rym: oh Because Scott suggested that I should read it.

12
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,330
Rym: so you can.

13
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:42,976
Emily: you can read it on the web.

14
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,408
Emily: like it's a webcomic It's all free on the internet.

15
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,780
Rym: I'll take that book and read it so we can do the show Like all of Evan's stuff is so amazing.

16
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,331
Rym: Well, yeah Scott I had jury duty today and Scott did.

17
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:55,692
Rym: he was.

18
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,080
Rym: he hinted that maybe he wanted to bail on the show.

19
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:01,269
Rym: Yeah, and I was busy and it was nice out.

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:01,751
Rym: So whatever.

21
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:03,599
Emily: It was national running day today.

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,251
Emily: So Yeah, so, I don't know.

23
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:09,340
Emily: so I'm sitting here and I feel it all good.

24
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:24,591
Emily: I was like I have such a hard time Getting started when it comes to exercising and I always have like it's like my mom would always be like Emily go to track Practice and I'd be like no I'm tired And then it would be like go to track practice and I'd be like, yeah And then I come home and be like that

25
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,134
Rym: was the best

26
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:25,638
Emily: thing ever.

27
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,371
Emily: So yeah, that's kind of how I feel about jogging.

28
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,380
Emily: And so luckily I have a exercise part.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,343
Rym: Everyone's like me.

30
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:35,251
Rym: Yeah, I'm just gonna go run like all morning.

31
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:45,238
Rym: See it's an acquired taste though, cuz you used to hate The worst until I lived in the mountains by myself and I ran out of sheer anger.

32
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:48,039
Emily: Yeah He's just like no one's around.

33
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:56,160
Emily: Wow this see this is what we need to do to make people not fat.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,260
Emily: We just take away their internet and put them in a room and be like the only way you could get out is to run.

35
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:06,691
Rym: You know, I was gonna say maybe they just masturbate but that would one be some exercise calories.

36
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:10,692
Rym: No internet, so they might not be able to wait.

37
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,740
Emily: who can't masturbate without internet?

38
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:16,853
Rym: I have the impression that a lot of people would have difficulty without the internet.

39
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:17,996
Emily: good imaginations.

40
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:18,819
Emily: I don't know.

41
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:33,158
Rym: So Shinsekai Ori from the new world relatively new show based on a Somewhat I wouldn't say erotic but definitely sexually charged novel.

42
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:44,600
Emily: Well, I started reading the novel and actually the novel is very similar to the show, you know I think a lot of people have the wrong impression about this work because they like the novel.

43
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,649
Emily: It's you you keep calling it a light novel.

44
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:47,613
Emily: It's not a light novel.

45
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,140
Emily: It's like it doesn't have illustrations.

46
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,959
Emily: It's written in the style of you know, much more traditional.

47
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,966
Rym: How many pages is it?

48
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,375
Emily: it's like three volumes of 200 pages each.

49
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:02,810
Emily: I've got the first volume but you know, it's.

50
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:11,760
Emily: it's really weird because You know people see the manga which was made kind of after the show is like this crass cash grab.

51
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,627
Rym: It's like the eska flow Or the brave story.

52
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,135
Rym: manga are awful.

53
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:25,820
Emily: There's so bad Like, you know, we saw brave story and that's another one based on a novel has a pretty good anime adaptation.

54
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:29,116
Emily: Actually, I like the anime of brave story better than I like the book.

55
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:33,390
Rym: the brave story Anime movie is actually one of my favorite animated movies.

56
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,233
Emily: It's really fun.

57
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,637
Emily: And I still have the.

58
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:36,720
Emily: I don't know.

59
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,143
Emily: I went and saw it in the theater when I was an exchange student And so it was like.

60
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:52,412
Emily: I also associate it with a lot of like very nostalgic memories and you know having a really good summer break and stuff like that, but No, the the manga was just really dumb.

61
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,153
Rym: It's porn goog.

62
00:03:53,194 --> 00:04:04,946
Rym: if you do a GIS for the shinsa kiyori manga Yeah, basically see the most ridiculous butts Looking lesbian sex.

63
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:09,259
Emily: Yeah, so part of it is because you know.

64
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:24,115
Emily: taking that into account the book does feature like a very in-depth description of a Future society and this is a society where they kind of explore all these different aspects of it.

65
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:36,119
Emily: And so sexuality you know in regards to culture and actually in in regards to like societal conditioning is a big part of the this world that they're trying to create.

66
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:56,973
Emily: and so there's there's Everybody's basically bisexual in this show, but the relationships they portray in the anime and I'm assuming you know I haven't read too far in the novel are very complex very well fleshed-out complicated relationships and very satisfying to watch.

67
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:58,197
Emily: but I don't know.

68
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:02,013
Emily: I think the The manga they just were like, hey, what do you mean?

69
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:02,796
Emily: Everybody's gay.

70
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,700
Emily: That's awesome.

71
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:10,848
Rym: The further OAVs of El Hazzar Kind of like that delightful.

72
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,978
Rym: the second one step shy of porn.

73
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,914
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but it doesn't have one really good scene.

74
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:22,440
Emily: so, you know, I recently listened to a show.

75
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,897
Emily: I don't remember whether it was the drugs one or whether it was like.

76
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:41,660
Emily: I Forget what show you geek-bited this on but I don't really know how much I can add except that like there's this This show where everyone well certain members of the population suddenly manifest psychic powers.

77
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,140
Rym: Here's the story.

78
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:59,348
Rym: This is like a you're ready to give a full accounting because I know I've invited this before is a show set in the distant distant Future after what can only be described as a psychic apocalypse in the modern era one day x-men powers happen But it's a very basically squishes everyone around.

79
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:10,340
Emily: Yeah, it's it's not easily controllable x-men powers cuz like in in x-men You know, there's a lot of prejudice and everything and actually the mutants are relatively downtrodden despite their powers.

80
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,300
Emily: Well, this is the opposite.

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,062
Emily: These are people.

82
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:18,300
Emily: they can't control their powers and they'll just like lash out and then everyone in a like mild radius is just dead.

83
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,500
Emily: Well, like

84
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:40,363
Rym: I was getting this is basically what Magneto wanted after this apocalypse and you get hints of the Sort of prehistory of the show and the precursor technology and like the old nuclear wars and everything Now society is kind of rebuilt around at least in the place we're looking at a sort of neo Shinto neo Ancient Japan.

85
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:45,776
Emily: I actually really really like the costume design for this show because it's future.

86
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,526
Rym: it like future of Like ancient Japan.

87
00:06:48,587 --> 00:07:01,299
Rym: Yeah theme and style and Aspects of religion brought forward into a modern setting with some technologies very advanced Some of its still like banned or you know, that's ancient precursor technology.

88
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,540
Rym: I'm not allowed to use that kind of electricity.

89
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:12,330
Emily: They have electricity like they have waterwheel that generates electricity and stuff like that But they're not allowed to use it for very many things.

90
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,820
Emily: Like most people don't have access to electricity.

91
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:22,300
Rym: But basically society has rebuilt itself in a way to sort of allow humans who have psychic powers to exist.

92
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:28,431
Rym: So now we have a world where there are small communities of humans Each of whom is basically a bomb.

93
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:38,660
Rym: Yeah, and they have a sort of Subservient race of mole rats who do all of their manual labor and sort of worship them as gods.

94
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,933
Emily: They're like these really really ugly buggers and like the whole time.

95
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,140
Emily: I was just like, oh, they're so creepy.

96
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,751
Emily: And then I realized well, that's kind of the point.

97
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:54,780
Rym: You definitely get the impression that there are other Villages and other societies around Japan and around the world that have done a similar thing.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,685
Emily: Yeah, it just focuses.

99
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:57,187
Rym: you get they.

100
00:07:57,247 --> 00:08:00,296
Rym: you see from a couple of flashbacks later in the show that it's.

101
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:13,180
Rym: it seems like every nation or every culture went back into its past and found Some sort of I don't know means to control the population or like way to organize their lives.

102
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,760
Rym: Yeah able to deal with this great and terrible power that they have.

103
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,907
Emily: I mean really the show is pretty zoomed in.

104
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:22,960
Emily: it really focuses only on that one village and they'll go to like that ring village.

105
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:30,280
Emily: It's like kamisu 66 is the village where they're all from and they'll go to these other villages in the immediate vicinity.

106
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:36,880
Emily: But it basically takes place all within like a few kilometer radius around this one town.

107
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:41,938
Rym: Though you do get a point later in the show where you get a sort of zoomed out view of Japan in the world.

108
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,140
Rym: and what?

109
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,197
Rym: Might be out there and you know old precursor stuff.

110
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:45,700
Rym: I mean Tokyo.

111
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,253
Emily: Yeah, they do go to Tokyo at one point in the show.

112
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:56,730
Emily: You see what Tokyo is and it's basically Just everyone's Subconscious has made Tokyo kind of this nightmarish place.

113
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,800
Rym: What's what's cool is that that's just the world.

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,366
Rym: That's not the show itself.

115
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:15,935
Rym: It's core concede really is that you've got a bunch of kids who grew up in this world and It's a psychic 1984 the they sort of Accidentally discover some information that they shouldn't have a zebra storyteller situation.

116
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,820
Rym: They find this adorable old library.

117
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:19,458
Emily: It's funny too.

118
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:30,356
Emily: Cuz when it like that threw me for a loop because they're they're looking for this creature That they call the false mino shiro and it looks kind of like a sea slug horse thing.

119
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,500
Emily: It's kind of like a pony.

120
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:32,373
Emily: It's very cute.

121
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:32,800
Rym: There's like.

122
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,768
Emily: It's like I'm a library.

123
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:44,464
Emily: I'm branch of Tokyo library and I'm like, whoa It's a library and that makes a lot of sense in in future Episodes.

124
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:47,339
Emily: you're like, oh I see what's going on there.

125
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,847
Rym: but basically they learn all these things like.

126
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:59,693
Rym: they learn that human behavior has been modeled on bonobos and when humans are stressed they will actually feel Sexually charged rather than other kinds of stress.

127
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,320
Emily: So this gets teenagers.

128
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:09,305
Emily: They're like, okay teenagers go make out with your best friend of the same gender and then you won't like Blow up and kill everybody.

129
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:18,874
Rym: but now these five kids because they've learned some of the history of the world Is conscious of it they start to notice these things happening to them.

130
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:31,460
Rym: well second-guessing if Anything anything that they ever want or do is something they truly wanted or something that was conditioned into them or genetically implanted in them and The adults are up to shady bullshit.

131
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,834
Rym: Well, they're and kids disappear and you get all these sinister hints that hurt.

132
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,439
Rym: like the main character her mother.

133
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:42,900
Emily: basically She overhears her previous children.

134
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,380
Emily: Yeah, she overhears her before she manifests her powers because the powers tend to like get stronger and manifest at puberty.

135
00:10:50,905 --> 00:11:01,539
Emily: And so she hears her mother Freaking out because she's a late bloomer and talking to the father like I can't lose another child Kind of that you're like, whoa, she had sisters and she doesn't remember them.

136
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:04,614
Emily: And so that that's kind of a freaky thing.

137
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:05,558
Emily: And so I don't know.

138
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,944
Emily: I think 1984 it's Mean like.

139
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:15,810
Emily: it's all about social conditioning and the use of Propaganda, but it's even deeper than propaganda.

140
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:17,518
Emily: It's not just the way they're raised.

141
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,896
Emily: It's actually Their genes have been modified.

142
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:26,865
Rym: Well, there's also a lot of sort of brave new world of Everyone's just living in this sort of.

143
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:35,344
Emily: we are gods and this is paradise world, but there's a dark side to it Yep, and nobody's conscious of the dark Impression like there's there.

144
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:39,394
Rym: there's the education committee and there's all these committees of adults.

145
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:40,115
Rym: that yeah things.

146
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:43,165
Rym: and the librarians and I mean It's obvious once.

147
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:48,484
Emily: it's the sinister utopia that like once you appear too close It's not actually utopia.

148
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:52,977
Emily: something something really unpleasant is going on behind the scenes now.

149
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:53,840
Rym: We'll spoil in a second.

150
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,248
Emily: But yeah, we'll cross that spoiler line.

151
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:57,271
Rym: The show is great.

152
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:00,020
Rym: I would call it a solid b-plus anime.

153
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:09,257
Rym: It's a little bit above like the scrap princess level But it falls short of the Ava level in terms of message and his production.

154
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:17,969
Rym: and honestly my only complaints really with the show are that the soundtrack is Really repetitive and not terribly know where.

155
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:25,654
Emily: also sometimes it gets a little talky, you know It will be like an entire episode will be like a conversation.

156
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:30,959
Emily: That's something adapted You know, it really would make sense as a novel.

157
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,956
Emily: you Let me tell you the history of the Sam a flash.

158
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:35,819
Rym: words words words words.

159
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,908
Emily: Yeah It's like I'm not a lot of animation.

160
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:42,499
Emily: a lot of people standing around being like, whoa That's what was going on.

161
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:55,420
Rym: Also do that thing and you see this in Hunger Games and books like that where they will Sort of explain their plan to another character because that's how it was narrated in the book.

162
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,280
Rym: Yeah, but really that dialogue didn't need to be there.

163
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:05,860
Emily: Yeah, but you know characters will clarify things to each other and it tends to be a little bit of a wordy show.

164
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,119
Emily: But all in all like already shows.

165
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,606
Emily: Yeah Artistically, it's it's pretty well done.

166
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,411
Emily: The animation is fairly consistent.

167
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:20,433
Emily: one thing it is at points incredibly disturbing Like on a psychological.

168
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,560
Emily: it's also very gory.

169
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:34,510
Emily: It's like you're like a lot of people get killed in this show, which is really juxtaposed with these sort of cute like anime standard characters and Ridiculous costumes.

170
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:42,799
Emily: Yeah But yeah, it's it's got moments that are very like yay But then a lot of moments that are pretty pretty grim.

171
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:49,619
Rym: my only other complaint really about the show other than these basic things the soundtrack being weak is really my primary complaint.

172
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,020
Rym: but it Would be that early in the show we get all these flashbacks to sort of like vignettes of the history of this world.

173
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:09,300
Rym: one of the things the kids find out is that you know human societies after this apocalypse sort of moved in a bunch of different directions and One of those directions was a period of basically emperors and slaves and psychic slavery and all this.

174
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:14,152
Emily: Basically, the Emperor is like I would kill anyone who stops clapping.

175
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,997
Emily: the first hundred kids are like what.

176
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:17,320
Rym: which one were we?

177
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,213
Rym: And it's kind of the smarter kid is like well, isn't it obvious?

178
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,880
Emily: Yeah, we're the psychic people.

179
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,607
Emily: What happened to the normal people?

180
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:25,235
Emily: That's a big plot of the show.

181
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:26,460
Emily: It's like everyone's psychic.

182
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:33,860
Rym: So what happened to the normal people are great and they really put the show in the context that this is a far future.

183
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:40,119
Rym: And if they had kept that up the flashbacks basically stop happening a few episodes in and don't recur.

184
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:48,720
Rym: But had they continued through the whole show you'd have this great parallel Progression of the current plot sort of evolving in time.

185
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:58,220
Rym: But simultaneously if you had the flashbacks becoming closer and closer to present day throughout history through the Dark Age Like I was all this other stuff that happened would have made sense.

186
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,747
Rym: That would have that alone.

187
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,440
Rym: that detail would have made this an a-show if that had been done.

188
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,125
Emily: Well, I would have liked to see stuff like, you know For example the death of shame.

189
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,780
Emily: if a psychic tries to kill another human they basically have a heart attack and die.

190
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:19,053
Emily: It's it's like a thing a feedback mechanism that physically prevents Psychics from just flipping out and killing everyone even though that happens.

191
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:21,040
Emily: Sometimes there'll be rare exceptions.

192
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,480
Emily: They call them Oni like demons who are just psychopaths who can kill without any repercussions.

193
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:36,135
Emily: so But I would have liked to see how that sort of stuff developed, you know They did it all in dialogue and said yeah, this is how they could have shown us.

194
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,960
Rym: Keep doing it chronologically from there.

195
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:50,260
Rym: Why didn't they have the the the weapon of mass destruction precursor technology stuff that comes up near the end of the show?

196
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,628
Rym: Get foreshadowed in one of those flashbacks.

197
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,380
Emily: So do you wanna like step the spoilers?

198
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,040
Rym: We're gonna do a final thoughts as well because we haven't covered much more ground than my geek bite.

199
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:06,771
Rym: Other than that now that I've seen the whole show I am comfortable saying this is a solid b-plus anime.

200
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,660
Rym: if you're an anime fan, you should probably watch this show.

201
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,853
Rym: It's one of the better shows to come out in recent memory.

202
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:21,130
Rym: It's not better than Madoka no, but I can't think of a Very recent show that I think is better than it currently.

203
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,292
Emily: It was weird though.

204
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,515
Emily: It didn't really.

205
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:27,600
Emily: um, I Wasn't moved in the same way.

206
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,996
Emily: I've been moved by shows like Madoka or cowboy bebop or something like that.

207
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:34,648
Emily: Like it didn't affect me Emotionally as much.

208
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:36,680
Emily: it was more interesting on a cerebral level.

209
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:45,370
Emily: but You know, there were sometimes there were scenes where I was like, oh man Oh man, and that's kind of my feeling was just kind of like.

210
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,919
Emily: I feel so I. that's really disturbing.

211
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:57,745
Rym: Yeah, if you look at these other shows like Madoka the characters themselves react to the situations around them Extremely viscerally.

212
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,740
Emily: Well what the whole character the main character?

213
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,859
Rym: Final thoughts we're gonna spoil the fuck out of this show.

214
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,789
Rym: Seriously don't keep listening until you've seen all of Shinsekai Ori.

215
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:19,700
Rym: the main character that we follow is by birth Not affected by this stuff and able to keep a cool head and we see everything through the lens of her.

216
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,453
Emily: I mean, she's empathetic and everything like she cares about her friends.

217
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,926
Emily: She's not like this emotionless sociopathic person.

218
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,846
Rym: height of her emotions in the show to See what covers.

219
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,915
Rym: that's that time Madoka cry.

220
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:33,136
Emily: Yeah.

221
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:34,565
Emily: Well, that's the thing She.

222
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,080
Emily: she recovers from stuff.

223
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,411
Emily: she's very pragmatic and she's like she'll pick herself up.

224
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:45,328
Emily: and part of that also I think has to do with like memory erasure and stuff like that.

225
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:46,672
Emily: like there's this scene.

226
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:47,574
Emily: that's very sad.

227
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:52,055
Emily: when when Shun his name was Shun boy with the mass.

228
00:17:52,136 --> 00:18:02,910
Emily: He he basically has this thing where His power we can assume everyone's On has already seen the show.

229
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,397
Emily: He's he's a karmic demon.

230
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:07,070
Rym: So they're Basically gives up and kills himself.

231
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,039
Rym: Yeah, basically admitting that he loved her.

232
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:20,840
Emily: yeah, so there are ogres and there are karmic demons and ogres are like serial killers and they'll Psychically explode and just like kill anybody who's in their path and they won't die of the death of shame.

233
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:39,339
Emily: But karmic demons actually I think are the more tragic Form of like psychic Like deformity, I guess you'd call it is that somebody's power will start to leak from their subconscious and so they'll start to like mutate everything around them with their mind.

234
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:48,347
Emily: So like the plants and their house and their pets and their family all will get like twisted or die Or it's like their ID kind of takes over.

235
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,938
Emily: but they're still like this normal feeling person.

236
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:55,772
Emily: They're just like Causing they're almost like radioactive people.

237
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,520
Emily: They're like psychically radioactive.

238
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:03,120
Emily: And so one of their very close friends from childhood, he basically this happens to him.

239
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,018
Emily: he's a very powerful psychic, but he can't control it and he dies, you know, he kills himself.

240
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,310
Rym: and Well, I do like.

241
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:12,492
Rym: how?

242
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:23,865
Rym: after that Yeah There's this other just derpy kid hanging out with them and they they all are still kind of zebra storytellers Remember and they're just like yeah derpy kid We're gay.

243
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:26,120
Rym: We don't really want you to be around as we try to solve.

244
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:30,396
Emily: Not you did not talk about Mamoru cuz he was originally was just there.

245
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:31,079
Emily: He's just like.

246
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,715
Emily: yeah We've always been a group of five right and I totally dated you.

247
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:42,560
Emily: and he's like, yeah I dated this other main guy and the other main guys like yeah, I think we dated what's going on with my brain.

248
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,866
Rym: It skips Boring parts and why?

249
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:53,931
Rym: every time the show is about to get into a rut it'll time-skip or Immediately escalate to the next significant plot point.

250
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,376
Rym: So it time skips twice.

251
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:58,968
Emily: figure out their major Pretty quick.

252
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:02,240
Rym: they realize their memories all been edited and you don't have a long drawn-out.

253
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:03,789
Rym: Well, maybe it's not happening.

254
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,820
Rym: Like they all pretty much agree almost right away Like yeah, like something is up with our memories of this event.

255
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:12,320
Rym: But seriously what this show is about is that children?

256
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:20,672
Rym: Often do not understand the seemingly cruel and Arbitrary way that adults in the world manage the world.

257
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,642
Rym: and then they become adults and they realize I mean did.

258
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:29,547
Rym: the more of the show is that everything those adults did is basically Completely justified.

259
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,639
Rym: not all of them that world not all of it.

260
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,390
Emily: She feels really bad about the moats and she knows.

261
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:36,840
Emily: she knows their deal, you know.

262
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,534
Emily: And so I think it's one of those things where children become adults.

263
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:47,220
Emily: and children when they're teenagers They'll fight the adult world and be like, you know, everything's wrong and I'm gonna revolutionize the system.

264
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:57,600
Emily: but once they become adults, they actually kind of are the system and they start to become more like Incremental change like they're not exactly like the generation before them.

265
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,210
Emily: But there's a great scene where in the beginning.

266
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,948
Emily: There's this monster called an impure cat and it's like this huge Hulking.

267
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:07,137
Emily: you can assume everyone's.

268
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:11,120
Emily: yeah You see it's all like shadowy and scary.

269
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:16,360
Emily: Yeah, he's got like little kittens by the end.

270
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:26,020
Emily: You actually see them like for real without any shadows or without any aggression and they're just like hanging out.

271
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,505
Emily: They're just actually kind of cute.

272
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:35,520
Emily: and that I think is interesting because something that was this huge menace Early in the show becomes something that's almost benign.

273
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:40,275
Rym: Normal is set up in the classic trope of these.

274
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:41,340
Rym: people are up to evil.

275
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,363
Emily: There's the mystery in the committee and stuff and at the end she is the head of the ethics committee I remember.

276
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,000
Rym: she say what before shouldn't becomes the karmic demon.

277
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,480
Rym: She say like goes over to him and then freaks out and runs away.

278
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,654
Rym: And yeah with the eggs with the eyes really sinister.

279
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:58,040
Emily: what's going on happening?

280
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:09,356
Rym: but no the retroactive abortions the age of 17 are probably the best way to handle that world and Not killing the people who have these problems is way worse than letting them live.

281
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:13,860
Rym: but the show Makes the point you mentioned of the incremental progress.

282
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:24,580
Rym: Extremely well because Tomiko the sort of the person who saved all of them from extermination and groomed The main character sake to kind of grow into her role.

283
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,889
Rym: They basically had similar experiences.

284
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:29,293
Rym: They both dealt with effectively.

285
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:29,635
Rym: an ogre.

286
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,160
Rym: They both go through all these same things.

287
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:32,764
Rym: She's the protege.

288
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:40,145
Rym: she basically does everything that Tomiko wanted to do with one exception She spares square as life.

289
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,274
Emily: Well, not really he became like.

290
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:45,620
Rym: well spares him the pain of continued life.

291
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,005
Emily: Well continued life.

292
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:50,097
Emily: she let him go for like a year as a suffering lump of meat.

293
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,460
Emily: basically Oh, that's the worst part of the show.

294
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,459
Rym: but she needed her excuse to talk to him alone which he couldn't do right away.

295
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:01,840
Rym: and Then she needed to be alone with him to be able to get away with it.

296
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,400
Emily: How could she like he couldn't understand her by that point?

297
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,884
Emily: He was I don't know.

298
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:11,580
Rym: I just assumed he would have to be able to understand or else the pain is meaningless.

299
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,047
Rym: Oh, it's so fun.

300
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:16,000
Rym: They made a big deal about how much care they put into that.

301
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:23,740
Emily: So fucked up like they torture him infinitely and it's basically the day like regenerate.

302
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,338
Rym: And I like Squealer Because Squealer was smart and canny.

303
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:31,860
Rym: That's the only other complaint I have about the show but not really the show just the story.

304
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:35,171
Rym: They didn't see this shit coming from the beginning.

305
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:40,880
Rym: when Squealer started pulling his bullshit early on Started making concrete and lobotomizing the queen mole rat.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,340
Rym: I mean they eliminated entire colonies of rat people for way less than what Squealer was up to.

307
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,845
Emily: But that's the whole thing.

308
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:55,071
Emily: He's an incredibly sympathetic character and like you see him and he's like this brutal dictator.

309
00:23:56,341 --> 00:24:03,520
Emily: But at the same time a lot of the stuff he does you're like, wow Well, this is fighting for a humanities freedom.

310
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:14,774
Rym: This is a show where the gods are real where the gods of Shinto are real and they're just kind of dicks Because the the mole rats everyone around them even their own children can't.

311
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,660
Rym: their motives are inscrutable.

312
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,159
Rym: Their power is untouchable.

313
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:24,540
Rym: But it seems like people always rebel against that idea of the inscrutable untouchable power.

314
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:29,525
Emily: But I mean it like Story with squealer.

315
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:40,694
Emily: squealer was Prometheus and he even ended up almost identical fate to Prometheus Except that Prometheus didn't get well because I think that was very intentional.

316
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:55,000
Rym: and this is a world where the The gods motivations as humans because we see it from the main from Saki's perspective and these kids perspective the Motivations in the end of the show make perfect sense from that world and from that viewpoint.

317
00:24:55,141 --> 00:25:04,426
Rym: yeah, but from the viewpoint of the rat of the mole people, it's basically just subjugation and callous Laboratory exterminate.

318
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:10,146
Emily: Yeah, it's just like suddenly the gods will be like, oh you stepped out of line whoosh You're all dead, you know, and so it's.

319
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:20,729
Emily: it's basically like punishment from heaven Zeus throwing his thunderbolts down and I think the thing with squealer is I. That's a part where I felt really bad in the show.

320
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,618
Emily: when he was he was defeated and brought in chains.

321
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:33,928
Emily: before that You know before the jury and and the council to be you know to be tried and he says, you know Well, they're like, well, what should we call you?

322
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:40,539
Emily: and he's like we're human and you feel so bad for him at this moment and you feel what he has fought for.

323
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:53,034
Emily: you know even though he is he is like kidnapped babies and brainwashed them and like done all this shitty stuff and killed a whole mess of human like superhumans you.

324
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,920
Emily: He was basically like the savior of the mole rat people.

325
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,551
Emily: He was trying to lead them to freedom and you're like.

326
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:01,399
Emily: you really didn't deserve that maybe.

327
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:11,224
Rym: But I mean in the end the show just has a nice Complex message and it's not the message you expect for a show like this No one expect.

328
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:12,107
Rym: and the what.

329
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:19,073
Rym: I was no bringing down the system because we did this as a geek Book way back or maybe we just reviewed it before we're doing the book club.

330
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:27,260
Rym: I don't remember but the difference engine Yeah, I would say they're very similar works because this show leads up to a big climax.

331
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:32,000
Rym: That is actually just an incremental evolution, but is not in fact a revolution.

332
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:35,259
Rym: No, it's like because that's how the world actually works.

333
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,220
Emily: You kind of wonder like in the beginning are they gonna bring down the system?

334
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,781
Emily: Is it they're?

335
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:44,936
Emily: they're going to expose the false veneer of their utopia and they do they.

336
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,260
Emily: they figure out the utopia.

337
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,258
Emily: But yes what every single adult knows what's going on in this utopia.

338
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:57,400
Rym: It's She let the end when she's like yo, so since there's that ogre here's the map to the weapons of mass destruction.

339
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:05,689
Emily: We know about yeah, which was anthrax, which I thought was I was like, yes that That's why I wanted more flashbacks.

340
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,345
Rym: The fact that the anthrax was in that weird vial Yeah, I was like, what do you deal with?

341
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:10,309
Rym: zero sense?

342
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:17,072
Rym: And also I'm like, okay, so the anthrax Was gonna kill takes a while to kill you.

343
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:19,380
Rym: Yeah, I'll bet it was a modified anthrax.

344
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:29,180
Emily: So it's interesting too because it's like, okay So the death of shame doesn't hit you if you kill somebody with a disease because the disease killed them.

345
00:27:29,802 --> 00:27:31,489
Emily: Where's the line like?

346
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:36,045
Emily: if you feel like you're directly responsible Purely psychological?

347
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:39,017
Emily: remember at the end when I didn't kill him.

348
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:39,319
Rym: I didn't.

349
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:48,551
Rym: yeah She had to talk herself because the the child who has brainwashed beginning the monk that was taking them back to the temple to Basically murder them.

350
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:56,380
Rym: Yeah, he That that minasura turned into an image of a woman in the last second of its death and he had a hard time dealing with.

351
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:06,580
Emily: Yeah, he was all like sweating and he was like, you know heart rate up and basically like they have to talk themselves out of Heart attacks if they feel guilty for someone's death.

352
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:14,705
Rym: There's also that great moment where and it's like visual these main these characters all know this crap and so do all the adults that We as viewers interact with.

353
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:19,760
Rym: but then there's like this normal monk guard near the end like guarding one of the cool guys.

354
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,725
Emily: Yeah, what's his name?

355
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:22,153
Rym: The awesome mole rat?

356
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,625
Rym: Oh Already forgot his name.

357
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,580
Emily: It was like inu maru or something like is like awesome?

358
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,574
Emily: Yeah, it I think he had like inu in his name and he also looked kind of dog-like.

359
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:35,018
Emily: so I forget.

360
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,105
Emily: or kiro Maru that's what it was.

361
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:41,699
Emily: Yep, cuz yako maru was squealer and kiro maru was.

362
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:44,166
Rym: He was a the man.

363
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:50,359
Rym: some reason I thought it was inu maru But him and she say wrote my favorite sort of strong characters.

364
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,434
Emily: He don't matter I felt bad for kiro maru.

365
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:55,740
Rym: Yeah, he did his thing.

366
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:56,664
Emily: Yeah, he was.

367
00:28:56,804 --> 00:29:02,808
Emily: he like sacrifice, but I mean, I don't think the humans Really deserved his sacrifice.

368
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,560
Emily: No, but then again, this is he bartered the life of his colony.

369
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:14,560
Emily: He said I will sacrifice my life if you will save my mother that it's obvious that the normal people the normal adults Don't know everything.

370
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,732
Rym: They just know enough to be able to serve their function.

371
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,240
Rym: and that trial was just a show trial.

372
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:29,220
Rym: but yeah, the adults in the know the committee's just know everything is a great scene where the kids and Everyone else knows the whole deal and this one guard is like what the fuck you talking about?

373
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:37,138
Rym: Oh the monk who is like down guarding To him and the the guards just like they're like something something death of shame and the guys like what what?

374
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,385
Emily: Yeah, and he's all like.

375
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:46,940
Emily: we must keep the mole rat down here because he is filthy and they're like shut up and remove his Chains, you don't know what the heck you're doing kind of thing.

376
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,809
Emily: So that was that was funny.

377
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:50,979
Rym: So yeah, the show is complex dark show.

378
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,420
Rym: But I love the fact that it had that anti-climax that the end was just an evolution of culture.

379
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,064
Rym: It was just one step beyond.

380
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:00,146
Rym: one thing changed.

381
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:01,830
Emily: So would you classify this?

382
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:02,900
Emily: Like?

383
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:05,228
Emily: do you think it's partly a horror anime?

384
00:30:05,248 --> 00:30:06,893
Emily: I don't think so.

385
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,136
Emily: It's feel like horror anime.

386
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:10,122
Rym: I think of it more as Sci-fi.

387
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:17,879
Emily: Yeah, but like there are parts of it where they're like going through the old hospital and it's dark and you're like Oh my god, there's something in there.

388
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,329
Rym: I would definitely not call that.

389
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:29,819
Emily: when the thing is coming in after them in the boat And they can see it's aura and you're like, oh my god the ogres in the boat all of those scenes I would call them suspense and not horror.

390
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:31,378
Emily: What's the difference?

391
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,014
Rym: Suspense can be used in other films or in other things.

392
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,420
Rym: There are suspenseful scenes there.

393
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,608
Rym: there could even be suspense movies, but a horror is The core of the show.

394
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:52,980
Emily: if it's a horror show I thought I thought it's like Suspense is like will the spy get found out with a spy not get found out with a spy?

395
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:54,385
Emily: But this was more like.

396
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:56,352
Emily: I feel horrified.

397
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:58,640
Emily: I feel terrified of this.

398
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:05,040
Rym: I guess I would never call something genre horror unless the horror aspect is the climax.

399
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:06,412
Emily: But it had horror elements.

400
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,375
Emily: Yeah I think they were more suspenseful than but it wasn't a horror show.

401
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:12,860
Emily: It's kind of like a movie.

402
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,820
Emily: I feel like it can have elements of horror without being of the horror genre.

403
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,949
Rym: This might partly be that I've been listening to every single pseudopod for the last several years.

404
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:27,173
Rym: So I've been assuming Ridiculous amount of modern horror fiction.

405
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:28,340
Emily: You're kind of a horror buff.

406
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,360
Rym: Anyway, like you're big into the first big boy book I ever read was The Hobbit and the second big boy book I ever read was Stephen King's skeleton crew.

407
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:37,606
Emily: I'm actually I was.

408
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:40,400
Emily: I don't know why I've been thinking a lot about The Hobbit lately.

409
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,128
Emily: I want that new movie to come out.

410
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,474
Rym: It'll come I want it.

411
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,888
Emily: Oh my god Katsu showed me something really cute like this weekend.

412
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,094
Emily: It was a gender swap Bilbo Baggins.

413
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,338
Emily: She was very cute.

414
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:52,060
Emily: She had hairy feet.

415
00:31:56,324 --> 00:32:02,130
Rym: But yeah Shinseki Ori great show, uh I hope you didn't just spoil everything by listening to this.

416
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,796
Rym: But yeah, I liked it.

417
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:04,800
Rym: I like its message.

418
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:06,367
Rym: I like that.

419
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,920
Rym: It didn't have the typical tropes.

420
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:10,124
Rym: I like that.

421
00:32:10,204 --> 00:32:17,949
Rym: where it ended was such a different place from where it began in terms of like the View or the angle like your perspective on this world.

422
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:24,086
Rym: the world didn't change you change it was by growing up Mind blown.

423
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:29,100
Emily: it was legit hard to predict where the show is going and I wasn't expecting the time skips.

424
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:34,166
Emily: Actually, the first time skipped was spoiled for me because somebody was like, oh my god The show gets super gay.

425
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:34,830
Emily: and I was like what.

426
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:35,896
Emily: and then I watched.

427
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:39,280
Emily: I was like, yep Everybody became a teenager and started making out with you.

428
00:32:39,302 --> 00:32:39,661
Emily: well every

429
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,427
Rym: time a time skit happens the show is

430
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:54,199
Emily: very different very different and the whole plot and and Politics have progressed like, you know in the second time skip they deal with the mole rats more But they're also dealing with this other stuff like the karmic demon stuff.

431
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:58,380
Emily: But in the third time skip the mole rats.

432
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:03,575
Emily: It's like everything is different now and they're like all attacking each other and stuff like.

433
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:04,920
Emily: but there's a war going on.

434
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:15,038
Rym: It's it's a new world only because you see what is basically the same world From an adult perspective and a gnostic perspective instead of from a childlike perspective.

435
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:27,436
Emily: Yeah So I'm probably gonna read at least parts of the book so I'll at least read the first volume which I have and and then I can give you the pros and cons of The book versus the the movies.

436
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:31,610
Rym: but Seriously, don't read the manga the manga.
