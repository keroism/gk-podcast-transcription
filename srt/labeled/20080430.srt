1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,368
Scott: It's Wednesday, April 30th.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,251
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:12,913
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,277
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:20,027
Scott: Tonight, Eska, Blo, Nay, Dun, Dun, Dun, Dun.

6
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:26,920
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,584
Rym: So yesterday we talked a bit about how we had Mario Kart Wii and how we were worried about some things.

8
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:46,605
Rym: And I would just like to point out in case anyone says anything that today, when I got home from work, we started it up and immediately discovered the menu that lets us change everything.

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,513
Rym: So now we now race with no A.I.

10
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:51,022
Rym: and pretty much no catch up items.

11
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:51,484
Scott: Yeah.

12
00:00:51,645 --> 00:01:00,937
Scott: And even though the single player in Mario Kart Wii is pretty much just a practice to build up your skills combined with the unlocking bullshit.

13
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,406
Rym: Everyone said it was annoying rubber band A.I.

14
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,754
Rym: and I'd expected annoying rubber band A.I.

15
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
Rym: I was unprepared for how annoying it was.

16
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:17,882
Scott: It's pretty annoying, but basically the single player exists only to build your skills and to also unlock all the bullshit, which should be unlocked from the beginning.

17
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:20,754
Scott: And the multiplayer is where the real game is at.

18
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:26,360
Scott: And the multiplayer, I must say, is excellent day, as long as you change the rules to turn off the bullshit.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,724
Scott: Mighty fine.

20
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:28,968
Scott: And I beat Rym.

21
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,657
Scott: I was using the wheel and he was using the nunchuck.

22
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,993
Scott: So that's like if I beat him in a foot race wearing a ball and chain.

23
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:39,074
Rym: Well, maybe except for the fact that one, you couldn't beat me in one hundred and fifty CC.

24
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,822
Scott: I don't think the wheel can do a hundred.

25
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:41,525
Scott: Yeah.

26
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,157
Rym: And do I have played the game maybe ten minutes total.

27
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:51,228
Scott: See, beating you with the wheel at one hundred and fifty CC would be like beating you in a foot race wearing a ball and chain uphill.

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,494
Rym: Well, we'll see.

29
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,863
Rym: We'll see, because downhill actually might be an advantage.

30
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:55,626
Scott: It is.

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,389
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

32
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,737
Scott: All right.

33
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,001
Scott: The analogy breaks down.

34
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,302
Scott: All right.

35
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,076
Scott: So you got any other stuff to talk about?

36
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:04,758
Scott: It's Wednesday.

37
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,421
Rym: It's anime day.

38
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,245
Rym: There's as usual.

39
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,371
Rym: There's not like there's that much.

40
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:08,316
Scott: Oh, I was gonna.

41
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,943
Scott: I was gonna watch an anime today.

42
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,780
Rym: Oh, because I've been kind of busting your balls about watching anime.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,278
Rym: So I was being the number one anime podcast in the English speaking world.

44
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,912
Rym: We kind of got to got to get on this and talk about some anime.

45
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:23,999
Scott: So I was going to watch the Kazu No Yojimbo DVD, even though I watched the first four episodes of the show a long time ago.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,643
Rym: You know what?

47
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:25,287
Rym: I thought that, too.

48
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:28,805
Rym: And I was like, all right, I'll just skim through the first DVD and then send it back.

49
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:34,083
Rym: And then the first episode started and I didn't remember any of that.

50
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,232
Scott: I don't remember anything in the show whatsoever.

51
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:40,108
Scott: I remember that it's a story about a stranger comes to town.

52
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,916
Scott: It's that's all I remember.

53
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,880
Rym: It's Fistful of Dollars.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,862
Scott: I don't know if it's well, I know Fistful of Dollars in terms of throwing rock than paper twice.

55
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,794
Rym: I still you know, that's really all you know.

56
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:51,757
Scott: That's all I know.

57
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,565
Rym: God Fistful of Dollars is kind of awesome.

58
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,148
Rym: You should look it up.

59
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:57,384
Rym: But anyway, the other thing is I got to look up.

60
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,088
Rym: I keep forgetting.

61
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:58,550
Scott: Finish it.

62
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,115
Rym: I was saying I kind of suspect that the character designer is the same person from Gundam 00.

63
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:05,457
Scott: Check it.

64
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:09,214
Scott: But anyway, so I was going to watch Kazu no Yojimbo on the train on my laptop.

65
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:09,495
Scott: Right.

66
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,684
Scott: I even brought I remember to bring my optical drive.

67
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,290
Scott: I brought the Netflix DVD.

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,293
Scott: I was all set.

69
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:15,618
Scott: I forgot.

70
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:23,522
Scott: I had recently, though, upgraded to the new Hardy Heron Ubuntu and I had not installed the new DVD playing software.

71
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,827
Rym: Ah, CSS.

72
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,842
Scott: So I couldn't play the DVD and I didn't have an internet connection on the train.

73
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:36,307
Rym: And well, I guess tomorrow, you know, you could have just written some sort of D.C.S.S Oh, yes.

74
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:37,791
Scott: Because I remember the prime number.

75
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:41,261
Scott: You know, it would have been funny.

76
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,366
Rym: What if you'd been wearing the shirt?

77
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,083
Scott: If I was wearing the shirt, then, yes, I could have done it.

78
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,496
Scott: But even though, you know, even writing a D.C.S.S.

79
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,193
Scott: right now, I would have to rip the DVD, run it through the D.C.S.S.

80
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,913
Scott: and then just it would have taken my CPU and laptop not powerful enough to.

81
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:02,069
Scott: you would have taken by the time it was done, I would have been off the train, basically.

82
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:02,552
Rym: Yeah.

83
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:02,773
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:03,719
Rym: But it's fun to think about.

85
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,293
Rym: Plus what if the train got stuck, you know, 41 hours?

86
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:17,165
Rym: Yeah, I got to admit, I'm saddened by the fact that the Internet has made a million kind of parodies of that guy stuck in an elevator video and they're all awful.

87
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:25,147
Rym: I had the pleasure of watching the first 10 seconds of stuck in an elevator for 41 hours with diarrhea.

88
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,029
Rym: Yeah.

89
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,073
Rym: But someone made that whole video.

90
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:33,185
Scott: It's going to be next week.

91
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:37,863
Scott: So between now and next week, I'm going to be watching some animes for a week.

92
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,570
Scott: That should give us some anime shows to do.

93
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,835
Scott: Oh, snap.

94
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:44,694
Rym: Actually, after we watch some more Casa, no, you Jimbo, I think you've got to watch some Boca.

95
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:45,800
Rym: Yeah, I did.

96
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,623
Scott: I watched a bunch of.

97
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:47,407
Scott: I just didn't finish it.

98
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,151
Rym: Got to finish it.

99
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:49,658
Rym: Can't talk about it.

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,388
Scott: I was totally liking that show.

101
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,234
Scott: That's my kind of show.

102
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,310
Rym: Well, if you were liking it from what you'd seen, you'd like it a lot more.

103
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,640
Rym: Pretty much right after you stop watching.

104
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,310
Scott: My only problem with that show is that I have met knowledge that the man that it is that diverges from the manga that I've never read.

105
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:04,913
Scott: You know what?

106
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:05,636
Rym: I'll say this.

107
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:12,067
Rym: The divergence that we'd heard about was that the person doing the anime wondered if they could get away with killing fewer children.

108
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:12,489
Scott: Yeah.

109
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,276
Scott: And I kind of want to read them.

110
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:23,192
Scott: It makes me think, though, that, like, even if the show is great, it makes me really want the manga and think that the manga is better, even though it might not be.

111
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:25,902
Rym: So apparently you're a you're pro children killing.

112
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,710
Scott: I'm pro children dying.

113
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,975
Scott: Children killing robot story.

114
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:43,063
Rym: See, the thing is, if the anime was the kind of lightened, less sad, less hardcore version, I can't imagine what's in that manga.

115
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:43,524
Scott: I know.

116
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:43,825
Scott: Right.

117
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,430
Rym: Good God.

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,807
Rym: I cried like four times throughout the last five episodes of Boca.

119
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:56,167
Rym: Anyway, I started crying at the end of almost every episode because they kill a kid like every episode.

120
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:56,729
Rym: Good God.

121
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,269
Scott: OK, so I'm going to instead of a news because there is no news really.

122
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:01,993
Rym: Yeah, there is.

123
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:05,712
Rym: There's there's news that people are probably screaming about the fact that we haven't talked about.

124
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,782
Rym: Maybe I can do my news quick.

125
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:08,566
Scott: You want to do your news?

126
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:10,153
Rym: I have a lot to say about it.

127
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:14,069
Rym: But at the New York Comic Con, there was one kind of important announcement.

128
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:22,537
Rym: A lot of people were lamenting the fact that in all the anime industry problems, Gurren Lagann, the TV was not.

129
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,015
Rym: it just kind of fell off the license truck and no one had picked it back up.

130
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:30,550
Scott: Well, well, ATV ran into that problem with that company or whatever.

131
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,103
Scott: They lost a bunch of shows and everything was getting weird.

132
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:41,066
Rym: Well, it just so happens that Gurren Lagann has been picked back up really by Bandai Entertainment.

133
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,996
Scott: Oh, see, that's kind of surprising.

134
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,243
Scott: So that definitely see anime companies.

135
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:47,006
Scott: So hush hush.

136
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:47,267
Scott: Right.

137
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:52,967
Scott: But that basically confirms ATV lost the license completely and Bandai bought it.

138
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:59,189
Rym: I'll admit, I'm sure Dave and Joel are going to cry about this and Daryl Surratt and all those people.

139
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,461
Rym: But I have not seen even a second of this show.

140
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:08,344
Rym: And while I've heard a lot about it until now, when I went to the anime news network and I see this picture.

141
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:12,602
Rym: that's obviously from it, I didn't even know what it was about or what it looked like.

142
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,910
Scott: I knew it was a robot show by Gainax, right?

143
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,198
Scott: I just it is.

144
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,965
Scott: It's a Gainax robot show, right?

145
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,713
Rym: It's a robot show by Gainax.

146
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:21,175
Scott: Right.

147
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:30,432
Scott: Because there was that other like clamp robot show that was pretty recent and I was getting the two shows confused because this one's Tenga, Toppen, Gurren Lagann, right?

148
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:30,894
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:31,677
Scott: What was the other one?

150
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:31,958
Scott: I forget.

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,196
Rym: It's weird how we watch so much anime because I didn't watch either one.

152
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,089
Rym: So I don't know how this show slipped under my radar.

153
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,902
Rym: I just kept having other things to watch and other things to do.

154
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,709
Rym: And everyone's saying it's great.

155
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:45,713
Rym: Mm hmm.

156
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,923
Rym: Well, probably watch it at some point.

157
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:49,531
Scott: Yeah, we'll definitely watch at some point.

158
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:55,731
Scott: I just want to point out, though, that that what you lost your train of thought.

159
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,353
Rym: It's gone.

160
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:57,116
Scott: I got it.

161
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:57,417
Scott: OK.

162
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,099
Scott: Bandai Entertainment.

163
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:58,982
Scott: Right.

164
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,027
Scott: Well, a lot.

165
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,679
Scott: You know, Bandai Entertainment, first of all, is not Bandai Visual.

166
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,603
Scott: Bandai Visual sucks.

167
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:04,024
Scott: Right.

168
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:13,118
Scott: But actually, I guess this sort of does hold for Bandai Visual, too, in that many things about Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual do not please me.

169
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:13,820
Scott: Right.

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,695
Scott: But over the history of all anime production in the

171
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:20,116
Scott: U.S.,

172
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,344
Scott: well, not production, but anime distribution in the

173
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:22,866
Scott: U.S.,

174
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,416
Scott: Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual.

175
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:31,054
Scott: for all their failings, they consistently have the best selection of titles.

176
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:36,494
Scott: If you were to pick, you know, if you were to tell me that I could get one free anime series.

177
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:36,855
Scott: Right.

178
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,842
Scott: But I had to pick the U.S.

179
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,916
Scott: distributor and then one of their titles would be given to me for free.

180
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:57,335
Rym: I would pick Bandai Entertainment every time because they're the greatest odds of getting a good show, especially because I remember back in like the late 90s, early 2000s, if you thought of a good anime, you always remember that Bandai logo right before it.

181
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:57,958
Scott: Yep.

182
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:58,379
Scott: Yep.

183
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,323
Scott: That emotion thing.

184
00:08:59,564 --> 00:08:59,825
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:00,648
Rym: All that business.

186
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,190
Rym: Yeah.

187
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,238
Rym: But yeah, that's all I got.

188
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,062
Rym: I haven't seen the show.

189
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:05,411
Rym: I can't say anything about it.

190
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,905
Rym: I guess you should listen to Dave and Joel if you want to hear about that show.

191
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:09,392
Scott: Oh, why can't I find.

192
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:09,774
Scott: All right.

193
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:10,779
Scott: Code Geass was.

194
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,547
Scott: that was the show that I always got.

195
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,455
Rym: I've heard that was pretty bad.

196
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:14,676
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,025
Scott: Code Geass is the new clamp robot show.

198
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:21,360
Scott: And tank of top and girl and Lagan is the guy next robot show.

199
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,564
Scott: And I think I did watch the first episode of Code Geass, even though I completely forget it entirely.

200
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:26,227
Scott: Why?

201
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,815
Scott: I don't know, because it was a new show.

202
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,201
Scott: I watched, you know, the one episode.

203
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:29,884
Rym: Yeah, I guess.

204
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:36,932
Scott: But because I had the shows confused for so long, I think I put off the Lagan thinking it was the other one.

205
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,359
Scott: And now now I've got it sorted out.

206
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,690
Scott: Just now, as I recorded the show, I sorted it out.

207
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:42,593
Rym: Wait a minute.

208
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,045
Rym: So you watch a show that you thought was Lagan, but wasn't.

209
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:52,387
Rym: And then when you saw Lagan, you assumed that it was the show you'd already watched.

210
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,311
Scott: No, that's not true.

211
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:58,388
Scott: What had happened is I saw a show Code Geass, Lelouch de rebellion, right?

212
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,826
Scott: Later, I saw that there was a new robot show called Tank of Top and Girl and Lagan.

213
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:09,005
Scott: And I had thought that I'm like, oh, I seen that show when I hadn't seen it.

214
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:18,861
Scott: I thought that, you know, because the names I got, even though the names aren't similar at all, at all, they're sort of complex, kind of crazy names for robot shows.

215
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,927
Scott: There are too many robot shows.

216
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:21,898
Scott: So I thought they were the same show.

217
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,163
Scott: You know, I was confused.

218
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,934
Scott: But now it's not like great as I'm recording this.

219
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:34,118
Scott: My confusion has been cleared and now I will be swiftly corrected in possibly the in the coming weeks.

220
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,749
Scott: watching of girl and Lagan, at least some episodes.

221
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,412
Rym: All right.

222
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,571
Rym: So obviously, because you were complaining about the lack of news, you don't have a news.

223
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:42,918
Scott: I don't have news.

224
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:43,641
Rym: What do you got?

225
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,427
Scott: I got a geek back.

226
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:46,330
Scott: Geek bite.

227
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,831
Scott: God damn it.

228
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,754
Rym: You're bad at this.

229
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,617
Scott: I'm real bad.

230
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,183
Scott: I got a geek bite.

231
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:50,444
Scott: Right.

232
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:55,064
Scott: So I go and I try to look at what comics I've read recently, you know, try to pick something out there.

233
00:10:55,747 --> 00:11:04,153
Scott: And I was looking and nothing really felt like a like a real strong geek bite candidate until I saw Orion.

234
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,400
Rym: Now, did you read all of Orion?

235
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:08,263
Scott: What is what do you?

236
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:08,584
Scott: what do you?

237
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,089
Scott: what's the definition of read?

238
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:17,254
Rym: Because I'll admit there are certain moments where a shirotasm will kind of overcome me.

239
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:26,768
Rym: Oh, and I'll realize that I've been flipping pages for like five pages, looking at pictures in the back, glossing over words in the back of the book.

240
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:31,228
Scott: There's a dictionary and author's notes, which would probably be very helpful if I read it.

241
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,172
Scott: But I did not read that.

242
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:32,734
Rym: Wait.

243
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:41,587
Rym: So he at least he made a dictionary and author's notes, not like the other Ghost in the Shell manga, where the ramblings were just kind of all over the pages.

244
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,630
Scott: Right.

245
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,585
Scott: So Masamune, Shiro, Shiro Masamune, the guy who did Ghost in the Shell.

246
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:48,128
Scott: Right.

247
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:51,140
Scott: That guy, the guy sort of famous manga guy.

248
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:51,561
Scott: Right.

249
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,649
Scott: This is one of his manga.

250
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,837
Scott: It's all in one book from Dark Horse.

251
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,002
Scott: It's eighteen dollars.

252
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:58,548
Scott: I didn't pay eighteen dollars, thankfully.

253
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,259
Scott: And I got to say this about Shiro.

254
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,142
Scott: Right.

255
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,888
Rym: He is Shirotastic.

256
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,613
Scott: Well, Ghost in the Shell is awesome.

257
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:06,556
Scott: Super awesome.

258
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:06,917
Scott: Right.

259
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,552
Scott: And for some reason, I keep buying all of his other works.

260
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:11,676
Scott: I buy the Appleseed.

261
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,123
Scott: I buy the Tank Police.

262
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,609
Scott: I buy the Orion.

263
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,955
Rym: Tank Police is awesome.

264
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,718
Scott: Tank Police is awesome.

265
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:17,863
Rym: Appleseed pretty hot.

266
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:18,224
Rym: Right.

267
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,308
Scott: Appleseed is OK.

268
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,999
Rym: Well, the Appleseed movie was really good.

269
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:22,240
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,024
Scott: And I buy all his manga.

271
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:31,448
Scott: Thing is, most of his manga are kind of just crazy and don't make sense and aren't really that.

272
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,559
Rym: No, no, we're not talking on the Trigun level.

273
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:34,542
Rym: It's no Naito.

274
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:38,756
Scott: No, it's definitely not on the Trigun level of not making.

275
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,329
Rym: I mean, there's I guess there's two kinds of not making sense in a manga.

276
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,901
Rym: There's the Naito Trigun of you flip pages and wonder if pages were missing and can't tell what characters are involved in a scene.

277
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:57,891
Rym: And then there's the Shiro where there'll be a picture of a tank and this vomit of words around the tank on the page.

278
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:04,426
Rym: And some of the words are talking about how we didn't draw the blah, blah, blah on the tank because he didn't think it would look good, but he knows they have to be there.

279
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:15,869
Rym: And then the rest of it is complaining about, like some military political issue in Japan in the future, but not in the future of the manga you're reading, just at some other year.

280
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,399
Rym: And it has nothing to do with the comic at all.

281
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:23,013
Scott: Yeah, so Orion, basically the deal with Orion is this.

282
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:29,140
Scott: I'm going to, instead of, you know, Shiro usually likes to go off about science and technology and all that.

283
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,325
Scott: Yeah, or military stuff, right?

284
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,851
Scott: Or something like that, right?

285
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:46,058
Scott: In Orion, he basically makes up this universe where it's all like supernatural fantasy of gods and demons and snakes and monsters and...

286
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,705
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,159
Rym: Gods, demons, monsters.

288
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,138
Scott: Evil witches and magic and...

289
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Rym: Okay, gods, demons, monsters, evil witches, magic, snakes.

290
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,958
Scott: Yeah, snakes.

291
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Rym: Snakes aren't that special in and of themselves.

292
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,252
Scott: Well, no, I think they're big, magical sort of dragons.

293
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:06,000
Scott: They keep talking about like nagas and things and, you know, this sort of crazy stuff.

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
Rym: Not just, I picture like a wizard and a dragon and a Godzilla and then a snake.

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,541
Scott: No, this is a semi-Watchmen spoiler, but there are scenes reminiscent of the ending of Watchmen in here.

296
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:24,802
Scott: But yeah, it's basically, it's just really fucked up and he can't tell what's going on.

297
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:28,876
Scott: It's like he's just making up like this fantasy shit as he goes along.

298
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:40,557
Scott: And there's a few cute parts, I guess, where like someone gets randomly, like this one scene where you see the girl talking to like these cute aliens, they're sort of octopus-ish, right?

299
00:14:41,099 --> 00:15:18,792
Scott: And the next scene, like she turns someone into one of the cute aliens and it's like hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.

300
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,472
Scott: and you know it's like a kingdom or something.

301
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:37,875
Scott: and then like this demon guy comes out and there's gonna be some sort of apocalypse or something.

302
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,317
Scott: maybe.

303
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:43,379
Scott: and you know there people are trying to like set up these crazy magic spells.

304
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:52,243
Scott: they're gonna make good or bad things happen or like all the evil in the world or all the good in the world is gonna come spilling in or out in some direction or something.

305
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:56,856
Scott: and there's all kinds of made-up words all over the place.

306
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:01,294
Rym: and now is this proper noun gobbledygook or just shirotasm.

307
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:04,265
Scott: okay you ready I'm gonna read I'm gonna read some.

308
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,352
Scott: some random speech bubbles you ready.

309
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,081
Scott: okay naga system I'm ready.

310
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,032
Scott: once you activate I'll fry you with an octo trigram.

311
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:14,762
Rym: that makes perfect sense.

312
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:25,586
Scott: it's an aqua loco type with a twisted hydro element an incredibly powerful Vajra naga force on this planet in 64 harmonics it'll reach threshold that everything will disintegrate.

313
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,198
Rym: all right I I feel really bad.

314
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,424
Rym: now you want to know why.

315
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,919
Rym: when I read ghost in the shell he would say it's the same.

316
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,524
Rym: it's like jabberwocky where you all the all the structure makes sense but the words don't mean anything.

317
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:47,890
Rym: but in ghost in the shell when you read some of those words you think your brain says oh that was some sciency technical thing and I understand it and you know what.

318
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:52,212
Rym: your brain just lying to you because it makes no more sense than what that just sounded like.

319
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,302
Rym: that just used more fake words.

320
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,430
Scott: okay I'm gonna read four bubbles.

321
00:16:56,792 --> 00:17:03,025
Scott: it's a dialogue between two characters character a then character B then character a then character B again right and that's all.

322
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,696
Scott: that's how I'm gonna end this little geek bite.

323
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,906
Scott: okay ready character a baby.

324
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,532
Scott: he's a deep demon guy who was summoned.

325
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:14,824
Scott: perhaps in another 200 Sykes or so we'll see a sorcerer's shell created that can truly discriminate between good and evil.

326
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:26,815
Scott: character B. and when that time comes human spirits filled with good shall become deities ape spirits shall assume human form and human spirits tainted with bad karma shall remain human asterisk.

327
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,972
Scott: there is a Buddha nature for each level of the soul.

328
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:33,453
Scott: there are infinite levels of the soul and infinite numbers of corresponding Buddha natures.

329
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:37,656
Scott: the spiritual hierarchy further subdivides the levels existing between apes men and gods.

330
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,047
Scott: the physical body is only a manifestation of the spirit.

331
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,185
Scott: character a again the human form is not the human soul.

332
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,055
Scott: its eyes merely see what is transient.

333
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:52,866
Scott: its ears do not hear the voice of the true spirit its words do not state the truth and its mind is ruled by karma.

334
00:17:53,708 --> 00:18:01,201
Scott: character B if psychoscience can weaken the barriers to the physical form words in mind it may become a legitimate method of reaching the truth.

335
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:06,879
Scott: it's just a bunch of made-up talk that's really complicated.

336
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,782
Scott: it makes no sense.

337
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:12,454
Scott: and I'm picking random pages people random pages.

338
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,184
Scott: I did not prepare this at all.

339
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:21,412
Scott: I opened the book and flipped around looking for speech bubbles with lots of words and they were not hard to find.

340
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:24,725
Scott: don't buy this unless you really hate yourself.

341
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,837
Rym: you could have a contest and give it to someone.

342
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:27,802
Scott: no I want to keep us.

343
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:29,068
Scott: I have the whole shiro collection.

344
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,802
Rym: what are you gonna do with that?

345
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,770
Scott: give the whole thing to somebody.

346
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:45,335
Rym: Wow on the condition it's kind of like those clauses in some sort of Don Knotts movie where you can have the mansion in the fortune if you spend the night in the haunted house.

347
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,021
Rym: good one you can have Shiro's manga.

348
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:59,817
Rym: if you read it it's getting down.

349
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,981
Rym: oh god it's things of the day.

350
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:11,126
Rym: I'm sure many of you have seen this but I'm also sure just judging from conversations I've had with our listeners in the past that many of you are not familiar with this.

351
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:15,889
Rym: now you're an anime con today and there's always the kind of fan parodies.

352
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,218
Scott: well actually a lot of anime cons don't have them.

353
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,747
Scott: it's sort of you know it was.

354
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:27,947
Scott: it was a lot more popular I think like a few years ago like one or two and it's sort of spayed it a little bit you know but it was pretty big for a time.

355
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:40,162
Rym: well I guess the really big cons always have them in some capacity and even though actually a lot of the kinds of things that used to be fan parodies are now just in anime music videos straight up or kind of put into that realm.

356
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:44,139
Rym: but yeah a long time ago I think it was called like otaku.

357
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,546
Rym: this is otaku to them or something.

358
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,392
Scott: yes that was it.

359
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,282
Scott: I was gonna ask what the name of that thing was.

360
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:52,541
Scott: we rented it from the anime club library and VHS and watch it as a group.

361
00:19:52,922 --> 00:20:09,302
Rym: yeah this was one of the earlier known to American fans fanfare is one of them more widely distributed early fan pair we were able to get our hands on because in like 2000 2001 times yeah but most people hadn't seen anything like that before.

362
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,613
Rym: and then this kind of made the rounds.

363
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,368
Rym: and then there was this surge for a couple years of everyone going.

364
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:15,475
Rym: oh my god fan parody.

365
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,246
Scott: I remember we watched this is otaku them.

366
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,394
Scott: it's like a group and it would.

367
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,722
Scott: for some reason it was hilarious.

368
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:26,005
Rym: it was utterly hilarious but in reality look I watched it again a couple years ago lame.

369
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,450
Scott: so so lame.

370
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:33,432
Rym: I wanted to have because I've seen in my life a grand total of three fan parodies.

371
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:34,998
Scott: I've seen one and a half.

372
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,670
Rym: this is otaku them which is you know what it is.

373
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,700
Rym: it kind of started it funny to watch in a group if you're not into anime enough to know a lot about it and you're not.

374
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:54,854
Scott: because remember if you're sort of like a young naive punk kid with a bunch of naive punk kid friends like a high school anime club or freshman in a college anime club this will freaking knock your socks off.

375
00:20:54,914 --> 00:21:01,662
Rym: but remember this is from an era before YouTube back when anime hell and things like that worked a lot better.

376
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:06,220
Rym: nowadays you've seen things like this already times a thousand yep.

377
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:12,848
Rym: but the other two that I've seen and that made a big splash back in the day were Nescaflowne.

378
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:13,751
Scott: I didn't see that one.

379
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,140
Rym: it's not online I can't find it easily.

380
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,017
Rym: I didn't look for a torrent or anything but they kind of screen it at.

381
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,783
Scott: cons is anything like Nescafe.

382
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:33,129
Rym: no Alan anyway I wanted to have a link to that because I wanted to make that my thing of the day since we're talking about tenku no escaflowne tonight but couldn't find it.

383
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:37,601
Rym: so I went with the third the classic redeaf.

384
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:45,859
Scott: ah redeaf now perhaps the most widely famed of the the fan parodies.

385
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,660
Rym: now this is another one of those things where if you saw redeaf at a convention a long time ago and have fond memories of it don't watch my thing of the day.

386
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:55,905
Rym: all you're gonna do is go.

387
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:58,113
Rym: wow that was stupid.

388
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,426
Rym: wow that wasn't funny at all except for the gendo part.

389
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,858
Scott: yeah pretty much the only good part is the.

390
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:13,560
Rym: it's getting down but I don't know there was something about watching this with a whole group of people at a convention and the fact that it was so poorly done.

391
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,330
Rym: I mean the voice acting is super bad.

392
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:17,622
Rym: half the time you can't even tell what people are saying.

393
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,152
Rym: misato is called in.

394
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:26,252
Rym: they phoned in the role as in literally the woman playing misato called them and they recorded it.

395
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:30,788
Rym: yep it's it's just it's awful in every regard.

396
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,947
Rym: but at the same time this is a piece of anime history and I think it's an anime.

397
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:39,641
Scott: it's a US anime fandom history not not anime history.

398
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:46,987
Scott: anime history would be like you know Miyazaki's notebook you know I think it's a piece of anime history.

399
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:47,710
Rym: this is kind of.

400
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:50,922
Rym: this is what was spawned in America.

401
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,045
Rym: this is the result.

402
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,493
Rym: Japan this is what you caused.

403
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,704
Rym: okay it's it's actually kind of funny.

404
00:22:57,745 --> 00:23:05,320
Rym: there is the nice one bit at the end that I actually really like where they kind of point out the stupidity of the end of the show Escaflowne.

405
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,702
Rym: but they're like.

406
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:07,711
Scott: so you mean Evangelion.

407
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:09,520
Rym: yeah yeah I said Escaflowne didn't I?

408
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,062
Rym: yes he does.

409
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:10,525
Rym: they're like.

410
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:11,852
Rym: so you gave him the thing he's like.

411
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:14,002
Rym: yeah you gave him the thing.

412
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:17,192
Rym: oh shit and that's all I got.

413
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,219
Rym: yeah you watch and see.

414
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,200
Scott: if you've never seen this if you've never seen Evangelion though and you watch Redeaf.

415
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:29,381
Rym: it does kind of spoil it yeah but in so far as you know what everybody dies in Escaflowne.

416
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:33,069
Scott: everybody yeah everybody dies in both.

417
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:44,730
Rym: Redeaf is an Evangelion fan parody yes as opposed to Nescaflowne which if anyone can find an online copy and send it my way I would be very happy.

418
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,609
Scott: I'm sure some links to Nescaflowne are coming to us as soon as you push the upload.

419
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:54,155
Rym: I'm sure Nescaflowne is as bad as Redeaf was remembered to be I'm sure but I remember.

420
00:23:54,196 --> 00:24:02,130
Scott: there was a time though where you I had already realized the fan parodies were lame and you were all like oh man I'm gonna go watch the fan parodies.

421
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,055
Rym: it's so awesome.

422
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,201
Rym: fan parodies can be awesome.

423
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,493
Rym: there have been some super awesome ones since then.

424
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:09,770
Rym: the thing is I just it's hard to find the good ones.

425
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:15,156
Scott: I just remember that one OdaCon like you were super hyped to go to the fan parodies and I was like hell.

426
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:25,487
Rym: no see I wasn't super hyped and the only reason I didn't go was I was gonna go and then I got hungry and I realized that if I didn't eat right then there was no way I would have eaten before the concert.

427
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:31,175
Rym: so I totally didn't go to the fan parodies because food at that mall across the street is very important.

428
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,139
Scott: it is indeed.

429
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,066
Scott: oh I got to do a thing a day right?

430
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,373
Rym: oh I guess you do okay.

431
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:36,700
Scott: so check this out.

432
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,517
Scott: here's the thing of the day that I cannot vouch for the quality of.

433
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,247
Rym: oh great stellar things of the day tonight.

434
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:46,542
Scott: yeah this is a webcomic right that I have not read.

435
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:47,829
Scott: I don't know if it's good.

436
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,955
Rym: are you linking to it?

437
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:51,831
Scott: I don't know if it's bad because I was really desperate for a thing of the day.

438
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:55,048
Rym: I got like four actually between Emily and I do.

439
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:59,509
Rym: I've learned about three or four new comics some of them webcomics that I really got to read.

440
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:01,720
Scott: but there is evidence once about Viking.

441
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:05,921
Scott: yes there is evidence those to suggest that this webcomic is worth talking about.

442
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,090
Scott: first of all the webcomic right.

443
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,553
Scott: the art is by Paul Duffield who if you look at this art it's pretty high quality arts.

444
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:16,348
Scott: he's sorry he's very good with the colors that I've recognized.

445
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:23,457
Scott: that name no okay the name you should recognize is the writer of this weekly webcomic Warren Ellis.

446
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,601
Rym: I don't know who that is.

447
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,022
Scott: he is.

448
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:32,845
Scott: he is the famous writer of non webcomics such as such as such as transmetropolitan.

449
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,312
Rym: I didn't like that at all.

450
00:25:34,472 --> 00:25:35,678
Scott: I don't care if you liked it.

451
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,933
Rym: the point is is that I gained no enjoyment from it.

452
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:43,116
Rym: I remember when Steve had it we were at the shore and he brought all this transmetropolitan.

453
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:49,807
Rym: he's like yeah this is like a great comic and I remember I read like all of it and it's oh my god I didn't like it at all.

454
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,735
Scott: it was just awful.

455
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,702
Scott: he also wrote that fell comic.

456
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:54,526
Scott: did you read that one yet?

457
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,916
Scott: nah no he also wrote planetary.

458
00:25:56,936 --> 00:26:03,042
Scott: he's written a lot of comics but the fell I think is my favorite comic by him is definitely the awesome.

459
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:09,901
Scott: I mean we're gonna talk about that soon because I had the first volume and the second volume I think is pending pretty pretty quickly I'll try to read it.

460
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,572
Scott: yeah it's it's an awesome detective thing.

461
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:12,196
Scott: Emily liked it.

462
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,840
Scott: she thought it was.

463
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,288
Rym: I imagine I'll really like it.

464
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,158
Rym: yes I've been watching a lot of anime.

465
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:18,510
Scott: so Warren Ellis is a famous comic writer.

466
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,299
Scott: right whether you like his stuff or not.

467
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,507
Scott: I mean you don't have to like his stuff.

468
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,016
Scott: it's not like say Alan Moore.

469
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:27,610
Scott: we have to like his and he make it a webcomic.

470
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:32,986
Scott: that's free and weekly and it's called freak angels freak angels calm.

471
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:41,182
Scott: there's 11 episodes in each episode is six pages and you just go to the first episode and start reading and it shouldn't take you that long.

472
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:46,160
Scott: I mean they're on episode 11. so what 66 pages to catch up at that?

473
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,892
Scott: shouldn't take you that long to read 66 pages of comics?

474
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:52,408
Scott: that's like three flimsy comic books worth right.

475
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:53,816
Scott: so they've already got one trade.

476
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,953
Scott: shouldn't take more than an hour to read through this even if you're slow.

477
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:01,025
Scott: so you know free comic by a real.

478
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:08,787
Scott: you know high quality you know professional comic writer you know that that's thing of the day worthy I say but you haven't read it.

479
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:17,642
Scott: no I yeah.

480
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,490
Rym: and then we talked about redead.

481
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,818
Rym: yeah and now that yeah.

482
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,566
Rym: well I think we gotta balance that out.

483
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:26,216
Scott: so you know we don't know you're suing.

484
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:26,860
Scott: this is bad.

485
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,523
Scott: it could be good.

486
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:28,850
Rym: I'm not assuming anything.

487
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:31,422
Rym: I'm taking an agnostic and unknowing position.

488
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,357
Scott: you you do but you associated it with Orion and redead.

489
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:38,574
Rym: I'm just saying that there was a train and the trend might continue.

490
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:39,218
Rym: it might be us.

491
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,002
Scott: I don't see a trend.

492
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,648
Scott: the trend is no it's bad.

493
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,572
Scott: no it's bad.

494
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:43,435
Scott: who knows?

495
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:46,086
Scott: well that's not a pattern.

496
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:55,166
Scott: unless we then talk about two more things that are bad and then one more thing that is questionable then it would be a pattern of bad bad questionable bad bad questionable.

497
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:55,547
Scott: repeat.

498
00:27:55,567 --> 00:28:07,054
Rym: anyway tonight regardless we're gonna talk about one of those kind of big shows but luckily because it's a big show we can't really talk about it in any super deep detail.

499
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:10,429
Rym: partly yes Scott hasn't watched it in a long time.

500
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,299
Scott: I've only watched the entire show once.

501
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,028
Scott: that was like more than five years ago.

502
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:16,882
Rym: I'll say this this is a show that I was in 2002.

503
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:21,759
Rym: I believe I have seen all the way through four times and then some.

504
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,366
Scott: I've seen all the way through once.

505
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:24,030
Rym: it's a show.

506
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,150
Scott: I've seen the movie twice and I've seen the first four episodes twice.

507
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,442
Scott: that's includes the time that I saw the whole thing.

508
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:40,788
Rym: well it's a show where despite having seen it four and some times I cried at the end every time and you know when I say a cry because I tried a lot of anime but usually it's like Reaper.

509
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:46,710
Rym: it's like Scott did just finish the Prince of Nothing trilogy.

510
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:49,749
Scott: by the way I'm making all sorts of Prince of Nothing jokes now bitches.

511
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,138
Rym: yeah you're a little late to that.

512
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:51,782
Rym: you know what you're like.

513
00:28:51,822 --> 00:29:01,270
Rym: now though you're like those people who played portal like yesterday and they come to the party and they're like haha the cake is a lie and we're all like haha yeah yeah

514
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,995
Scott: but you know what the difference is is that I'm much more clever and that's I'm making the jokes that no one else makes.

515
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,563
Rym: we made the deeper joke.

516
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:08,105
Scott: no you did.

517
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:08,788
Rym: yes we did.

518
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:09,932
Rym: yes we did.

519
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,663
Scott: I'm gonna have to go digging for some deeper jokes.

520
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:16,641
Scott: then cuz they were the Prince of Nothing is a minefield of jokes.

521
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:21,616
Rym: oh my god it is it is it is a no it is not a comedy.

522
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:24,306
Rym: it is that there is so much in there.

523
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:28,847
Rym: it's the kind of thing where you can reference it with other people in very clever way.

524
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:29,711
Scott: it'd be Prince of.

525
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:42,833
Scott: this is sort of a bad in poor taste but I'm gonna compare it to Cambodia in terms of its humor value it's kind of true and in terms of the you know minefields get it.

526
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,079
Scott: yeah okay that's.

527
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,429
Scott: I know that was in poor taste but I was.

528
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,754
Rym: I was thinking more in terms of.

529
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:50,706
Rym: it is not a pleasant fantasy world?

530
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,590
Scott: no it is not.

531
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,704
Scott: neither is Cambodia no but I think Cambodia is worse.

532
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:59,354
Rym: well was at least bad anime.

533
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:05,512
Rym: so tonight we're talking about this show which is nothing like Cambodia.

534
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,157
Rym: tenku no escaflowne.

535
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,627
Rym: vision of escaflowne is in my opinion.

536
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:13,524
Rym: now we talk about must-see anime and we talk about good anime and bad anime.

537
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:22,778
Rym: but if there are say three or four or five like greatest anime like TV series well yeah movies we can't really count.

538
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:23,924
Rym: that's this whole separate.

539
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:35,828
Scott: because then you see when you start movies you're like okay she movie every miyazaki movie every stodgy khan movie every you know you start going off and then you're in a mess.

540
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:46,368
Scott: but when you're talking about TV shows at least the TV shows that aren't five zillion episodes and I know a lot of people hate you know making like a top ten or a top five list but escaflowne is in every one of those lists.

541
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,040
Rym: it's gotta be what I would pretty much say.

542
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,700
Rym: the way I would put it is that we kind of classify anime into a B and C anime.

543
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,232
Rym: a anime is anime that leaves you with something.

544
00:30:55,252 --> 00:31:07,998
Rym: I mean examples of a anime or cowboy bebop Trigon like the big hitters the amazing shows Gundam seed not destiny clean up batters the star quarterbacks in the Super Bowl.

545
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:12,139
Rym: and then there's be anime which are like I don't know scrap princess konkotsuo.

546
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,681
Rym: they're good they're fun they're really worth watching but they're not like special they don't.

547
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,633
Rym: they're not like the all-time amazing greats.

548
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,824
Rym: you know yeah and see anime are like.

549
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:29,574
Rym: you know initial D and all those things that we like anyway and then F anime are like girl in the gun.

550
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,540
Scott: oh no I haven't watched it I can't.

551
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,244
Rym: yeah we can't say.

552
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,300
Scott: I just tried to say something that would incite people going.

553
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,936
Rym: Oh Daryl Surratt for a second was about to call gogo 13.

554
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:40,759
Scott: yeah I know like.

555
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:47,107
Rym: he picked up the phone and then you said just kidding he hesitated for a minute much like speaking of gogo 13.

556
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,652
Rym: Wow so much for escaflowne.

557
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:52,406
Scott: okay so escaflowne right.

558
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:59,155
Scott: the thing about escaflowne that makes it such an a anime right is that first of all you got a fantasy anime.

559
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,164
Scott: pretty rare to have a fantasy anime.

560
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:02,531
Scott: that's not just like a joke right?

561
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:10,083
Rym: I mean what like serious fantasy anime do we have slayers edges into serious territory a little a couple of times right?

562
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:11,608
Rym: there's twelve kingdoms.

563
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,039
Scott: yeah I guess - it's a robot anime.

564
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:22,207
Scott: they're mad robots in escaflowne but it's not a. it's not in the genre of robot show but it has the robots and they're cool.

565
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,177
Rym: it's got pretty boys and cat girls.

566
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,625
Scott: I guess that's it does like.

567
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:32,622
Scott: that does yeah and the thing that's really like defines escaflowne.

568
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:46,684
Scott: the way I sum it up in my mind is that somehow they take like stereotypes of anime like come on schoolgirl in high school transported to a fantasy world.

569
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:56,094
Scott: there's a bunch of pretty boy bunch of pretty boys and cat and a magical war and she falls in love kind of.

570
00:32:56,535 --> 00:33:00,812
Scott: but is that not the most like by-the-book story you've ever heard?

571
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:08,880
Scott: I don't know what is in terms of anime right but yet yet they pull it off and you don't even realize how cliche it is.

572
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:16,893
Scott: because every cliche is like done with the finesse and the polish that makes it feel like original and new and amazing.

573
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:22,623
Rym: it's one of those shows one of those rare shows where a lot of things try to be epic and there's different ways to look at epic.

574
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:28,068
Rym: I mean you could look at kind of all the leiji Matsumoto works and say like those as a whole are this epic thing.

575
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:41,521
Rym: but watching a show the the way like from where escaflowne starts until where it gets about halfway through and then to where it gets by the end it it is epic in every sense of the word.

576
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:51,155
Scott: the plot is one of those like epic but not forced and I a lot of the plot you can see coming but a lot of it no way gonna see it coming?

577
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:52,722
Scott: not at all not even close.

578
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:55,312
Rym: so escaflowne before.

579
00:33:55,353 --> 00:34:02,283
Rym: I mean just if you'd stop listening to GeekNights right now tonight because you got other things to do and you have not seen tenku.

580
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,736
Rym: no escaflowne it is your duty to buy it and watch it.

581
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,589
Rym: this is one of the greatest animated series ever.

582
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,137
Scott: yeah it's really cheap too.

583
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,001
Scott: I mean you can probably get.

584
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:18,907
Scott: you can get every all 26 episodes of it in like one box right in the bricks and it shouldn't cost you more than $50.

585
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:19,529
Scott: I paid $23 for it.

586
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:20,011
Rym: Wow best Bob.

587
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,130
Scott: Wow 26 episodes for $23 less than a dollar an episode for an entire anime series one of the best ever on DVD.

588
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,498
Scott: I'm looking it up on Amazon right now.

589
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:37,523
Rym: all right but there's actually there's a lot of interesting kind of side stuff about escaflowne.

590
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,840
Rym: before we kind of get into what it's about and why it's so great.

591
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,507
Rym: already talked about what it's about yeah but we can talk about that in a little more detail.

592
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,726
Rym: well it's funny how whenever we do a show about a show we like which isn't that often we kind of gush.

593
00:34:51,007 --> 00:35:08,484
Scott: yeah you could walk up to Rym like randomly and just say escaflowne I might just cry just like gush onto the floor me not so much all right on Amazon right I see escaflowne anime legends complete collection $45.

594
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:13,279
Scott: that is worth everything that is totally worth it.

595
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,535
Rym: I paid $28 for the first VHS tape of escaflowne.

596
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:20,821
Scott: I see 43 used and new from $26.

597
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,770
Scott: so you can get a used set 26 bucks.

598
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,460
Rym: so escaflowne is actually kind of old.

599
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,024
Rym: it's more than a decade old.

600
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:30,909
Rym: this came out in 1996.

601
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:36,527
Scott: oh god it looks like a late 90s early 2000 anime.

602
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:39,800
Rym: yeah yeah but at the same time it was a very high budget.

603
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,936
Rym: kind of we're putting all the right things together.

604
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:47,780
Rym: it was one of those shows where you looked at and you knew wow all the right people are behind it.

605
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,724
Rym: all the money's there.

606
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:51,256
Rym: this is gonna be one of those gigantic shows.

607
00:35:51,598 --> 00:36:00,820
Rym: the same way you'd look at cowboy bebop when it was originally kind of being put out and and much like all these great shows back in that era it had a lot of trouble.

608
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,671
Rym: it was almost not made like a bunch of times.

609
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:04,802
Rym: it sat on the shelf for like four years.

610
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:14,360
Rym: there they lost the first director which actually I'm not gonna tell the whole story but to sum it up briefly someone was going to direct escaflowne.

611
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:19,077
Rym: that person was for various reasons not included in the project.

612
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:44,168
Rym: by the end they it's actually kind of complicated but instead of the original director and the original concept someone by the name of Kazuki Akane became the director and made changes to escaflowne to the point that it went from a super run-of-the-mill garbage show into one of the greatest anime ever and I attribute that largely to the changes that were made.

613
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,534
Rym: if you want to see what escaflowne would have likely been like otherwise there are two.

614
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,586
Rym: well there are three but you probably haven't seen the third one.

615
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:52,452
Rym: there are two manga.

616
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,584
Scott: yeah that's the thing about escaflowne.

617
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:56,713
Scott: it has two manga which is confusing.

618
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:59,966
Rym: one is a shoujo manga and one is a shonen manga.

619
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:00,990
Rym: they both suck.

620
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:02,717
Scott: they're utter crap.

621
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:07,502
Scott: the shoujo is a little better than the shonen but that's like saying it smells better than poop like.

622
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:11,799
Rym: don't even be tempted to flip through the escaflowne manga.

623
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,546
Rym: this is some bad bad manga.

624
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:17,073
Scott: they're terrible not worth the penny.

625
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:24,016
Rym: but this show just like Evangelion was originally going to be 39 episodes.

626
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:39,717
Rym: this is back when shows were always 26 episodes and this show was gonna be you know three half seasons 39 episodes and unlike utenna instead of stretching out their budget with lots of stock footage and bad animation techniques which I think worked to utenna's benefit.

627
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,106
Scott: yes well but that not for her.

628
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,358
Scott: they wouldn't have worked escaflowne's benefit that's not sure.

629
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:51,134
Rym: but escaflowne and Evangelion were both originally going to be 39 episodes and due to cuts they had to cut them short to 26 episodes.

630
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:57,774
Rym: and escaflowne unlike Evangelion did this by not cutting out anything.

631
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,626
Scott: you really can't tell that the show was supposed to be 39 episodes.

632
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:14,094
Scott: if anything I mean like you watch say the original Matt cross TV series right where they tacked on extra episodes at the end and you can totally tell the point at which the original ends and then they begin the tacked on episodes and this.

633
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,264
Scott: they cut episodes out but you can't tell.

634
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:24,201
Scott: it's like it looks like they wrote the whole thing from the beginning knowing is gonna be setting plot out or changing things to make an end in 26.

635
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:30,854
Rym: all they did was kind of tighten it up and save time wherever they could by kind of making the story progress faster and that was good.

636
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:42,450
Rym: and as a result actually I think one of the greatest strengths of escaflowne one of those subtle things is that the show starts and it throws you into it and then it kind of progresses at a steady pace but the kind of.

637
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:46,606
Rym: the rate of progression is accelerating throughout the show.

638
00:38:46,626 --> 00:39:00,133
Rym: so you get through say one plot unit in the first episode and one plot unit in the second episode and 1.1 plot units in the third episode and 1.4 plot units in the fourth episode.

639
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:03,911
Rym: and the show kind of builds up the pace and builds up the pace.

640
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:10,542
Rym: and epic like the epicness is going up and the pace is going up and filler scenes and atmospheric shots are cutting down.

641
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:20,719
Rym: and the last like five or six episodes are this like bullet train to destiny like the show is just at this breakneck pace and things are happening.

642
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,466
Rym: just it bam bam bam bam bam.

643
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:24,775
Rym: and then it stops and it's over.

644
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:25,878
Rym: and it's amazing.

645
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:48,150
Scott: the worst part of escaflowne is there's so many cliffhangers often at the end of DVDs or VHS tapes and they're like the most grueling possible cliffhangers you can imagine like we're talking characters you love on the brink of death major major climaxes in the plot.

646
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,137
Scott: just like left ambiguous.

647
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:52,646
Rym: this show really strings you along.

648
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,257
Scott: it strings you along so badly.

649
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:56,784
Rym: it's kind of like in that regard.

650
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:14,217
Rym: it's almost like those old Hardy Boys novels the kind of Hardy Boys the New Year's but unlike those it's not terrible like the worst example if you were watching escaflowne and you have you're watching the second to last DVD or tape or whatever you got and you see the fifth to last episode.

651
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:18,390
Rym: make sure you've got the next episode handy cuz.

652
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,791
Rym: there's.

653
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,848
Rym: that's the worst cliffhanger at any show I've ever seen.

654
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:25,174
Scott: it's really terrible.

655
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,221
Scott: we're talking about the same one.

656
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:31,312
Scott: I think we are the one where actually when we really where all you see is a robot and something's coming out of it.

657
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,959
Rym: oh no no there's one worse.

658
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,345
Scott: I think that's the worst one.

659
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:34,445
Scott: well

660
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:41,721
Rym: that while that one was like the second worst cliffhanger ever I think the one near the end where me and Ken got stuck in the elevator

661
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,067
Scott: yeah coming

662
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:43,871
Rym: back with the tape

663
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,971
Scott: I think the one with the robot and the stuff coming out of it is the worst one.

664
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:49,565
Rym: I don't even want to say anything about what either.

665
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:53,002
Scott: these cliffhangers I find I found a clever way to say it without spoiling it.

666
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:56,320
Scott: are you gonna say it robot with stuff coming out of it?

667
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:58,110
Rym: oh I thought you had some other clever way.

668
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,095
Scott: no that was my clever way.

669
00:40:59,116 --> 00:40:59,920
Rym: that kind of works.

670
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,362
Rym: there's.

671
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:04,762
Rym: there's no way to cleverly refer to mine other than other than to just blurt it out.

672
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:08,237
Scott: man that and this is an easily spoiled show.

673
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,282
Scott: that is a problem with it.

674
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:15,815
Scott: well it's easily spoiled in one regard but at the same time a lot of things are kind of obvious to anyone who's actually seen the show.

675
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,624
Rym: so it's it's one of those.

676
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:25,717
Rym: yeah you could spoil it but spoilers don't mean much out of context like the journey is a lot more important than what happened.

677
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:31,101
Scott: yeah yeah other thing about asking flown a is that the characters are pretty awesome.

678
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:32,045
Scott: they're solid.

679
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:33,834
Rym: there are a lot of main characters they're.

680
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:40,469
Scott: all the thing is is like I do you know it doesn't have the simp the problem of a lot of other enemies or the main characters suck.

681
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:45,995
Scott: the side characters are cool but I do think that the side characters are cooler than the main character.

682
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:51,745
Scott: well it depends because it's all right thing is they're not really that far off to the side they're pretty close.

683
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:52,649
Scott: they're just.

684
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:53,192
Scott: you know they're not.

685
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:54,641
Scott: domain to character.

686
00:41:54,721 --> 00:42:00,330
Rym: yeah well they're also all really three-dimensional and it starts out like the show looks a little stereotypical.

687
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:06,514
Rym: I mean Alan she's are is the pretty boy and he's so cool and I'm gonna think he's so cool.

688
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:08,663
Scott: but then do you think he's so cool?

689
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:09,788
Rym: course I think he's so cool.

690
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:10,794
Rym: he's the man.

691
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:12,442
Scott: it's just your favorite anime character.

692
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:20,577
Rym: but then as it goes I mean god that's what I. my aim name she's our 105. it wasn't named after Cliff she's our that's for sure.

693
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:30,166
Rym: but then you know as the show progresses and no Alex is our is a sad emotionally broken man who's kind of messed up.

694
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:33,316
Scott: yeah and then you've got like you know Dylan down.

695
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:40,319
Scott: I mean people see you know crazy characters in anime like he's like the crazy psycho killers.

696
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:46,264
Scott: right Dylan Dow is like the perfect execution of the crazy psycho killer.

697
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,148
Scott: kind of care I think.

698
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:52,997
Rym: the scene the scene I actually rerun when I was watching this the first time we actually rewind because it was a VHS tape.

699
00:42:53,459 --> 00:43:14,034
Rym: the scene where he got that scar on his face he's freaking out about it for like the rest of the show yeah and he's just sitting there with it like this flask in front of him and he's cutting like scratching this knife against the flask and the scene is just him sitting there kind of scratching this flask and then he suddenly freaks out and breaks it all over himself and screams

700
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:29,046
Scott: yeah the show that that's really I said it before but escaflowne is all about taking the cliche but executing it in a way where it doesn't seem cliche it's like it makes it work every time

701
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:32,503
Rym: and also right along those lines it takes the cliche.

702
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:36,223
Rym: there's kind of this surface like you can enjoy escaflowne like the cliche of the cat girl.

703
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:40,485
Scott: but the cat girl isn't bad you're not going all cat girl you're going huh cat girl.

704
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:47,107
Rym: and then when there's the other cat girls yeah it's like cliche the crazy evil bad guy.

705
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,295
Scott: but whoa he's so crazy.

706
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,444
Scott: and wow that totally works as a character.

707
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,818
Scott: and you know cliche schoolgirl brought to a fantasy world.

708
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:58,655
Scott: but oh it's done so tastefully and not so shallowly.

709
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:00,223
Scott: ah just like a like a truffle.

710
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,791
Rym: but in addition to this ooh a truffle.

711
00:44:02,254 --> 00:44:06,294
Rym: but you look at it from that you can enjoy this show on this surface level this visceral.

712
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:09,645
Rym: yay let's go fantasy epic adventure this crazy plot.

713
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:17,080
Rym: but and a lot of people go whenever people say things like this well no I mean if you know the thing I'm about to say not the thing I just said.

714
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,623
Rym: no escaflowne is one of those shows that's you know deep and stuff.

715
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:25,256
Scott: it's kind of deep it's not super deep but it's got.

716
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:30,768
Rym: it's got the depth it's got a lot more depth than you'd realize especially in the when you kind of find out what was going on.

717
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,598
Rym: and you know a lot of shows have like cool.

718
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:37,384
Scott: if it was a pool it would be deep enough for a high jump but not deep enough for an Olympic high.

719
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:44,268
Rym: well I'll put it this way it's not deep in the big o2 way where they beat you over the head with.

720
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:46,537
Rym: it's not deep in the existentialist philosophy.

721
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:48,467
Scott: it's not deep in the Orion way.

722
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:51,060
Rym: it's not deep in the ghost in the shell.

723
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,130
Rym: you know social phenomenon and what is the nature?

724
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,275
Scott: just the right depth where you stand on your tippy toes but and you keep your nose out of the water.

725
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:57,718
Scott: well know what.

726
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:02,284
Rym: what's great about the show is that it doesn't just have kind of one overarching moral.

727
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:06,423
Rym: I mean you've been some evangelical despite all its existentialist.

728
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:07,508
Scott: and try gun as well.

729
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:22,633
Rym: yes try gun is just kind of considering the idea of pacifism and everything in the show is really just kind of around this one idea and as a or evangelical is kind of just around the idea of what our humans and how do we interact with each other and ourselves.

730
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:31,628
Rym: eska flown a has like nine of those issues and yeah it wants them all equally well cuz each character like this side plots.

731
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:32,332
Scott: it's sort of like.

732
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:38,081
Scott: I really related a lot to Final Fantasy 6 where you have like a fantasy world a big epic kind of journey.

733
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:43,071
Scott: you can actually match up a lot of the characters with Final Fantasy 6 characters being kind of similar you know.

734
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,424
Rym: and oh man I just you said that I thought.

735
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:47,790
Rym: but who would match up with lock?

736
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,171
Rym: that was like or Edward and I was like duh Dryden.

737
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:55,724
Scott: for both of them I think I think Edward.

738
00:45:55,805 --> 00:45:57,108
Scott: now she's our goal together.

739
00:45:57,229 --> 00:45:58,333
Rym: yeah they kind of do.

740
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:01,768
Rym: yeah but I really like Dryden when he's got that mermaid.

741
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:06,186
Scott: yeah all right but yeah you got Kefka for Dylan down.

742
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:07,552
Scott: it's like you totally it totally works.

743
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:11,771
Rym: well I think Dylan down out crazies Kefka though the only thing cats.

744
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:12,957
Rym: a tough call that Dylan.

745
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,493
Rym: tough call that Kefka murders a lot more people than Dylan.

746
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:20,356
Scott: I can guarantee though if you like Final Fantasy 6 you like eska plonie and vice versa.

747
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:24,804
Rym: in fact if you're one of those people who always wish the Final Fantasy 6 for an anime just watch eska plonie.

748
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:26,634
Rym: pretty much it's better than that could ever be.

749
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,062
Scott: yeah yeah I guess.

750
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,294
Scott: cuz it doesn't have the random encounters it doesn't take as long.

751
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:34,615
Rym: if you're gonna make a Final Fantasy movie I think the random encounter is the first thing to go.

752
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,206
Scott: but yeah it's really.

753
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:46,684
Scott: it's that kind of thing where even though there is a big major plot like all the characters have their plots and each of their plots is sort of separate.

754
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:48,772
Scott: so it's like as you go through.

755
00:46:48,833 --> 00:47:01,974
Scott: it's like not only are you trying to figure out the big picture but there's the you know the thread of each of the main characters and what their deal is and all their deals come to a head and then the big thing comes to a head and then it's over

756
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:04,432
Rym: and the show doesn't kind of take anything for granted.

757
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:05,357
Rym: like there's the world.

758
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:18,221
Rym: but the world is super super super fleshed out and all the politics and all the people and all the races and all those things are all there and all strong in the background the foreground wherever they matter and it's super consistent with itself.

759
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:27,439
Rym: and as a result you know it's got the cliche of the girl who comes from the other world has some magical powers but they don't just leave it at that.

760
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:40,157
Rym: like a lot of shows she's an esper she's an esper but seriously the show gets into some dark territory in regards to why does Hitomi have these powers?

761
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,806
Rym: what are those powers doing?

762
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:47,024
Rym: how are they affecting everything as we've been following this show?

763
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,675
Rym: yeah how much can she really control them?

764
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:54,294
Rym: the show really really really is good and that's all we can really say.

765
00:47:54,335 --> 00:47:55,644
Rym: we just keep saying that over and over again.

766
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,915
Scott: now there is an escaflowne a movie.

767
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:05,064
Scott: the movie has some of the same characters as the show a lot of the same characters but different character designs.

768
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:05,728
Scott: actually the

769
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:20,321
Rym: movie is basically take like every character from the show and pick like one element of their personality make that the entire character and then it's like everyone is a deep caricature of a character from the show and

770
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:34,759
Scott: then take sort of the same universe but like a different world like so you know it's like it's the same but it's different and they just sort of tell a story with those characters in like you know 90 minutes or so.

771
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:42,474
Rym: it's kind of like it takes one of the themes of escaflowne and just addresses that like it distills everything to one of its core essences.

772
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:47,397
Scott: yeah you could watch the movie and it won't spoil shit about the real show and vice versa.

773
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,331
Scott: they they really have not not much to do with each other.

774
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:56,079
Rym: besides the characters the movie also was one of those super high-budget super pretty and you know what.

775
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,844
Scott: it's pretty pretty.

776
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,352
Rym: yeah it's a good movie it's not.

777
00:48:58,493 --> 00:48:59,036
Scott: it's okay.

778
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:02,252
Rym: just if you if you don't go into it expecting you don't need to see it.

779
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:08,740
Rym: but if you want to watch it just don't watch one and expect it to be the other one because they're both good.

780
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,499
Scott: if you expect the movie to be like the TV show you're gonna be disappointed.

781
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:17,502
Rym: plus don't forget the escaflowne movie was one of the first widely distributed digital fan subs.

782
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:18,707
Scott: yep it sure was.

783
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,936
Rym: Wow this was a long time ago.

784
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:22,382
Rym: all of this yeah it was.

785
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:26,242
Rym: but the story of escaflowne actually it's just that there's this girl.

786
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:26,946
Rym: her name's Hitomi.

787
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:31,325
Rym: she's a normal average girl but she's not an average boring girl.

788
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:34,358
Rym: she's an average you know quirky kind of realistic girl.

789
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:38,780
Scott: yeah and she's in high school and she does track and she has friends who were cool.

790
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,228
Rym: yeah she actually has friends.

791
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:41,796
Rym: it's not like the stereotypical.

792
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:47,548
Scott: you know I don't have any friends blah and the friends are sort of normal and they sort of have these real high school problems.

793
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:50,083
Scott: and she likes this boy and there's another boy.

794
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,073
Scott: I think that doesn't really get talked about so much.

795
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,224
Rym: and well there's Amano Senpai.

796
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,233
Scott: right right right that's the guy that she likes.

797
00:49:56,414 --> 00:50:00,992
Rym: yes but one thing leads to another and she gets transported to this world.

798
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:03,221
Rym: but it's not like it's out of the blue it's.

799
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,310
Rym: I can't spoil anything.

800
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,217
Scott: they slowly lean into it.

801
00:50:07,278 --> 00:50:14,930
Scott: like as a watcher as a viewer of the anime you kind of see that Sun's coming and you kind of know because it's a meta thing.

802
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,754
Scott: right you know what.

803
00:50:15,794 --> 00:50:21,360
Scott: but they totally lean into it and it's it feels really natural and not just like poof.

804
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,068
Scott: we're in another world like El Hazzard.

805
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:28,473
Scott: this show kind of stand out like if El Hazzard is the wow we're just transported to a different world.

806
00:50:28,513 --> 00:50:31,708
Scott: suddenly this is the ah this is the right way to do that.

807
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:35,303
Rym: even El Hazzard has a whole bunch of school build-up.

808
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:35,946
Rym: it does.

809
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:45,047
Rym: it has that one of my favorites comedy scenes in any show ever where Jedi is in the hallway freaking out as he looks at all the different bulletin board pictures.

810
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:53,098
Scott: this is one thing that amazes me about Escaflowne is how the school the high school aspect of Escaflowne comes on so strong.

811
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:57,813
Scott: yet the amount of screen time it gets is so small.

812
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,664
Scott: but yeah like it's you barely see the school.

813
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:03,997
Scott: but the school is so powerfully in the show.

814
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,086
Rym: well the school also comes back.

815
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:11,090
Rym: this isn't really a spoiler so much because it kind of illustrates an interesting the show.

816
00:51:11,532 --> 00:51:18,083
Rym: there's a point at which they're you know things are going on and they told me is trying to hide somewhere and her pager goes off.

817
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,553
Scott: it's totally a Hoshi no koei thing.

818
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:22,058
Rym: her pager goes off

819
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:23,965
Scott: and in the fantasy world

820
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:34,263
Rym: you know she's got her bag with her she's got CDs and all these things just with her but it goes off and it caused all this trouble and you forget about it going off because whatever it went off and all this action happens.

821
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:42,507
Rym: and then at the end of the episode she's like they've relaxed and they're safe and she just kind of looks at the pager and then she sees the phone number on it and then it

822
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:43,090
Scott: cuts to

823
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:49,490
Rym: the real world again earth and there's a mono and he was just calling the pager.

824
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,197
Rym: and is he there?

825
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:52,502
Rym: he's in a phone booth and that's it.

826
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:57,905
Scott: yeah and the thing is it told me is like for is wearing her school uniform.

827
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:01,643
Scott: still everyone else is like you know knights and wizards and elves and shit.

828
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:02,688
Scott: so it's like.

829
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,657
Scott: you know that's like her character design.

830
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:06,023
Scott: so it totally makes sense.

831
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,334
Scott: but it's sort of it always ties.

832
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:13,440
Scott: she's always carrying her bag of stuff from high school because it was transported to this world with her.

833
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:18,024
Scott: she's wearing sneakers you know so it's like it's always tied back to this school.

834
00:52:18,084 --> 00:52:21,180
Scott: despite that the school gets almost no screen time and it's not.

835
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,392
Rym: I mean it's not just a convenience or whatever.

836
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:26,367
Rym: it actually kind of matters to the plot and it matters a lot.

837
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:32,157
Rym: it is the plot now but what I was about to say before was that part of what makes this show stand out in terms of.

838
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:34,029
Rym: you know you said the opening is kind of natural.

839
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:46,395
Rym: like it it draws you into the world and a lot of modern shows seem to just like people have an idea like we're gonna make a show about blah and they introduce blah as quickly as possible and they wrap a little mystery around it to try to dangle you along.

840
00:52:47,178 --> 00:52:50,772
Rym: this show develops so much more naturally than a lot of these shows.

841
00:52:50,812 --> 00:53:02,843
Rym: I feel like modern anime seem to often forget that you have to have a strong come on in the beginning but they come on too strong in the beginning and in the end it makes a weaker come on

842
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:06,344
Scott: or they come on too weak in the beginning because they don't want to reveal too much.

843
00:53:06,364 --> 00:53:14,467
Rym: I think the first episode of this show is one of the best not the best but definitely one of the better introductions to a complex world and a complex show.

844
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:18,268
Scott: I think the reason it works so well is because they come on strong with the school.

845
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:23,412
Scott: they bring you on everything about the school and then the fantasy world and you got nothing.

846
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:29,188
Scott: so they got the mystery is all in the fantasy world but they were able to lure you in with the really strong school revealing everything.

847
00:53:29,228 --> 00:53:30,776
Rym: it really lets you identify with you.

848
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:34,193
Rym: tell me a lot more because now you kind of got used to the school you're.

849
00:53:34,395 --> 00:53:35,802
Rym: you were grounded in this kind of.

850
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:41,366
Rym: here's the world of the show and now you're transported along with her to this other world.

851
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:50,554
Rym: and I also point out that in this other world earth is in the sky like a moon and you see it and they know it and they know she's from there and they call it the cursed world.

852
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:50,614
Rym: do?

853
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:53,512
Rym: they call it the curse world called the curse moon of the curse something.

854
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:54,439
Scott: I call it something.

855
00:53:54,499 --> 00:54:02,371
Scott: I forget if it was cursed but they call it something and they're like it's like it's like it's like imagine if someone showed up like in front of your house and you knew that they were from the moon.

856
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:07,472
Scott: you'd be like you're from the moon whoa but not just the moon the cursed moon.

857
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,279
Scott: I don't remember if it was cursed.

858
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:10,886
Rym: it is most definitely cursed.

859
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:12,151
Scott: I forget I can't.

860
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:12,975
Scott: I can't say either way.

861
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:17,962
Rym: I mean I don't want to talk about the plot anymore because this is kind of the like.

862
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:26,552
Rym: we're gonna talk about the show a couple more times in the far future because you know we got to do a final thoughts we got to do kind of the full review for people who have seen it all those sorts of things.

863
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:32,419
Rym: but I don't feel like I need to talk more about the plot or anything because you need to see this show.

864
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,906
Rym: this is one of the best anime ever.

865
00:54:34,228 --> 00:54:42,405
Rym: if you if you're an anime fan and you haven't seen this show it's like saying I haven't seen cowboy bebop I haven't seen trygun I haven't seen Star Wars.

866
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:47,472
Scott: okay so if you didn't have enough reasons already to go watch this Cofloni I got two more reasons for you.

867
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:54,355
Scott: number one yoko kano music and also number two no but teriyuki character designs.

868
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,022
Scott: that's the pointy nose guy.

869
00:54:56,042 --> 00:55:01,950
Rym: I really like both of those people a lot and actually we're talking like a list anime you know.

870
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,341
Rym: there's a third reason Maya Sakamoto.

871
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,050
Rym: you realize this was like her premier role.

872
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:09,442
Rym: ah I mean Maya Sakamoto who was famous.

873
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:12,191
Rym: now this was her first real role she played.

874
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:20,738
Rym: he told me the lead and she sang the opening song yaku soku wa erinai which is actually I really like that song.

875
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:29,335
Scott: yeah you know the one thing is there is one song and it's not a bad song it's actually a really good song but it's like eska flow day.

876
00:55:29,956 --> 00:55:35,287
Scott: as you know it's a lot like.

877
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:37,033
Scott: you know the Excalibur something.

878
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:39,949
Scott: ah no what the the song from Excalibur what the hell's it called?

879
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,979
Rym: well the thing is a lot of you do.

880
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:46,490
Rym: the music in the yeah is absolutely fantastic.

881
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,394
Rym: I mean it's yoko kano.

882
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:49,524
Rym: duh but it's very symphonic.

883
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:50,247
Rym: it's very.

884
00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:51,352
Rym: there are light motifs.

885
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:55,974
Scott: I'd say it's yoko kano second best anime music scabula being her best enemy music.

886
00:55:56,014 --> 00:56:00,582
Rym: yeah I would have to agree because I think right up there at number three are the openings to the ghost in the shells.

887
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:03,357
Scott: yeah that's was really good too all right.

888
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,985
Scott: anything else we gotta say I don't know.

889
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:05,728
Rym: I think that's it.

890
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,736
Scott: I mean buy it Netflix it.

891
00:56:08,218 --> 00:56:10,787
Scott: if you're really poor maybe you can find it somewhere.

892
00:56:10,948 --> 00:56:13,419
Rym: if I had to you know I'd give a top 5 anime.

893
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:19,624
Rym: I wouldn't rank them but it's easily cowboy bebop evangelical eska flown a try gun and something else.
