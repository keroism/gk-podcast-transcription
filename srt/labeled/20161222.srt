1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,283
Rym: It's Thursday, December 22nd, 2016.

2
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,590
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,093
Rym: Shazam!

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,530
Rym: And actually we're talking about Christmas, I guess, and Festivus and all that.

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:23,656
Rym: You'll see.

6
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:24,508
Rym: It's a show.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,727
Scott: Let's do this!

8
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:32,549
Rym: Scott forgot his news while we were doing the opener.

9
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:33,468
Scott: I remember it again.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,170
Rym: So, I've got my new computer up and running, like for real, and I know I keep talking about this.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,316
Scott: It's a computer.

12
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,450
Scott: It adds one and one the same as the old computer.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:58,209
Rym: I experience something that I always forget about, because unless you're managing a lot of servers that are basically personal servers, like if you manage a data center, you don't really give things clever names anymore, you pretty much give them functional names that are derivable from what they do.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,270
Scott: I just imagined a funny comic, right?

15
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,530
Scott: Here's why I can write comics if I can't draw them, right?

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,961
Scott: There's a guy, and he's going on Newegg.

17
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:05,765
Scott: He's on a computer.

18
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:06,750
Scott: He goes on Newegg, right?

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,049
Scott: And he's got a keyboard and a mouse, and he's looking, and he pulls up the listing, and it's for ENIAC.

20
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:16,370
Scott: And you look down, and the keyboard and the mouse are plugged into UNIVAC.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,610
Rym: But the thing that always paralyzes me...

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,463
Scott: I hope I got the order of those computers correct.

23
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:25,510
Scott: I'm pretty sure UNIVAC's older.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,413
Rym: I think so.

25
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,258
Rym: I don't remember offhand.

26
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:27,841
Rym: You know what's funny?

27
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,309
Rym: I took a class on that at RIT.

28
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,649
Rym: We took a class on computer history.

29
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,110
Rym: But got to name your computer.

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:49,210
Rym: Though what's interesting is in the old days, like when you installed Windows or something, it would be, well, depending on how old you go, there's an older days where this wasn't a thing, and then it was a thing mostly when you had like Samba and NetBIOS, like I'd have a NetBIOS name for shit.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,389
Rym: Got to name your computer.

32
00:01:52,232 --> 00:02:00,750
Rym: And it's something that only matters to people who are a little bit nerdy and technological because if you're just some sort of muggle, your computer's name is probably just your first name.

33
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:07,588
Rym: apostrophe-esque computer and networking just kind of magically makes that show up in places and you don't think about it that much.

34
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,869
Rym: But normal computers have a host name and a Linux server has a host name or something.

35
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,610
Rym: So I had to name this new computer.

36
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,770
Rym: And it's been a while since I built a computer.

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:19,549
Rym: Both laptop and desktop are like 2009 era-esque.

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,907
Rym: So is the HTPC.

39
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,435
Rym: So I had to name it.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,730
Rym: So I started thinking about what I have named computers over the years because I haven't had that many.

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,429
Scott: Like I can't count work stuff.

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,129
Scott: I didn't name all my computers ever.

43
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,410
Rym: I named every computer I ever built.

44
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,390
Rym: The only computer that didn't have a name was the first computer we ever had.

45
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,211
Rym: The 486 was literally just called the 486.

46
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,970
Scott: I don't think I named them until college or Beacon.

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,750
Scott: I don't even remember the names I had in college.

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,849
Rym: I remember a lot of them.

49
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,389
Rym: So the computer before this one, the new one, was Kusanagi.

50
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,589
Rym: The one before that was Tochiro.

51
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:00,969
Rym: And the one before that was Ryoko.

52
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:06,689
Rym: And then I had also names for Tachikoma for a while.

53
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,654
Rym: Every computer I've ever had has had an anime-related name because I've been a weeb since 4th grade.

54
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:28,769
Rym: But then I dug a little deeper and I realized that also with basically no exceptions if you know anything about Tenchi Muyo every one of them was also a sort of sci-fi anime name in particular.

55
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:35,508
Rym: And a bunch of them were either Cyberpunk-y or Lady Matsumoto-verse.

56
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,819
Rym: So I've just doubled down.

57
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:38,516
Rym: Matsumoto-verse forever.

58
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,930
Rym: That's just what I'm going to use to name my computers.

59
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,910
Scott: You can run it names quick.

60
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,550
Rym: Luckily I don't build computers that often.

61
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,710
Scott: You'll run it names quick.

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,527
Rym: Well I could use derivations or I can do names of ships like the Arcadia.

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,390
Rym: I could use that for stuff.

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:03,320
Rym: So the new computer's name is Emeraldus and the reason I bring this up is in the old days when you start the computer the first time it's like, "What's this computer's

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,643
Rym: name?".

66
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,329
Rym: Windows 10 doesn't actually really ask you that.

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,189
Rym: You actually have to go out of your way to give it a real host name way after you install shit.

68
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,849
Scott: I name all my computers and currently my current system is always after a fictional robot of some kind, right?

69
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:28,550
Scott: So my desktop computer that I've had for four going on five years is Hardac, which is from Batman the Animated Series.

70
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,090
Scott: This giant, enormous computer.

71
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:32,189
Scott: That was a two-parter.

72
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,889
Scott: I think he even had a repeat, but he came back in some more episodes.

73
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:37,639
Rym: I will look that up.

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,165
Rym: I don't remember.

75
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,270
Scott: It was the best episodes of Batman the Animated Series, by the way.

76
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:46,301
Scott: And my iPad is Genos, who is the sidekick of One Punch Man, who's a cyborg.

77
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:51,517
Scott: And my phone is Haro, which is a little ball in Gundam.

78
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,209
Scott: that's a little robot.

79
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:58,464
Scott: You know, it bounces around because it's like a sidekick kind of thing like a phone would be, right?

80
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,030
Scott: You know, whatever.

81
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,989
Scott: I forget what the HTPC is.

82
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:14,130
Scott: Oh, my NAS is, I think, which is the detective guy from the Astro Boy slash Pluto.

83
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,230
Scott: Yeah, Pluto.

84
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,550
Scott: Detective guy who's also a robot.

85
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,029
Rym: You got to name your next computer, Bruton.

86
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,837
Scott: You know, those are all available names.

87
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:28,250
Scott: If you want robot names, you could do only Astro Boy robot names because there's so many robot names.

88
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:39,000
Scott: I think my previous desktop was Danuba because in Phoenix, the manga, in the second part, future, there's the, it's sort of the Logan's Run one.

89
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:39,527
Scott: Oh, yeah.

90
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:52,292
Scott: And there's the two, there's the computers around the world that basically run these sort of paranoia Logan's Run cities and one of them that starts the new, the intercity nuclear war is Danuba and it's the coolest looking one.

91
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:55,220
Scott: It looks like a darkology from SimCity 2000.

92
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,313
Rym: Yes, Hardak came back.

93
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,141
Rym: So Hardak is in Heart of Steel part one and two.

94
00:05:59,202 --> 00:05:59,910
Rym: That's what we remember.

95
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:10,475
Rym: He comes back in a third episode, his silicon soul, late one night, a group of criminals break into a warehouse owned by Cybertron where all the surviving items in the factory are kept, including Hardak.

96
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,468
Rym: Obviously, not recognizing the Hardak icon, they open it and from inside, Batman emerges.

97
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,183
Rym: I don't remember this episode.

98
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:20,313
Scott: I do remember that now.

99
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:23,262
Scott: There's basically a robot Batman and Hardak's in it.

100
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:30,434
Rym: I don't, I feel like I remember this title card with this like robot hand coming up, but I don't know if that's a shazam.

101
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,443
Scott: I just remember the title card with Hardak itself.

102
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,626
Rym: Yeah, but that's, that's not from that.

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,989
Rym: That's from the original Hardak and Hardak two.

104
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:38,393
Rym: Right.

105
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:41,543
Scott: Anyway, those are like the best episodes of Batman.

106
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:42,210
Scott: It's good stuff.

107
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,297
Rym: I don't know though.

108
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,898
Rym: The cool and Luke one is pretty good too.

109
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:52,129
Scott: Uh, I mean, if you want to talk about second best episodes, there's the one where like he has to go to Japan and then fight the guy in the volcano area.

110
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:53,118
Scott: Oh yeah.

111
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:53,987
Scott: He learns kung fu.

112
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:04,868
Rym: So yeah, name the new computer and I pre-ordered the one terabyte crazy drive that's going to come like right away in the new year and then it'll be complete.

113
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:05,354
Rym: Hmm.

114
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:06,809
Rym: And it's good times.

115
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:08,628
Rym: So I got any news?

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,355
Scott: I have more news.

117
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,001
Scott: no one will care about but me.

118
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:12,850
Rym: It's the lounge.

119
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,922
Rym: You can talk about anything.

120
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:16,139
Rym: So kpop, right?

121
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,253
Scott: No, but you're close.

122
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,286
Rym: Oh, jpop?

123
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:18,549
Scott: No.

124
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,043
Scott: In 2012, I watched the show running man.

125
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:26,550
Scott: It has nothing to do with the running man of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

126
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,381
Scott: Right.

127
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:29,799
Rym: And I like that show.

128
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,918
Rym: I feel like I should have watched more of it.

129
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:36,017
Scott: They've made an episode I think every single week since 2010.

130
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,609
Scott: The show is six years old, right?

131
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:43,857
Scott: But you know, the show has like incredible international.

132
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:44,846
Scott: It's weird, right?

133
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:52,381
Scott: Is that somehow Korea manages to make a lot of things that are internationally popular but not as popular in their own country.

134
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:58,529
Scott: Like there's a new kpop group called card that oh my God has dudes and girls in it.

135
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:05,958
Scott: They've done that a few times, but it's the only active one I know of right now and their song is way good and like.

136
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,503
Scott: if you go on the internet to English speaking communities it's like people are so into it like oh my God, this is the best.

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,010
Scott: But if you go like the Korean people don't give a fuck.

138
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,785
Scott: and it's like oh my God, what's wrong with you?

139
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:25,210
Scott: But anyway running man like about a month ago, my favorite member of the show left because he's like all right, I've been on this for six years.

140
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:27,148
Scott: That's enough of that, right?

141
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,150
Scott: But the rest of the people kept going.

142
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,010
Scott: they kept going.

143
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:38,750
Scott: But then there was a whole bunch of drama and I don't want to spend time talking about the details of the drama because it doesn't really matter and it's not that interesting.

144
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,849
Scott: The point is the show is going to end for end for real.

145
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,057
Rym: Oh man, that finale episode is going to be off the fucking hook.

146
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,240
Scott: Originally there wasn't going to be like a finale.

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:48,605
Rym: What?

148
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:51,756
Scott: Yeah, it was weird dramas you can read about on the internet if you want.

149
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:58,564
Rym: I'm curious because that show that's the kind of show that is designed to have like the finale that is remembered for all time.

150
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,038
Scott: Well, I mean, so here's the dramas then.

151
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:09,756
Scott: So the show had seven, you know, I guess for it started off with a different number of members, but it quickly solidified to the seven core members and it was like.

152
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:14,483
Scott: the appeal of the show really is that they were sort of like a family together.

153
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,007
Rym: Oh, the old cast is going to be together in a new show now.

154
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:21,846
Rym: The old cast is going to be together in a new show supposedly.

155
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:25,837
Scott: Maybe we'll see about that anyway.

156
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,587
Scott: But yeah, you can't trust any of these news because they change every day.

157
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:40,810
Scott: But what happened was is somebody leaked that two of the people were getting kicked off the show and this other famous guy who's not a bad guy was going to be added in and they were going to do something new, like a season running man to or something.

158
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:45,334
Scott: But those two people who are on the show, they didn't hear that first from anyone right.

159
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,568
Scott: They heard it from the news first.

160
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:47,880
Scott: They were right.

161
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,246
Scott: And then it was like, oh, they're pissed now.

162
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,689
Scott: And oh, the other guy is not going to join the new show.

163
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,985
Scott: And and then they're like, you're just going to kick us out.

164
00:09:56,026 --> 00:10:01,900
Scott: And so now I guess the latest news I heard was that they're just going to keep doing the show.

165
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:11,699
Scott: The two people who, you know, were pissed are going to give all their remaining salaries from a running man to charity to be like, look, we're not just staying for the money's right.

166
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,162
Scott: We're staying because of loyalty or whatever.

167
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:17,436
Scott: And then they're going to end in February.

168
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,750
Rym: There's a lot of stuff.

169
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,385
Rym: So apparently over recent term, the viewership had been dropping.

170
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:35,981
Scott: If you're just driving for years because the show itself, the content of the show was not really, you know, staying up to previous, you know, demand up to previous quality.

171
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:42,101
Scott: I mean, that double of seven episode, like but part of it part of it was because, hey, the show is six years old.

172
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:42,303
Scott: Right.

173
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,747
Scott: And it's a physical activity show that's every week.

174
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:44,989
Scott: Yeah.

175
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,103
Scott: An hour long to us.

176
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:51,838
Rym: We have coming up with a half hour show to do literally anything.

177
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,303
Scott: So it's not just ideas that they were having trouble with.

178
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:54,788
Scott: Right.

179
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,566
Scott: It's like, you know, you do the same thing.

180
00:10:56,688 --> 00:11:00,324
Scott: People want some of the familiarity of the stuff they already like.

181
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,537
Scott: It's sort of like the Nintendo thing.

182
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:01,698
Scott: Right.

183
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,920
Scott: Do we just make another Metroid or we do something new?

184
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,455
Scott: It's like people already like that.

185
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:07,314
Scott: But if we keep doing the same thing, it gets old.

186
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:08,710
Scott: We need to keep keeping it fresh.

187
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:13,029
Scott: But also the show is physical in nature and these people are getting old.

188
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:17,845
Scott: They were six years younger when the show was zero years old and they were into it.

189
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:23,076
Scott: They were running around, you know, like and really trying hard and, you know, with the physical activities.

190
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:29,218
Scott: And now it's sort of like they've been doing that for a day a week or two days a week for six years.

191
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,025
Scott: Right.

192
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:34,955
Scott: It's like that's pro athlete levels of getting beat up on a not pro athlete.

193
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:41,946
Scott: People, you know, they you can see like they're all injured and they can't run as fast and they do less physical things now.

194
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,501
Scott: You know, so it's like you can't you have to get all new people.

195
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,914
Scott: If you got old people who were young, people would be like, Oh, well, fuck that.

196
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:49,480
Scott: Right.

197
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:49,965
Scott: Yeah.

198
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,622
Scott: These are my people saved by the bell.

199
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,330
Rym: The new cast.

200
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,035
Scott: Exactly.

201
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,006
Scott: You can't do that either.

202
00:11:54,066 --> 00:12:02,510
Scott: So it's like they're in this really hard place, especially since no one in their country is watching it as much anymore except for like kids and whatnot.

203
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,419
Rym: So I can't really tell.

204
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:11,425
Rym: It's hard to suck this suss this out, but as best I can tell while its viewership had been dropping, it's still the number one show on that network on the network.

205
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,942
Scott: Yes, but it's not.

206
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:16,530
Scott: It's nowhere near the number one variety show, let alone number one show period.

207
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:21,829
Scott: The number one Friday show is still Infinite Challenge on the other channel.

208
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,059
Rym: Well, it's infinite.

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,325
Scott: Infinite Challenge didn't end, but Infinite Challenge lost members to various scandals and things and whatnot.

210
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:34,459
Scott: It's not a bad show, but I just Infinite Challenge had started earlier.

211
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,195
Scott: It's 10 years old.

212
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:43,184
Scott: So when I discovered these things, it was already so old that I couldn't go back and watch all of it.

213
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:49,190
Scott: And I don't even think it's all subtitled from the very beginning, though it's reliably been subtitled for quite a few years now, though.

214
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:54,497
Rym: So as you guys might know, I talk about how I bought new skis.

215
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:55,909
Rym: I want to talk about it a little bit.

216
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,530
Scott: You're going to shush all of them?

217
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:58,884
Rym: So I went skiing.

218
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:07,330
Rym: Last year was a horrible ski season because I think El Nino messed stuff up, so it was warm and there was no snow anywhere.

219
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,850
Rym: It was crazy on the East Coast.

220
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,210
Scott: Did you see a DJZ bed when you were skiing?

221
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:12,263
Rym: I did not.

222
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,450
Scott: You didn't end up in the hospital where he's hanging?

223
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:17,569
Scott: I think he's actually out of the hospital now.

224
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,256
Scott: I was doing okay.

225
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,449
Rym: Actually, I didn't fall down.

226
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:25,896
Rym: Well, I didn't have any accidents because I went skiing for the first time this year with my new skis and there was a bunch of snow at Hunter Mountain.

227
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:30,622
Rym: A lot of snow, which is not common on the East Coast, especially in December.

228
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:34,950
Rym: We don't actually get good snow until the end of January, early February.

229
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,222
Rym: The ski season, winter is actually weird here compared to a lot of the rest of where I have skied in the past.

230
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:40,970
Scott: It wasn't.

231
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,321
Scott: It used to snow.

232
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,269
Scott: I lived in Connecticut in New York my whole life.

233
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,950
Scott: It used to snow here in November and December.

234
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,810
Rym: Hunter Mountain, you're not skiing in December unless they make the snow.

235
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:55,394
Scott: In Connecticut, I remember a Halloween where there was snow.

236
00:13:55,414 --> 00:14:04,124
Rym: Yeah, but I also remember in Beacon, a Christmas day where I got up, put on shorts, no shirt, and went for a run.

237
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:05,658
Scott: That was a decade later.

238
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:14,328
Rym: Yeah, but I do remember that one morning because I was running and all the Christmas lights were still up and it was Christmas day and I just had this moment of like, "What the fuck?

239
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:16,588
Rym: What?".

240
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:20,503
Rym: I actually ski a lot and I'm pretty good at it.

241
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:33,649
Rym: I'm not a professional skier in that no one pays me for it and all that, but I ski difficult technical terrain and I, in the near future, want to go heli-skiing and do some off-pis stuff with guides on the West Coast.

242
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:36,243
Rym: I bought new skis.

243
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:40,277
Rym: finally because I've used the same shitto skis for...

244
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,829
Scott: You didn't say they were shitto when you bought them.

245
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,910
Rym: What I said was the same thing I say about everything.

246
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:49,214
Rym: I follow my own advice and this is proof that that is the good advice.

247
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,770
Rym: because what's my advice on everything?

248
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:55,941
Rym: If you don't know why something's better, buy the cheapest version of that thing.

249
00:14:56,426 --> 00:15:00,129
Rym: Don't buy anything better than that until you can articulate what you need it for.

250
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,310
Scott: I got this crazy mixer here for GeekNights.

251
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:09,548
Scott: I can articulate what I need a $100,000 camera for but I can articulate why I need a mansion.

252
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,122
Rym: I guess it adds justification.

253
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,770
Scott: I can articulate why I need a private jet and a spaceship.

254
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,787
Rym: But you also have to have the memes.

255
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:27,534
Rym: But think, when we did GeekNights, we started with that fucking Logitech stick mic and then I bought that crapo Behringer mixer and then the bigger one.

256
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:31,429
Rym: If we had bought this mixer back then, we would have been morons.

257
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,688
Scott: Did that mixer exist then?

258
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:39,449
Rym: Mixers like it did, but actually I think you had to buy a mixer like this but then you had to buy a firewire card to stick into it.

259
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,443
Rym: This thing came later as the integrated firewire.

260
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:49,715
Scott: I remember ones that came with PCI cards that you would put in the computer and had a million cables coming out and you connect that to the mixer.

261
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,049
Rym: Weird old days.

262
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:52,743
Rym: So like microphones, right?

263
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:56,122
Rym: We bought those Radio Shack microphones and then we were like, "Okay, we're doing this

264
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:56,627
Rym: serious.".

265
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:08,910
Rym: We bought the SM57s because they were relatively cheap and while there were microphones that were way more expensive and ostensibly better, I could not come up with any way they would actually help us doing what we were doing.

266
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:17,595
Rym: And now, you might have noticed that we both use different, better microphones because we had a need and we learned and we were better and we had money and there's reasons to buy them.

267
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,757
Scott: Nah, I don't think there's a reason to buy these SM57s.

268
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:20,181
Scott: just fine.

269
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:28,300
Rym: Well, the thing is I needed to have more than two microphones for when we had people on the show and I needed the two SM57s to be able to be used for the room.

270
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,629
Rym: I got that weird mount to do a stereo to record the room because boundary mics kind of suck.

271
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,929
Rym: They're not the best for some of this stuff.

272
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,320
Scott: You didn't continue to waste money.

273
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,329
Scott: You're not buying any more money.

274
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,260
Rym: I'm not buying a better microphone than this thing that I'm using right here.

275
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:44,927
Rym: Even though two of you recently were like, "Why don't you guys use one of those fancy condenser

276
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:45,210
Rym: microphones?".

277
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:46,910
Rym: One, this is a condenser.

278
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:50,890
Rym: It just doesn't look like what you expect it to look like but this is the same kind of condenser.

279
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:55,374
Rym: Anyway, I went to a ski shop 10 years ago, more than 10 years.

280
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:56,469
Rym: God, it was a long time ago.

281
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,485
Rym: I said, "I haven't skied in 10 years.

282
00:16:58,566 --> 00:16:59,456
Rym: I want to start skiing again.

283
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,649
Rym: I want to buy skis.

284
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,000
Rym: What skis should I

285
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,264
Rym: buy?".

286
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:06,564
Rym: He reached over and he pulled some skis out and put them in front of me.

287
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:07,675
Rym: I said, "Why

288
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,060
Rym: these?".

289
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,405
Rym: He said, "Because they come up to about your

290
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:10,728
Rym: nose.".

291
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,960
Rym: Then I said, "What's the difference between these and those blue

292
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:14,183
Rym: ones?".

293
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:17,435
Rym: He said, "The blue ones are blue and they're $300

294
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:17,537
Rym: more.".

295
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,678
Rym: I asked what's better about them and he said, "If you can't tell me what's better about them, you have no business using

296
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:23,880
Rym: them.".

297
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:25,335
Scott: That's a good shop right there.

298
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,214
Scott: You don't see a lot of shops like that these days.

299
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,143
Scott: Then I needed boots.

300
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:28,769
Rym: Same shop.

301
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,646
Rym: I was like, "I'll get ski

302
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:30,890
Rym: boots.".

303
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,395
Rym: He was like, "Do you want comfortable

304
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:33,718
Rym: ones?".

305
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,346
Rym: I was like, "Is there a reason why I wouldn't want comfortable

306
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:36,589
Rym: ones?".

307
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:39,334
Rym: He handed me some boots and I said, "Are these

308
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:39,778
Rym: comfortable?".

309
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,705
Rym: He said, "They're comfortable

310
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:40,988
Rym: enough.".

311
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:44,709
Rym: I spent like $300 total on skis and boots.

312
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:50,309
Rym: I skied all the way up to Black Diamonds, like crazy skiing on cliffs and through glades.

313
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,476
Rym: I was starting to hit this plateau.

314
00:17:53,537 --> 00:18:04,810
Rym: I was having a problem where I'd ski really dangerous, difficult stuff, but I'd see other people at my skill level skiing much more smoothly and in control.

315
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:08,169
Rym: I started to feel like maybe I suck at skiing.

316
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,503
Rym: Maybe there's something I'm missing here.

317
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:16,450
Rym: I finally decided to do a lot of research and learn more about modern skis.

318
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,174
Rym: I bought modern skis based on Ski.

319
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,166
Scott: technology has improved that much in 10 years.

320
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,970
Rym: Binding technology actually did get better.

321
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:36,364
Rym: The bindings I have now are way safer than the bindings I had previously, which are way safer than the bindings I had as a kid, which are infinitely safer than the bindings of the 70s and 80s.

322
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,050
Scott: Aren't the bindings of the 70s just like two ropes?

323
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,561
Rym: No, that's like 60s.

324
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:46,076
Rym: 80s ones are like these giant plastic bricks.

325
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:47,247
Rym: You look at them and you're like, "Ah, that's

326
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:47,287
Rym: 80s.".

327
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,503
Rym: They look like they're from the 80s.

328
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:55,169
Rym: I bought these crazy fancy super stiff skis.

329
00:18:55,972 --> 00:19:00,400
Rym: I talked to ski experts and shops and they were like, "You're good, right?

330
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,298
Rym: These skis will fuck you up if you don't know what you're

331
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:02,601
Rym: doing.".

332
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:08,889
Rym: Not to belabor the point on the details of skiing because I don't think any of you guys really care that much.

333
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,309
Scott: It's a sled you cut in half and put on your feet.

334
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:12,930
Rym: Here's an example.

335
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:25,296
Rym: When I'm skiing on a very steep cliff, I want to be able to carve, meaning I want to be able to traverse across the cliff and then turn on one side of the cliff and traverse across again.

336
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,089
Rym: You don't want to just go straight down the cliff.

337
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:33,641
Rym: Sometimes maybe if you're doing a ski jump, but I don't want to go straight down the cliff because it's also covered in rocks.

338
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:38,009
Scott: If you're doing a ski jump, don't use those really long skis.

339
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,009
Scott: Ridiculously, comically long, like a clown ski.

340
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,830
Rym: Or if you're racing, but it's complicated.

341
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,829
Rym: I actually got slightly shorter skis based on the advice of experts.

342
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:51,950
Rym: When I was a kid, I actually skied on way longer skis than I ski on now.

343
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,475
Rym: I got 167s now.

344
00:19:54,672 --> 00:20:01,390
Rym: Basically, I bought super pro skis that are rated for experts and I upgraded all my shit and I took them out skiing.

345
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:03,768
Rym: I had some trouble at first.

346
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,590
Rym: Didn't seem so great.

347
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,770
Rym: I started skiing, right?

348
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:09,900
Rym: It doesn't feel great.

349
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,869
Scott: It doesn't feel that fun.

350
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,829
Scott: There were new skis that just went on the bunny hill to make sure they worked?

351
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,569
Rym: No, I went right to the big stuff.

352
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,110
Rym: But not the crazy stuff.

353
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,170
Rym: At Hunter Mountain, I went to Hell Gate.

354
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,750
Rym: The black diamond that goes down the front of the mountain.

355
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:26,989
Rym: The basic, regular black diamond trail.

356
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:29,549
Rym: I'm having trouble with them.

357
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,662
Rym: I'm trying them out.

358
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:31,229
Rym: Remember how to ski?

359
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,754
Rym: And then I thought about the experts and why I bought these skis and I said fuck it.

360
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:41,369
Rym: And I went to the crazy cliff trail and I just jumped down and skied as fast as I could.

361
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:43,229
Rym: Holy shit.

362
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:44,950
Rym: These skis are amazing.

363
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,510
Rym: But the reviews were kind of right.

364
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,490
Rym: They kind of suck if you're going slow.

365
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:54,189
Rym: If you're going fast, they give you this level of control that I've never had before.

366
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,419
Scott: It's like an F1 car.

367
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,589
Scott: If you go slow, it doesn't work.

368
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:03,703
Scott: You have to go fast enough to heat up the brakes because if you don't heat up the brakes and heat up the tires then you won't be able to stop and you won't be able to go.

369
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,423
Scott: You can't drive an F1 car around the track at like 60 miles an hour.

370
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:08,929
Scott: It won't work.

371
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,040
Scott: You need to go 100, 200 miles an hour.

372
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,530
Scott: That's how it's designed.

373
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:19,150
Rym: But the moral of this is I do not waste money on stuff.

374
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,390
Rym: Sometimes I waste money on stuff.

375
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,288
Scott: You waste money on a lot of stuff.

376
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:32,338
Scott: But when it comes to expert equipment or specialized equipment you will at least have an excuse to where nobody can argue with you and tell you that you wasted money.

377
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:36,468
Scott: Even if you may have you can justify it to yourself and others with words.

378
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,389
Rym: And that is a very important skill to have in life.

379
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,648
Scott: But you still wasted money.

380
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,315
Rym: So I didn't though.

381
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:47,266
Rym: I got Atomic Black Eye Titanium Arc XTO-12.

382
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:51,449
Scott: That sounds like words to make room spend money, Ski.

383
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,218
Rym: But I bought last year's model brand new for 50% off.

384
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,737
Scott: I bought last year's model bicycle brand new for like 25% off.

385
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,969
Rym: The moral is just that advice that we give is totally legit.

386
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,349
Rym: Buy the cheapest thing that will do the job.

387
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,135
Rym: Learn as much as you can from that thing.

388
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:17,069
Rym: Like I was skiing Crazy Black Diamonds on skis that are not made for that.

389
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:21,549
Rym: And as a result, I really understood what I was doing when I got on the bigger stuff.

390
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,540
Rym: Like it was worth it.

391
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:23,269
Rym: It was the time.

392
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:24,989
Rym: That is the way to live your life.

393
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,650
Rym: Buy the shittiest office chair possible or the best office chair possible.

394
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,898
Rym: You'll notice I'm still sitting in my Aeron and Scott's still sitting at home in his human freedom.

395
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:37,170
Rym: Human scale freedom chair with the optional headrest.

396
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,169
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

397
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,940
Rym: I present to you the Scott Forgot his thing of the day!

398
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,515
Rym: My thing of the day is Shazam!

399
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:51,959
Rym: This movie!

400
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,723
Scott: No!

401
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:53,800
Scott: The movie doesn't exist!

402
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:55,278
Scott: No such movie!

403
00:22:56,306 --> 00:23:01,300
Rym: I kind of think the people who think Shazam exists are actually just racist and confuse the actors.

404
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,920
Rym: because I remembered people said Shazam's not a movie.

405
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,996
Rym: And the first thing I thought was, "Bullshit!

406
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:07,642
Rym: I saw that

407
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:08,047
Rym: movie!".

408
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,158
Rym: And then I googled for it and the answer was, "Oh no, I'm thinking of

409
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,208
Rym: Kazam!".

410
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,634
Scott: See, I remember Kazam definitely.

411
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:15,200
Scott: I didn't see it.

412
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Scott: But I remember seeing commercials for it, right?

413
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:21,826
Scott: But I have a vaguer memory of Shazam.

414
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:35,079
Scott: I sort of remember like I don't remember a movie like some of these people are like, "Oh yeah, I worked in a blockbuster and I had it on VHS and there were two copies and everyone kept checking it in and out and I had to watch it over and over.

415
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:37,666
Scott: and I definitely remember this movie.

416
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,606
Scott: It totally existed.

417
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,559
Scott: I don't remember a movie.

418
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:52,757
Scott: But I do remember Sinbad the Comedian in a pirate genie sort of setting on TV doing something like a TV commercial or something of the sort.

419
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:55,140
Scott: And that's all I remember.

420
00:23:55,321 --> 00:24:00,854
Scott: So when people say, "Oh yeah, this movie with Sinbad was a genie named

421
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:01,459
Scott: Shazam!"

422
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:10,470
Scott: It's like it matches enough things else in my memory that it sort of falsely pieces them together, these true things into a false thing.

423
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:10,894
Rym: Yep.

424
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:14,713
Rym: But I guess for me, I immediately thought that was Shaq, not Sinbad.

425
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,248
Rym: And then I looked it up like, "Oh

426
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:16,450
Rym: no!".

427
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:21,179
Scott: I didn't think that was Shaq not Sinbad, but I said, "Oh yeah, there was Kazam and Shazam, I

428
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,644
Scott: remember.".

429
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:25,899
Rym: The important thing is as a kid, I remember that Sinbad was not funny.

430
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,331
Scott: Sinbad the Comedian?

431
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:28,876
Scott: Not funny.

432
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,209
Scott: I don't remember any of his comedy at all, but I remember him you know.

433
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,611
Scott: I remember him fondly, but I don't think he was funny.

434
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:40,352
Scott: I don't remember him being a bad guy, but I don't remember watching him on purpose.

435
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:44,211
Scott: I remember jokes about Sinbad more than jokes told by Sinbad.

436
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:49,748
Rym: Kind of like how in the future we might remember who Jimmy Fallon was just because people make fun of him for his Boteau's comedy stylings.

437
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:50,780
Scott: Right, well that's what I'm saying.

438
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:56,150
Scott: At this point even, there are more people remember more jokes about Seinfeld.

439
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:06,459
Rym: Kids who grew up in the 70s who's in the 70s and 80s remember Ishtar because that was the default name of a bad movie that Mad Magazine would use whenever they wanted to talk about a bad movie.

440
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,633
Rym: None of us have seen Ishtar.

441
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,150
Rym: Well, I have, but no one else has.

442
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,919
Scott: You can see it if you want.

443
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:12,436
Rym: You don't want to.

444
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:12,699
Scott: Why not?

445
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,629
Rym: It's not a good movie.

446
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:14,640
Scott: How bad could it be?

447
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:18,338
Rym: It's just really, really, really unremarkable that movie.

448
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:24,540
Rym: So anyway, the thing of the day is actually, I'm just trying to stall to give Scott time to remember his thing of the day.

449
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,509
Scott: No, I got it.

450
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,357
Scott: Alright.

451
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:33,084
Rym: There's a video of a driver in New York City who keeps his dash cam on, which if you're like an Uber driver or whatever, you really should do that.

452
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,648
Rym: I mean, I do that on my bike, on my commute.

453
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:36,052
Rym: Yeah.

454
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:40,640
Rym: But I guess his thing is trying to hit as many green lights in a row as possible.

455
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:44,519
Scott: Yeah, if you're really bored, your job is driving, shouldn't you be doing something like that?

456
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:54,060
Rym: This guy exceeded all expectations, and this is a video, both a sped up one and the real-time uncut one to prove he's not cheating.

457
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:00,036
Rym: 240 green lights in a row in motherfucking Manhattan and not at like three in the morning.

458
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:03,531
Scott: So he just knows the timing of the lights and how to hit them.

459
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,157
Scott: And he's practiced so much.

460
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:06,926
Scott: He's got skills.

461
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,800
Scott: Also, if I need a cab, how can I get this guy specifically?

462
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,416
Rym: More trucks are out at night.

463
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,031
Rym: A lot more Uber cars are on the road.

464
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:17,259
Rym: I was hoping to push my goal up to a large number, like 500 green lights, but I'll settle for this.

465
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,510
Rym: No stopping.

466
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:19,300
Scott: Smooth.

467
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:20,910
Rym: Mostly smooth sailing.

468
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,559
Scott: Any block in the box and like running the yellows?

469
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,448
Rym: He's a little aggressive to catch some lights.

470
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:32,265
Rym: Slows down a little bit to like wait for something to turn green when it's off in the distance.

471
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:35,400
Scott: So it's red in the distance, but he's still moving.

472
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,112
Scott: He doesn't completely 100% stop.

473
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:38,810
Rym: Can't just stop.

474
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,360
Scott: But he gets down to like 0.01 miles an hour and creeps.

475
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:42,999
Rym: Actually, he keeps a pretty good clip.

476
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,731
Rym: It's a pretty impressive video.

477
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:45,800
Rym: I didn't watch the whole thing.

478
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,019
Rym: It's 26 minutes long.

479
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,457
Scott: The DOT should check this video out and they could figure out some stuff.

480
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:56,480
Rym: It's not as exciting as that other video, the guy who raced the lap around Manhattan.

481
00:26:58,403 --> 00:26:59,938
Rym: I think we used that as a thing a day a while ago.

482
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Rym: So what do you got?

483
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:04,819
Scott: So, Rym, you had El Parrot when you were a kid, right?

484
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:12,012
Rym: Yes, Dusty the African Gray who could mimic my voice perfectly and would sometimes yell, "Mom, I'm

485
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:12,415
Rym: home!"

486
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:15,749
Rym: randomly during the day freaking my mom out.

487
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:16,920
Rym: Dusty was a good bird.

488
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,647
Rym: Well, he is a good bird.

489
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:22,635
Rym: Dusty will outlive all of my adult relatives.

490
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:25,116
Scott: Like everyone who was an adult when I was a kid.

491
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:26,046
Rym: Dusty's out in Arizona.

492
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:28,419
Rym: Dusty will outlive my mom pretty much guaranteed.

493
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,544
Scott: Then what?

494
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,162
Rym: Then my brother's gonna take her.

495
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:31,710
Scott: Okay.

496
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:32,380
Scott: Then what?

497
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:36,670
Rym: Well, if she also outlives my brother, I guess I'll take her.

498
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,865
Scott: Your brother's younger than you.

499
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:41,552
Scott: Yeah, he is.

500
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,636
Scott: You're gonna be dead first.

501
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,940
Scott: So I guess don't buy a parrot unless you have children.

502
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:51,519
Rym: If you get a real parrot, one, you gotta treat them like a kid.

503
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,017
Rym: You can't just leave them home alone.

504
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:54,804
Rym: They'll go crazy.

505
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,613
Rym: You have to play with them every day like they're a real human being.

506
00:27:57,633 --> 00:28:00,000
Rym: They're as smart as a two to three year old human.

507
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:05,518
Scott: But anyway, so this parrot, someone has one and it says stuff because that's what they do.

508
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:11,219
Scott: This one says something way awesome that I've never seen any other animal say.

509
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:13,256
Scott: It's a 15 second video.

510
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:13,499
Scott: Enjoy.

511
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:15,479
Rym: It's actually real good.

512
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,443
Rym: So Dusty did a lot of stuff like that but I won't tell those stories right now because it spoils the video.

513
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:21,292
Rym: You just watch the video.

514
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:23,211
Rym: You'll figure out what's going on real quick.

515
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:24,443
Scott: I mean the title of the video.

516
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:29,959
Rym: Yeah, but when you see the title, like the video comes up, you're like ah, makes sense.

517
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:33,720
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is Rebecca.

518
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,012
Scott: Kindle says that I have how much time left.

519
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:44,408
Scott: The thing is I can't trust the Kindle time because like I'll read for 15 minutes and the time will go down by like an hour.

520
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:50,830
Scott: It says I have five hours and 45 minutes left and I'm at the beginning of chapter 13. so who knows.

521
00:28:50,931 --> 00:29:00,238
Rym: It moves around on me too, partly because like I'll be reading on the subway but then I have to transfer and I just like walk with it open, not reading the page for a while and that like messes up its calculations I think.

522
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,452
Rym: Like I can't really trust that number.

523
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:06,364
Scott: I'm at the beginning of chapter, what'd I just say, 13.

524
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,409
Rym: I'm only a couple chapters in but I'll burn through it pretty quick.

525
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,879
Scott: It says I got less than six hours so I could probably, I'll be done reading this by the end of the year.

526
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:24,206
Rym: It's still fucking me up because I remember a lot of this but I don't clearly know if I've actually seen the movie or if I'm just remembering pieces of it and other movies altogether.

527
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:25,940
Scott: Well after we finish the book, we'll watch the movie again.

528
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:31,540
Scott: I've only seen the movie like two times and not recently, not since like maybe Beacon or earlier.

529
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,945
Rym: Oh dude, if I saw the movie, I was single digit age at most like six to eight years old is when I saw it.

530
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,379
Scott: Oh no, definitely the first time I saw it I was definitely at least two digits in age.

531
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:45,040
Rym: I watch a lot of awesome horror movies and such as a little kid.

532
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,169
Scott: It's not a horror movie.

533
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:47,703
Rym: It's pretty lugubrious though.

534
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:48,652
Scott: It's a Hitchcock movie.

535
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,914
Scott: It's lugubrious and it's suspenseful.

536
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,126
Rym: It's also really, really...

537
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,219
Scott: It's not suspenseful in chapter two though.

538
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:56,308
Rym: Well, you know what?

539
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:12,896
Rym: Chapter one and two are interesting in that they're so far, you know, no spoilers obviously, there's like this deep undercurrent of dread of like, we're avoiding thinking about the thing that happened.

540
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,617
Scott: that casts a pall over the rest of our lives.

541
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,629
Scott: Right, yeah, the flashback.

542
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:21,760
Rym: Like everything's just very nice and the dream and everything's just very sinister.

543
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:24,007
Rym: and you're like, what the fuck happened to these people?

544
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,840
Scott: It is sinister.

545
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,479
Scott: It's not a feel good movie.

546
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,459
Scott: It's Alfred Hitchcock movie.

547
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,258
Scott: You think Alfred Hitchcock isn't going to pick up like Bambi?

548
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,838
Scott: Bambi's sinister too though.

549
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,728
Scott: Anyway.

550
00:30:40,768 --> 00:30:42,892
Rym: So yeah, we're going to be at MAGFest coming up real soon.

551
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:44,934
Rym: We're between Scott and I. We're on six panels.

552
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,128
Rym: It's going to be good times.

553
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:47,000
Rym: PAX South.

554
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:48,519
Rym: Nah, it's coming.

555
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,719
Rym: Not too long after that.

556
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,499
Rym: We're going to be doing at least one panel.

557
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:57,198
Rym: I'm really excited about MAGFest and we'll hopefully see you there.

558
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,478
Rym: So yeah, I guess Christmas is coming up where we celebrate the birth of Shazam.

559
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,293
Scott: We've definitely done many holiday episodes.

560
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:06,979
Scott: We have not.

561
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,917
Scott: You deleted them.

562
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:14,939
Rym: So, you know, we did them, actually we talked about Christmas in the review we did of that movie Shazam.

563
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:36,514
Rym: So, I noticed looking at the archive of GeekNights that last year around this time, like September or October we did a show on Thanksgiving as a holiday which reeks of the situation that happens to me and Scott all the time where we'll rack our brains for a show idea and then one of us will have a dumb idea like,

564
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:37,019
Scott: "Hey,

565
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,939
Rym: what are we going to do a show on?

566
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,827
Rym: I don't know, submarine

567
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:40,514
Rym: sandwiches.".

568
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:46,812
Rym: And the other one will inevitably say, "We've definitely done a show on submarine sandwiches in the last 16 years of our

569
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:47,235
Rym: lives.".

570
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:54,399
Rym: And then it'll turn out that no, somehow that topic never talked about, never did it, never happened.

571
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:04,998
Rym: And I feel like that happened with the Thanksgiving episode last year and I feel like there's an untapped well of holiday-related episodes that we could fill a lot of Thursdays with.

572
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:06,938
Rym: So, yeah.

573
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,392
Rym: Christmas is coming up.

574
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:10,480
Rym: Yep.

575
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:11,800
Rym: It's Christmas.

576
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,520
Scott: We've done, I think, two Halloween shows maybe.

577
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,062
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:20,255
Rym: When I searched for Christmas in the archive, I found an episode that started promising.

579
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:25,973
Rym: It was like, "Tonight on a very special Christmas episode of GeekNights, we review Hotline

580
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:26,419
Rym: Miami.".

581
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,779
Rym: And I think we actually recorded it on Christmas Day.

582
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:38,219
Rym: So, Christmas as an adult, like the way I had this holiday season is interesting because I've actually sort of resolved over the years.

583
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:43,491
Rym: I very rarely travel anywhere on Thanksgiving or Christmas anymore.

584
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:44,037
Scott: Why would you?

585
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:44,724
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

586
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:45,067
Scott: Yeah.

587
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:53,571
Rym: And I've tried to convince everyone in my life who really wants to see me on Christmas to sort of defer that and like, "I'll visit in January" or "I'll come in like

588
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:54,279
Rym: October.".

589
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,905
Rym: Like, we'll shift the holiday so I don't have to actually travel on Christmas.

590
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:01,128
Scott: It doesn't matter what arbitrary day you see someone.

591
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:02,864
Scott: If you see someone every year, it's like,

592
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:03,228
Scott: "Okay.".

593
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:06,544
Rym: But you gotta get people on bar because you always have like the grandma who's like, "But it's

594
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,272
Rym: Christmas.".

595
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:07,980
Scott: Get bent, grandma.

596
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:09,960
Rym: You did dick, grandma.

597
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,585
Scott: That's right.

598
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,020
Rym: So, once again, I'm just staying home and maybe I'll even go.

599
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,360
Rym: in fact, I think I might go skiing on Christmas.

600
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:17,694
Rym: That's actually not a bad idea.

601
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:18,240
Scott: Is it open?

602
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:18,803
Rym: Yeah.

603
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,695
Rym: How many people are gonna be skiing?

604
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:22,180
Rym: Maybe a lot.

605
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,523
Rym: I don't know.

606
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,159
Rym: I've never skied on Christmas Day, I don't think.

607
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,675
Scott: On Christmas, I go to the movies and eat Chinese food.

608
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,644
Rym: That's what I usually do.

609
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:30,846
Scott: That's how a non-believing Jew do.

610
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:31,412
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:33,028
Scott: And how I also believe in Jew do.

612
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,786
Rym: Or like you and me and Jews or something.

613
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,260
Scott: Because those are the only things that are open on Christmas.

614
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:45,048
Rym: We'll go hang out and get some, we'll get those, what was that, the Arab, the lamb dish covered in those spices that we got at that Chinese place.

615
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,260
Scott: Oh, that's open on Christmas?

616
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:48,420
Rym: That place is definitely open on Christmas.

617
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:56,299
Rym: I remember that dish had a weird name and it had more spices on it than you could, it was a ridiculous amount of spices on that lamb.

618
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:57,536
Rym: But it was pretty good.

619
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,755
Rym: So yeah, Christmas now is, like Christmas Day is barely at all a holiday for me.

620
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:11,147
Rym: I guess I wake up and I sort of think in my head the like end of Ebenezer Scrooge's Odyssey, like it's Christmas, it's Christmas.

621
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:15,270
Rym: But then I just like play video games and dick around and eat some Chinese food.

622
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:30,340
Scott: Yeah, the main problem with Christmas is that if you're not celebrating it and you're not with people and even though there's a few things open I guess like skiing and Chinese food and movies drugstores, sure is that not very few people are like that, right?

623
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,359
Scott: At least, you know, per unit space.

624
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:38,239
Scott: So you're usually like you know, alone-ish and cold-ish, right?

625
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:39,610
Scott: It's in the winter.

626
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,429
Rym: And like you log into Overwatch or Counter-Strike, no one else is online.

627
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,460
Scott: Yeah, there's not a lot of people.

628
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,500
Scott: there's not a lot of people making content on the internet.

629
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:51,859
Scott: so even you think, oh, there's people on the internet and they are but the people actually making stuff aren't working, right?

630
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,699
Scott: You're not gonna get new posts on like your websites or you're not gonna get new content in your video games.

631
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:01,860
Scott: You just gotta play your existing stuff, you know, new stuff is not happening.

632
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:19,477
Scott: whether you observe the holiday or give a shit or not you know, as long as you live in a part of the world that does like we do, it's sort of like, alright, it's Christmas but I do enjoy the like two weeks before and the week after Christmas.

633
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:25,459
Rym: and just like the Christmas music is playing and there's lights and everyone's like I mean, other people, right?

634
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:29,520
Scott: Including me, I hate that the Christmas shit shows up too early.

635
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:35,035
Scott: it's like it's not even Halloween yet and they're putting the lights on the tree and I'm like, oh, fuck you, get that shit down.

636
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:39,942
Rym: Yup, like Black Friday is literally the earliest that is even defensible in my opinion.

637
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:41,420
Scott: That's not, it's barely defensible, right?

638
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,553
Rym: Defensible at all, it is indefensible to go before that.

639
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:46,230
Rym: But at the same time It's a war crime.

640
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:54,835
Scott: If Christmas is 12 or fewer days away if it's like December 13, 14 If it's 13, 14, 15 like, I can't deny you.

641
00:35:55,017 --> 00:36:08,552
Scott: Also despite whether you know, what the lyrics are there are many Christmas carols that I do not find annoying and in fact enjoy that many other people do not enjoy.

642
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:13,180
Rym: Oh, Scott do we talk about Christmas music right now or do we do a separate show on that in the future?

643
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,209
Scott: I'm just saying is that there's a lot of people, even Goyim, who are like hating on Christmas music.

644
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:19,199
Rym: Yeah, you know what though?

645
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:25,620
Scott: I'll hate on Christmas music if I hear it in September Sure, but it's like you know, I like a Burl Live.

646
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:28,267
Scott: I'll take all the Burl Live you're gonna send me.

647
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:29,159
Scott: I don't give a shit.

648
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:32,024
Scott: I'm an atheist Jew and you give me all the Burl Live you got.

649
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:35,180
Rym: Today I was walking down the street and I heard that holly jolly Christmas song.

650
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:36,267
Rym: That's Burl Live.

651
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:37,579
Scott: Yeah, I really like that song.

652
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,326
Scott: It's a great song.

653
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,248
Scott: Feliz Navidad, people are like so angry.

654
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:42,519
Scott: It's like, no man Feliz all the time.

655
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:44,530
Scott: Give me some more Feliz.

656
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,793
Rym: Navidad today but Feliz every day.

657
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:47,359
Scott: That's right.

658
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:51,079
Rym: Alright, Scott what are your top three Christmas songs?

659
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,869
Scott: Top three?

660
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,399
Rym: Top three.

661
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:53,931
Rym: No particular order.

662
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,274
Scott: Number one is the easiest so we'll go three, two, one.

663
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:56,699
Scott: Alright.

664
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,900
Scott: Three, John Lennon.

665
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:01,769
Rym: Yeah, so this is Christmas and Happy New Year.

666
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,193
Rym: Yes.

667
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:07,180
Scott: Two Thank God it's Christmas Freddie Mercury.

668
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:12,056
Scott: Number one Christmas is Hollis Run DMC.

669
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:22,659
Rym: So, despite being not just an atheist but kind of like one of those angry militant atheists like, you know I can't associate with them.

670
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:24,139
Scott: they're so bad.

671
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:27,317
Rym: I'm angry militant in the like.

672
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:30,875
Rym: atheism is the thing that actually I am mad about.

673
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:36,549
Scott: I definitely do not believe in God but the thing that people who are in an atheist community all the other things.

674
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,204
Scott: Misogyny and fedoras.

675
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:43,259
Scott: All the other things that they're into like Islamophobia and I'm not into that.

676
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:48,450
Rym: Yeah, you say you're an atheist dude with a but those are the guys like burning down Christmas trees.

677
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:49,018
Scott: It's like.

678
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:53,460
Scott: no, I'm down with the guys who put out the Satan display on the town lawn.

679
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:54,650
Rym: I'm pro them.

680
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,084
Scott: I'm down with the people who put like the Festivus pole on the town lawn.

681
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,379
Rym: Yeah, or the like.

682
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:03,620
Rym: it's a nativity scene but like it's Obi-Wan and a bunch of stormtroopers.

683
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:04,832
Scott: Oh man, it's so hot.

684
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:05,378
Scott: Yeah, it is.

685
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,520
Scott: Right, but like the neighbor like in the behind my apartment has like I guess they're actually religious.

686
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,699
Scott: they got like an infledo nativity scene.

687
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:19,017
Rym: That feels really middle class Americana.

688
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,932
Scott: Well, they're definitely.

689
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,298
Scott: it's kind of sad looking but it's also kind of cute.

690
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:28,224
Scott: but the super realistic nativity scene at the catholic church across the street that's kind of creepy.

691
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:31,760
Rym: Yeah, I just got I grew up and went to a catholic school.

692
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:39,135
Scott: Yeah, it's like the nativity scene at the church is creepy but the infledo one kind of looks like a halloween decoration and plus it's got three kings.

693
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,759
Scott: It's like dude I don't give a fuck about Jesus but three kings.

694
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:47,860
Rym: but I actually I actually really like some of the like very Swedish hockey jersey three kings.

695
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:53,439
Rym: very stoic and serious Christmas songs like Oh Holy Night actually might be my favorite Christmas song.

696
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:54,609
Scott: Not into that.

697
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,234
Rym: I like that song.

698
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:56,526
Rym: I like Silent Night too.

699
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:03,096
Rym: Mostly not into that because I like it on a pipe organ and basically your list after that.

700
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,590
Rym: but yeah but it was so alright fine.

701
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,360
Rym: if I can't use anything on your list I'm gonna go with Holly Jolly Christmas.

702
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:10,673
Scott: Yeah, it's number four.

703
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:11,986
Rym: Yeah, that's my number three then.

704
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:12,935
Rym: I'll use that.

705
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:13,824
Rym: I like that song a lot.

706
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:15,440
Rym: It's been running through my head all day.

707
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,329
Scott: You know another one.

708
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:16,773
Scott: I like that.

709
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:18,470
Scott: everyone else hates Yeah?

710
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:19,986
Scott: Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.

711
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:21,120
Rym: Ah, fuck that song!

712
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:22,208
Rym: Fuck you!

713
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:23,360
Scott: Fuck that song!

714
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,859
Scott: People hate that song but you know what?

715
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,180
Scott: It's got that little guitar part where it goes.

716
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,694
Scott: I like that.

717
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:30,830
Rym: Scott, you you know what it is?

718
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,699
Rym: You know what this is like?

719
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:43,684
Rym: It's like if you see someone who doesn't know anything about computers they have a computer and they use it but they don't know anything about it and they're just like man that internet explorer is just like the most amazing athlete like I've ever run.

720
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:44,653
Rym: Like it's great.

721
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,755
Rym: That is how I feel when someone says they like Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.

722
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,539
Scott: One that song is not rock.

723
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:53,080
Scott: that song is just like... Who said it's rock?

724
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,247
Scott: I just like the song.

725
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:54,753
Scott: Then what?

726
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:58,472
Rym: It's just like straight eighth notes and terrible lyrics.

727
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:02,070
Scott: Don't give a shit I mean all the songs have terrible lyrics Most of them.

728
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,006
Scott: What's your best?

729
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,580
Rym: What's your favorite Christmas movie?

730
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:07,100
Rym: that's not the ironic.

731
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,492
Rym: it's not actually about a Christmas.

732
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:10,348
Rym: It just happens to occur on Christmas.

733
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:10,852
Rym: Die Hard.

734
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:11,700
Scott: So not Die Hard?

735
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,752
Scott: Yeah not Die Hard.

736
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,691
Scott: So what counts as a Christmas movie?

737
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,800
Scott: I guess Christmas has to.

738
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:17,319
Scott: Does Nightmare Before Christmas count?

739
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,144
Rym: Damn it.

740
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:19,195
Rym: Yeah probably.

741
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:20,023
Scott: But that's not my favorite.

742
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:20,992
Scott: I'm just asking if it counts.

743
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:21,840
Rym: I think it counts.

744
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,487
Scott: I'm not picking it.

745
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:24,873
Rym: I think it might have to have Santa in it.

746
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,146
Rym: At least implied.

747
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,500
Scott: It has to have literal Santa?

748
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,140
Rym: Or at least an implied Santa.

749
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,025
Scott: So I can't pick.

750
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:30,873
Scott: It's a Wonderful Life?

751
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:31,599
Scott: Which I like?

752
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:32,968
Rym: Yeah.

753
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:33,824
Rym: It's a Wonderful Life.

754
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,020
Rym: It doesn't have the implied Santa.

755
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,885
Rym: Because most of those movies I guess I'm thinking about Christmas specials.

756
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:39,783
Rym: They always have the implied Santa.

757
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:41,719
Rym: Like who left this package here?

758
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:43,259
Rym: It must have been.

759
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,289
Rym: And then the credits roll.

760
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:51,660
Scott: I can't pick National Lampoon Christmas where the cat burns down the tree or whatever.

761
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,149
Rym: So because so the ski bus that I take sometimes.

762
00:40:56,169 --> 00:41:00,694
Scott: It shows that movie because that's a very appropriate movie to show on a ski bus in December.

763
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:01,986
Rym: One of them shows.

764
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:03,117
Rym: There's multiple buses I can take.

765
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:09,683
Rym: One of them shows the regular vacation movie until it's December and then they show the Christmas vacation movie.

766
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:13,076
Scott: I feel like that's like the most appropriate movie to show when someone's skiing.

767
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,520
Rym: However there's a better more appropriate movie.

768
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:16,128
Scott: I know one.

769
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:16,940
Rym: Better Off Dead.

770
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,249
Scott: I don't know what that is.

771
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,119
Rym: But how did?

772
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:20,532
Rym: you're the same age as me.

773
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:22,168
Rym: At least younger people have an excuse.

774
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,340
Rym: That's the.

775
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,659
Rym: I guess you had to be born in like 81 or 80 to remember that movie.

776
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:29,824
Rym: It's about a guy who's gonna die skiing.

777
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:30,995
Rym: It's a comedy.

778
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:31,884
Scott: Oh he's gonna die skiing?

779
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,079
Rym: Well it's a dark comedy.

780
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:37,619
Rym: It's hard for me to really explain the plot.

781
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,659
Rym: It's kind of absurd.

782
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:41,199
Rym: We'll just leave it at that.

783
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:41,985
Rym: Better Off Dead.

784
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:43,560
Rym: I'm curious if any listeners have seen that movie.

785
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:45,945
Scott: If I ran the ski bus the movie that I would show.

786
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:46,574
Scott: Die Hard?

787
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:46,879
Scott: No.

788
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,315
Scott: Would be James Bond The Spy Who Loved Me.

789
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,140
Scott: The best skiing scene in the beginning.

790
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,379
Scott: The best skiing scene in any movie of all time.

791
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:04,475
Rym: The thing is though a lot of people are like it's hipster ironic bullshit.

792
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:05,771
Scott: Maybe I'll watch that shit when I get home.

793
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:13,579
Rym: To say that Die Hard is your favorite Christmas movie but I think it actually is my favorite Christmas movie and I still can't make a good argument to myself as to why it doesn't count.

794
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:22,120
Scott: I mean you know if you told me like if I got a choice of like a whole bunch of Christmas movies to watch right and I'm just saying which one do I want to watch?

795
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:24,360
Rym: So here are all the Christmas movies.

796
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,733
Rym: I typed best Christmas movies.

797
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:27,719
Rym: Google just gives me a list here.

798
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:29,010
Scott: Love Actually.

799
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,740
Scott: That's a great movie.

800
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,811
Scott: Scrooged.

801
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:34,459
Scott: Muppet Christmas Carol though.

802
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,711
Rym: A Christmas Story.

803
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,067
Rym: I think it's just overplayed.

804
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,308
Scott: No I think a Christmas story is not only overplayed but also overrated.

805
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:45,819
Rym: Once again fuck you you're rocking around the Christmas tree and you hate for this movie.

806
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,489
Rym: What's wrong with that movie?

807
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:50,742
Scott: I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying like I'm not into it.

808
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:56,060
Rym: I suspect you're just oversaturated from the fact that that movie is everywhere.

809
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:58,907
Scott: I've only seen it like one time.

810
00:42:58,927 --> 00:42:59,820
Scott: Wow really?

811
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,127
Scott: I noticed that it's played a whole bunch like back when I had TV.

812
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:12,500
Scott: it flipped through the channels and you'd see it on all the time but I'd only see it for like a second and that had no effect on my opinion of the one time I saw it completely.

813
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,356
Rym: Before it became a thing where like networks would air marathons of it, it was actually my family's tradition to watch it every year on Christmas Day.

814
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:21,568
Rym: Home Alone.

815
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:22,580
Rym: A Christmas movie.

816
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:25,457
Scott: Home Alone was okay when I was a kid and now is not good.

817
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,959
Rym: As a kid I really like.

818
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:34,720
Rym: for some reason this movie would make me laugh hysterically but watching it as an adult it's basically soft core torture porn.

819
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,648
Scott: It's not a good movie.

820
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:37,084
Rym: Like it's a torture porn movie.

821
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:41,774
Rym: Straight up it is just these dudes get tortured dangerously the end.

822
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:42,220
Scott: Anyway.

823
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:43,471
Rym: It's a Wonderful Life.

824
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:43,775
Scott: A+ movie.

825
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:46,739
Scott: Elf with Will Ferrell.

826
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,304
Scott: Never saw it.

827
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:48,093
Rym: So I saw it.

828
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:49,044
Scott: Also I don't think he's funny.

829
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,427
Scott: And other things I've seen him in.

830
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:52,680
Scott: I know who that is actually.

831
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:53,102
Rym: Yeah.

832
00:43:53,325 --> 00:44:00,940
Rym: A thing that's happened to me is that whenever I see there's a movie that has Will Ferrell in it I kind of assume it's gonna be just like basic shitty movie.

833
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:08,359
Rym: And Elf is actually a shockingly good movie compared to my expectations of that movie.

834
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:13,123
Rym: I saw it under duress and I enjoyed it in the end.

835
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:16,839
Rym: Like I did not regret seeing it even though I attempted to avoid seeing it.

836
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:22,054
Scott: When I was a kid the movie that was on the pay movie channels was the Santa Claus.

837
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:22,500
Rym: Oh.

838
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,095
Rym: That's on the list right here.

839
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:26,920
Rym: Right after National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Nightmare Before Christmas.

840
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,732
Scott: And back then it wasn't the worst.

841
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:30,380
Scott: Like it was.

842
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:34,620
Scott: I remember it being better than I expected but I don't remember it being good enough to where.

843
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:34,862
Scott: like.

844
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:36,759
Scott: I liked it and wanted to watch it.

845
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:44,960
Rym: I remember seeing it as like kind of a body horror movie because he started getting fat and he couldn't stop it and it just felt horrifying.

846
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,422
Scott: Yeah.

847
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:47,144
Scott: He actually like became Santa for reals.

848
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,020
Scott: Like the spirit of Santa inhabited his body.

849
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:49,645
Rym: Yup.

850
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,059
Rym: That was Tim the Tool Man Taylor too.

851
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,422
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:52,294
Scott: You know what I really like?

853
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:55,325
Scott: I like you know the Rudolph with the claymation.

854
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:55,750
Rym: Oh.

855
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,639
Rym: That's good stuff.

856
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,085
Rym: The Bumble.

857
00:44:58,106 --> 00:44:58,880
Rym: Muppet Christmas Carol.

858
00:44:59,161 --> 00:44:59,425
Scott: Yeah.

859
00:44:59,445 --> 00:44:59,953
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

860
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:00,722
Rym: White Christmas 1954.

861
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:01,247
Rym: Never seen that.

862
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:01,630
Rym: Irving Berlin.

863
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,850
Scott: I don't know what the hell that is.

864
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,468
Rym: It's Vista Vision.

865
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:07,525
Rym: It's one of those old Rosie.

866
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:07,889
Rym: Alright.

867
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,265
Rym: Bing Crosby movie.

868
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:09,730
Rym: Okay.

869
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:11,731
Rym: I've never seen it but it's one of those like ultra wide.

870
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:12,983
Scott: I never even heard of it.

871
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:14,236
Rym: Let's see.

872
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:15,467
Rym: Miracle on 34th street.

873
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:16,033
Scott: No.

874
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:16,719
Rym: You don't like it?

875
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,639
Scott: That's a Macy's commercial.

876
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:20,219
Rym: It's a part of Americana.

877
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:22,011
Scott: The new dog.

878
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:22,152
Rym: No.

879
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:23,628
Rym: We're not talking about that new Grinch movie.

880
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,669
Rym: Though the original animated Grinch.

881
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,640
Scott: Animated Grinch is fine.

882
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,265
Scott: It's okay.

883
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:28,255
Scott: Whoa.

884
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:28,680
Rym: Wait a minute.

885
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,739
Rym: So now there's a new contender for me because I always say my favorite Christmas movie is Die Hard and that might be true.

886
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,689
Rym: I forgot until just now that Gremlins is actually technically also a Christmas movie.

887
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:42,380
Scott: I guess if you count Die Hard you gotta count Gremlins.

888
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:42,885
Scott: Yeah.

889
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:45,734
Scott: But I mean I like Gremlins-ish but like.

890
00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:47,350
Rym: I haven't seen Gremlins since I was a kid.

891
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,360
Scott: If you give me a Die Hard DVD and a Gremlins DVD it's not even a difficult choice.

892
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:51,329
Scott: No.

893
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,080
Scott: Not even difficult.

894
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,620
Rym: In fact I think any Die Hard even later ones comes over Gremlins.

895
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,459
Scott: I don't know about that but.

896
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,559
Rym: Well I haven't seen Gremlins since single digit age so I gotta watch it again.

897
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,080
Rym: Oh Charlie Brown Christmas.

898
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:07,534
Scott: Is it pretty good?

899
00:46:07,676 --> 00:46:07,858
Rym: Yeah.

900
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:09,716
Rym: Just like whole jingle all the way.

901
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:09,777
Rym: No.

902
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,558
Scott: It's not as good as Great Pumpkin though.

903
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:13,272
Rym: Great Pumpkin is way better.

904
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:14,685
Scott: Which is not as good as Garfield.

905
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,868
Rym: Christmas with the cranks I did not see.

906
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:17,817
Scott: I don't know what the hell that is.

907
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:21,333
Rym: A Very Bill Murray Christmas which I've heard mixed reviews of.

908
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:22,060
Rym: I didn't actually see.

909
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:22,643
Scott: Never seen it.

910
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:24,522
Rym: They remade Miracle on 34th Street.

911
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:24,887
Rym: Oh no.

912
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:25,393
Rym: 34th Street.

913
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,797
Rym: What the fuck?

914
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,848
Rym: They did.

915
00:46:28,928 --> 00:46:29,820
Rym: What's going on here?

916
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,507
Rym: They remade it.

917
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:31,319
Scott: It's the 90's version yeah.

918
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:32,771
Rym: Wow I didn't know that existed.

919
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,656
Rym: I feel kinda dirty about it.

920
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,980
Rym: Earnest Saves Christmas.

921
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,105
Scott: Nope.

922
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,560
Scott: 1988.

923
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:39,722
Rym: Nope.

924
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:47,193
Rym: If I recall correctly I think that one scraped in the bottom of even the earnest barrel.

925
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:48,505
Scott: Look there's not that many.

926
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:50,747
Scott: You ran out of Christmas movies pretty quickly there.

927
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:51,736
Rym: Home Alone 2.

928
00:46:51,736 --> 00:46:52,888
Scott: It's a real short list.

929
00:46:53,453 --> 00:46:54,100
Rym: While You Were Sleeping.

930
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:55,279
Rym: also Christmas movie.

931
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:57,393
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

932
00:46:57,434 --> 00:46:59,211
Rym: Lethal Weapon is listed.

933
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,111
Rym: Part of it takes place on Christmas.

934
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:01,940
Scott: Sure whatever.

935
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,839
Rym: It's listed next to Die Hard.

936
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:04,564
Scott: Sure.

937
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:08,600
Rym: I guess Trading Places takes place on Christmas.

938
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,694
Rym: Batman Returns takes place on Christmas.

939
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:15,774
Scott: That is more of a Christmas movie than Die Hard is for sure.

940
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:16,399
Scott: No question.

941
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:17,898
Rym: Actually yeah.

942
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:20,300
Rym: Remember Rare Exports?

943
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,270
Scott: Did you watch that with us?

944
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,079
Scott: I didn't know what the hell that is.

945
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:22,563
Scott: Oh.

946
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:25,532
Rym: Well you didn't come right?

947
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:26,480
Rym: We went to Chase's house.

948
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,539
Rym: We watched that shit.

949
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:33,144
Rym: This is a horror movie set in like the Scandinavian wilderness.

950
00:47:33,968 --> 00:47:47,511
Rym: It's in this movie is a Christmas movie except the conceit is Santa Claus is probably real and he's treated like a monster from a classic horror movie.

951
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,677
Scott: But isn't he going to be nice to everyone and give them presents?

952
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:49,738
Rym: No.

953
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:49,799
Rym: No.

954
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:51,311
Rym: It is horrible.

955
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:54,218
Rym: This movie is like you're ultra violent like it is.

956
00:47:54,662 --> 00:47:55,996
Rym: it's like deep homage.

957
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:57,400
Scott: Why isn't Santa giving everyone presents?

958
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:01,231
Rym: You've got to see this movie Scott.

959
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:02,080
Rym: It is legit good.

960
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:02,948
Scott: Alright whatever.

961
00:48:02,968 --> 00:48:03,980
Scott: It's a good Christmas movie.

962
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,275
Rym: Or Halloween movie.

963
00:48:05,295 --> 00:48:06,345
Rym: It's one of those interchangeable.

964
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,706
Scott: Does Edward Scissorhands take place on Christmas?

965
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:09,454
Scott: Part of it.

966
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:10,364
Scott: I guess it's in the winter.

967
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:11,620
Scott: I definitely remember scenes with snow.

968
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,465
Scott: I only saw it once when the year it came out.

969
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:15,760
Rym: I also saw it the year it came out.

970
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,346
Scott: Which was when?

971
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:18,220
Scott: 1990.

972
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,960
Scott: So I was eight so I remember nothing.

973
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:25,217
Scott: I remember him cutting bushes in the snow and being in a house and people were scared of him.

974
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,771
Scott: and that's about it.

975
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:32,829
Rym: We went to the theater and as a kid my main memory for the movie was why the fuck did he give him Scissorhands?

976
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,798
Rym: He had perfectly good hands right there and that bothered me the whole movie as a kid.

977
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:40,907
Rym: Christmas town the bishop.

978
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:42,951
Rym: Oh Mickey's Christmas Carol.

979
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,540
Scott: Mickey's Christmas Carol is not as good as Muppet Christmas Carol.

980
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:50,668
Scott: But Scrooge is like the best at being Scrooge.

981
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,919
Scott: So I wish they would make a Muppet Christmas Carol and bring over Scrooge McDuck to be Scrooge.

982
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,768
Rym: That might be peak.

983
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:58,830
Rym: Scrooge McDuck like that was like that.

984
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,809
Rym: Ebenezer Scrooge is kind of legitimately terrifying.

985
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:03,660
Scott: That's how it should be.

986
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:05,500
Scott: You want to talk about a good Christmas movie?

987
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,460
Scott: The old Christmas Carol movie.

988
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,310
Scott: The real deal.

989
00:49:08,371 --> 00:49:08,919
Scott: The black and white.

990
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,399
Scott: That's the hot shit.

991
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:13,659
Scott: None of those new garbage ones.

992
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:19,199
Rym: So we were thinking about doing a Christmas special like the Bill Murray thing.

993
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,077
Scott: Like the crunchy roll thing.

994
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,846
Rym: We'd be sitting here and we'd be like ding dong.

995
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:24,693
Rym: what's that?

996
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:25,559
Rym: Who's here?

997
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,827
Rym: Oh it's I don't know Gerald from anime world order.

998
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:30,460
Scott: There's actual fucking Santa.

999
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:31,360
Rym: In the neighborhood.

1000
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,827
Rym: And then like play a recording from him and we're just fucking lazy and didn't do that.

1001
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:36,485
Scott: Yeah we're not doing any work.

1002
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:37,010
Rym: Yeah.

1003
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,586
Rym: I thought we were going to live stream it.

1004
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,950
Scott: I still can't believe we haven't done a holiday show ever.

1005
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:41,476
Scott: Ever.

1006
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:42,748
Rym: We did Thanksgiving once.

1007
00:49:43,374 --> 00:49:47,393
Scott: Facebook is adding live audio streaming which is interesting that no one else does that.

1008
00:49:47,615 --> 00:49:48,120
Rym: I saw that.

1009
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,455
Scott: We could do shout cast.

1010
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,300
Scott: We could have done shout cast in the 90's too right?

1011
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,518
Scott: I mean that still exists also.

1012
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,959
Scott: But how are people going to find that shout cast and play it?

1013
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,253
Scott: Are we going to put some weird shout cast player in our website?

1014
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:10,789
Rym: All over the Facebook thing because I feel like we can generate content on a thing like that with the rapidity that allowed like the YouTube people to get big in the early days.

1015
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:16,484
Scott: I mean you could just find some ways that when we're recording the podcast on our Facebook page a live audio thing shows up.

1016
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:20,466
Rym: I think I would need a Facebook account to actually set that up.

1017
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:23,760
Scott: Yeah you need a Facebook account and then I give it permission to access the Facebook app.

1018
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:26,183
Rym: I've never had a Facebook account in my entire life.

1019
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:28,020
Scott: I'm not giving you mine.

1020
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:31,560
Scott: It's like I could give you just permissions for the app but you need.

1021
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:32,630
Scott: you can't just log in.

1022
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,348
Scott: You can't log in as GeekNights.

1023
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:35,280
Rym: Yeah.

1024
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:39,599
Scott: You need to log in as a user who has permission on the GeekNights page.

1025
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,942
Rym: Well I guess they made a Christmas Carol again in 2009?

1026
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:44,830
Scott: I mean I assume Christmas Carol.

1027
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,889
Scott: With Jim Carrey right?

1028
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,355
Scott: I assume Christmas Carol gets remade like a thousand times.

1029
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:57,879
Scott: There was a Christmas Carol production at the Boys and Girls Club near my apartment that was running all month and it was supposedly like sort of a creepy cool one but I didn't get over there to see it.

1030
00:50:58,304 --> 00:50:59,119
Rym: Jim Carrey.

1031
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:01,700
Rym: This looks horrific.

1032
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,729
Scott: It probably is.

1033
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:03,380
Rym: Yeah.

1034
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:04,887
Rym: Alright.

1035
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:07,760
Rym: So I actually have a lot of nostalgia for like old Christmas.

1036
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,400
Rym: but when I was a kid it was interesting because Christmas really just it was literally never religious.

1037
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,638
Rym: It was just.

1038
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:20,325
Rym: I had a materialistic and specific desire to get a ton of presents because I did not have any way.

1039
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:22,732
Rym: like I couldn't just get NES games.

1040
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:23,460
Rym: I did have money.

1041
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:26,879
Rym: so I would get NES games primarily on Christmas.

1042
00:51:27,663 --> 00:51:28,531
Scott: I had Hanukkah.

1043
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:41,580
Scott: We had eight days of presents and my mom would hide the presents in the basement and then after dinner you light the candle then she goes down in the basement and comes up with the presents for that day and we would go in the basement during the week and we couldn't find shit.

1044
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,660
Scott: And we were searching hard.

1045
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,304
Scott: like if we're kids you think we're smart enough to find something right?

1046
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:47,397
Scott: I don't know how.

1047
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,056
Scott: I mean there's a bunch of junk in our basement.

1048
00:51:49,097 --> 00:51:50,857
Scott: but man we couldn't find jack shit down here.

1049
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,359
Rym: Maybe they weren't actually down there.

1050
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:57,560
Scott: Maybe sometimes you think like aha she's putting like under her shirt and then going down there.

1051
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,903
Rym: Alright Scott you wanted the pro move because I actually I do know the secret of how most parents in America solve that problem.

1052
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:08,472
Scott: I mean we were looking like in the washing machine behind the washing machine in the clothes in the.

1053
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:11,480
Rym: you know a lot of families in America have more than one car.

1054
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:14,854
Rym: all the presents are in the trunk of the lesser used car.

1055
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,986
Scott: Yeah no so but I mean like one year.

1056
00:52:18,007 --> 00:52:22,269
Scott: so here are notable episodes from presents from the basement right?

1057
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:24,820
Scott: That I just have a clear memory of right?

1058
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:31,060
Scott: One year she was like oh I got a present for all of you together to like share right?

1059
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,220
Rym: That's always that's sometimes a danger sign.

1060
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,165
Scott: Alright and I'm looking through like the Toys R Us catalog right?

1061
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:38,939
Scott: You know the circular or then there was the big book.

1062
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,200
Rym: The big book was the one I go through that with a highlighter.

1063
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:47,299
Scott: Oh yeah but it's like if you're looking through that Toys R Us and I'd be like hmm what here is appropriate for everyone.

1064
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:53,926
Scott: and keep in mind Sarah Rubin was eight years younger than me at the time and could like barely walk.

1065
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,239
Scott: so I'm like what is good for all three of us right?

1066
00:52:57,259 --> 00:53:02,027
Scott: And one of the things that I thought might be possible was Mr.

1067
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,580
Scott: Bucket because he was in the catalog.

1068
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,244
Scott: Mr.

1069
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:04,871
Rym: Bucket.

1070
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:05,376
Scott: You ever saw Mr.

1071
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:05,518
Scott: Bucket?

1072
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,856
Rym: I'm well familiar with Mr.

1073
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:09,220
Rym: Bucket.

1074
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,055
Scott: Yeah so it's fun.

1075
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:13,438
Scott: and I was right when Mr.

1076
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,207
Scott: Bucket came out.

1077
00:53:14,732 --> 00:53:15,218
Scott: So Mr.

1078
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:18,245
Scott: Bucket definitely wasn't hidden anywhere else but the basement because where the hell was she gonna?

1079
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:19,843
Scott: how was she gonna sneak him into the basement?

1080
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,289
Rym: You remember that horror movie that the AVGN made with Mr.

1081
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:22,814
Scott: Bucket right?

1082
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:23,602
Scott: But the point is Mr.

1083
00:53:23,643 --> 00:53:24,471
Scott: Bucket fucking sucks.

1084
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:25,340
Rym: Yeah.

1085
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:28,086
Scott: It was like he played with it in the kitchen immediately.

1086
00:53:28,106 --> 00:53:29,558
Scott: and then we're like alright that's the end of Mr.

1087
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:29,760
Scott: Bucket.

1088
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:30,386
Scott: good job.

1089
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:32,771
Scott: Yeah there was always that like Why'd you buy that garbage?

1090
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:33,620
Scott: I could have told you not to.

1091
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,793
Rym: Like as a kid there's always that like crazy adrenaline rush of oh shit there's presents.

1092
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:40,207
Scott: I mean because there was no internet.

1093
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:44,408
Scott: so just new things period were like a miracle regardless of what they were.

1094
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:50,409
Rym: Like when a new Simpsons episode like the night when Simpsons episode was on like whole family gather round because.

1095
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:54,510
Scott: Oh my god something's going to be on the TV that's never been on the TV before ever.

1096
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:54,914
Scott: Whoa.

1097
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:01,195
Scott: Because now I could just if no one ever made anything else ever I could watch YouTube and see new things for the rest of my life.

1098
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,591
Rym: I could just watch all those Christmas movies that we just talked about.

1099
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:07,620
Scott: The other notable episode from the basement.

1100
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:20,890
Scott: right yeah comes out of the basement and this is box and they take the wrapping paper off the box and it says like Macy's on it's like is this some kind of clothes folded up in here or something?

1101
00:54:20,951 --> 00:54:21,516
Scott: right you know.

1102
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,012
Scott: but then you take off the Macy's lid.

1103
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:31,918
Scott: it's a rectangle box like it's going to have clothes and then there's a bunch of tissue paper in there and you take off the tissue paper.

1104
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:35,844
Scott: NES game reveal Mario 3.

1105
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:36,733
Rym: ah damn.

1106
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:43,823
Scott: The golden of all goldens the platinum item had arrived that Mario 3 right there.

1107
00:54:44,086 --> 00:54:48,347
Rym: That was one hell of a year because you had to choose between Mario 3 and Zelda 2.

1108
00:54:48,347 --> 00:54:49,659
Scott: I took Mario 3 all day.

1109
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:50,900
Rym: yeah no regret.

1110
00:54:51,561 --> 00:55:00,287
Rym: so there will always be that sort of crash though like around 1pm on Christmas day when everyone's laying around and like you sort of touched all the toys.

1111
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:06,066
Rym: and now you sort of you're almost bored like you're looking at all this stuff and you're like so which one do I interact with?

1112
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:06,490
Scott: now?

1113
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:07,117
Scott: see that's the thing.

1114
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:09,845
Scott: when you get one thing a day that's not a problem.

1115
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:10,860
Scott: but you know what is a problem?

1116
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:12,591
Scott: you get your Christmas shit.

1117
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:16,087
Scott: you wake up in the fucking morning and there it is and you're not going to school.

1118
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:27,603
Scott: so you got all fucking day to burn it all out to play Mario 3. right I got Mario 3 and I played it and after it's already after dinner it's already like 6 or 7.

1119
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:32,589
Rym: we'd be up at like 4.45 in the morning to start opening shit.

1120
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:43,258
Scott: so I get this Mario 3 run upstairs and I play Mario 3 and then I go to fucking bed and then I wake up and maybe I can play like one level and then go to school.

1121
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,386
Scott: yeah and I'm in school all day.

1122
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:47,659
Scott: there's no.

1123
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:53,984
Scott: Hanukkah doesn't cancel school or anything right in December it's cold and I'm in school all day just like.

1124
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:55,941
Scott: gotta get home and fucking play Mario 3.

1125
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:57,079
Scott: Jesus Christ what the hell am I doing here?

1126
00:55:58,164 --> 00:55:59,159
Rym: this is a problem.

1127
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:06,199
Rym: yup our problem was like well I remember one year we got the Super Nintendo.

1128
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:09,039
Rym: that was a big goddamn deal.

1129
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:19,838
Rym: and the problem was we got every launch game too F-Zero, Mario yup, RPM Racing which is a truck game.

1130
00:56:20,404 --> 00:56:24,515
Rym: it was actually an okay game but we had to share it.

1131
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:28,217
Scott: I mean only F-Zero and Mario are the ones you care about but we had to share it.

1132
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:29,959
Scott: sure you can play Mario 2 people.

1133
00:56:30,504 --> 00:56:32,740
Rym: yeah but couldn't play F-Zero 2 people.

1134
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:36,800
Rym: nope not the original F-Zero couldn't play pilot wings with 2 people.

1135
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:37,699
Scott: oh right pilot wings.

1136
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,351
Rym: and even worse.

1137
00:56:39,411 --> 00:56:43,558
Rym: later when we got the super scope there's only one of those.

1138
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:44,840
Scott: you don't get 2 super scopes.

1139
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:54,099
Scott: I mean we gotta say Genesis but Sonic 2. that was the one that came with Sonic 2 not the one that came with Sonic 1. it was the redesigned Genesis so someone could be Tails.

1140
00:56:57,472 --> 00:57:01,660
Rym: I guess I guess I guess that was a Christmas show.

1141
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,038
Rym: it wasn't a Christmas special it was a Christmas show.

1142
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,340
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: We didn't do a Christmas special but we talked about Christmas.

1151
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:46,559
Rym: We're thinking about doing a kind of Christmas special variety show.

1152
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,580
Rym: I don't know if we'll just wait and plan it and do it next year, maybe we'll do it randomly over the next couple weeks, we'll figure it out.

1153
00:58:52,621 --> 00:58:54,099
Rym: But we've got some vague ideas.

1154
00:58:55,264 --> 00:59:08,480
Rym: That might be one of the things we spend a little bit of the Patreon money on down the road We might make a legit, cheesy Christmas special, because that might actually be fun, as well as a relatively constrained project, but anyway We're seriously on like six panels at MAGFest.

1155
00:59:08,581 --> 00:59:10,860
Rym: If you're at MAGFest, let's hang out, let's play games.

1157
00:59:12,403 --> 00:59:27,069
Rym: And now I leave you with Want to show old Santa Claus that I Believe.

1158
00:59:39,616 --> 01:00:04,843
Rym: Silent night The stars are bright The fields are white with snow Christmas trees are waiting Lights are turned down low Tinsel shells and tinsel bells reflect.

1159
01:00:04,985 --> 01:00:12,410
Rym: the Firelight's hue Seems to whisper softly.

1160
01:00:13,956 --> 01:00:17,044
Rym: There's just one thing to do.

1161
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:23,209
Rym: I'm hanging up my stocking.

1162
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:27,678
