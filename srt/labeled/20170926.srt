00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,246
Rym: It's Tuesday September 26 2017.

2
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:17,099
Rym: I'm Rym I am and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,862
Rym: on Tuesday it's Black Friday the 2010 board game about Black Friday the stock market Black Friday.

4
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:26,926
Scott: let's do this.

5
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,718
Rym: so a few days ago I smell.

6
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:39,741
Rym: I came home and I smelled like a whiff of mildew which I have never smelled in my New York apartment before.

7
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:43,532
Scott: I have just the old guy yeah.

8
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:46,241
Rym: but then it disappeared like I couldn't find it.

9
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:47,366
Scott: oh so just a whiff.

10
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:47,948
Rym: it was a way.

11
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:49,475
Rym: I mean we've sappin.

12
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,625
Scott: I've smelled whiffs of all kinds of smells.

13
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,013
Scott: you know I even you know.

14
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:56,630
Scott: sometimes I'll even smell a whiff of gas and like oh shit yup yup yup.

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,719
Scott: and then it's gone and like well I guess it was just like someone you know twisted something on their barbecue.

16
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:10,319
Rym: there was one time I was biking home back when I worked downtown and I was like way downtown and I'm in the middle of the street and I stopped at a stoplight.

17
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,237
Scott: I've definitely smelled it while biking in the middle but I smelled hella gas.

18
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:17,129
Scott: I've never smelled hella gas I've only.

19
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,414
Rym: so I'm like huh.

20
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,783
Rym: so the first thing I did was bike away.

21
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:21,846
Scott: yeah a good idea.

22
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:34,043
Rym: and then I was about to call 911 and then I see a whole bunch of Con Edison trucks come up and a bunch of people get out and start looking around and sniffing and then one guy points in a manhole and they were on it.

23
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:39,101
Rym: okay but so then the next day I came home and there was a whiff of it again.

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:40,868
Rym: second whiff.

25
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,053
Scott: that's a job I don't want.

26
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,946
Scott: Con Edison report go to the emergency where some smell gas job.

27
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,611
Scott: it's a bad job.

28
00:01:48,252 --> 00:02:00,100
Rym: so uh but then I can't find it again and then I hear a bunch of construction noises going on and it sounds like it's in the wall behind our kitchen mm-hmm like in the inside area.

29
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:08,102
Rym: and then I go into my bathroom and there was some old water damage there and I see that they're like they're working outside of our apartment but related.

30
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,354
Rym: so I wonder if they're like fixing some water damage.

31
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:14,413
Rym: so I found a plausible explanation for occasional mildew with so I ignored it.

32
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:20,090
Rym: I came home the third day and I smelled it way stronger.

33
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,502
Rym: so at that point I have to do the I don't.

34
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,751
Rym: I don't just casually investigate.

35
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:36,031
Rym: I methodically start going around the apartment following the walls sniff testing mm-hmm and then I get near the fridge and it's real strong mm-hmm.

36
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:36,694
Rym: so it's.

37
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,508
Rym: I think it's behind the fridge which is terrifying.

38
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,735
Scott: cuz how do you get back there?

39
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:41,981
Rym: even yeah but it's not.

40
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:43,773
Scott: you know it would really help you see behind the fridge.

41
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,375
Rym: uh yeah I know exactly what helped me see behind the fridge endoscope.

42
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,043
Rym: I think I might get one of those endoscopes.

43
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:52,275
Rym: actually I got one in an Amazon cart right now.

44
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,176
Rym: but but I want to do some research to make sure I'm getting the right one.

45
00:02:55,196 --> 00:03:05,263
Rym: I want to do any competing endoscopes the one that has the iPhone and Android app and has the hook and the magnet and has a light on the light on the front and it's real stiff.

46
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:08,116
Rym: so I can like put it straight up if I want but also long enough.

47
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,414
Rym: yeah well one of them is crazy long but it's crazy expensive but I digress.

48
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:17,760
Rym: so then I'm going around the kitchen and I can't look figure out where it's coming from.

49
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:37,784
Rym: like it's getting really irritating and unnerving I start like opening cabinets and double-checking and then as I'm walking across the kitchen again I suddenly remember there's a sack of potatoes on the like just sitting out and I go over and I sniff the bag and I smell it a little stronger and I open the bag and I sniff it.

50
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,377
Scott: mildew country just throw down potatoes out.

51
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:45,271
Rym: so but those are pretty new potatoes from the CSA.

52
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,576
Rym: they're like really nice potatoes.

53
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,911
Scott: so well I mean the CSA might not be the cleanest.

54
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:50,574
Rym: yeah.

55
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:56,083
Rym: so what I do is I open it up because the thing is usually when potatoes go bad they smell like a rotting human corpse.

56
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,536
Rym: they smell bad but this just smelled like mildew.

57
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,804
Rym: it did not smell like rotting potato.

58
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:09,754
Rym: so what I do is I put a big bowl in the sink and I dumped the entire potato sack in and two of the potatoes out.

59
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:19,778
Rym: of like 20 potatoes two of them had the consistency of a rotten fruit and when I squished one of basically exploded into mush.

60
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,762
Rym: that smelled like mildew.

61
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:22,892
Rym: so yeah that was horrible.

62
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:31,489
Scott: yeah this is the difference between you know CSA food and grocery food but also but but that so only two of these potatoes had this problem.

63
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,899
Rym: the rest like I washed them all.

64
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,952
Rym: they were all totally must have been attacked by something.

65
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:39,990
Rym: yeah but I've never in my life had a potato go bad in that manner ever.

66
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:44,308
Scott: also I guess that that's weird that the construction wasn't anything.

67
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,019
Rym: yeah the construction was a red herring.

68
00:04:46,079 --> 00:05:00,704
Rym: the probably the other thing is in New York especially if you smell a smell and there is even a remotely yeah like if there's a remotely plausible source for the smell I'll assume it's that unless the smell persists or causes it's almost a problem.

69
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,199
Scott: cuz like I could be in my apartment and smell pee or something.

70
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,856
Scott: yeah I guess there's like a homeless bum outside or something.

71
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:11,416
Scott: it's like no I actually peed in my apartment on something I wouldn't know.

72
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:18,573
Rym: so yeah actually a couple weeks ago I was sitting in this room and I suddenly smelled a little bit of cigarette smoke.

73
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,501
Rym: now I was like oh fuck no.

74
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:27,045
Rym: and I look out the window and there is one person three stories down and these are tall stories.

75
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:33,897
Rym: so it's like five stories down in like a non New York building like that's how four and a half by their normal size stories.

76
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:40,086
Rym: now you forget how high the ceilings are here and our series my scene and our first floor is almost two stories.

77
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:52,466
Rym: sure cuz I got the highness something like four and a half stories up give or take and there's someone way down and way across in that like area where there's the construction smoking like one cigarette mm-hmm.

78
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,796
Rym: so I open the window and I yelled at him and he flipped me off.

79
00:05:55,239 --> 00:06:01,162
Rym: but then the next day a whole bunch of no smoking signs appeared in that entire area down there mm-hmm.

80
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:04,738
Scott: so yeah you're not allowed to smoke in construction areas.

81
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,784
Rym: oh no no that's so.

82
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:06,810
Rym: it's not construction anymore.

83
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,512
Rym: you're not allowed to smoke anywhere on this building's property except in your own apartment.

84
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,521
Scott: you can smoke in your own apartment.

85
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:16,059
Rym: yeah this building is not one of these smoke-free buildings unfortunately.

86
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:24,935
Rym: but really yeah most buildings are not really mine is yeah most new buildings are but this building is not as new.

87
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:25,919
Rym: it's rent stabilized.

88
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,832
Rym: but technically you're allowed to smoke in your building.

89
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:37,049
Rym: but to this building's credit the only time I've ever smelled anyone smoking anything in their apartment it's been marijuana mm-hmm.

90
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,328
Rym: I have never actually smelled cigarette smoke coming out of an apartment mm-hmm.

91
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,479
Rym: so and the person who was smoking on?

92
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,655
Rym: they're pretty sure they did not live in any of these buildings.

93
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,523
Rym: so yeah that's mine.

94
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:48,266
Rym: that's my story.

95
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:49,371
Rym: okay that's all I got.

96
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,881
Rym: all right you got it.

97
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,786
Rym: had anything happen to you?

98
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:56,019
Rym: or should we get right into gaming living?

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,915
Rym: so in the news there's this game called PUBG player unknown battleground.

100
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,800
Rym: we've talked about it.

101
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,408
Scott: it's the biggest deal right now.

102
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,123
Scott: we might not be able to avoid it cuz it's such a big deal.

103
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:10,381
Rym: I almost played it the other night or the other evening but the weather is nice.

104
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:15,204
Rym: I biked instead but the game feels like it's got things I hate in games like.

105
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:26,786
Rym: I think there's some iron sites type aiming stuff like some RMA stuff but at the same time it's also a battle royale which is just a fascinating concept in games mm-hmm.

106
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:37,330
Rym: so the only reason I haven't played it yet does not seven at a time like it's one of those games that I feel like if I play it at all it'll be immediately apparent if it's bad and if it's not bad I'm probably gonna play it a lot.

107
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:42,422
Scott: yeah so the deal is someone else noticed.

108
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,872
Scott: hey PUBG is like a huge fucking deal right now.

109
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,842
Scott: yeah I think PUBG is not quite indie.

110
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:53,320
Scott: I read an article about the guy who made PUBG and he was a modder.

111
00:07:53,681 --> 00:08:01,449
Scott: right it was a mod originally but then he sort of got hired and went to work with you know somewhat real game studios.

112
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,000
Rym: well that's how counter-strike came about.

113
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:10,430
Scott: this is a similar story to that right where you know it's a PUBG itself is not some in mod anymore that some guy made.

114
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,395
Scott: it's actually like this.

115
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:16,984
Scott: you know he's the leader of the team that makes it but you know he went to get a real game studio to make PUBG.

116
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,834
Scott: the mod he made is not PUBG.

117
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,746
Scott: it's like a. you know I think it was called.

118
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,967
Scott: it might have had the same name but it was like on a different engine and was crap.

119
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,213
Scott: you don't want to play that no one's playing.

120
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,517
Scott: yeah anyway.

121
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,649
Scott: so they know people noticed.

122
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,238
Scott: hey this is the number one game on Steam.

123
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,029
Scott: it's like the number one game period right now.

124
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:46,294
Scott: that's pretty good and other game studios that have more resources in such just added this game mode to their games or made similar games that are basically the same fucking thing.

125
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,183
Rym: now I'm a big fan of.

126
00:08:48,584 --> 00:09:06,908
Rym: I'm glad that chicken dinner is coming back into the lexicon because of this game because that is how people would describe victories in sort of the predecessors of these games like gun game and counter-strike the or old death matches where there's a ton of players not even overwatch deathmatch which is just eight people.

127
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:13,553
Rym: we're talking like there is ten to twenty people in a game and it's long and in the end only one.

128
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,940
Scott: I mean this is nothing new right?

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,705
Scott: it's like you know even though you know was Mario Brothers even the first platforming game.

130
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:20,750
Scott: right it's all it was.

131
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:33,410
Scott: it's basically one step above pitfall right I have some arguments about what the first platforming game is right but regardless of which one it is right are you gonna say oh no no no those Janice sisters cannot be or are you know?

132
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:39,046
Scott: it's like they made her somebody at a racing game and then someone else makes a racing game and gonna be like no no no you can't do that right.

133
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:43,068
Scott: it's like yep you know they made as a space invaders and then there was a Galaga.

134
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:43,611
Scott: you can't be like.

135
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,119
Scott: no no Galaga is allowed.

136
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:57,169
Rym: we already made a space invader especially because you know when it comes to games in general it game design game mechanics game rules none of those things are really covered by copyright.

137
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,806
Scott: and regardless of law I guess this is mostly a legal issue.

138
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:04,340
Scott: but even without law it's like you can.

139
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,292
Scott: you can make the same kind of game that someone else has already made.

140
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,051
Scott: Magic the Gathering is not the only collectible card game right you know.

141
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:16,807
Scott: just even without taking law into account you can't own a concept.

142
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:23,773
Rym: no where on earth can you own a concept when Dominion sort of made deck builder of genre?

143
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,652
Scott: even people who really believe in strong intellectual property and whatnot recognize?

144
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,177
Scott: you can't own a concept.

145
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:37,107
Scott: yep so as best I can tell like imagine if like the first person with a jazz song is like no one else may make jazz.

146
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,419
Rym: I own jazz doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

147
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,964
Scott: you can't write so anyway.

148
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,790
Scott: so but what hat?

149
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,593
Scott: what's happened here?

150
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:50,957
Scott: this news story is that epic games the people who make the Unreal Engine right.

151
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,532
Scott: you know cuz pub G is on the Unreal Engine I'm pretty sure right?

152
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,982
Rym: think so yeah I don't know a lot about it.

153
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:03,262
Scott: yep but epic games that makes the Unreal Engine made this game using the Unreal Engine.

154
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:09,139
Scott: that is really really really really really battle royale.

155
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,616
Scott: that is ridiculously similar to pub G to the point at which it's like.

156
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,203
Scott: alright this isn't like I made a FPS and you made a FPS or I made capture the flag and you made capture the flag.

157
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:27,469
Scott: this is like you squeaked out of pub G. yeah and I and they basically think what happened.

158
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,731
Scott: I'm not.

159
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,614
Scott: I didn't read and I don't remember because this was already a date many days old news story.

160
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:36,275
Scott: I think they got the game out on other platforms besides PC before pub G would.

161
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,030
Scott: it was able to do that and that's why it's sort of like.

162
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,311
Scott: you know.

163
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,785
Scott: it's trying to conquer some territory that way.

164
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:53,635
Rym: yep I mean it's interesting is on one hand most of this kind of thing that happens are those garbage fake games on phones that try to look like a game that grandma's heard of so it gets bought.

165
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:54,923
Scott: that's actually what this looks like.

166
00:11:55,204 --> 00:12:01,661
Scott: yeah it does have that kind of graphic design like huh if you're epic games you make the Unreal Engine shouldn't be able to make a better game.

167
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:12,971
Rym: but I'll be honest when it comes to this sort of thing I'm of the opinion that that sucks and whichever one of them is better is gonna win like kind of like how an idea is worth nothing.

168
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,156
Rym: only execution matters.

169
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:28,633
Rym: if someone has an idea for a kind of game but doesn't execute it fully and someone else takes the same idea and executes it better they're gonna win and that's probably that's the fastest way to evolve games.

170
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:29,879
Scott: yeah but I think there's.

171
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,744
Scott: there might be some legal action or there is gonna be some legal action or something.

172
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,332
Rym: I feel like that's not gonna get very far.

173
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:51,957
Scott: I'm not a lawyer there's no advice but if there is I definitely want to keep a close eyeball on that because that could have repercussions elsewhere seeing how that turns out in the blog post announcing the version under the Fortnite team byline epic rights.

174
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,487
Rym: we love battle royale games like PUBG and thought Fortnite would make a great foundation for our own version.

175
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:05,933
Rym: so they preemptively started calling them battle royale games to imply that that is a genre.

176
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,245
Scott: well everyone knows that is a battle royale game.

177
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,000
Scott: because I mean can battle royale the whoever wrote the book?

178
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,034
Scott: I don't know the author's name can they go after PUBG?

179
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:20,720
Scott: yeah right what about the Hunger Games the Hunger Games if all they should go after Hunger Games before they go after PUBG?

180
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:23,653
Scott: battle royale is real old.

181
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,299
Scott: it's like 1998 99 something like that is like.

182
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:26,122
Scott: that book is not new.

183
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,040
Rym: it's interesting that movie is actually way old.

184
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:35,579
Rym: yep well I actually watched the third mood like the end move.

185
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,509
Rym: I guess the third movie is actually two movies.

186
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,313
Rym: so there's four movies.

187
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:39,177
Scott: a third one.

188
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:45,883
Scott: I thought the second one was such like insane Oh garbage like crazier than Mamoru Oshii.

189
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,956
Scott: live-action crazy that I did not proceed any further.

190
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:55,372
Scott: but the first one is still a the first one's fine very important and terrific movie that you should see with Takeshi Kitano.

191
00:13:55,593 --> 00:14:07,756
Scott: the rest of them makes everything good pretty much just there is only one battle royale movie no and it only has one sibling movie which is the only matrix movie that there is.

192
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:11,488
Rym: do not ever read the battle royale manga.

193
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,435
Rym: I cannot stress this enough.

194
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:16,185
Scott: I haven't read more than like one page of.

195
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:19,983
Rym: no matter how vile you might think it is it will surprise you.

196
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,257
Scott: I've actually haven't read the book and it's kind of big.

197
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,989
Scott: so I've always wondered like is it worth reading?

198
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:25,700
Scott: but you know maybe I check it out one day.

199
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,585
Scott: maybe that'd be a book.

200
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,678
Scott: good book club battle royale the book yeah.

201
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:38,011
Rym: so uh yeah I will see how this goes because it's very interesting because the other similar quote-unquote controversy has been going on.

202
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:45,310
Rym: is people talking about how battle-born and overwatch competed with each other even though they're ostensibly very different kinds of games.

203
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,222
Scott: well there's that lawbreakers thing too that yeah.

204
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,629
Rym: so I feel like this topic.

205
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,609
Rym: I kind of the reason we made this a news is that I don't really have any stake in the PUBG battle and I feel like whichever games better is gonna win.

206
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:02,166
Rym: I feel like lawsuits in either direction are gonna go nowhere.

207
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:22,025
Rym: but at the same time I feel like this is gonna crack the seal on this sort of issue being talked about more seriously in the games industry because there is definitely the trend from the old days of someone invents a kind of game and then there's a billion copycats immediately to try to sponge off of that.

208
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:26,348
Rym: I feel like that is accelerating as a pace rapidly and I don't know what's gonna happen.

209
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:30,592
Scott: but usually in the past the copycats have always been worse right than the original.

210
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:44,617
Scott: but if we get into situations where one developer with tons of resources right sees a really great game from someone without a lot of resources you know back in the day like you know you would hire the portal like the person who made portal.

211
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:51,795
Scott: that was like some demo or something or some art project or whatever and then valve hired them and they made the real portal cynical counterpoint.

212
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:52,820
Rym: but if you don't

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:01,863
Scott: somebody sees someone's doing a thing and then suddenly just goes off and beats them at their own game because they got mad money's that's maybe not so cool ah

214
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:09,958
Rym: but at the same time if you feel like you don't need to hire that original person or creative team what did they actually do other than have the idea?

215
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:14,946
Rym: mm-hmm I mean they are the only thing they've done really is market research for you as well.

216
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:22,215
Scott: well you'd also hope that you know they've learned lessons already because they've been working on it for so long and you can avoid having to learn those lessons yourself if you hire them.

217
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:23,078
Rym: yeah.

218
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,594
Rym: but also kind of the side thing is games themselves.

219
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:30,313
Rym: you know because I'm kind of a UX expert that's a lot of what I do in my professional life.

220
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,600
Rym: games don't have UX.

221
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:40,612
Rym: they sort of are UX meaning all these salient parts of a game are explorable by anyone even someone trying to rip the game off.

222
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:51,918
Rym: the parts that aren't explorable are like engineering and architecture pieces primarily that any confident person if you hire the right team could sort of put together on their own usually.

223
00:16:53,785 --> 00:17:00,236
Rym: but you can fully explore the user experience or what the game is like and what features work and don't without permission from anyone.

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,548
Rym: so we'll see where this all goes.

225
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:09,518
Rym: but I feel like this topic is gonna get talked about more and more and more over the next couple years and we'll see what happens.

226
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,046
Rym: mm-hmm in some other news.

227
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,421
Rym: there's some trouble in the Smash Brothers scene.

228
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,449
Scott: that scene always has trouble.

229
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:19,935
Scott: it's like the most drama of all.

230
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,833
Scott: yeah like and I'm even at all scenes but it is always a drama-filled scene.

231
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:31,583
Rym: like I feel like the smash scene has drama above and beyond the fighting game scene within which it resides.

232
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:32,687
Scott: well I think it's.

233
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:36,230
Scott: also it's always felt like it's next to the fighting game scene and not really in it.

234
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:43,143
Scott: cuz smash is so different from say Street Fighter or MVC or yeah but MVC and Bushido Blade are completely different games.

235
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:45,434
Scott: yeah but Bushido Blade doesn't have any community.

236
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:48,907
Scott: so that's me I don't think you're.

237
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:51,200
Scott: actually I think you've actually had to play Bushido Blade.

238
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,147
Scott: you just get your ass kicked.

239
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:55,370
Scott: yeah probably the thing is you know you probably don't even remember the control.

240
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,234
Rym: nope not at all.

241
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:57,340
Rym: you know what I remember.

242
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,759
Rym: if you if you have a throwing like you're just like the idea of Bushido Blade.

243
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,169
Scott: you're like actual Bushido Blade.

244
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:14,034
Rym: no the problem is I like Bushido Blade but when I say I there's an asterisk and that asterisk says Rym a long time ago through the filter of memory and age anyway.

245
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,992
Scott: but smash is like such a different game and attracts a different crowd.

246
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:21,477
Scott: there's not a lot of crossover between like smash melee masters and Street Fighter masters.

247
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:27,354
Scott: right but a lot of times you'll see Street Fighter masters you know playing some other fighting games and also being really damn good at them.

248
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,949
Rym: but smash people are only smash as far as I can tell.

249
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,988
Scott: yeah well they might play other games but usually you don't see them too much.

250
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,243
Rym: so there's a pretty serious problem for that community.

251
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,156
Rym: that is not a problem for any other fighting game community.

252
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:50,590
Scott: the problem is the old GameCube controller which is a great controller even though it looks weird and when everyone saw it for the first time was like what the fuck yep then you put your hands on it.

253
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,357
Rym: it's like when Morty experienced true level.

254
00:18:52,377 --> 00:19:01,630
Rym: you're like oh like to this day because I played more Soul Calibur when Soul Calibur 2 was out on this controller.

255
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,781
Scott: I can't play Soul Calibur 2 on a different controller.

256
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:13,582
Rym: I guess I could get used to it but it would be difficult for me to play a Soul Calibur game because I'm a vertical attack my horizontal attack and it just mapped so nicely.

257
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:19,265
Rym: but Nintendo has now made a GameCube of controllers in a long ass time.

258
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:25,233
Scott: no they've been out of manufacture for quite a while because no one has a GameCube anymore that you even sell Wii's anymore.

259
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:34,863
Rym: and unlike the N64 smash community which does exist and has its own problems let's stay away from them.

260
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:47,490
Rym: yeah that that's that's like the people who still play Counter Strike 1 6 in here 2017 but because the GameCube controller could still be plugged into the Wii and the Wii U really the Wii U?

261
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:47,933
Scott: I didn't know.

262
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,240
Rym: I heard that's what this article said.

263
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,723
Rym: the Wii U?

264
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,850
Rym: okay I don't know.

265
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,655
Rym: I didn't verify that.

266
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,083
Rym: cuz of course why would I have a Wii U?

267
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:54,491
Scott: I never used a Wii U quote.

268
00:19:54,752 --> 00:20:10,111
Rym: the aging GameCube controller is a smash staple not just for melee but for the two more recent games in the franchise which were released for the Wii and the Wii U. so that means that it's not just people who grew up in the GameCube era are used to this controller and everyone else in the smash community moved on.

269
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:15,753
Scott: people who play Smash Wii also need GameCube controllers even though it's a Wii game.

270
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,079
Rym: but Nintendo didn't keep making them.

271
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,018
Rym: no they let you plug them in but they didn't let you make them which there are.

272
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,491
Scott: there are Wii pro controllers you could use.

273
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,314
Scott: they're not good.

274
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,097
Scott: they're not good.

275
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,342
Scott: not GameCube controller good.

276
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:32,406
Rym: so smash community basically has this problem of its final destination Fox.

277
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,233
Rym: only GameCube controller.

278
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,663
Rym: first party no mods only mm-hmm.

279
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,189
Rym: the fuck are they gonna do?

280
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:45,458
Rym: because there will always be any given day fewer functional GameCube controllers than there were before.

281
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:49,638
Scott: well you can just fix one and you can also not fucking destroy them right?

282
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:52,754
Rym: it's like they were out like even a mouse like a fancy mouse.

283
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:53,216
Rym: you'll see.

284
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:56,754
Rym: they have mean time before failure like how many times can you click?

285
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:58,965
Rym: a couple million you don't click too hard.

286
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,372
Rym: a lot of no it's not a matter.

287
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,061
Rym: don't click too hard as a matter of entropy.

288
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:04,353
Scott: I'm just saying you can there.

289
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,825
Scott: you can behave in such a way to make them last longer.

290
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:08,654
Rym: yeah but not that doesn't matter.

291
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,020
Scott: obviously not going to be.

292
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,777
Rym: that longer would have been last from the GameCube era.

293
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:19,902
Rym: through the Wii era you can also the GameCube era the Wii era the Wii U era and now the switch air.

294
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:20,986
Scott: you can also repair them.

295
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:28,214
Scott: so easier said than done if you got a 3d printer and you got a soldering iron you can repair a controller.

296
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:30,482
Rym: uh yeah but it's difficult.

297
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:35,143
Rym: and two if it's not a first party controller and someone's cracked it open and soldered it.

298
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,073
Rym: ah you know they didn't cheat.

299
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,104
Scott: you check the controller.

300
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,290
Rym: how do you how you gonna look at that?

301
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,496
Rym: tell me if that's legit or not.

302
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:42,139
Scott: you write it.

303
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,486
Scott: you get a piece of software.

304
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:51,863
Rym: you think the smash community who's built their entire existence around console gaming as opposed to a PC is capable of that.

305
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:52,908
Scott: this is you know you get.

306
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:56,188
Scott: there's plenty of we mods we has been homebrewed and hacked for quite a while.

307
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:03,512
Scott: you make a little we app where someone plugs in a GameCube controller and you have to push all the buttons and then it tells you whether the GameCube controller is legit or not.

308
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:04,656
Rym: so there are.

309
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:28,736
Rym: so if you read this article you'll find out there's actually significant specific reasons why they're very difficult to repair because the kinds of repairs that were easy are already done all the time and now they're so old that they're failing in other ways and it's starting to come down to like was it from the beginning of the manufacturing run or the end of the manufacturing run?

310
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:33,279
Scott: well I got a bunch of give controllers and I'm gonna hold on to them until the smash melee.

311
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,153
Scott: people are so desperate they'll pay me like a fortune for it.

312
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:41,094
Rym: I feel like Nintendo could make some money but they won't because they don't care.

313
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:44,212
Rym: they don't want to be in the non console hardware business.

314
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,002
Scott: somebody will eventually right.

315
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:51,941
Scott: just make something that lets you use like a Wii pro controller on the.

316
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:52,423
Scott: you know it's like.

317
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:56,764
Rym: oh no it's got to be this exact shape or that community is gonna freak out.

318
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,594
Scott: well you're gonna have to give up at some point.

319
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:04,060
Scott: right since we talked about this I think story earlier where the arcade people are running out of CRT's.

320
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,847
Rym: yeah or DDR?

321
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:09,545
Rym: if you're an aficionado of dance dance revolution good fucking luck.

322
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:16,347
Scott: getting a good dance pad you know at the foot of my bed is a bunch of junk I'm trying to get rid of and I'm actually make gonna make some headway now on that.

323
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,056
Rym: you're not getting rid of your red octane are ya?

324
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,446
Rym: you don't play DDR anymore.

325
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:20,728
Rym: is that?

326
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:24,789
Scott: haven't use that red octane in so long and I don't know if it works a hundred percent.

327
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,257
Scott: I think it might have some bad arrows.

328
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,447
Rym: yeah well I have three working.

329
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,773
Scott: you can try to fix mine if you want.

330
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:36,623
Scott: yeah anyway but the at the foot of my bed though is a plastic guitar hero guitar for the Wii.

331
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:40,178
Rym: yeah you can just throw that shit away and it's like but what it wait but what.

332
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:44,774
Rym: but what if that community is not the same as the smash community?

333
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,864
Rym: that ship sailed and sank.

334
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,442
Scott: but if I feel like playing guitar hero though one day I still have the game.

335
00:23:51,683 --> 00:24:02,823
Rym: so there's a longer meta story like meta story here on the top about eSports in general and smash will never be a top-tier esport for reasons like this.

336
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:07,258
Rym: yeah consoles cannot without making them effectively.

337
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:17,820
Rym: pcs support modern eSports because modern eSports requires significant spectator infrastructure and significant anti cheating and uniformity infrastructure.

338
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,632
Rym: you're not gonna get that with any kind of consoles.

339
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:29,195
Scott: even like games that are eSports which are supported by the companies that make the games have really shitty and subpar infrastructure.

340
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:31,146
Scott: there's a game I've talked about it before.

341
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,943
Scott: I have yet to actually play it though I do have access to it.

342
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,492
Rym: I have to just that Amazon one right.

343
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,269
Scott: I just had to be home on one of the weekends where you can play it.

344
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,393
Scott: it's called breakaway.

345
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:49,576
Scott: it's made by Amazon who owns twitch by Amazon Game Studios and basically it looks like a MOBA but there's a ball and the goal is to get the ball to the other end.

346
00:24:49,616 --> 00:25:01,273
Scott: so it's a sport but also a MOBA kind of thing and they are building the game from the ground up with eSports and spectating and streaming it as like the first priority and that just makes it interesting.

347
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:13,740
Scott: cuz like well if you're good at that even if the game doesn't get popular maybe you could mooch off some Amazon twitch monies by being like the king of this game or something right that no one currently even cares about like the forum has like no one in it the official forum.

348
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,540
Scott: so you know I'm not saying I'm not promoting that game.

349
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:18,306
Scott: I didn't know what's good.

350
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,077
Scott: I haven't played it yet I just have it downloaded.

351
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:24,622
Scott: but that's the kind of thing that you're gonna need for eSports going forward.

352
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:42,369
Rym: but here's the other thing that's interesting when it comes to preservation of old experiences like old Atari 2600. the controllers are so simple that people can effectively repair them indefinitely in a way that they really can't do with the GameCube type stuff.

353
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:48,731
Scott: but also there are enough GameCube controllers that in forever right at least.

354
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,118
Rym: no no not forever.

355
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:54,115
Scott: you see that's the kind of um you know it's a museum that is preserving game.

356
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,552
Rym: that's the kind of like we'll be always post-apocalyptic thinking.

357
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,266
Scott: they always have at least one working game cube controller together.

358
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,442
Rym: until all the canned food runs out it's out.

359
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:11,562
Rym: but there's gonna be a time where the last GameCube controller is buried by the Lorax.

360
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,629
Scott: no no there is.

361
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:14,993
Rym: that day will come now.

362
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,871
Scott: but with the Atari and all that as long as there are people who care about preserving GameCube controllers there will be one in a museum.

363
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:32,906
Rym: almost every other semi-professional or serious community around a legacy console game has ways to make do that.

364
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:41,576
Rym: the smash community has uniquely tied itself to a limited number of consoles and a limited number of a very specific controller.

365
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:52,798
Scott: something else is that you know Nintendo did at certain points make promotional items of basically Super Nintendo controller replicas that were just plugged into wii's.

366
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:03,930
Scott: true I can definitely see on like GameCube anniversary them releasing like GameCube controllers that work on a newer system or whatever they and then people will just make adapters for them.

367
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,059
Scott: you know they're definitely going to be within our lifetime the GameCube.

368
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,742
Scott: a GameCube similar controller will be manufactured as some sort of novelty by Nintendo.

369
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:13,888
Scott: cuz that's how they do so.

370
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:21,602
Scott: yet another issue here is that because this community they just made NES classic and SNES classic one day GameCube would be so old.

371
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:26,828
Scott: they'll be GameCube classic because this game n64 classic isn't coming within like you know.

372
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,497
Scott: so Scott there's another problem here.

373
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:36,509
Rym: next year Christmas n64 classic bet on it because this community is so obsessed with this controller being intrinsic part of the game.

374
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:43,117
Rym: they've also basically prevented any amount of handicap accessibility that's in their scene.

375
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:48,987
Rym: that's a shame in a way that fighting games have embraced I mean with the fight sticks and all the alternative inputs.

376
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:53,142
Rym: yep so GameCube controllers have caused people some injuries.

377
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:57,941
Scott: well they've also not only denying disabled people from playing a game.

378
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:01,462
Scott: you're just denying people from playing your game if they can't get the equipment.

379
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,055
Scott: yeah it's just like oh sorry you weren't a kid.

380
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:07,315
Scott: when GameCubes are out and you don't have a bunch of money to buy one from someone.

381
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:14,635
Rym: sorry get tennis rackets were only manufactured between 2001 and 2009 so I guess you can't ever play tennis unless you buy some old tennis racket on eBay.

382
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,123
Scott: yeah you can't play this game.

383
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:17,509
Scott: it's not for sale anymore.

384
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,660
Scott: sorry oh you want to play this collectible card game that they don't print anymore but it's still a big deal.

385
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:23,663
Scott: that's a shame.

386
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:30,532
Rym: so yeah I guess the moral is the smash community is really really weird and this is just kind of funny.

387
00:28:30,552 --> 00:28:40,948
Rym: there's more just more examples of their weirdness but anyway things of the day.

388
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:44,092
Rym: so way back we had to have made this a thing of the day.

389
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:44,937
Rym: there's a definitely

390
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:45,540
Scott: thing of the day

391
00:28:45,922 --> 00:29:07,427
Rym: but Wintergatan is this amazing YouTube channel slash person who makes really complicated musical experiences and the most famous one is this giant machine that just plays music with marbles and it's amazing and this person is currently working on a much more elaborate and interesting version of that machine.

392
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:16,368
Rym: but as an aside they do a bunch of awesome stuff and they made this video using an instrument they developed and a bunch of other instruments to play dr.

393
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:32,654
Rym: Wiley's castle theme from Megaman 2. and not only is it fascinating to see how he made this music but it sounds really good it's accurate and it gave me some Megaman feels reminded me how much I like Megaman 2's music usually a homemade instrument.

394
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:37,065
Scott: you know you get like some hard drives playing some music or something and it's not really doesn't sound that impressive.

395
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:37,930
Rym: this sounds great.

396
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,018
Scott: it sounds incredible for this thing.

397
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:40,942
Scott: it's like whoa.

398
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,769
Rym: yeah it's good stuff.

399
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,134
Rym: so what you got?

400
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:45,739
Scott: so here's an.

401
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,525
Scott: I guess it's an art installation.

402
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:50,054
Rym: I guess as we call it that this count says so.

403
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:51,802
Scott: basically I think it's in Germany right.

404
00:29:51,822 --> 00:30:05,142
Scott: a bunch of people decided to entertain the train passengers by doing stuff out in the empty fields outside the train window the idea being like hey you're riding the train stop just looking at your phone.

405
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:06,669
Scott: instead look out the window.

406
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:09,965
Scott: we're gonna do fun stuff as the train passes by for like a whole day.

407
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:17,890
Scott: and it was a great community event because all the people who live in these farm areas got together and met each other and you know had a good time working on this together.

408
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:27,820
Scott: so there's one more like a bunch of people are behind bushes they're holding bushes and when the train comes they start running until Pernham Wood comes to Dunstanane right you know.

409
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,227
Scott: and there's like this one.

410
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,827
Scott: you know it's all kinds of interesting ones but the the most the craziest one was.

411
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:42,701
Scott: a bunch of people get in a costume and all look like the same person and they pretend to basically be having a race with the train.

412
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,247
Scott: it's like you know the person.

413
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:55,040
Scott: the first person runs and then jumps and then you can't see them anymore and then another person comes out from behind something with the same costume and runs and it looks like the person.

414
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,112
Scott: it basically creates the illusion that someone is racing and beating the train in a foot race even though it's a crazy fast train.

415
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:09,332
Scott: these are shockingly elaborate and at the very end at the train station there's like someone there like already you know who's wearing the costumes.

416
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:14,036
Scott: it looks like they beat the trains at the train station but they basically did this whole thing.

417
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:19,566
Scott: all these all these different scenes and acts were repeated you know for all the trains throughout the day.

418
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:26,160
Scott: they think they did it for like a few hours or whatever so you can have all the fun of riding these trains just by watching this YouTube video.

419
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:32,070
Rym: yeah one of my favorite I mean these are this really is more installation like you said than prank.

420
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:38,801
Rym: but my favorite pranks in the world are do something weird where someone questions reality a little bit and they can't explain it.

421
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:39,665
Scott: this isn't a prank.

422
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,208
Scott: they're like they think the people on the train knew to look out for it.

423
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:44,237
Rym: at least some of the people know.

424
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:50,214
Rym: but imagine the person who doesn't know just like on the train like fucking down with their phone and they look up and they notice that guy.

425
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:52,867
Scott: well the illusion isn't that great is the thing?

426
00:31:52,927 --> 00:32:00,902
Rym: it's not it you know it's it's obvious when you look at it like how depends though because the trains moving fast you only see it for like a second.

427
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:04,175
Scott: sure sure but you know like.

428
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:08,576
Rym: they put that fake house up and then it's gone like the next time they go by like that kind of nonsense.

429
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:14,157
Rym: hmm so yeah in the meta moment we got two videos up that you should watch.

430
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:29,136
Rym: so one our pecs panel from pecs was 2017. the age of the quitter is a hundred percent on YouTube in glorious 2k because I didn't feel like uploading 50 or 60 gigabytes of 4k and you really don't need 4k of our faces.

431
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,753
Rym: and Scott uploaded on his channel meaning you got described both of our channels.

432
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:40,497
Rym: the first non anime Boston produced episode of GeekNights judge anime by its cover.

433
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,365
Scott: yeah it's gonna be a quarterly show.

434
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:47,851
Scott: so four times a year like about a couple weeks before the new anime season starts we're gonna put up a video.

435
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:59,159
Scott: we go through the anime chart at any chart net and judge based on almost no information whatsoever which anime are gonna be worth watching and which ones you should stay the hell away from.

436
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,480
Scott: and we have uploaded the first episode of this show and it's only gonna get better.

437
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,214
Scott: in a few months we'll do the next episode.

438
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,551
Rym: yeah so there you go and I'm actually watching a lot of anime these days.

439
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:21,305
Rym: so it's feeling good and I finally fully understand exactly what it means for a show to be a darker than black you and your darker than black.

440
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:26,925
Scott: anyway the book club book is the fifth season by NK Jemisin.

441
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:29,754
Scott: I finished reading it a while ago.

442
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:30,958
Rym: I've been busy.

443
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,303
Scott: how are you doing so?

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:38,591
Rym: I'm only like five chapters in because uh-huh I don't have a commute anymore like it takes me like ten minutes to get to work.

445
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:43,460
Scott: there's other times during the day that you can read like before you go to bed when you wake up.

446
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,654
Rym: ah but I've been busy when you're at work not doing work.

447
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:48,744
Rym: ah so that's the thing my new job.

448
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,272
Rym: I've been doing work the whole time I'm at work.

449
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:51,886
Scott: yeah I'm just saying there's time you know.

450
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:55,403
Scott: when you're sitting somewhere waiting for something you know whatever.

451
00:33:55,423 --> 00:33:57,131
Rym: yeah I'll be reading it real soon.

452
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,503
Rym: I'm gonna power through it because I really like what I read.

453
00:33:59,543 --> 00:33:59,925
Rym: so far.

454
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,241
Rym: I can see why people when they start these books.

455
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:09,873
Scott: I've already started on the sequel which also won a Hugo Award just like the original which is the book that we're doing.

456
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:16,248
Scott: and there is a third one which I think is the last one but I haven't at least you're not I'm only the beginning of the second one of like.

457
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:25,188
Rym: I was where we both read the wheel of time one as the book club and we both just kept reading and then I just kept reading till I hit the end.

458
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:26,815
Scott: I read like four or five wheel of time.

459
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:31,719
Rym: yep but I I read them all and I know the full dealer Randall tar and what's up with the magic.

460
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,547
Scott: I don't need to read anymore.

461
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,933
Rym: yeah the problem is it.

462
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:39,172
Rym: it would take me longer to summarize it then it would take you to just fucking read them.

463
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,446
Rym: so yeah but the fifth season it's summarizing.

464
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:46,235
Rym: I defy anyone to summarize the.

465
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,129
Scott: I need to know the parts about the creepy tower.

466
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:51,456
Scott: I don't need to know anything else.

467
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,246
Rym: yeah that's really all you want to know about.

468
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:56,842
Rym: yeah cuz that's the least explained of everything.

469
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,896
Scott: of course the good the best part is always the least explained.

470
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:02,608
Scott: that's how it always is.

471
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:07,609
Scott: you fucking fantasy sci-fi people right the coolest thing should be the most explained.

472
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,587
Scott: if you're watching a Star Wars movie there should be awesome Empire shit.

473
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,375
Scott: see more than stupid rebel shit.

474
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:19,954
Scott: no stupid lame-ass pussy rebels on the screen right not enough TIE fighter too much x-ray over the course of all that Prince of nothing.

475
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,724
Rym: they're like Oh God or off go God or out.

476
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:32,148
Rym: and then in the last book we just read there fucking is and we're just going inside this but they and then they're like oh by the way the real cool shit is actually gods haha.

477
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,297
Rym: anyway well we'll see what it.

478
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,764
Rym: what is a guy any other?

479
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:48,372
Scott: yeah so in meta basically just go on the internet to all the places that we are all the social YouTube the social networks the YouTube channels the websites the everything and get with it.

480
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,565
Rym: so we played a ton of games at PAX.

481
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:55,596
Scott: oh yeah like even though PAX is already like a month ago.

482
00:35:55,616 --> 00:36:00,822
Rym: if we did nothing on Tuesday shows but review games we haven't reviewed yet that we played at PAX.

483
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:04,253
Scott: we'll be at PAX unplugged we'll be.

484
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:10,096
Rym: we would make it past PAX South yeah without running out which I guess they got to submit the panels for that.

485
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:10,418
Rym: mm-hmm.

486
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:11,926
Rym: so cod pecs out.

487
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,052
Rym: this coming up mm-hmm.

488
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,021
Rym: yeah X unplugged is coming up.

489
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,272
Rym: exos is coming up but we're skipping it this year.

490
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,156
Rym: mm-hmm.

491
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,568
Rym: we were gonna go next year for sure for 01 the omega-thon.

492
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,084
Rym: but because she only gets you got pretty deep but she didn't win.

493
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,316
Rym: so I think I'm skipping one more pack sauce.

494
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,742
Rym: but I'm feeling like 2019.

495
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:31,958
Rym: I'm gonna go back to 2018. go to Essen Essen it's time.

496
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:40,545
Rym: but the reason I want to review Black Friday is that it neither sounds if you don't know who made this game.

497
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:44,804
Rym: it neither sounds nor looks like the kind of game that me and Scott would like.

498
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:47,599
Scott: well no I mean it's a. it's a game made by Friedman free.

499
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,529
Rym: oh yeah you don't know who made it.

500
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:55,737
Scott: so Friedman freeze is this guy with green hair who made power grid which I think in German is called Funkin.

501
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:56,560
Rym: German.

502
00:36:56,921 --> 00:37:01,940
Rym: all his games all his games begin with the letter F not all of them as we learned.

503
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,663
Scott: no not all.

504
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:06,278
Scott: most of his games are you know FF something like fresh fish?

505
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,712
Scott: yeah and they come in a green box just like his hair.

506
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:11,159
Scott: that's how you can tell when it's his game.

507
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:17,892
Scott: so black market is another and I can't believe how many games this dude is made but I thought he played every game.

508
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:19,075
Scott: but no there's another one.

509
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,460
Scott: it's called black market.

510
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:26,646
Scott: there's a black market fuck if I know all right a Black Friday.

511
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,012
Scott: I mean is it something Friday like?

512
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:31,947
Rym: I'll try to look at something else every day?

513
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:32,550
Scott: or who knows?

514
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:42,401
Rym: but Friedman freeze is almost tied with Canis II I think for reliably able to scratch and itch that Rym and Scott have related to gaming.

515
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:46,697
Rym: mm-hmm about the name of the first game in the fruit egg pro.

516
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:50,272
Rym: it's in a project but here is it something.

517
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:52,666
Scott: here is it from 2010 so it's pretty old it's real.

518
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:56,306
Scott: but anyway I'd never seen this game before or I've never seen it in a store.

519
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:57,512
Scott: I've never seen it played.

520
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,321
Scott: I'd even know it existed but then there it was.

521
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:04,752
Rym: we see why I'm saying that like oh this doesn't look like at surface value a game that room Scott would play.

522
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:11,065
Rym: if you look at this you see a weird-looking board that looks like it's from one of those Milton Bradley kind of games in the u.s.

523
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:16,107
Rym: a bunch of paper money and a bunch of nonsense and a victory track.

524
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:17,171
Scott: we didn't use paper money.

525
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:17,875
Scott: views chips right.

526
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:20,669
Rym: yeah yes chips but paper money paper money anyway.

527
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:26,076
Scott: so what this game is is about Black Friday stock market Black Friday as in the day the stock market crash right.

528
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:26,578
Scott: so there's.

529
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:30,376
Scott: it's really hard to explain the exact rules so I'm not going to.

530
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:38,586
Scott: but basically what this game amounts to is that there is silver and over time silver will increase in value.

531
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:40,231
Scott: it starts off real cheap.

532
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,520
Scott: what like 20 bucks or something 50 50 to 100 I forget.

533
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:48,142
Rym: anyway it starts off it goes from zero and it starts going up.

534
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:48,684
Scott: anyway.

535
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,577
Scott: it starts off cheap and gets expensive when it hits the top.

536
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,104
Scott: that's when the game ends right.

537
00:38:53,666 --> 00:39:04,439
Scott: yep when silver hits its max value I'm pretty sure that's one of the things that ends the game and basically victory points is money is money but silver is basically the money you have at the end of the game.

538
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,649
Rym: so you can get money and you can use that money to either buy more stocks or convert it to silver.

539
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:12,695
Rym: what is it converted to silver?

540
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,144
Rym: you can't turn it back into money.

541
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:14,748
Rym: I can't sell.

542
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,256
Scott: I didn't see any way to sell silver.

543
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:17,563
Rym: you can't sell silver but you want.

544
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:22,027
Scott: so if you in most games you're trying to figure out like all right when do I?

545
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:22,892
Scott: like a Puerto Rico?

546
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:28,297
Scott: I obviously early game doubloons are worth more and late-game victory points are worth more.

547
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,949
Scott: obviously cuz victory points are all that matter.

548
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:36,367
Scott: but if you go for victory points right away in Puerto Rico you'll have no doubloons and no barrels and then you won't be able to get more victory.

549
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,553
Rym: it's like race for the galaxy.

550
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:40,888
Rym: don't do the x2 consume on the second round right?

551
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,205
Scott: you know that's how most German euro timing games work.

552
00:39:44,245 --> 00:40:07,374
Scott: is that you have to build this resource engine crank it up just exactly the right amount of efficiency and then pull the levers that it starts producing victory points at the right time and the right amount but still also producing resources to get even more victory points so that you can basically completely exhaust all resources at the exact end of the game to have the most possible victory points because there's a timer in the way.

553
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:07,916
Scott: it does.

554
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:08,519
Scott: no timer.

555
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,762
Scott: you could just crank as hard as possible and then get a big infinite fountain of victory points.

556
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:14,626
Scott: that's stupid.

557
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,112
Scott: in Black Friday.

558
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:24,783
Scott: if you go for victory points early you could just buy a silver right away and it's so cheap that you kind of want to.

559
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,813
Rym: but your upside is at most 80.

560
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,480
Scott: that's still a really good upside.

561
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:39,412
Scott: yeah compared to you later in the game you buy one at like 90 shares of a stock that ends up being worth like 200 each right.

562
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:40,196
Scott: so that's the thing.

563
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:44,796
Scott: is that the only other thing you can do really is engage in the stock market.

564
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,864
Scott: that's hella risky.

565
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:49,733
Scott: it is based on pulling random cubes out of a bag.

566
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:58,357
Rym: now the stock market in this game is shockingly I'm not gonna say accurate to the real stock.

567
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:00,665
Scott: it's not accurate in its mechanism.

568
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:11,534
Rym: it's accurate in its motion in terms of liquidity affecting price and momentum and in terms of it's.

569
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:13,902
Rym: this game is designed to form bubbles.

570
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:18,298
Rym: so I start buying a stock and it goes up a little bit.

571
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:22,898
Scott: so I buy a stock which means I get a cube and we put a cube in the bag and the

572
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,546
Rym: same color same stock Rym

573
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:43,611
Scott: buys one and we put another one in the bag right and now if there's a lot of cubes in the bag this stock has a good chance of going up but then if everyone keeps buying it and the cubes come out of the bag which makes the price go up right and then people buy more cubes and the price goes up but now there's not a lot of cubes in the bag

574
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:45,862
Rym: because the price is up fewer people are buying.

575
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:50,121
Rym: so the game comes down to because the price went up from people buying it.

576
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,978
Scott: people started selling and now there's black cubes in the bag.

577
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:58,397
Scott: and when black cubes come in the ad out of the bag prices go way down.

578
00:41:58,577 --> 00:41:58,919
Rym: yep.

579
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:08,216
Scott: so you're trying to buy stocks that have cubes in the bag and then once the cubes come out of the bag you want to sell right away and things get cray.

580
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,929
Rym: yep and a stock's price can move a significant amount.

581
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,673
Rym: but all these?

582
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:19,183
Rym: it's really hard to explain all the ways that stocks will move without just teaching you literally the entire.

583
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,175
Scott: there's a crazy grid of numbers and they move up left down and right.

584
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:31,076
Rym: it's all weird and stuff and there's things that aren't really encoded in the board that you just have to know by reading the rule book like when the third cube is taken.

585
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,647
Scott: then this thing happens and we reprice all the stuff.

586
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:51,798
Rym: but unlike a lot of board games the one saving grace is that as long as at least one person at the table fully understands all those rules they can facilitate all the parts of the game that are complicated and even if you don't fully understand what they're doing

587
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:55,777
Scott: you can still understand enough to realize when it that you to figure out.

588
00:42:55,897 --> 00:43:16,574
Scott: okay I don't completely understand which cubes are moving where but I know enough to know that this stock is bubbling that one's tanking that one's on the rise and you can just tell right before I there was like as we played the game a few times it wasn't until like towards the end of the first playthrough that I fully understood how like all the rules of all the cube movement.

589
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,683
Rym: but I knew I was about to cry.

590
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:22,562
Scott: I was still a hundred percent right about what was happening in the market.

591
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,050
Scott: regardless because it moves.

592
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:32,708
Rym: naturally the game is a lot of great moments like I buy a stock and Scott buys the same stock right after me there was like oh shit I won.

593
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:39,075
Scott: so the first time he played I won and what happened was his Rym bought a stock and then it was.

594
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:43,579
Scott: then he went first and it was everyone else's turn and I said all right everyone Rym bought what color?

595
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,442
Rym: you forget.

596
00:43:44,503 --> 00:43:45,667
Scott: it was like pretend it was blue.

597
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,233
Scott: I'm like I listen everyone.

598
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,586
Scott: let's all go in together on orange.

599
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:51,349
Scott: everybody.

600
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,453
Scott: orange Rym went blue.

601
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:59,789
Scott: if we go blue we're gonna put a bunch of blue cubes in the bag and help Rym all of us orange and we'll all get a bunch of money and Rym won't.

602
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,022
Scott: and sure enough that's exactly what the hell happened.

603
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:04,012
Scott: it was totally great and I won.

604
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:13,756
Rym: so what's really fascinating too is that the game's very the game looks like and when you first start to learn it even feels like it's gonna be very fiddly number heavy in terms of like.

605
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,375
Rym: someone who's not good at math could have significant analysis.

606
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:18,823
Rym: paralysis trying to decide what to do.

607
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:28,068
Scott: if you try to analysis paralysis this game don't play this game but the game it's good enough to just know it's gonna go up a little up a medium up a lot down a little.

608
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:29,215
Scott: you don't need to know the exact number.

609
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:34,412
Rym: fascinating how well very simple heuristics on the board like.

610
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:40,792
Rym: are there a lot or a small number of green cubes on deck for the green stock?

611
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:44,728
Rym: are there a lot or a small number of them in this other area.

612
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,059
Rym: how many black suitcases are in the bag?

613
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:48,344
Scott: how many really?

614
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,312
Rym: simply heuristics like that gets you?

615
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:50,472
Rym: 99%?

616
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:55,596
Rym: as far as trying to calculate actual probability where is where is the price of silver?

617
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:56,259
Scott: right now?

618
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,936
Rym: the game seems to because the numbers are too like.

619
00:45:01,257 --> 00:45:07,525
Rym: odds are really difficult to calculate to the point that I don't think anyone playing this game could feasibly do it.

620
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:22,557
Rym: the fact that it's effectively impossible for the majority of players means that people won't even try to do it and this game I think is really good at fostering surprisingly nuanced heuristics and players they don't fully understand the logic of the heuristics they're using.

621
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:23,862
Scott: I think another great thing was.

622
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:29,766
Scott: game is simply that it has the classic drama we see so often of pulling stuff out of a bag.

623
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,058
Rym: Oh bag drama is one of my favorite things.

624
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,032
Scott: now Christine Euphrates what's the one with the digging for treasure?

625
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:35,555
Scott: Oh 7 7 right.

626
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,919
Scott: any game where you pull stuff randomly out of a bag is the awesomest right.

627
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,455
Scott: I'm way into bag pulling right now so I mean even even rah.

628
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,423
Scott: rah is like the worst bag pulling game.

629
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:59,292
Scott: yeah but basically even though you might be there were situations where it's like I know that bag is like a hundred percent blue cubes oh my god this is gonna happen and then after they finish pulling stuff out of the black suitcase black suitcase black suitcase.

630
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:05,413
Scott: it's like all black suitcases and blue ends up going down even though it's like oh my god why.

631
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:08,422
Scott: and it's you know it's.

632
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:20,093
Scott: it's like crazy shit happens and you totally get boned against the odds just like in the real stock market and that creates a lot of drama which is fun even if it's not the best in terms of like.

633
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,078
Scott: making it a skill game.

634
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,814
Scott: yep but the real world is not a school skill game.

635
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:26,802
Scott: it's full of luck and risk and nonsense.

636
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:38,037
Rym: unlike say camel up which has a very high luck factor for that sort of drama this game has a very high skill factor despite all that nonsense because that's pretty much the only luck is the pulling things out of a bag.

637
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,612
Scott: right now can't think of any other luck sources in the game.

638
00:46:40,954 --> 00:46:43,467
Rym: well you start with an initial loadout of some stocks.

639
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:48,729
Scott: oh your initial loadout is random but it effectively doesn't matter because this game is not an FF.

640
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:51,257
Rym: Schwartz are free tag.

641
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:54,773
Rym: okay black Friday has a F gotta be the word for Friday.

642
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:55,557
Rym: so black Friday.

643
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:58,130
Scott: well Schwartz definitely means black in Germanic languages.

644
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,423
Rym: yep black for oh and they use currency symbols.

645
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:02,788
Rym: okay that's cute mm-hmm.

646
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,444
Rym: but yeah the game is just kind of like pen Dante.

647
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:25,962
Rym: this game had a similar feel in the sense that this was a game that greatly exceeded my somewhat low expectations and was way more fun than I expected and as a result got way more of our precious packs tabletop hours than I expected.

648
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:28,473
Rym: yes so late this game what three times?

649
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:29,035
Scott: yeah?

650
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:37,515
Scott: so if you're a person who likes stock market type things right and you know you like playing like one of the stock market games you buy stocks with fake money.

651
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,728
Rym: oh this game is gonna scratch you so good.

652
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:43,650
Scott: and then you wait for the real market to move and you play that game over like multiple days.

653
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:45,279
Scott: right you see who who has the most money?

654
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,855
Scott: at the end of a month everyone starts with a thousand dollars of fake money.

655
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:56,677
Scott: this gives you all the more fun than that in only like a couple hours and the only thing you're missing out on is the real-world stock market stuff.

656
00:47:56,758 --> 00:48:04,256
Rym: right you can play this game real quick if everyone you're playing with this smart you only need one person to 100% know all the rules.

657
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:11,932
Scott: yeah that's important because that person better a hundred percent know all the rules perfectly yeah because it actually trusting them.

658
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,260
Scott: you're also trusting them to not cheat.

659
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:23,662
Rym: but most of the weird complexity that you might imagine this game has like I said it distills really like really simply into heuristics that are digestible.

660
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:34,242
Rym: and this game in terms of the ebb and flow and deciding when to shift from money generation to better victory point money generation because it's all just money.

661
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:36,910
Rym: in the end it's similar to st.

662
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,492
Rym: Petersburg.

663
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,757
Rym: yeah yeah like you have your two modes and you're flipping between them.

664
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:47,178
Scott: the other great thing about this game is that the your turns are really simple.

665
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:48,083
Scott: it's like comes to your turn.

666
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:49,229
Scott: it's like you can buy some stock.

667
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,698
Scott: yeah you can sell some stock.

668
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,985
Scott: you can buy some silver.

669
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,473
Scott: it's like there's not really.

670
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,061
Scott: it's a lot like ticket to ride.

671
00:48:55,081 --> 00:49:00,783
Scott: we're in very modern design where you go around taking very small actions on your turn.

672
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,269
Scott: there isn't a lot of like.

673
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:05,362
Scott: hmm I'm gonna move this but where do I move it?

674
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:08,760
Rym: kind of stuff and a consequence of that is that there's a lot of table.

675
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,227
Scott: it's like I'll buy a blue cube.

676
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:10,790
Scott: that's my turn.

677
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:16,740
Rym: go lots of table banter and player interaction like come on Scott greens hot join me buy some green stock with me.

678
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,775
Rym: we'll make out like bandits except we went against Rym.

679
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,660
Scott: we did the smart thing.

680
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,292
Scott: don't don't get on the Rym team.

681
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:25,955
Scott: everyone getting up on Rym and that totally worked like in that page is what you should be doing.

682
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:30,781
Scott: every time I tell you to do that see how well it worked do it again every so and we play getting up on Rym.

683
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:37,508
Rym: in the three ongoing long-form Civ games I have the first one the big crew one that they hang up on Rym.

684
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,304
Rym: so the entire world has been at war with me for like a hundred years.

685
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,448
Scott: good job world.

686
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:45,742
Rym: literally the entire world is at war with me.

687
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:46,464
Scott: good job world.

688
00:49:46,685 --> 00:49:47,066
Scott: good job.

689
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:52,466
Rym: and yet despite that the only consequence is I lost my worst city.

690
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:54,594
Rym: I'm still actually doing fine.

691
00:49:55,076 --> 00:50:01,476
Rym: do better at the game people in the patreon game I feel like I'm running away with it.

692
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,161
Scott: I know no one can stop.

693
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:04,889
Scott: sure the other people are just not that good.

694
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:15,878
Rym: so one person who I know is good just got F'd because basically Egypt was like on this continent like in a line to the south of them was me and Persia and I just rolled Persia.

695
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:19,151
Rym: so I'm up on Egypt's border and Poland rolled someone.

696
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:24,571
Rym: so Poland and me are these two massive land like war empires and Egypt.

697
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:28,285
Rym: was this lost strip of culture between the two of us?

698
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:32,423
Scott: you know well Black Friday I think would be a fun game to play online.

699
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:34,174
Scott: if it's an online version I could just play.

700
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,584
Scott: you know you could play one in like an hour or whatever.

701
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,857
Scott: if a computer did it for you it would be so fast.

702
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,796
Rym: but I feel like playing it physically with people is the only way.

703
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:45,359
Rym: this game right.

704
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:55,624
Scott: but what I'm saying is that and I would really like it even more if someone made a somewhat similar stock market game where there's like a fake market and stocks go up and down.

705
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:00,098
Scott: yeah except it's more real-time if it's digital right.

706
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,931
Rym: so you're more mule trading right.

707
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:06,369
Scott: you basically pretend like there's a fake stock market and everyone the gate.

708
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:19,208
Scott: the day you got it you've got dials know your socks buy or sell and there's like anyway bye bye bye bye and basically the stocks are moving in real time and you're basically simulating like a day of day trading or something.

709
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:23,370
Scott: yeah obviously it only takes an hour that the clock is sped up and then you play.

710
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:26,484
Rym: as long as that feedback loop is this game I can't stress enough.

711
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:34,158
Rym: I'm not even gonna try to explain the details of the feedback loop of how stock prices get determined in this game.

712
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:35,122
Rym: you just got to read the rules.

713
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:41,732
Scott: cubes move around a grid based on how many cubes come out of a bag minus how many black suitcases come out of a bag.

714
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:44,764
Rym: but it is a fascinating mechanism.

715
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:49,451
Rym: if I ever get the chance to interview Friedman freeze the first question I'm gonna ask how did you come up with this?

716
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:55,157
Rym: yeah how did you play test and design this specific mechanism in Schwartz sir free tags?

717
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:58,731
Scott: I made a lot of games so I'm good at genius game maker.

718
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:06,868
Scott: so yeah I don't know if this game is for everybody but if you like stocks and you like you're okay playing games that are a little bit hard to understand.

719
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:11,431
Scott: well I'd say and you got you like to play for an hour with you know four or five six is it?

720
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:13,520
Scott: go to six people and check.

721
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:19,184
