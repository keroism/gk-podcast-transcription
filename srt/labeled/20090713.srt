00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,480

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:47,328
Rym: There's this shady looking is not a big deal like ripped off like just really crappy looking package That's half opened.

10
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,880
Rym: It's addressed to Scott.

11
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,560
Rym: It was mailed from Beacon of like a while ago, and it has no return address.

12
00:00:54,741 --> 00:01:02,644
Scott: I mailed a book to somebody because they sold the book on Amazon and somehow the book showed up on My front porch.

13
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:08,120
Rym: yeah, so as a result you know shady looking package ripped open no return address mailed from B.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,860
Scott: I have to go check my Amazon's after the show to see if this person like returned it or why?

15
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:17,680
Rym: That whatever mailing label you put on it fell off and the post office got it.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:17,983
Rym: They're like.

17
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,358
Rym: well, there's only one address here.

18
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:22,740
Rym: We'll mail it to Scott Reuben and oh he put plenty of postage on it.

19
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:23,403
Scott: I put the.

20
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,009
Scott: the address was clearly.

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,500
Scott: it was on a piece of paper that was heavily taped to the front.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,617
Scott: So I do not know what the hell happened to it.

23
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:38,640
Scott: But I will go and correct this situation Emailing the purchaser and such-and-such, but much more importantly I come out of work for lunch.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Rym: I'm kind of in a hurry, and it was like tourist day like more so than any other day.

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,180
Rym: I walk on a 42nd Street, and I just can't walk.

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,330
Rym: They're just slow people blocking every sidewalk in every direction.

27
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:55,420
Rym: It took me like 10 minutes to walk to the Chipotle But on my way, there's a inside of this crowd.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,155
Rym: There's another crowd this long line of people lined up somewhere.

29
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,545
Rym: It was like down the street And I'm like all right.

30
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,260
Rym: what's going on here, so I walk up to the front of the line.

31
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:11,840
Rym: I see that the line terminates at that shady looking KFC slash Dunkin Donuts on 42nd Street by Grand Central.

32
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:16,016
Rym: But then I look and I realize that it's no longer Dunkin Donuts.

33
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:20,493
Rym: it is now Shady looking KFC and a shady looking Tim Hortons.

34
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,160
Scott: really, so that's where it is.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,367
Rym: That's where the Tim Hortons is.

36
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,038
Scott: they got rid of the bad place.

37
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,717
Rym: well No, it's in a great place if you get rid of that KFC.

38
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:32,620
Scott: I didn't know the Dunkin Donuts and Tim Hortons and KFC were all the same company.

39
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,900
Rym: I don't think Tim Hortons is I think the Dunkin Donuts.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,520
Scott: Do you think that the guy who just owns that storefront like has bought two franchises and put him in the same place?

41
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,987
Rym: I think Dunkin Donuts.

42
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:44,560
Rym: they realized that that Dunkin Donuts was not making him money.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,099
Rym: I mean that's the one where the those you know the people were complaining about their 80 cent coffee.

44
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:53,165
Scott: Well he definitely made his money back with his uh Switching to Tim Hortons franchise.

45
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,308
Scott: The thing is don't?

46
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:58,140
Scott: usually franchises make you have agreements like you can't have like a McDonald's.

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,214
Scott: If I buy a McDonald's franchise and a Burger King franchise They don't let me put them in the same building.

48
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,440
Rym: it depends everyone's different.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,369
Scott: I mean subway basically doesn't give a shit about anything.

50
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:10,780
Scott: subway is the easiest franchise in the universe exactly which is why they're everywhere.

51
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,820
Rym: That's also why most subways you get into are super shady.

52
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:14,983
Scott: Yeah, like.

53
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,209
Scott: basically you like if you wanted to open up.

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,837
Scott: I don't know a cold stone right.

55
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,527
Scott: they don't say yes That easily you got to.

56
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:26,743
Scott: you know be pretty cool bad, and you know slick or else They'll just be like no We're not gonna let you.

57
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:32,569
Scott: but if you want to open up a subway all you do is say yeah Thinking about you got one here.

58
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:34,217
Scott: you go open anywhere you want.

59
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:38,784
Rym: the best part is of all those subways are so Shady's the word today.

60
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:52,880
Rym: because like a lot of my co-workers will just like go to subway real quick and the people know they'll like Cover up the $5 footlong sign and try to get away with not following the promotion that they have to follow.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,639
Rym: Really, I've never seen that or they'll just charge people full price unless they complain.

62
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,752
Rym: oh Yeah, I basically have given up subway forever.

63
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:02,440
Scott: I mean I'll go to subway.

64
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,268
Scott: You know it sits on the lid.

65
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,060
Scott: I rarely eat at any sort of emergency food.

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,903
Rym: There's the list of.

67
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,471
Rym: you know it's an acceptable emergency food.

68
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:18,692
Rym: It's like the bottom of that list is pretty much like I'll go to Arby's I'll go to Subway I'll go to Taco Bell.

69
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:19,820
Scott: I won't go to Taco Bell ever.

70
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:23,031
Rym: I would go to Taco Bell before I go to McDonald's or Burger King.

71
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:40,476
Scott: I would go to McDonald's or Burger King because at least they before Taco Bell because at least while I would you know Those three are way at the bottom of the list way at the bottom the bottom Taco Bell is still lower than McDonald's or Burger King because McDonald's and Burger King especially.

72
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:45,351
Scott: McDonald's has Some menu items that are you know acceptable?

73
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,036
Rym: What does Taco Bell not have?

74
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,540
Rym: they're like high school cafeteria tacos.

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,405
Rym: They're not that bad.

76
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:50,029
Scott: They're pretty bad.

77
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,731
Scott: at McDonald's I can get like you know A cookie that's not dinner a chemical milkshake.

78
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,514
Rym: That's not dinner.

79
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:57,858
Scott: Oh a dinner.

80
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:58,620
Rym: Yeah food.

81
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,626
Rym: This is the situation of cinecon.

82
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,934
Rym: We're in the middle of nowhere, and there's no food.

83
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,739
Scott: a dinner from McDonald's.

84
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:07,509
Scott: Yeah, I get a chicken sandwich at McDonald's.

85
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,339
Scott: right you can't be chicken something something.

86
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,006
Rym: Yeah It's not as good as the Arby's one.

87
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:12,467
Scott: I mean.

88
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:15,038
Scott: It's just mechanically separated chicken McNugget whatnot?

89
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:18,178
Rym: yeah Alright, so McDonald's or Burger King I?

90
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,005
Scott: Take McDonald's slightly over Burger King because King's at the bottom.

91
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:26,000
Rym: for me the only thing Burger King is like Papa eyes at a rest stop.

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,231
Scott: Well, you know there's like Chick-fil-a is way down.

93
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,900
Rym: Well Chick-fil-a is in a different category.

94
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,484
Rym: I won't eat.

95
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,060
Scott: Roy Rogers is way down there Chick-fil-a.

96
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,610
Rym: I'm against both for food reasons and for moral reason.

97
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,116
Scott: White Castle is pretty much the bottom.

98
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,299
Rym: White Castle is awesome castles in a separate category.

99
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,971
Scott: Well, I guess it's pretty much the most disgusting worst food.

100
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,240
Scott: You could possibly I will seek out White Castle.

101
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,064
Scott: I know this.

102
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,250
Scott: that's why I called it out.

103
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,140
Scott: Yeah to show how disgusting you are right.

104
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:55,036
Scott: It's no hot now getting your chicken sticks chicken rings at the White Castle.

105
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,239
Rym: I don't need the chicken rings.

106
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:04,525
Rym: Nothing on the White Castle menu other than the standard White Castle burger You think I'm gonna eat.

107
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,653
Rym: look like fried oysters that they have.

108
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,420
Scott: yeah, that's what White Castle is about it.

109
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:09,507
Rym: No, that's not what it's about.

110
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,320
Rym: you go there and order a sack of like a hundred.

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,018
Scott: You know what I heard White Castle is 88 years old and they have a special sale going on right now.

112
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:17,158
Scott: 88 cents.

113
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,508
Rym: Oh, yeah, they do that periodically.

114
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:21,036
Scott: Yeah, the thing is next year.

115
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:21,437
Scott: It'll be 89 cents.

116
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,820
Scott: I don't think it's gonna keep up with inflation though.

117
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,720
Scott: So I think when they're like a hundred and the burgers are a dollar they'll probably worth like five dollars.

118
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:34,110
Rym: See the thing is the way they get away with that is that people go there like oh, yeah G burger and then they realize how awesome White Castle is.

119
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,480
Scott: No, it's it's really not awesome at all.

120
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,212
Rym: When was the last time you ate a White Castle burger?

121
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,920
Scott: when you and me went to White Castle?

122
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:41,743
Rym: You actually ate.

123
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:44,953
Rym: I recall you not wanting to eat and just sitting there.

124
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,027
Scott: Oh, I mean, I yeah I went there, but I didn't.

125
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:48,470
Scott: I didn't eat.

126
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:49,800
Rym: when was the last time you ate one?

127
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,873
Rym: You don't know what they taste like.

128
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:55,365
Scott: they're all right back in Jersey Jersey way back.

129
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:55,787
Scott: that's where.

130
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,240
Scott: that's where the only place that real White Castles are is Jersey.

131
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:03,842
Scott: No, I don't let them anywhere else because they're so disgusting Way.

132
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,630
Scott: they let you make a subway anywhere.

133
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,558
Scott: cuz at least it's you know, it's just food on a roll.

134
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,393
Scott: but as a kid I mean that's only legal in like certain places.

135
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:17,720
Rym: as a kid in Stirling Heights White Castle Burger King and Taco Bell were banned from the city limits.

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,679
Rym: So at every corner like at the edge every road that went out of the city right there It was a Burger King a White Castle and a Taco Bell.

137
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,629
Scott: KFC is also way down.

138
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:29,111
Rym: It was funny.

139
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:32,283
Rym: They banned Taco Bell and White Castle I believe for the grade of meat.

140
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:40,034
Rym: they banned Burger King because that had ordinance against smells and apparently Burger King could not Possibly conform to that ordinance.

141
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:42,259
Rym: Wow Yeah.

142
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,740
Rym: So so there's a Tim Hortons there and I can get Tim bits in the morning.

143
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,640
Scott: I guess I'll just buy a doughnut from a cart if I really want one.

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,578
Scott: Yeah, I used to like pass by like maybe one cart going to work.

145
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,848
Scott: now I passed by like eight carts.

146
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,374
Scott: think there's like so many.

147
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:01,108
Rym: if you're gonna get the cart doughnut You got to get the coffee stick.

148
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,959
Rym: It's pretty much the best doughnut in there.

149
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:03,984
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

150
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,422
Rym: I sort of like the regular old glaze, but the coffee stick is the closest thing to a real doughnut I've seen.

151
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:11,777
Scott: also those cards have actually pretty good bagels and they're only 75 cents.

152
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,592
Scott: Yeah, like you go to like, you know, like they're hot and crusty.

153
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:19,473
Rym: It's like a dollar a dollar and it's not dollar Eighty it's a dollar eighty if you get cream cheese.

154
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:20,460
Scott: I don't get a cream cheese.

155
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:21,947
Rym: What kind of bagel you eat?

156
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,373
Scott: It's too much money with the cream cheese.

157
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,847
Rym: I Can't be a big spender.

158
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,620
Rym: Not everyone has all this money laying around.

159
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:28,465
Scott: I know right.

160
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:30,879
Scott: I get a cream cheese at home where I could buy some tempe.

161
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,232
Scott: But the cream plus they don't give you this the whipped cream cheese.

162
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,900
Scott: They give you that solid cream cheese is no good.

163
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,235
Rym: Problem is they put like a pound of it on my bag.

164
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,280
Scott: That's also a problem.

165
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,068
Rym: I like scrape some off before I eat it.

166
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,500
Scott: All right, so you're paying for all that extra cream.

167
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:48,440
Scott: Actually, you know what those those really generic metro cafes.

168
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:53,703
Scott: They're actually a pretty good place to go to get a bagel because a you don't really have to wait in line because no one Else is getting a bagel.

169
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:57,820
Scott: there be the bagels not too bad and see like they toast it and there's no line.

170
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,640
Scott: So other places like it's hard to get it toasted, you know, well, you know, I get the city early enough.

171
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,764
Rym: There's never a line for anything.

172
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,156
Rym: No, except the goddamn Starbucks.

173
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:07,477
Rym: No 7 a.m.

174
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:08,180
Rym: There's like 10 people.

175
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,779
Scott: That's the only place it's gonna be a lineup that early.

176
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,279
Rym: All right tech news is some tech news.

177
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,647
Scott: What was my tech news?

178
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,210
Scott: Oh, yes.

179
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:36,740
Scott: I don't believe we talked about this on the show earlier But the creators of gizmodo and who moved on to also crate and gadget which are pretty much the same thing as gizmodo Have moved on yet again and they opened up GDGT Which is not like gizmodo or in gadget at all really other than it is, you know, that's gadget website.

180
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,029
Rym: I don't know what your opinion is, but I'm pretty much I went from.

181
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,580
Rym: this is awesome - this is crap in about a day.

182
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,287
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much read from.

183
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:47,960
Scott: this is awesome - this is crap - this is okay And it's got to improve a lot.

184
00:09:48,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Scott: Basically, the site is sort of what I hoped it would be right and that you have this situation Where you know a gadget comes out, let's say it's I don't know a particular model of digital camera, right?

185
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:05,660
Scott: And you want to discuss this particular model of digital camera with other people who have that particular model.

186
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,900
Scott: And that's not so easy on the Internet.

187
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,056
Scott: So, I mean I had a. my previous cell phone was like a LG VX 8600, right?

188
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,500
Scott: And I found some weird forum on the internet.

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Scott: That was one at some crazy V bulletin thing and there was one category in that forum that had a threads for my phone as I get to join it and it's you know, it's Like that one phone happened to have this nook and cranny on the internet.

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,069
Scott: you know, like the TiVo used to have these TiVo forums that all these TiVo people would go to like these AVS forums and who knows what.

191
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:49,448
Scott: and You know, it really was not a good situation for people who wanted to like, you know, sort of connect in a community around gadgets either specific or general.

192
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,030
Scott: and I remember

193
00:10:50,070 --> 00:11:01,420
Rym: very very very much way back when we had that Apex or whatever DVD player Yep, and I had to troll around and there the forums about that device to figure out how to hack it to be region-free

194
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,980
Scott: Yep, and also, you know even to talk about general tech stuff, right?

195
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:15,280
Scott: I mean, you know slash dot and you know dig and those sorts of places that have tech news Right that also have I guess discussion, right?

196
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:21,000
Scott: They don't really cover the tech news the way they engage it and gizmodo do and while engaging gizmodo have comments.

197
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,660
Scott: Those comments are these flat comments.

198
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:28,560
Scott: There are thousands of them within like a minute and you can't really have a discussion or connect with anyone.

199
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,691
Scott: All you can do is post a comment that no one's ever gonna see.

200
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:44,280
Scott: so GDGT sort of also You know, they sort of bring in the RSS from gizmodo and engage it in other places and allow, you know Discussions actual discussions on the tech topics and things, you know.

201
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,700
Scott: So it's sort of good in this way.

202
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:57,240
Scott: And also there's a gadget database that you know They sort of started it up, but people you can go in and contribute, you know And add in new gadgets that aren't in there and I've added a few and you know.

203
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,482
Scott: Then you can also search gadgets based on specs Like you can say.

204
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:08,017
Scott: show me all the 40 inch plasmas that have at least this much like refresh rate and stuff like that Which is pretty cool.

205
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:19,844
Scott: The things that bother me about the site is you know First of all any entries into the database need to be approved by some people who work for them Which is Pretty problematic.

206
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:24,460
Scott: They should have just made it an open wiki like Wikipedia and let people go.

207
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,029
Rym: No Didn't you try to add your happy hacking keyboard and you couldn't.

208
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,559
Scott: I tried to add the happy hacking keyboard because I want to discuss It with other happy having keyboard people.

209
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:36,340
Scott: I first I couldn't add it because the company that makes it was not already added in the system.

210
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,420
Scott: So I had to add PFU systems.

211
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:44,340
Scott: They denied my entry for PFU systems because they didn't realize that they made the happy hacking keyboard.

212
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,360
Scott: They were like consumer electronics manufacturers only and PFU systems primarily makes non consumer electronics the happy hacking keyboard.

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,729
Scott: It's pretty much the only consumer product they make.

214
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,198
Scott: so I had to go in and they have a separate.

215
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,430
Scott: one thing They did that was smart is they have a separate forum for talking about GDGT, you know and I really like that.

216
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,819
Scott: there is you know stack overflow gets that right.

217
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,195
Scott: also You need to separate the meta from the site itself.

218
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,645
Scott: putting them in together Really really hurts.

219
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:17,609
Rym: how long have people wanted that for slash job some sort of place to argue about slash dot in independently of the articles?

220
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:27,011
Scott: exactly because if people talk about Slash on slash dot then people who come to slash that who don't care about slash dot itself But I actually care about the content are inundated with all this.

221
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:33,900
Scott: talk about mod points and shit and they're like, oh fuck days Right, like if you go to stack overflow, you're looking for the answer to your tech question.

222
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,620
Scott: You're not looking to talk about this site that you never even heard of because you just came to it through Google, right?

223
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:46,174
Scott: So set they have a separate forum on their site for talking about GDGT and I'm like Hey, I was denied and they fixed it.

224
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:50,600
Scott: so good for them And then I was able to enter my keyboard and they accepted that as well.

225
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,083
Scott: So they're they're good about it But it's still.

226
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,227
Scott: they should have made it a wiki.

227
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,449
Scott: all the data that people are entering should be Creative Commons wiki license Just like Wikipedia.

228
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:04,108
Scott: right Wikipedia compatible And you know the.

229
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:08,979
Scott: they could use a little bit more Cleanliness in some of the interface bits.

230
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,879
Scott: it's sometimes hard to figure out exactly what to click on and such like that.

231
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,745
Scott: and You know, it's.

232
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:25,838
Scott: you know, it's definitely got the right idea, but the execution is not yet perfect, but I'm still sort of hopeful because the people behind it are smart and also the.

233
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:28,830
Scott: You know, they're gonna iterate.

234
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,480
Scott: they're nowhere near done, right?

235
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,575
Scott: They got a lot of a lot of room to grow and you know, they've got to start.

236
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:42,784
Scott: I just wonder How long they can hold on to all these people they grabbed with their sort of initial go, you know It's like they started up.

237
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:44,271
Scott: a million people rush in.

238
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:45,960
Scott: how many people are still there?

239
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,020
Scott: I guarantee like less than you know, a very small percentage of the people are still Actively coming to the site all the time.

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:00,331
Rym: plus there's the problem of any thing like that on the internet where You'll probably just distill everyone down to the dig around Paul people.

241
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:00,752
Scott: Yep.

242
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:08,472
Scott: And well, I think another thing is that You look at a site like in gadget right and Even though these people are not in a gadget anymore.

243
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:17,490
Scott: You'll still read it once a day Maybe even twice a day because the updating with new news GDGT doesn't have that update thing going on.

244
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:26,543
Scott: You know, it's like the front page is just the only go when you need something And once you go, yeah, you only need something or you know, if you're if you're you know It's.

245
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:28,779
Scott: it's not something you're gonna go to all the time.

246
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,539
Scott: So it's sort of you have to really you know.

247
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:40,120
Scott: the only time you're gonna visit it a ton is if you're heavily invested in some gadget and the Community around that gadget builds up on GDGT.

248
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:55,820
Scott: However, if there is a gadget that warrants a community building up around it I think GDGT has sort of become the default place to form that community So that that's gonna help them and I think they just need to wait for more gadgets that are community worthy to to appear.

249
00:15:56,641 --> 00:16:04,540
Scott: And the thing is though I sort of feel like when a gadget is too popular like say the iPhone Just GDGT has the iPhone section is just so crazy.

250
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,940
Scott: It's not even really, you know, maybe if you want to like find a how-to for hacking it or something like that be in there.

251
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,077
Scott: But for discussion, I think it's too intense still.

252
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:17,620
Rym: the thing is I think the majority of people for any act any device don't care about the discussion.

253
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,959
Rym: They literally just want these step-by-step back.

254
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:28,324
Scott: And I think that GDGT, you know in those discussions the facts will appear and that will be helpful to people's One interesting thing they did.

255
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:37,436
Scott: the last thing I'll say is that you can do reviews of gadgets and you can either a you find A gadget you can link to an existing review elsewhere on the net like CNET slash dot.

256
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:46,560
Scott: wherever your blog you can also Submit your own review, but your review has to be at least like I was like some number of words.

257
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:55,599
Scott: So like you can comment and discuss your your brains out But if you want to put a review up it has to be at least so long You know which implies that it's you know good.

258
00:16:56,262 --> 00:17:01,797
Rym: So I think that was a thing that it says fuck you iPod followed by the letter a repeated 150 times.

259
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,651
Scott: Yeah, I somehow think that won't make it through but you know that was.

260
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:07,980
Scott: that was shows that they're thinking about that sort of thing.

261
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:16,280
Rym: I mean slash dot always had the lameness filter Yeah That's true Which more often than not seemed to stop legitimate posts that we're trying to post code than it did to stop spammers.

262
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:17,819
Scott: Yeah, but you know what you do.

263
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:25,560
Rym: But I remember way way back when I was in high school And I was really like that was when I was really into hacking and all that sort of stuff.

264
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,160
Rym: And I kind of the more I learned about computers the less I cared about that sort of thing.

265
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,674
Rym: I know right it's funny how that works.

266
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:34,378
Rym: and now the Security is a big deal and I work for one of those big iron companies.

267
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:39,359
Rym: yet again That sort of hacking is just no longer even useful or interesting or any.

268
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:46,448
Scott: well I think what it is is a lot of that hacking is You know it's only Pragmatic for people with more time than money.

269
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,439
Scott: and there's also the situation that it's kind of like it's also Pratt It's only pragmatic as a entertaining hobby if you have tons of money.

270
00:17:54,459 --> 00:18:01,078
Rym: well No, it's kind of like the freaking days like the Golden Age of hacking the phone system where you know a technology appears.

271
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,439
Rym: in this case It's internet computing all that sort of stuff.

272
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:14,880
Rym: And they'll kind of be this early Wild West phase where the technology is being suddenly widely deployed But there are very few safeguards or controls and nothing's really tested or proven.

273
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,919
Rym: And that's when hackers can really do crazy awesome stuff.

274
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:26,037
Rym: But then it won't take long for the sophisticated Companies and the people who know what they're doing to come in patch everything, and then there's no more Wild West.

275
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:31,448
Rym: yeah It's a different kind of Wild West.

276
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:31,749
Rym: I mean it.

277
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:41,817
Rym: it used to be the Wild West of we're Omnipotent gods walking through a sea of ants and now it's the Wild West of everybody has a gun and nobody Has a way to start the real Wild West.

278
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:50,100
Scott: no But you know some stuff like say overclocking right is really good for people who don't have a lot of money But have a lot of time because you know they can get there.

279
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:53,558
Scott: you know really they can hack to sort of get more than they paid for.

280
00:18:53,578 --> 00:19:09,254
Scott: and Certain stuff like say jailbreaking your iPhone is really great if you have a ton of money because if you break your iPhone You can just get another one, but for someone like us or we have more money than time But we don't have so much money that we can afford two iPhones.

281
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,944
Scott: right it's sort of like well We got enough money.

282
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,840
Scott: We can just buy a faster CPU instead overclocking, but I don't have so much money.

283
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,000
Scott: I can buy two iPhones.

284
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,704
Scott: You know I'm gonna take.

285
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:22,731
Rym: so I'm not really happy to take a completely different Tech here in that I think a big part of it is now.

286
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,819
Rym: I was talking about the golden age of hacking and all that.

287
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,840
Rym: Yeah, it's just like with science.

288
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:36,927
Rym: I mean back in the day you could have a Ben Franklin who kind of dabbles and everything and the bar of doing something cool Or interesting or novel or new were so low that It didn't take a lot.

289
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:41,927
Rym: you didn't need this gigantic body of prior knowledge To do some crazy things early on.

290
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:57,720
Rym: it took very little to do very much, but as things got more sophisticated I mean the level of skill and knowledge it takes to write a modern worm or a modern effective virus is So much that by the time you learn that much you've given up on your desire to own swords.

291
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,708
Rym: Yeah, I think that's the primary factor.

292
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:10,580
Scott: of course most you know people doing the worms are either a they're making so much bank Cuz they're the guy doing it or you're just some script kitty who just takes them from that guy and then uses exactly.

293
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,624
Rym: But that's a whole script.

294
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,054
Rym: kidding is a whole different thing from actually hacking.

295
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:23,028
Rym: Yeah, all right But I remember one of the hot topics back then was tempest and the whole EMI shielding and that Theoretical this.

296
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,762
Scott: this is like this funny joke RIT.

297
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:30,140
Rym: yeah, well everyone always went after it and tried to do it and well it was this really fear.

298
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,418
Scott: It was this theoretical thing that worked, but it was sort of like more trouble than it was worth right.

299
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,400
Scott: the idea Was that you know if someone has CRT monitor?

300
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:46,880
Scott: And you had like this really fancy equipment you could basically spy on see their screen Even if you weren't looking at their screen.

301
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,502
Scott: Well, it's basically.

302
00:20:47,562 --> 00:21:00,980
Rym: it's close to fundamentally the idea that you can take the extent kind of radiation because you know there's electromagnetic radiation coming out of any electronic device yep and Theoretically that contains everything is being processed by your computer.

303
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:05,339
Rym: It's just obfuscated by the fact that there's a lot of electromagnetic radiation going around yep.

304
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:17,275
Rym: But because computers are synchronous and they have buses and they're very reliable timing it is Theoretically possible to identify a particular computer in that radiation and get information from it.

305
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:19,723
Rym: and like this is true It can be done.

306
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:21,309
Rym: There are lots of proof of concept.

307
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:32,660
Rym: It's been done, but but at that time Hackers in particular people like me were real into it and as a result I remember it was just a huge thing and people were trying to do it all the time.

308
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:34,920
Rym: There was a lot of software and hardware like that.

309
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:36,500
Scott: What's the practical?

310
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:43,054
Scott: Situation where that hack is actually a gonna work and B. There isn't a better hack that would work in the same situation.

311
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:44,400
Scott: that is less stupid.

312
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:45,966
Rym: I think there definitely are.

313
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:46,648
Rym: just a matter of.

314
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:59,971
Rym: it was a lot more difficult to do than a lot of people thought but The disparity between how difficult it was and how difficult people thought it was led to a really interesting situation where people were building RFI or EMI shielded computers.

315
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:01,660
Rym: people were building Faraday cages around them.

316
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,411
Scott: I didn't say I didn't see much of that.

317
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:04,780
Rym: There was a lot of that on the internet.

318
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:07,060
Scott: I think there's a lot of reports of that on the internet.

319
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:10,945
Rym: I saw a lot of pictures and designs for it and PGP.

320
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:13,720
Rym: the early versions back in the day had a mode.

321
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:25,400
Rym: It was called temp is secure and what it would do is when you viewed you decrypted a document It would show it on your screen in this very low contrast kind of shifting window.

322
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:31,900
Rym: That theoretically would be much more difficult to read in some sort of tempest attack that was built into PGP.

323
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,380
Scott: I don't remember that but I used your word for it.

324
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,556
Rym: I used it because I was a paranoid high school hacker nerd and tempest was totally remember that.

325
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,184
Scott: I don't remember hearing about the tempest Until we were at RIT.

326
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:46,772
Rym: So it was all really around back.

327
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:47,153
Rym: Yes.

328
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:48,116
Rym: People were people.

329
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:50,488
Rym: it was the theoretical thing I mean around that time.

330
00:22:50,508 --> 00:23:00,360
Rym: There's also the idea that you could Theoretically if you could film What was going on on some really slow network equipment that had those LEDs that would light up when data was being sent.

331
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:06,339
Rym: You could recreate the data that was being sent because the LEDs were triggered by the pulses on the wire.

332
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:09,594
Scott: We need to know if the pulse is a one or a zero.

333
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:10,899
Rym: No, you don't know.

334
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:13,788
Rym: But and it actually did work.

335
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:17,700
Rym: But what most people failed to realize was that it worked on technology.

336
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,098
Rym: It was already obsolete and that that can't work with like.

337
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:28,719
Scott: well The other thing the other thing that's stupid about that right is like, okay Let's say that even if you could do it with modern networking equipment, right?

338
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,649
Scott: Well that assumes right that you can get into a situation where you're next to The networking equipment with a camera.

339
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:38,411
Rym: that's trivial.

340
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,860
Rym: Have you ever been to a modern colo data center?

341
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,966
Scott: They just let you walk right in.

342
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:43,455
Rym: Well, no you have your cage.

343
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,840
Rym: when you have a key You can only get into your cage and no one can get into your cage without your permission.

344
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:53,525
Rym: So in my cage, I just put a fucking camera That looks at your own stuff.

345
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,252
Rym: Look at someone else's stuff in another cage.

346
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,684
Rym: The cages are usually just like bars But that's so.

347
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,520
Scott: that's a very, you know narrow scenario.

348
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:02,924
Rym: It's not.

349
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:11,180
Rym: it's not as narrow as you'd think because for example Like some of the data centers that I have stuff in it like there's a giant like a huge important Google thing.

350
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,540
Rym: It's like right next to us and like one of our competitors is like right next to us like all that sort of stuff.

351
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:27,060
Rym: uh-huh, there are a lot of that's why data center security is such a big deal because there's a lot of Very important information right next to other very important information and people on both sides want that information.

352
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:32,100
Rym: Luckily the camera trick doesn't work on any modern infrastructure whatsoever.

353
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,760
Scott: Yeah, now the lights is pretty much tell you it's working.

354
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:42,207
Rym: It's not working but tempest was a huge deal among the 2,600 phone freaker hacker types because that stuff was yeah I guess let's define the 20s.

355
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:43,133
Scott: There must be a 2,600 article articles.

356
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:48,180
Rym: Not only was it really cool, but in kind of that sort of thing back then.

357
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,040
Rym: It was a lot easier to do partly because things were slower and things were less shielded used it a lot more power.

358
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,509
Rym: Your computer was just a gigantic antenna.

359
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,767
Rym: I mean look at a ps2 keyboard and how loud that is Electromagnetically compared to like USB keyboard.

360
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,616
Scott: I think the my headphones died, but that's alright.

361
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:05,857
Scott: Yeah.

362
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:17,407
Rym: Alright, but anyway The news here is that this whole thing Suddenly got rediscovered by the internet and we're gonna see a lot of people losing their shit over this again because there's well I thought there's a new.

363
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,291
Scott: someone just came up with a new one That was pretty much like the same thing.

364
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:22,860
Scott: only it looks at keyboards, right?

365
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:34,444
Rym: Well, there's a proof of concept at some conference where basically you can read what people are typing on ps2 keyboards and possibly other devices by Having Lasers or something right?

366
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:39,680
Rym: No, but I have an electrical outlet by having an outlet on the same ground as someone else's outlet.

367
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:48,093
Rym: Yeah, and there's a proof of concept and it looks like it works at about scenario Do you have physical access to the same outlets as someone else?

368
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:48,997
Rym: That's pretty trivial.

369
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:49,940
Rym: I'm in a skyscraper.

370
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,056
Rym: I'm on the same floor as some other company.

371
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,073
Scott: Yeah, still, you know, yeah, and they got a lot of computers over there.

372
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:58,798
Scott: How you gonna separate which ones are which?

373
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,084
Rym: well That's the part of it.

374
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:01,470
Rym: I mean, did you even read the article?

375
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,354
Rym: Do you know anything about this?

376
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:04,544
Rym: No, not at all It doesn't.

377
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:05,911
Scott: it doesn't sound that to me though.

378
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,157
Scott: Like it's a plausible hack.

379
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:07,579
Scott: That's useful.

380
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:18,000
Rym: What it is is it's actually pretty much equally plausible to a lot of the tempest stuff in that if you have sophisticated equipment You could probably engage in some very sophisticated attacks.

381
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:28,440
Rym: however, the real thing here is that the majority of people will never encounter this on either side and People are going to talk about this a lot more than is warranted probably.

382
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:33,960
Scott: I mean if you want to hack someone you could probably just get him with any old normal worm and it's it's gonna work.

383
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,275
Scott: It's not like a. you know, this is sort of like ridiculous kind of.

384
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:40,829
Rym: well, it's not ridiculous It's just interesting fun kind of hobby hacker stuff.

385
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,629
Rym: I mean if you're into ham radio, let's say or Electromagnetic design or anything like that.

386
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,017
Rym: This stuff is really cool.

387
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:54,460
Scott: It's cool Yes, but I'm saying is that if anyone actually takes this as a as a legitimate security consideration you're going overboard.

388
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,860
Rym: Well, it depends on what you're doing and who you think your enemies are and there are industries where that sort of thing.

389
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,945
Rym: You've got to take it into account.

390
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,800
Scott: I don't think anyone's gonna do this hack ever?

391
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,720
Rym: Well, the thing is it's pretty trivial to counter these sorts of attacks.

392
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,799
Rym: It's the same thing with PGP where there's a theoretical attack.

393
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:24,960
Rym: There are relatively innocuous ways to prevent said theoretical attack But the people who primarily use the theoretical Versions of the attack are the people who are least likely to be targeted by ultra super secret spy organizations.

394
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:30,480
Rym: However, I will point out that I could probably steal your password.

395
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:32,825
Scott: I'm not worried about it.

396
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,917
Scott: Maybe I should try to have a USB keyboard and LCD monitor.

397
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:36,419
Rym: I didn't.

398
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:39,370
Rym: actually I think it could be done on a USB keyboard.

399
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,615
Rym: I'm not sure it doesn't matter.

400
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,244
Rym: I think it's neat stuff though I mean you're.

401
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:46,490
Rym: I also have a UPS That barely works and probably just gonna pass through.

402
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,614
Scott: I bought the newer one.

403
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:47,916
Scott: Remember?

404
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:48,980
Scott: Oh, yeah you did.

405
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,988
Scott: I have the fancy one.

406
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:51,340
Scott: So what are you gonna do?

407
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,647
Rym: Just put a key logger on your USB in line.

408
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,831
Scott: You know what this actually?

409
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:59,302
Scott: I'm pretty sure UPS would just completely right Wouldn't it?

410
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:02,090
Rym: No, because remember UPS is usually passed through and it's the same ground.

411
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:05,140
Rym: Your UPS doesn't have some magic special ground anywhere.

412
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:08,754
Rym: It's not the good UPS like James would tell us about.

413
00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:11,562
Rym: it's the crappy UPS Whatever.

414
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:12,987
Scott: Let's uh, let's just continue.

415
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:15,917
Rym: Plus I mean ground loops have been used to transfer information in the past.

416
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:27,014
Scott: That's why if you plug That's something I'd be more interested in right instead of like snooping on people and using this for evil Use this as some sort of way to surreptitiously communicate that.

417
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:27,857
Scott: I would be cool.

418
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:28,500
Rym: that already works.

419
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,363
Rym: It's trivial to do.

420
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:33,780
Rym: you can buy devices that you plug into all the outlets in your house and have a poor man's 10-based network.

421
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:40,500
Scott: Actually, I was reading that it was the Philippines that they were gonna do internet overpower lines like for like, you know ISP?

422
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,624
Rym: Oh, yeah, Scott.

423
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:43,189
Rym: They've been talking about that for 20 years.

424
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:43,992
Rym: That never happens.

425
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:46,200
Scott: Anyway, it sounds like someone's actually gonna do it.

426
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:48,880
Rym: I will not believe it until it is actually deployed.

427
00:28:49,063 --> 00:29:00,060
Rym: I also agree with you But there's been a story every six months for almost the entirety of the time that I have owned a computer saying Internet over the high voltage power lines is coming tomorrow.

428
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:02,427
Scott: Well, I heard in the Philippines.

429
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:02,969
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

430
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,257
Rym: I heard in the Philippines.

431
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:12,780
Rym: That's right But I think I think everyone should read this article because really this stuff is pretty cool and you can do cool stuff.

432
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,060
Rym: And if you're a hobbyist hacker try try to do this sort of thing.

433
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:24,140
Rym: It's not that hard and from what I gather from this article For under a thousand dollars you can put together something that will be able to replicate this proof of concept.

434
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,264
Scott: Yeah, five thousand dollars.

435
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:27,412
Scott: I just buy nice HDTV or something.

436
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,280
Scott: Maybe another Mac mini that was newer and better.

437
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:35,116
Rym: Yeah, well if you want to just consume as opposed to create interesting and useless hacks Also pay a month of rent.

438
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:38,931
Rym: Good - I think you're getting old.

439
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,422
Rym: You've lost the hacker spirit I'm hacking.

440
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,770
Scott: the software is where you know shits easy.

441
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,476
Rym: Oh have you what would you written recently?

442
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,480
Scott: a lot of work?

443
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:57,877
Rym: Yeah, yeah, we're old But anyway things of the day.

444
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,140
Rym: so buddy have for me Scott.

445
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:06,888
Scott: So this is video here of these kids and they got a pool and they must be rich because it's a fancy pool in a Fancy looking house in a fancy looking neighborhood.

446
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:15,495
Scott: All right, and all they do is they video themselves Dunking, you know doing slam dunks on the pool basketball hoop, right?

447
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,820
Scott: So that's you know.

448
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:20,856
Scott: Okay The thing is a they're real good at it.

449
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:28,640
Scott: and B They come up with some really creative multiple person dunks on this little pool basketball hoop and they pull them off.

450
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,660
Scott: I'm pretty sure they tried a bunch of times and only actually edited the ones that they succeeded into the video.

451
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:45,954
Scott: but they're looking like they're having a lot of fun and This was totally the kind of shit we did when I was a kid all the time and so when I watched it I was like, ah my childhoods they have it.

452
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,100
Rym: Well, there's not fair.

453
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:50,660
Rym: There's definitely something about the the miss and it's just like that game.

454
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:56,780
Rym: I think we made a thing of the day a long time ago Where those people covered the table in soap and would spin the frisbee on the soap.

455
00:30:58,261 --> 00:31:00,780
Rym: There's something about taking an arbitrary activity.

456
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:10,020
Rym: someone does something once and then you have a bunch of friends together and You decide to become the best people in the world at this thing you just made up and that's an entire afternoon.

457
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:17,760
Scott: No, it's you know, but it's like, you know Just sitting around just thinking of shit to do and coming up with something sort of funky like that.

458
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,636
Scott: I mean that was that was I know when I would go to like the town pool and that's.

459
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:22,641
Scott: the other thing is that you Know.

460
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:29,856
Scott: a lot of the stuff I did when I was a kid was pool related, you know I had a pool in the backyard went to the town pool pretty much any summer camp.

461
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,859
Scott: There was always pools.

462
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,693
Scott: go There's a lot of pools all over the place Except without the summer camp or the town pool.

463
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:36,738
Rym: Everyone just had pools.

464
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:40,380
Rym: Yeah No, but there was a lot of whose house we go to and we'd all hang out in their pool.

465
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:48,660
Scott: But yeah for as long as it for my whole life every summer up until when I went to RIT There was a lot of pool action.

466
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:57,324
Scott: So, you know This is like this is really close to home and it's totally epic and I wish I'm gonna get a pool so we can go Back to those days.

467
00:31:57,344 --> 00:32:00,640
Rym: I definitely think it comes out of the same impulse that created the frisbee game.

468
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,940
Rym: It's just the you you take something and just you have nothing to do in the afternoon.

469
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,665
Rym: You turn it into your entire afternoon.

470
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,712
Rym: something dumb like things are totally enjoying it.

471
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:12,163
Rym: do like like you're gonna do something like that And not enjoy it.

472
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:15,012
Scott: Well, no, but like you can tell that they're they're rocking out.

473
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:17,419
Rym: Yeah, those frisbee people were rocking out.

474
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,578
Rym: It's good times.

475
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:22,960
Rym: Flash mobs come and go and they're good ones and bad ones.

476
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,915
Rym: But after the whole Michael Jackson thing, there were a lot of Michael Jackson flash mobs.

477
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,340
Rym: They were mostly pretty mediocre.

478
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:32,399
Scott: Well, at least, you know, none of them really stood out.

479
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,102
Rym: Well, they were mostly pretty mediocre, especially the one that tried to happen in New York But thanks.

480
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:40,140
Scott: I think it might have been the next day, but I never saw a video of it.

481
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,666
Scott: So it's like there was no video.

482
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:42,690
Rym: it clearly fizzled out.

483
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,668
Rym: But here I have learned that in Stockholm That is where people not have put together a goddamn flash.

484
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:52,600
Scott: Well, actually those MC hammer ones are pretty good, but they were commercially orchestrated.

485
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:53,428
Rym: Yes, they were.

486
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:54,499
Rym: that's why I didn't mention them.

487
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,983
Rym: Yeah, but this one does not appear to be commercially orchestrated and appears to be some of the more epic of the flash mobs I've ever seen.

488
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:13,520
Rym: because the the degree to which the tiny one person dancing Grows into hundreds of people without you even realizing it and the fact they melt out of the crowd like it's beautiful.

489
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,423
Scott: They got skills.

490
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:14,845
Scott: Definitely.

491
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:19,880
Rym: They practiced is the thing to behold and anyone who wants to do a flash mob You could learn from these people.

492
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:29,373
Scott: My guess is that they like must have like scheduled and like an attempted one out in a field where no one could see and Practiced it and then brought it somewhere else because that's what I do.

493
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:32,325
Scott: if I was doing a flash mob that had to be so Coordinated or something.

494
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:38,440
Scott: I would a if it was a dance or something along those lines I would send out a video teaching people to dance, right?

495
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,867
Scott: Everyone would watch it on YouTube and learn it on their own.

496
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:55,751
Scott: then I would schedule a flat like a drill, you know I'd be like, okay, we're gonna do one for fake out in this field right at 1 p.m On Saturday and we do it in the field until we got it Right, and then I'd be like, okay, and then I would send out the other.

497
00:33:55,771 --> 00:34:00,409
Scott: the next message would be okay everyone for reals At the train station tomorrow and then there you go.

498
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,056
Scott: That's how to make it awesome.

499
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:02,578
Scott: Like they got.

500
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:14,081
Scott: well Yeah, you know much like an anime cosplay you practice you choreography it Yeah, but I think that I have a hard time believing that this was actually a hundred percent spontaneous Like this is.

501
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:18,579
Scott: they just said all right everyone at the train station and then pulled it off that awesomely without you know.

502
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,463
Rym: Well a flash.

503
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:24,688
Rym: my prior preparation is not necessarily I wouldn't say Necessitate a spontaneous.

504
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,799
Rym: Hey, we're gonna do this here and everyone just shows up.

505
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:31,078
Rym: They can also be extremely well coordinated because the the flash mob is either.

506
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:37,141
Scott: it is full But I just think that if you prepare that much in advance it removes some of the flash Aspect.

507
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:37,603
Rym: but how?

508
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:38,466
Rym: it's a flash?

509
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:44,424
Rym: in that you have a normal crowd of people doing normal things and suddenly a mob Appears out of nowhere.

510
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:45,306
Rym: it flashes.

511
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:46,690
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

512
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:54,737
Scott: But you know, but what it's alright, it's you know, it's not as Flash as the mob was not, you know, it was pretty much just like.

513
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,847
Scott: let's do it Because it was like I most.

514
00:34:58,148 --> 00:35:04,894
Rym: most of what people call a flash mob is usually a well-coordinated You know set up event that then appears somewhere later.

515
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:06,460
Rym: Yeah, that's what almost all of them are.

516
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,460
Scott: So it is I just you know, I think it's a lot more impressive though if the mob is truly a hundred percent.

517
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,136
Rym: So yes, it's a lot more impressive if people do something with less practice and with less preparation.

518
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:16,538
Rym: Yeah.

519
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,808
Rym: Yeah Alright, so what are we talking about tonight?

520
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,478
Rym: We've gone out a long time on this show.

521
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:21,880
Scott: That's good.

522
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,320
Scott: We probably need to because we I don't know how much direction we have for the main bit.

523
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:31,300
Scott: Anyway, so what we decided downstairs and we're gonna talk about like, you know black hat for his white hat.

524
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,203
Rym: I just wanted to talk about full disclosure because I'm pretty sure we've already talked about all the hats a long time ago on GeekNights.

525
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:42,552
Scott: I don't think we ever talked about the hats on GeekNights And I don't think I don't know how much there is to say about full disclosure As an IT professional.

526
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:45,874
Rym: there's a lot to say about it But it'll do if it's just gonna be me talking.

527
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,820
Rym: we can just skip it for now.

528
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,040
Scott: Well, we could start by talking about the full disclosure and then branch off to other hatters if necessary.

529
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:58,296
Rym: Well, the reason I thought about it There is not really wanted to talk about at least just full disclosure was the whole image check thing.

530
00:35:58,316 --> 00:35:59,560
Rym: that happened not too long ago.

531
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:09,172
Rym: we're basically a vigilante group hacked image check and replaced all the images with their kind of poorly put together manifesto and their whole idea.

532
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:22,879
Rym: their whole Thing is that there should not be full disclosure and that full disclosure is just a ploy By the security people to scare people into buying their firewalls and their antivirus and that sort of thing.

533
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,367
Scott: That's what they hacked image check for.

534
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:25,889
Rym: Yes.

535
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,815
Rym: It's basically their manifesto is crap.

536
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:34,360
Rym: I'm not even gonna read it, but They clearly do not work in the IT industry in any real capacity.

537
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:39,440
Rym: But at the same time they pulled off a pretty clever hack and owned image check pretty thoroughly.

538
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:50,346
Rym: yeah, but as a professional I'm kind of 50/50 on full disclosure because really what it comes down to is that full disclosure Will cause lots of problems.

539
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:55,320
Rym: It's basically the equivalent of if you can't fix your government by voting burning down a building to fix it.

540
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,266
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay in fear.

541
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:01,560
Scott: Well, this is a theory versus pragmatism situation, right in theory, right?

542
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,900
Scott: If there's a security hole you it's probably better that people Know right because then they know how to protect themselves from it.

543
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,163
Scott: Right be?

544
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:18,180
Scott: it puts pressure on someone to fix it see the fix will come sooner etcetera, etcetera.

545
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,501
Scott: Right.

546
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,829
Scott: The thing is right.

547
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,594
Scott: Is that in reality?

548
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:24,200
Scott: if you look at the actual numbers?

549
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:30,389
Scott: it's that if a Vulnerability is not published it pretty much never gets exploited.

550
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:48,032
Scott: every all these windows worms and exploits like ninety nine point nine 99.99% of all exploits and Windows and Internet Explorer are Against things that Microsoft has already put out a patch for and Microsoft when the patch comes out They'll tell you what the patch was for.

551
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:54,680
Rym: you look things up But you're forgetting that a lot of these kind of full disclosure situations aren't windows or anything like that.

552
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,038
Rym: They're things that are much more vulnerable and much more important like routers or ATM.

553
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:03,571
Scott: Yes, of course, but it's the same situation with those.

554
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:08,127
Scott: if you don't it's if you don't Disclose the vulnerability.

555
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:10,660
Scott: It's hardly hardly ever gets explored.

556
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:10,821
Scott: Well,

557
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:27,700
Rym: no because the thing is they actually as far as there's a lot of evidence to suggest that these sorts of things Do get exploited quite a bit But they're exploited quietly by people who you do them use them to very great effect And even if the companies find out about it They're probably better off covering it up then, you know letting loose that they have.

558
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,745
Scott: That's it like when.

559
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:37,280
Scott: yeah, it's a different situation like if you're a bank and you get hacked You don't want to let anyone know you got hacked because then you look real bad and everyone takes their money out.

560
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:41,420
Rym: But the reason that these people are stupid in my opinion is one their rationale.

561
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:42,735
Rym: They're no better than the.

562
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:49,849
Rym: you know We invaded Iraq for the oil people who just know nothing about the issue and just kind of make up some Half-baked conspiracy theory.

563
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,957
Rym: that doesn't actually make sense.

564
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,260
Rym: Whoever hacked Image Shack is stupid, but no no doubt about that.

565
00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:55,721
Scott: But

566
00:38:55,962 --> 00:39:15,299
Rym: the issue with full disclosure is I feel like in the end I am for it for the simple fact that Almost any time someone who is a white hat someone who is good and smart and knowledgeable discovers a vulnerability they will inform the company that has the product privately and say look I found this vulnerability you should fix it.

567
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,844
Rym: it's a huge vulnerability.

568
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:20,177
Rym: if someone in the wild finds out about it, they could compromise on your customers.

569
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:29,513
Rym: this sort of thing and The vast majority of companies that receive notices like this either ignore them or Sue the person who contacted them for hack.

570
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:30,500
Scott: that's happened a lot.

571
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:43,313
Rym: So it is in the best interest of a person who discovers something like this to not Contact the company because the company is very likely not going to respond with any sort of goodwill whatsoever And you're only putting yourself in danger by trying to help.

572
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:47,616
Scott: but it depends on the company It depends how you contact but it depends on a lot of things.

573
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:55,095
Rym: the problem here Is that even if you you know you can't be sure and the company because the way the laws are Have a lot of leverage in coming after you.

574
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:58,410
Scott: so Really, well you can look at the history.

575
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,340
Scott: You know especially if it's a tech company.

576
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:08,412
Scott: They probably have a history of people telling them about vulnerabilities And you know their policies and official ways to let them know.

577
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:11,220
Scott: but usually you know Adobe's had a lot of exploits.

578
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:14,836
Scott: You know that people have told them about and you know there's a. there's a way to do it.

579
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:17,073
Scott: that makes Adobe happy There's a way to do it.

580
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:17,780
Scott: that makes them angry.

581
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:25,127
Rym: But even then if you tell them usually they're not going to do anything even if they don't sue you or go after you in Some way well they do do something.

582
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:28,560
Scott: usually they're just not as fast to say open-source people who fix it in ten minutes.

583
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:37,151
Rym: I would say that usually it's been my experience that they don't do anything that most people will just not respond and not respond and That unless you threaten them with full disclosure.

584
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:39,180
Rym: They will never fix the vulnerability.

585
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,233
Scott: I think that I from what I've seen they do fix it.

586
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:42,976
Scott: It is slow.

587
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:46,132
Rym: You know Couple you say slow.

588
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:52,180
Rym: this will be a situation We're like a hack for an ATM is discovered where you can just like rob someone else's account of all its money.

589
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:57,180
Rym: Yeah, and it'll be years with no fix or no indication of a fix or anything.

590
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,689
Scott: Yeah, it takes a long time because the people are so slow.

591
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:07,260
Rym: yes, but that is a serious problem because if you threaten full disclosure Usually these companies fix it almost immediately.

592
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:16,772
Rym: Well, you know that's it's just the way you do business plus the other probably realize if you give if you privately contact a company and say all right here's what I have found.

593
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:17,696
Rym: here's the vulnerability.

594
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:23,400
Rym: please fix it and Someone else finds the vulnerability before they fix it and it gets out in the wild.

595
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:26,230
Rym: That company might just go after you because maybe you'll.

596
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,559
Rym: they'll assume you're the one who released it secretly to the wild.

597
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:33,580
Scott: yeah But you know if you're talking about an ATM company though, that's not really a technologically savvy company.

598
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,410
Scott: I said it depends a lot on the company that's involved.

599
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:43,440
Scott: You know Microsoft Adobe these types of people Apple They're a lot you know savvier and a lot smarter when it comes to this kind of situation.

600
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,125
Scott: They're used to it.

601
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:49,412
Scott: random bank number three You know d-balled government contractor.

602
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:51,480
Scott: a lot less savvy a lot less.

603
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,940
Rym: Those are the people that have more power over me.

604
00:41:56,443 --> 00:42:02,218
Rym: I don't even want to do business with these people But just because of our society I'm forced to and they have a lot of my information.

605
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:10,550
Rym: that is true If there is a vulnerability that they have that they won't fix They're basically making me vulnerable without my consent and I see professional.

606
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,887
Rym: I Feel like in the end full disclosure is justified because it is information.

607
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,790
Rym: It's real information.

608
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,095
Rym: You can't hide information.

609
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:21,529
Rym: You should not be obligated to hide information that you know about.

610
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:24,259
Rym: no Yeah, no, I signed a contract.

611
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,046
Rym: You know independently of that obviously.

612
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,908
Rym: I mean if I sign an NDA I shouldn't be able to say anything.

613
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:37,767
Rym: Yeah, so if you get in the situation where you know I go to an ATM conference I signed an NDA and they basically will show me here's how to hack our ATMs.

614
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:46,750
Rym: check it out I can't really do anything of course, then there's the moral conundrum of maybe I should anonymously, but that's that's great.

615
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:48,383
Scott: Yeah, the hair.

616
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:49,445
Scott: how about this situation?

617
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:51,009
Scott: right exactly what you just said?

618
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,732
Scott: The the ATM is hackable right.

619
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:58,038
Scott: if you reveal the hack full disclosure someone's gonna exploit it.

620
00:42:58,138 --> 00:42:59,400
Scott: bad for the company, right?

621
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,314
Scott: Possibly bad for you.

622
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:05,090
Scott: Also if you disclose it because the company might come after you right, okay?

623
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:08,790
Scott: If you keep your mouth shut well this vulnerability stays there never gets fixed.

624
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:13,290
Scott: Maybe someday someone else discovers it and now you're fucked and the bank is fucked again, right?

625
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,356
Scott: So what you know?

626
00:43:15,658 --> 00:43:18,029
Scott: how is it ethical perhaps to?

627
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:24,326
Scott: Use the exploit to hack into the device and fix the vulnerability yourself is you know how?

628
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:25,750
Scott: how do you feel about that?

629
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:41,858
Rym: Well the problem with that is that the people one White hat hackers who decide to do something like that if they're sophisticated enough to do it well Understand that they're putting themselves a great personal risk for pretty much zero reward Yep, and very few people are willing.

630
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:44,910
Scott: well if the reward is you're making yourself a little bit safer.

631
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:58,710
Scott: You know if you are really worried about the fact that someone else is making you vulnerable You're making yourself well sort of less vulnerable if you get away with Because the problem is because you're doing this without the consent or knowledge of the person who manages the system.

632
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:07,709
Rym: Even if you're a super awesome professional ghost in the shell style There's a good chance you're going to cause further problems And you're going to make things worse than not better.

633
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:12,390
Scott: And it's also true because you're even if you manage to fix the the one hack.

634
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,430
Scott: It's like you don't really know their system inside and out probably especially if it's a closed source system.

635
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:27,010
Scott: And you know your change is not really gonna go through the whole testing procedure And the QA and all that sort of big stuff to make sure that it doesn't affect anything.

636
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,090
Rym: Here's a much more interesting situation.

637
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:41,225
Rym: One of the biggest problems with security in the world is that a lot of people's home Windows computers are secretly parts of gigantic Spam spyware zombie networks yep, and the people who own these computers.

638
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,192
Scott: pretty much the number one security concern There is.

639
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:54,147
Rym: if we got rid of that security be like a joke, but the problem is the people who own these computers are Effectively illiterate when it comes to technology, and they cannot in any way protect themselves.

640
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:55,110
Rym: They refuse to learn.

641
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,873
Rym: There's nothing we can do.

642
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:56,074
Rym: There's.

643
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,503
Rym: no we can't even consider the idea of teaching them.

644
00:44:58,543 --> 00:44:59,205
Rym: It just won't happen.

645
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:01,834
Rym: mm-hmm and What?

646
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:09,250
Rym: if you know a grey hat hacker Made a malicious virus as opposed to a virus that just makes money for some Russian spams.

647
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:14,493
Scott: I actually actually did read recently that there was some sort of Virus out there.

648
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:15,395
Rym: there is it's the.

649
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:23,700
Rym: the Independence Day one is that it's basically counting down to a point where supposedly It will wipe out the hard drive.

650
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,889
Rym: yes someone every device is infected with.

651
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:31,510
Scott: yes Someone took this virus into their you know security lab, and they basically talked to it and told it.

652
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,381
Scott: You know that you know they triggered.

653
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:34,467
Scott: they looked at the code.

654
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:35,352
Scott: obviously It's got.

655
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:38,410
Rym: it's funny because we just watch Independence Day, and this is the Independence Day virus.

656
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,013
Rym: What are you doing?

657
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:40,057
Rym: It's the.

658
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:48,730
Scott: it's a self-repeating cycle that counts down to zero and it explodes Intentionally you know made the virus think that it was you know triggered and then it erased the hard drive of the computer.

659
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,841
Rym: It erased every attached storage device.

660
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:54,230
Rym: yep, but here's the thing that's interesting.

661
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,956
Rym: The speculation is that one.

662
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:05,109
Rym: it is a rival Russian Chinese spyware spam syndicate Wiping out all the hosts that are probably infected with it.

663
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:11,531
Rym: You know the other syndicate stuff so that they can then re-attack these people and put on their own stuff and then block their competitors Out.

664
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,553
Scott: mm-hmm could be.

665
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:22,420
Rym: there's another theory that it's just some sort of you know The probably the first straight-up malicious attack like maybe North Korea or someone is just trying to wipe out Western infrastructure.

666
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:30,217
Rym: Yes, you know I mean It's so interesting that like third suggestion the third theory out there is that it's some misguided white hat hacker thinking.

667
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:36,157
Rym: if I do This I will I will lower the amount of spam in the world by like 40% for about a day.

668
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:43,900
Scott: Yeah, it's not such a white someone who's actually a white hat hacker wouldn't go that route.

669
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:52,440
Rym: Some other route now because remember white hat People who are white hat I'm talking more gray hat like someone who's a script kitty kind of person.

670
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:55,935
Rym: Someone in high school who's super had a much better idea would be.

671
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:59,515
Rym: I'm not saying idea I'm saying there are people there's always the debate.

672
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:00,400
Scott: I don't think that's plot.

673
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,423
Scott: I don't think that's likely.

674
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:11,940
Rym: I think it's plausible and likely it just hasn't happened yet that someone with the ability to write a worm Might make a malicious one solely for the purpose of destroying dangerous species.

675
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:16,253
Scott: I don't think they would destroy dangerous pcs by erasing all attached storage devices.

676
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:22,255
Scott: I think that they would perhaps maybe disable all the network devices, you know somehow.

677
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:23,199
Rym: but why not?

678
00:47:23,279 --> 00:47:26,229
Rym: because I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.

679
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,320
Rym: I really am because it would be pretty trivial to do.

680
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,880
Scott: I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet for just pure maliciousness, right?

681
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:44,397
Scott: I mean, it's just as trivial to turn someone's computer into a you know Spam and spyware who knows what as it is to just you know Completely fuck the person over and make skulls show up on their screen and who knows what else.

682
00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:45,000
Scott: crazy shit.

683
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:46,344
Rym: Here's an idea.

684
00:47:46,465 --> 00:48:08,165
Rym: What if you know, this is not me advocating this but you could make rampant vulnerability exploits that went around the internet and basically just attacked compromised computers and Destroyed them to one punish the people who have poorly put out stuff and to make it almost impossible to maintain a compromised server For any amount of time in the wild.

685
00:48:08,526 --> 00:48:12,780
Rym: because if you're compromised these things these roaming viruses will just destroy you.

686
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,748
Scott: Well, the reason that would not work is because if the computers are destroyed Then which computer is propagating the virus?

687
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:23,240
Scott: if it just got erased you need to keep the computer up to propagate the virus.

688
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:29,880
Rym: No You basically you set them up to propagate with a timer payload and then there are periodic kind of days of reckoning.

689
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,164
Rym: We're say 40 percent.

690
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:31,827
Scott: Well, you're right.

691
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:35,600
Scott: Yeah, your virus will move across in sort of a wave, but then it will dissipate.

692
00:48:36,102 --> 00:48:38,873
Scott: He won't spawn into this big giant mole.

693
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:39,937
Rym: You didn't listen to what I said.

694
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:40,740
Rym: It's pretty straightforward.

695
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,680
Rym: You have pure you have semi random days of reckoning to where the viruses go out.

696
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:49,880
Rym: They propagate but they have kind of semi randomized timers such that they will.

697
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:57,360
Rym: You know 30% of the network will be wiped out on this day and then a year later The morphed virus wipes out another 30%.

698
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,110
Rym: So there's this constant kind of rolling blackout.

699
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:00,290
Rym: it.

700
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:04,383
Rym: the problem with this that it would be a very sophisticated attack To get.

701
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:13,780
Rym: anyone who has the ability to make something so sophisticated would probably shy at the obvious moral implications of you know Possibly shutting down hospital networks and that sort of thing.

702
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:18,580
Scott: Yeah, it also seems like people want credit card numbers more than they want erased hard drives.

703
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,987
Scott: Well the other situation I would do is I would make one where as soon as it got your credit card number Then it would erase your hard drive.

704
00:49:25,248 --> 00:49:26,835
Scott: It's like I got nothing more I need from you.

705
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:26,875
Scott: I

706
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:44,135
Rym: will say this though I have a small hope that regardless of why this virus came to be If the payload does what we think it does and there is this sort of mass wipeout of every compromised computer I think that is going to do more for computer security than anything in the last 10 years.

707
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,580
Scott: has yeah a little bit.

708
00:49:45,841 --> 00:49:48,792
Scott: It would help because at least somebody's the problem would get.

709
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:51,060
Rym: this is just a watchman situation.

710
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:56,793
Scott: Yeah, it would help a little bit though but I think a better way to go about it would you know it's there were.

711
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:05,526
Scott: there are instances in history of Not even that long ago people hacking and then like popping up a message that is like you have you have been hacked blah Blah blah, but we did that.

712
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:05,888
Rym: I remember.

713
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:07,176
Rym: we were visiting Pete and Albany.

714
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:07,740
Rym: we wardrobe.

715
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:13,199
Rym: We found a wireless access point to you know email Pete, and then we saw that you know all the guys.

716
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:14,391
Rym: window Shares was open.

717
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:15,200
Rym: read write admin.

718
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:22,420
Rym: So we put a couple of text files in obvious places that explained how to turn off those shares and secures wireless access point.

719
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:26,245
Scott: Yeah, the thing is right is that You know just what.

720
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:31,620
Scott: let's say I make a fire a website and the website says you know your computer is vulnerable.

721
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:35,760
Scott: Click here to be secure and of course that is an insecure thing.

722
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,342
Scott: So we can't.

723
00:50:36,462 --> 00:50:40,373
Scott: teaching people to trust that message is a very bad way to go.

724
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,720
Scott: They're already don't know what to trust.

725
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,382
Scott: Well, that's

726
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:59,980
Rym: why I feel like this is going to be a big deal if it happens because if we find it's been a long Time since there's been a widespread Actually malicious and damaging virus of any kind if it happens You're gonna have a lot of people whose computers get wiped out who take serious damage.

727
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,905
Rym: They're gonna lose like family photos and music collections and like all this important stuff And they're not gonna be able to get online right away And they're gonna have to.

728
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:10,320
Rym: they're gonna flood the Geek Squad and all these things.

729
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,764
Scott: No, they're not.

730
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:12,600
Scott: they're gonna take their computer back to the Best Buy.

731
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,892
Scott: They're gonna say it stopped working.

732
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:14,660
Scott: Give me a new one.

733
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,660
Scott: They get a new one that go home is gonna fire us again.

734
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:23,081
Rym: But at the same time if enough of them happen at once there's gonna be enough outrage to where a lot of people there's Gonna be.

735
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:27,060
Rym: I think mainstream media talking about how could this happen?

736
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,914
Scott: Yeah, and you know what's gonna happen is all the Norton's and stuff.

737
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:38,379
Rym: We're gonna make a lot of money You know what while Norton's and those things I think are just a bad idea all around for someone who has no who's basically technologically illiterate.

738
00:51:38,902 --> 00:51:41,780
Scott: And then people are not going to use the Norton's properly and it's not gonna help at all.

739
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:42,668
Rym: It'll help a little.

740
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:43,820
Scott: it's not gonna help at all.

741
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:46,652
Scott: People have the Norton's now, and they still get virus.

742
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:48,560
Rym: they don't actually have the Norton's anymore.

743
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:49,362
Scott: Yeah they do.

744
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:56,533
Scott: I have it and they still get virus because they don't update it and they don't use it and they turn it off or Well doesn't work right is it hits?

745
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:57,880
Scott: they click on shit anyway?

746
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,165
Scott: And then the real.

747
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:02,740
Rym: the real problem is that viruses and worms are dandy.

748
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:09,080
Rym: But I'd say 95% of the compromised computers out there are compromised by Trojans alone.

749
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,373
Rym: Yeah, Trojans probably the biggie and the Trojans are the easiest things to not get owned by.

750
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:18,900
Rym: don't double-click on dot exes That come in random emails.

751
00:52:21,044 --> 00:52:29,998
Scott: Well, I mean like look at my cousins right there computer was all messed up right and and I basically I was like wow Those computers way messed up and I found out pretty much the only reason it was messed up.

752
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:31,847
Scott: And so they just never do updates.

753
00:52:31,888 --> 00:52:35,610
Scott: It was like I'm like, you know when it says update it you're supposed to say yes They're like, oh I just ignore that.

754
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:39,252
Scott: and like someone else I talked to like a week later was like all the updates.

755
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:41,442
Scott: Yeah, I just ignore those, you know It's Pete.

756
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:45,234
Scott: the primary problem is that people do not read.

757
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:49,133
Scott: even you know, they do not read Whatever is written on their computer screen.

758
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,025
Scott: They just don't you know They just they.

759
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:55,327
Scott: all they want to do is if there's a window that pops up They want it to go away as quickly as possible.

760
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:57,314
Scott: Okay, cancel, whatever makes it go away.

761
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:58,800
Scott: They don't read anything.

762
00:52:59,362 --> 00:53:03,236
Scott: So if people don't read what's on their screen, nothing can make them secure.

763
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:04,340
Scott: Absolutely nothing.

764
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:04,947
Rym: I mean work.

765
00:53:04,968 --> 00:53:06,503
Rym: when I worked at the hospital It was just.

766
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:18,072
Rym: it was amazing that I could get a call from like a doctor someone who operates on people for a living and he would say something like My email is not working and this is a critical problem.

767
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:22,208
Rym: You have to fix it right now And I'm like, so what error did you get?

768
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:24,640
Rym: He's like there wasn't any error just now working.

769
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:28,051
Rym: So I tell him to try again and I'm like, so what happened?

770
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:30,059
Rym: He's like a thing popped up and I clicked OK.

771
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:31,626
Rym: So I'm like, okay.

772
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:32,311
Rym: What did the thing say?

773
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:32,915
Rym: He's like, what do you mean?

774
00:53:32,935 --> 00:53:33,519
Rym: What did it say?

775
00:53:33,942 --> 00:53:35,772
Rym: I was like do it again and don't click.

776
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:41,091
Rym: Okay, so he's like, alright I'm like, what does it say in the box that you keep clicking on?

777
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:41,653
Rym: and it's like.

778
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:44,366
Rym: it basically said your email account is not set up.

779
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:48,188
Rym: And he's like, what does that mean?

780
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:48,510
Rym: I was like.

781
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,139
Rym: it means your email account is not set up.

782
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,870
Scott: This means exactly what it says.

783
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:53,280
Scott: It's in English, right?

784
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:53,911
Scott: It's not.

785
00:53:54,055 --> 00:54:01,719
Scott: I mean It doesn't say like, you know I mean I can understand if the error is like one of those Like in the olden days of the blue screen in Windows or it be like blah blah blah.

786
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:05,997
Scott: error 0xx53 poo poo, right but poo poo.

787
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:10,240
Scott: nowadays It's like, you know, sorry you have a blah blah blah.

788
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:12,318
Scott: You know make sure you do this.

789
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:13,784
Scott: It's in English.

790
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:23,391
Scott: nowadays on Windows Mac and Linux all the errors that a user will see operating in the GUI 99% of those errors are in English and they will tell you what to do.

791
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:27,998
Scott: And if you don't read them, fuck you You deserve what you get.

792
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:32,020
Scott: All right, I think we're done but I don't even know what to call this episode.

793
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,446
Rym: I don't know either but it's all you.

794
00:54:33,566 --> 00:54:39,150
Rym: I feel like we could do some shows on some related topics about computer security And I think our listeners would love some high-level.

795
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,777
Rym: I think we should talk about.

796
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:45,400
Scott: I think I think yeah I think there's more to talk about in the ethics department than I mean the security department.

797
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:46,106
Rym: All right here.

798
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:49,949
Rym: the next Monday show will be ethical hacking And this one will be something else.

799
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:51,498
Scott: It's gonna overlap a lot with this one.

800
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,870
Rym: No, I want to talk about the technology side of it.

801
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:57,860
Rym: All right ethical hacking means something very specific in IT.

802
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:00,093
Scott: Yeah, well the job of it.

803
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:00,898
