00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,133
Rym: It's Tuesday June 24th 2014.

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,829
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,716
Rym: sportsmanship games.

4
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:23,333
Rym: woman in the ship Gender neutral men ship.

5
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:26,800
Rym: let's do this.

6
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,037
Rym: So there's been a problem between me and Scott for a number of years.

7
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:32,720
Rym: what problem?

8
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,547
Scott: So you make annoying noises.

9
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,080
Rym: when we got here when we got home to do the show Scott was watching the biking anime.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,165
Rym: We're hanging out doing our thing.

11
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:41,414
Rym: Scott's really wondering what I'm about to bring up.

12
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:42,720
Rym: and then what this conversation?

13
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:47,734
Rym: And then I had a snack before the show as I want to know.

14
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,057
Scott: I know you're talking about now.

15
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:57,979
Rym: so Scott what is wrong with eating croutons or as I like to call them advanced crackers, would you?

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,132
Scott: Take ketchup and just like fucking drink it.

17
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,180
Rym: Well, that's a condiment and A crouton is a condiment.

18
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:10,320
Rym: You do not shake croutons out of a dispenser on your table.

19
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:14,580
Scott: Yeah, come in a bag or a container and you shake them onto salads.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,288
Scott: You do not have you ever seen any restaurant in the world.

21
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,916
Scott: just serve croutons to eat straight up.

22
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:20,337
Rym: Yes.

23
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:24,609
Rym: They're in the Buffet all the time the salad bar.

24
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:26,554
Scott: They're meant to put on the south.

25
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:28,880
Rym: Who are you to say what they're meant to be done?

26
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:30,246
Rym: They're there?

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,160
Rym: no next to other things.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,440
Scott: I'm just glad I don't have to come up with any more reasons not to do this because everyone listening already is on my side.

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,681
Scott: So

30
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:47,171
Rym: I ask all of you out there if you believe in anything that is good or holy and you enjoy actual food something to go go to your kitchen go find your finger croutons

31
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:47,833
Scott: and just

32
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:53,932
Rym: eat one like it's a cracker and Realize that there is nothing stopping you from doing that anytime you want.

33
00:01:54,554 --> 00:02:00,184
Scott: Yeah your sense of self-worth Your Pride as a human being.

34
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:13,264
Rym: so speaking of same pride that you would lose if you drank ketchup is the same pride you lose When you eat a crouton, so speaking of pride in being a human being it is the steam summer sale and something Something amazing happened.

35
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,271
Rym: I no longer care about steam sales.

36
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:17,995
Scott: Yeah, I have all these games.

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,719
Scott: It's not video game season right now.

38
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,584
Scott: There's no game.

39
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,970
Rym: I'm playing a lot of video games.

40
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,420
Scott: My problem is I'm playing basically no video games.

41
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,079
Rym: Yeah, you're not playing any board games either.

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:35,820
Scott: There's nothing on the steam sale that I really want or urgently need to play right now, I mean that brothers game.

43
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,587
Scott: Okay, it's some artsy thing.

44
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,880
Rym: It's probably is a good interactive amusement and experience.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,121
Scott: It looks like it looks like an entertaining software for three dollars doesn't look like a game, but that doesn't bother me I'll.

46
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:49,836
Rym: so my trouble is not that I don't be on sale again.

47
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:50,720
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

48
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,480
Rym: My problem is again right now in any fashion that I do not want to buy these games.

49
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:01,780
Rym: My problem is that four times so far this team's summer sale four.

50
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:06,620
Rym: I saw a game and thought wow, I would definitely play that game for that price.

51
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:24,670
Rym: I clicked on it with the intention of purchasing is purchasing it and Instead of taking me to the shopping cart It took me to a screen that said in green you already own name of game that you just clicked on play now And I in every case I would go what really?

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,400
Rym: and I go to my library and sure enough there it is.

53
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,007
Rym: It's even installed.

54
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,800
Scott: I thought FTL the expansion you had to buy.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,893
Scott: Nope, because I bought regular actually kick-started FTL zillion years ago.

56
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:36,996
Scott: I have all the FTL.

57
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:38,180
Scott: I didn't have to buy anything.

58
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,988
Scott: I went to click on the FTL expansion thing.

59
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,013
Scott: It's like you already have FTL.

60
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,580
Scott: I'm like, oh, alrighty then.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,013
Rym: Yeah, so I've been playing a lot of FTL lately.

62
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,660
Scott: I played zero FTL lately.

63
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:49,078
Rym: I've had a lot of flying to do lately.

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,326
Rym: Advanced mode makes that game.

65
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,700
Rym: you could play that game for the next ten years and never get tired of it.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,213
Scott: But I didn't even play more than I.

67
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,925
Rym: you suck at FTL Not that I suck.

68
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,112
Scott: I just have no interest in it's like I'm done.

69
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,400
Rym: you beat it on like beginner mode.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,180
Scott: Yeah, what interest do I have in playing it with a different ship or on a harder mode?

71
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,948
Rym: None, the game is completely different in those modes.

72
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,653
Scott: I have no interest in that.

73
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,920
Rym: I don't understand why the game is engaging.

74
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,394
Scott: I've already beaten it and seen the end.

75
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,339
Scott: What more is there?

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,103
Rym: Yeah, so you.

77
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:22,360
Rym: so if you beat Mega Man 2 on baby mode, then you've beaten it a hundred percent.

78
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,416
Scott: Mega Man 2 doesn't have baby mode.

79
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:24,960
Rym: Yeah, it does.

80
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,804
Rym: You're Japanese only?

81
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:28,867
Scott: Of course.

82
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:35,199
Rym: So if someone played Mega Man 2 on easy mode Then they're not in person.

83
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:39,635
Scott: They say they've lost the same pride that they would lose if they ate a crouton or drank ketchup.

84
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,080
Rym: Oh, I see how it is Exactly.

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,549
Rym: Seriously, Scott's really bad at FTL.

86
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:45,494
Rym: I've watched him play.

87
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,780
Rym: It's not pretty to watch.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,222
Rym: What do you mean?

89
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,252
Scott: you click you wait for your shit to recharge?

90
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:50,940
Rym: Yeah, so how come you can't beat it on normal?

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,706
Rym: I can beat it on normal almost every time I play Because I don't give a shit.

92
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:55,912
Rym: Yeah, sure.

93
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,400
Scott: Let's play some netrunner.

94
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,760
Rym: So actually I should be playing some netrunners soon because I saw that some other friends of ours Conrad was playing some netrunner recently.

95
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,880
Scott: Why is he not coming to play netrunner with us or at least at the NYU Game Center near him?

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,929
Rym: I think he just learned how to play and seemed to really like it But why wasn't he listening to me telling to play like?

97
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,519
Rym: it's something that appeared on the steam summer sale just now?

98
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,587
Rym: that I think is interesting is Murdered soul suspect which is one of.

99
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,513
Scott: I've never heard of this ever really.

100
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,155
Scott: what is?

101
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,479
Rym: it is one of two.

102
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,011
Rym: You're a ghost detective games.

103
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,820
Scott: What's the other ghost detective game?

104
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,208
Rym: I don't remember but I kept confusing them.

105
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,319
Scott: ghost trick, which is really good and is like DS game.

106
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,430
Rym: No, these are both PC games.

107
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,899
Rym: Okay, but this game uh.

108
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:47,424
Rym: So the tagline on the game in all caps is the hardest murder to solve is your own Dun dun.

109
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,615
Rym: dun which I think is objectively true.

110
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:50,499
Scott: Do you know you're a ghost?

111
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:59,869
Rym: You basically are surprised that there is an afterlife after you were murdered and you try to solve your murder But you're a ghost who walks around the real world.

112
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,180
Rym: Yes, you walk around but time is still flowing.

113
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:02,743
Scott: So you're not.

114
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:03,808
Scott: you're still at you.

115
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,960
Scott: basically you're dead and then up there you are looking at your corpse.

116
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,879
Scott: Yep, and time keeps moving on.

117
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:14,818
Rym: You basically go around like trying to figure out what happened figure out who murdered you and why.

118
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:15,700
Rym: and there's this plot.

119
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:22,257
Rym: It has the popular user-defined tags of spooky detective supernatural mystery.

120
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:34,900
Rym: I was doing those, you know I saw the Square Enix panel about this at PAX because I was running that room at the time and I Might have related this anecdote to you earlier.

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,100
Rym: But just to reiterate the first or second question that came out of the audience was oh, that's why you know about this.

122
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:48,927
Rym: Yes One of the greatest questions anyone has ever asked at a panel at a game convention ever and the question was So is this a game?

123
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,100
Rym: Could I like not solve my own murder?

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,186
Rym: Could I fail to figure out who murdered me?

125
00:06:54,989 --> 00:07:04,119
Rym: and the people on the panel didn't answer for a little while and then they're slow Halting answer basically was summarized - no you cannot fail to solve your murder.

126
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,566
Rym: This is not a game.

127
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,891
Scott: It's an entertainment software.

128
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,256
Rym: Yes, or at best.

129
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,300
Rym: It might be an ideal game.

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,230
Rym: It might be a series of interesting decisions.

131
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,640
Rym: Anyway that all lead to the same Game, it's basically monkey island.

132
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:27,893
Rym: So it's interesting that this game already release date June 3rd 2014 so less than a month ago is 33% off.

133
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,480
Scott: That's you know, I mean, that's not a big sale.

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,111
Scott: It's still what 33 bucks.

135
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:37,380
Scott: Yeah But this is one of those triple-a square Enix games the South Park game which I actually kind of want to play.

136
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,900
Scott: I really want to play that discounted but it's still 40 bucks.

137
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:45,117
Rym: So yeah, the thing is the reason I want to play the and it's also Ubisoft.

138
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:45,880
Scott: fuck you Ubisoft.

139
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:50,040
Rym: The only reason I want to play the South Park games because it's basically an episode of South Park.

140
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,160
Scott: That's exactly the only reason I want to play it as well.

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,100
Scott: It's been a South Park drought usually the South Park in the fall and then South Park in the spring.

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,719
Scott: There was no spring South Park, you know how seasons work for there is no spring South Park this year.

143
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,177
Rym: Well, you know how I knew the last season the South Park.

144
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,213
Scott: my guys It only takes you 24 hours to make a goddamn episode.

145
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,640
Scott: Yeah, I saw crying some out.

146
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,552
Rym: Why do I not get seven episodes a week?

147
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,739
Rym: I mean you guys could clearly do it.

148
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,460
Rym: Seriously, you know what if they did you brag about it?

149
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:17,180
Rym: I imagine six episodes would come out and then nothing.

150
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:22,139
Rym: Eventually, the police would be called they'd go to the studio and everyone would be actual crab people would emerge.

151
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:28,142
Rym: Ooh The Metacritic score in this game is 62.

152
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,358
Rym: As far as I'm concerned, I mean, I guess anything under a hundred means the game is garbage.

153
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,304
Scott: I don't know I don't care about scores.

154
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:33,785
Rym: Do I?

155
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,852
Rym: but I just find out what that means.

156
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:52,310
Rym: the point of all that is that In ex I'm somehow no longer excited about the steam summer sales because I already bought all the games I wanted to buy in the last steam sale and I appear to already own almost every game.

157
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,972
Rym: That's under $8.

158
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,600
Scott: I have a desire to go biking.

159
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,020
Scott: I don't have a desire to play a video game.

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,542
Scott: So if you try to sell me video games That's like trying to sell food to a guy who just finished dinner and dessert and second dessert Yep.

161
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:08,594
Rym: Now maybe because even if it's free foie gras, it's like.

162
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,620
Scott: well, I would really love free foie gras.

163
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,020
Scott: That's really amazing quality two milkshakes and a really great price.

164
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,920
Scott: But there is literally no way I could eat anything not even if it's a way far thing.

165
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,027
Rym: But I never forget.

166
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:27,950
Rym: I tried to buy games that I already own Four times so far.

167
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:28,553
Scott: Yep.

168
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:32,835
Rym: I mean and here's the worst thing It's not like I like bought the games and never installed them.

169
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:38,097
Rym: two of them Not only had I installed but I had logged at least an hour or two in them.

170
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,846
Scott: Okay, so Skyrim They were selling the complete Skyrim right?

171
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,933
Scott: Somehow I got the incomplete Skyrim.

172
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,057
Scott: I think someone bought it for me.

173
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:50,939
Scott: Thank you I played it a whole bunch and it was pretty good, you know, just same as the oblivion which I enjoyed and beat.

174
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,110
Scott: and You know, I played it.

175
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,797
Scott: I got really far.

176
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,268
Scott: I found a lot of towns and did a lot of stuff and did a bunch of quests and was going on my way to Fus Ro Don shit and whatever right.

177
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,638
Rym: and then I tell me did you have Fus at least?

178
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,281
Scott: Yeah I had.

179
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,569
Scott: I think I had more than that.

180
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,294
Scott: Did you have Ro?

181
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,842
Scott: I might add the whole thing I don't remember.

182
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,328
Rym: So you got down as well.

183
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:10,830
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,095
Rym: Did you find Sailor Jupiter?

185
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,200
Scott: I killed a bunch of dragons.

186
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:19,008
Rym: Dragons are really Sadly easy to kill in that game.

187
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,539
Scott: Yeah, well not early on but yeah once you.

188
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,493
Rym: yeah But like it's really disappointing when it's like, oh, there's a dragon I'll just run backwards shooting my arrows at it and then it'll.

189
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,260
Scott: I never use arrows like a sissy.

190
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,179
Rym: Oh, all right, then it'll inexplicably keep landing near me and let me hit it.

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,199
Rym: Yeah, why doesn't the Reagan just constantly hover over me firing flame until I die?

192
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,511
Rym: Why does it ever land?

193
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,860
Scott: It is not wise anyway.

194
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:47,300
Scott: So, you know, I had a bunch of good times for a few days and then I just stopped and I never loaded it again.

195
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:48,178
Scott: It's still installed.

196
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:56,799
Scott: so why would I pay to add all the DLC shit to it that I haven't even Thought I had any desire to turn on the regular one.

197
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:04,993
Rym: The lesson I have learned is much more horrifying because when I bought fallout 3 I got Jip because I should have just waited for the ultimate edition.

198
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,660
Scott: I didn't know there was gonna be ultimate shit.

199
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,733
Rym: Yes, now I've learned every game like that will have an ultimate shit.

200
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,420
Rym: That'll be way better than the original game.

201
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,620
Scott: I mean, I mean, I wouldn't buy Skyrim until it was the ultimate shit.

202
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,836
Scott: I mean if I didn't have it at all, I probably would have bought it.

203
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:17,239
Scott: right now.

204
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,199
Rym: Fallout New Vegas is under seven dollars right now.

205
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:25,397
Scott: Yeah, I have the ultimate of that and I played it for like five minutes not fallout 3 level of quality.

206
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,647
Rym: Yeah It did the part.

207
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,355
Rym: if you cared about the fighting tactical kind of stuff.

208
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,037
Rym: It did that better.

209
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:47,756
Rym: but Most of what I actually expect to like about Fallout games is either the emergent behavior that doesn't really happen anymore or Just walking around the crazy post-apocalyptic Landscape which needs to have a bunch of stuff not just a bunch of empty buildings.

210
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:48,460
Rym: I can't walk into.

211
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,348
Scott: Yeah, well follow new vegas is a desert.

212
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,940
Scott: I know I didn't even get to vegas cuz it was so blue.

213
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:54,406
Rym: I didn't even get to vegas.

214
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,936
Rym: No, you didn't even beat the mothership on FTL.

215
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,199
Rym: I Did in baby mode?

216
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:02,938
Scott: That's I don't care what mode it is, yeah, really I don't care at all.

217
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,999
Rym: Well, then I've beaten Megaman 2 a bunch of times.

218
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,980
Scott: Are you telling me you can't beat Megaman 2 on non baby mode?

219
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,923
Scott: Is that what you're telling me?

220
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,309
Rym: You can't beat FTL on non baby.

221
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,057
Scott: telling me eat croutons and drink ketchup.

222
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:22,857
Rym: I Grutons, I tell you what you want ever race If you beat FTL on normal mode before I beat Megaman 2 on normal mode.

223
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:27,599
Rym: I'll eat a hat Tiny chocolate my hat.

224
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,353
Rym: So in other gaming news, I don't know if you have a gaming news.

225
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,036
Scott: I do.

226
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:39,635
Rym: okay The sports ball player bid another sports ball player and that's a controversy.

227
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,704
Scott: Well, yeah, let's talk about this gaming news Just quickly, right?

228
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,780
Scott: So there's a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD fan project.

229
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,931
Scott: So some fans want to remake Sonic 2 the best Sonic you mean.

230
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,540
Rym: some fans want to get sued in HD, right?

231
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:52,227
Scott: So that's the news, right?

232
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,678
Scott: So I would play this actually cuz I really like Sonic 2 more.

233
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,972
Scott: It's the best of all the Sonic's the only good one.

234
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:57,757
Rym: I'm not gonna be.

235
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,597
Scott: yeah Some of the other ones are not bad, but yeah, but it's vastly superior to you.

236
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:02,382
Rym: play Sonic 2.

237
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,900
Rym: Most of them are not worth playing sure.

238
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,696
Scott: So a direct HD remake where it's the exact same game only looks a lot better.

239
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:08,600
Scott: That would be really good.

240
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,147
Scott: It would be like bionic commander rearmed.

241
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,740
Rym: I'll be all about except that was not a direct remake.

242
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,423
Rym: That was a direct.

243
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,171
Rym: that was like a spiritual remake.

244
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:19,740
Rym: that actually changed a bunch of things for the better Right, but anyway, like a DuckTales game that had all the bullshit.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:30,120
Scott: This would be a good thing if fans made it but I've noticed in my long gaming life If you look around when fans try to do things like translation projects or hacks and mods.

246
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:34,475
Scott: Gaming companies don't seem to care that mother Translations are still out there, right?

247
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,733
Scott: You know Final Fantasy translations are out there game companies.

248
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:38,940
Scott: Don't try to stop you if you do that.

249
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:45,020
Rym: I got a C&D about a Final Fantasy 5 ROM translation I had hanging around back in the geocities days.

250
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:49,334
Scott: But when you try to do this, remember the people trying to make Chrono Trigger 3d.

251
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:55,559
Scott: Yeah, you get shut the fuck down But these people abandon this project, but now they are picking it back up.

252
00:13:56,283 --> 00:14:05,040
Scott: start the clock to see how quickly it gets shut down, but Sega you you know, you're looking to not suck and make a Sonic game that people actually want to play.

253
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:09,940
Scott: Why don't you just do this for the fans instead of having fans do it themselves?

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,467
Rym: But you have to do it right.

255
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,920
Rym: that DuckTales game looked like it was gonna be the greatest.

256
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:22,700
Rym: It was gonna be bionic commander rearmed with ducks But instead it was just like like they were faithful to the wrong parts of the DuckTales game.

257
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:26,840
Rym: Yeah, kind of like how modern MOBAs are faithful to the wrong parts of Dota.

258
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,140
Scott: That's why I actually you're right.

259
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:36,319
Scott: It's it's weird because in that bionic commander rearmed you had people who a were clearly huge fans of bionic commando But B also had game development skills.

260
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:45,880
Scott: Yeah, but see remember we you know We do a lot of pan need to get both things together good gaming knowledge and skills Plus also being a fan but not being a fan boy.

261
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,595
Rym: I was looking at our you know, our list of panels and it's a rare.

262
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,980
Scott: It's a rare conflagration.

263
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,269
Rym: I was trying to figure out like what panel I want to do.

264
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,112
Rym: it packs us.

265
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,260
Rym: if you don't go like which one would I?

266
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,573
Rym: Be happy to do on my own.

267
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,090
Rym: Mm-hmm And I think I'll do.

268
00:14:59,151 --> 00:14:59,960
Rym: losing should be fun.

269
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,874
Rym: But I remembered that we did that other panel years ago that we didn't get video of because we were in a hurry to get The Omega thon called egregiously unrealized potential.

270
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:14,029
Rym: and in that panel We talked at length about bionic commander rearmed.

271
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,132
Rym: and how remember?

272
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,440
Rym: that game was not the main game.

273
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,300
Rym: That was just a promotional game to promote the real bionic commandos.

274
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:29,854
Rym: No one gave a fuck about that sold so poorly that bionic commando Rearmed got a sequel and the new bionic commando is dead.

275
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:30,477
Rym: Mm-hmm.

276
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,770
Rym: So that's a topic.

277
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:40,180
Rym: being faithful to the right parts Yeah, anyway, if anyone has video of that egregiously unrealized potential panel, we did it a packs many years ago.

278
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:41,264
Rym: Let me know.

279
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:45,560
Rym: I would like to put some form of that on YouTube if I could anyway.

280
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,544
Scott: So let's talk about the biting.

281
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,891
Rym: So it's to me.

282
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,620
Rym: It's not news that a soccer player bit another soccer player.

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,606
Rym: That's just like ridiculous.

284
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:54,431
Scott: See the thing there.

285
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:55,960
Scott: It surprised me a little bit.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,352
Scott: I mean things like this have happened before head butts and bites, right?

287
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:01,640
Scott: Yep, but you know, they're not too common.

288
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:06,774
Scott: It's that someone was like ow and pretending to be it, but they weren't pretending.

289
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,459
Scott: they actually got injured by someone.

290
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:12,200
Scott: Yeah That's a more shocking part of it.

291
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,432
Rym: You see that HD zoomed in photo and there's a fucking bite mark there.

292
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,560
Scott: Also some guy bet a bunch of money.

293
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:25,398
Scott: There was a people were betting 175 to one odds that this guy would bite someone in the World Cup because he had bitten people twice before.

294
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:30,314
Rym: that's what Amazes me this people made that bet and one I would have bet.

295
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,743
Rym: I would have bet money on that if I knew I could Bet on that.

296
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,450
Scott: Yeah, well you can in every other country.

297
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,857
Rym: It's I mean Mike Tyson bit a guy.

298
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:38,970
Rym: once This guy bit two people.

299
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,918
Scott: we don't know who he bit outside the boxing ring.

300
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:52,480
Rym: well This guy in the context of soccer Bit multiple people was punished for it and yet was allowed to continue playing.

301
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,898
Rym: I imagine if a hockey player bit another hockey player, they would never play in the NHL again.

302
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:58,733
Scott: Maybe there's a long time.

303
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:03,559
Rym: You take your gloves off you punch each other then you both go sit in the box.

304
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,519
Rym: If was someone bit I think there'd just be a lawsuit like criminal charges outside of the game.

305
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,560
Rym: So soccer's weird and messed up and I just find this hilarious.

306
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:27,767
Rym: but anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day the most interesting thing you've seen in the last day I do but I forgot what it was.

307
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:28,450
Scott: Really?

308
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,654
Rym: Yes, really old man.

309
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,557
Scott: Do your thing of the day.

310
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:31,260
Rym: Old man Scott.

311
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,768
Rym: Yes, old man Scott forgot.

312
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,095
Scott: I didn't keep the link open.

313
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:34,959
Scott: I remembered what it was.

314
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,860
Scott: So, you know our friends over at super art fight.

315
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:40,449
Rym: There are some of the best people.

316
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,520
Rym: super art fight is one of the best.

317
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,173
Scott: Maybe you should come see them at Kinetic Con right in the final round.

318
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:57,826
Rym: There's gonna be a mystery Art fighter and I don't know who it is And I really want to know if it were if I didn't know but the ideal art fighter if I could think of anyone in The world to get in there.

319
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,011
Rym: There's only two people.

320
00:17:59,031 --> 00:17:59,413
Rym: Hmm.

321
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:06,162
Rym: I would either want to get Banksy Oh my god, or I would want to get Mike Krahulik.

322
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:10,535
Rym: I would also like to see Katie Cook could probably do a pretty good job.

323
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:10,977
Scott: I don't know.

324
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:11,920
Scott: She's really fast.

325
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,587
Rym: I think she can be.

326
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,351
Scott: she has art skills.

327
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,419
Rym: She could definitely do it because based on her style I think she could pull it off.

328
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:20,952
Rym: Like I think she could draw quick enough in the art fight style to make it happen.

329
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:21,534
Rym: Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,360
Rym: There's the undefeated Yuka Ota.

331
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,068
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

332
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:25,934
Scott: Is she going to Kinetic Con?

333
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,143
Scott: She didn't go last year I don't know.

334
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,400
Rym: don't think she's on any of the panels I put together.

335
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,979
Scott: Well Sergio Aragones would also is also one of my number one people to be in the art fight.

336
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:40,630
Scott: Yeah, I don't know Banksy There are plenty of people who'd be amazing in art fight.

337
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,360
Rym: actually Banksy would be a good guest of Kinetic Con.

338
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:44,684
Scott: Yeah, good.

339
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,427
Scott: Good luck with that.

340
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:46,170
Rym: You never know.

341
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,316
Rym: That's the kind of weird thing.

342
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,119
Rym: I'll go for it.

343
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,090
Scott: Anyway, so super art fight is doing much more internetting.

344
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,395
Scott: They got a podcast going on.

345
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,459
Scott: They got all kinds of stuff, right?

346
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,592
Scott: So then they have another thing on YouTube.

347
00:18:55,673 --> 00:19:07,809
Scott: on their YouTube channel Super art stream and in super art stream number 10 Appears another artist who would be excellent at super art fighting Casey Green.

348
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,463
Rym: Oh There are shoe set sir.

349
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,473
Scott: So you should watch super art stream number 10.

350
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:15,877
Scott: It only has 64 views.

351
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:16,318
Scott: Seriously.

352
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:16,859
Scott: What the fuck?

353
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,658
Scott: That should be like, you know, it should say 301 plus right now because they can't count the views.

354
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:29,134
Rym: Yeah guys my video of like Twilight Sparkle getting Kanye'd has more views than I mean.

355
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:39,612
Scott: in the thumbnail for the stream Which I guess they did via Google Hangout There is a drawing he has done of a cross between the Goodyear blimp and a narwhal in our year.

356
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:44,632
Scott: Nor your blimp and that's just the thumbnail.

357
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,740
Scott: there's an hour and 14 minutes of this.

358
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:50,845
Rym: In the meta moment.

359
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,460
Rym: the book club book is I guess you do my thing of the day.

360
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,560
Scott: Do you have a thing of the day or are you an old man?

361
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,928
Rym: Remember Arnold farts and egg ate?

362
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,192
Scott: too many crotons.

363
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,680
Scott: crotons can only remember tons.

364
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:06,288
Scott: You can only remember the 80s Things of the day.

365
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,147
Scott: Thing of the two decades ago.

366
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,160
Rym: three days ago is not a super cut in the traditional sense.

367
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,148
Rym: This is one of those things.

368
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:22,809
Rym: basically they took extended clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, which are great already and They've added farts but not in the way most people do.

369
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,580
Scott: most people just add farts when someone's making a funny face.

370
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,066
Scott: It looks like they would be farting but they're not actually farting.

371
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:38,628
Rym: these are added to moments where there is the Combination of the face and the movement and the reaction of other people to something else That make them perfect.

372
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:48,736
Rym: and the first one is Conan and he's sitting there and then he farts and then the other guy kind of looks him like up and then he says something to the effect of Have you ever felt wind like this?

373
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,438
Rym: Like it's that level of craft.

374
00:20:54,081 --> 00:21:07,840
Rym: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz the precursor to all the other post-apocalyptic fiction Sci-fi pretty much ever where everyone's trapped with the remaining human society is sealed in in some way.

375
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,744
Rym: I read the whole thing.

376
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,910
Rym: It's worth reading.

377
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,895
Scott: I read like a few chapters.

378
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:11,699
Scott: I'm gonna finish it sooner.

379
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:23,077
Rym: However, the only thing I will say is that it reads the way your typical like Sophomore junior year like the book you have to read for a class and do analysis of it.

380
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:29,916
Rym: It's quite rambling and Having read more than Scott though Scott agrees with me from the beginning.

381
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:37,768
Rym: I think You got to know a decent amount about both Jews and Catholicism or this book makes no fucking sense.

382
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:46,399
Rym: Like this is some inside baseball on Judaism and Catholicism And it only gets more inside baseball as time goes on.

383
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:55,733
Rym: you've also got to know a little bit about actual nuclear doctrine like nuclear war as It was portrayed in the 50s and 60s like the term counter value.

384
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,480
Rym: You need to understand what that actually means.

385
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,787
Scott: All right, any other meta things?

386
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:04,560
Scott: you should go and find us all over the internet and all the places that we exist.

387
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:05,810
Rym: Yes, we have uploaded.

388
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:13,200
Rym: to highlight some of them We have uploaded two significant videos recently our lecture from PAX East this last this most recent year.

389
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:19,780
Rym: Why no one will game with you a panel that to be perfectly honest might be a little too real to real.

390
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:27,042
Rym: You might feel a little uncomfortable watching that one - we have another episode of GeekNights presents shoujo kakame You Tena.

391
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:32,080
Scott: we are analyzing every fucking episode almost done with the first third of the show.

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,356
Scott: Yes, almost first arc get two arcs left.

393
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:36,844
Rym: It's up It's a big.

394
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,620
Rym: this episode is significantly longer than the actual long.

395
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,069
Scott: Take us a year two years.

396
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,297
Rym: Okay, so you bought a year to do.

397
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,282
Scott: Will be done in 2016 2017.

398
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:55,300
Rym: give or take Mm-hmm, and we are going to also Scott's uploaded videos of the most recent netrunner tournament in Boston the Cambridge regionals big time.

399
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,109
Scott: Yeah, I'm running know what the fuck but New York won.

400
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,493
Scott: take that everywhere else.

401
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,518
Rym: your Jersey made it past the finish line.

402
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:03,180
Scott: exactly.

403
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,008
Scott: Our Jersey made it over the line.

404
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:13,270
Scott: Yeah, in fact of the final 16 cut Like 25% were people wearing our Jersey damn straight.

405
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:20,123
Rym: So and July 10th 11th 12th 13th That's right four days motherfuckers Connecticut.

406
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,627
Scott: Oh who should have said something about that?

407
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:21,887
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:28,346
Rym: Yeah, Connecticut is a one of the better conventions out there But it's an everything convention.

409
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,695
Rym: We run the panels and workshops department.

410
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,160
Rym: We've been doing this for many years.

411
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:37,355
Rym: This con is off the fucking hook and you should be there and also we are doing a bunch of panels at it.

412
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:37,997
Scott: Mm-hmm.

413
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:52,120
Rym: So according to Merriam-webster sportsmanship quotes fair play Respect for opponents and polite behavior by someone who's competing in a sport or other competition.

414
00:23:52,682 --> 00:24:02,140
Rym: Mm-hmm conduct as in fairness respect for one's opponent and graciousness in winning or losing becoming to one participating in a sports.

415
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:07,780
Rym: He's a great player who's also admired for his sportsmanship.

416
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:13,454
Rym: Rhymes with sportsmanship Airmen ship a thwart ship.

417
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:14,639
Scott: What the fuck is that?

418
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:27,140
Rym: Then that's the only positive thing that's come out of you reading that dictionary entry Being across the ship from side to side So a thwart ship with and longitudinal frame wide.

419
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:41,131
Rym: So being across ships, I guess if I'm on the side of the ship the port side And I'm starboard then we are a thwart ship a thwart ship Thwart ship when I'm in the passenger seat here in the driver's seat.

420
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,575
Scott: We were a thwart car.

421
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:45,637
Rym: I Guess that's your word of the day.

422
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:55,520
Rym: so yeah, we're thinking about sportsmanship because Frankly the guy biting the guy the guy biting the guy and then Scott's been attending tournaments of things recently.

423
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,286
Scott: I have one that runner tournaments mostly.

424
00:24:57,326 --> 00:25:09,228
Rym: but yes sportsmanship comes up very often at net runner tournaments and it's entirely distinct from separate issues like cheating Because the different we've done shows on cheating we have.

425
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:16,186
Rym: the difference between sportsmanship and cheating is that sportsmanship is the unwritten Unspoken rules of the game.

426
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,493
Scott: Well, it's not necessarily rules of the game.

427
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,857
Scott: It's just rules.

428
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,748
Scott: It's just like Conducting yourself within it.

429
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:24,615
Scott: So it's like rules of society, right?

430
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,800
Scott: There's nothing to do with the game.

431
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:40,092
Scott: it's just when you are playing a game there are certain rules of society and Conduct that change and only apply while you are playing in a seriously competitive game or not seriously competitive game.

432
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:48,840
Rym: for example in my day-to-day life if Scott crosses me in some way I can say fuck you you motherfucker and flip him off and that's totally acceptable.

433
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:59,180
Rym: But if I did that at like a settlers tournament at PAX I would probably at least be frowned at if not booted from the tournament by the people running it.

434
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:06,040
Scott: Yeah, it's like if there's a bunch of pieces of wood sitting on a table and I scoop them all into a box nicely.

435
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,460
Scott: That's perfectly acceptable behavior.

436
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:15,150
Scott: But if in the were in the middle of a game and those are the pieces of the game and the game is not ended Yeah, that's cheating.

437
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:16,079
Rym: Actually, that's not.

438
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,505
Scott: Well, it's maybe.

439
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,949
Rym: you made a whole bunch of illegal.

440
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,637
Rym: You made like eight thousand illegal moves.

441
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:35,700
Scott: I'm just saying There Is certain conduct right, you know For everyday life there are rules of conduct that are not necessarily laws or written rules or things that you must do.

442
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:41,899
Scott: there are just you know societal things where if you do them people will really hate you and you'll be a jerk and an asshole.

443
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,880
Scott: and During a game any kind of game more rules apply than usual or different rules apply compared to usual.

444
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,189
Rym: There's another fine point there that sportsmanship stuff is very.

445
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:56,940
Rym: there's usually no defined objective line.

446
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,200
Rym: There's almost no way to objectively say this is the line between just being a dick and unsportsmanlike.

447
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:12,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean look it's like you can't write a rule like no trash talk because a lot of trash talk is perfectly Okay, and it's very sportsmanlike.

448
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,410
Scott: In fact, it would be unsportsmanlike to not trash talk at all in some cases.

449
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,786
Scott: But though at the same time trash talk goes over the line when does it go over the line?

450
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:20,990
Scott: that's completely subjective.

451
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:24,495
Rym: Well, of course though then again There's the gray area between these two.

452
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:35,374
Rym: where on the sportsmanlike conduct is an offense of which one can be Punished in some fashion or for which one can be punished in some fashion in some sports They're all in American football.

453
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:44,766
Rym: if I spike the ball in an inappropriate manner and there's definitions of what isn't is not an inappropriate spike or Celebration I could get in trouble.

454
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:45,249
Scott: three humps.

455
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:49,378
Rym: Yeah Like there's some like you're there are.

456
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,044
Rym: what are the exact rules about celebration?

457
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,255
Rym: like you can celebrate in some okay So you can't.

458
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:57,297
Scott: you cannot have a loud right not have a group Celebration right.

459
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,589
Scott: you need to celebrate on your own.

460
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:05,252
Scott: You cannot use a prop in the celebration and the ball counts a prop you cannot like taunt the other team Right.

461
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:09,610
Scott: So like you can't like point at the guy like if you like push the guy over and ran in for a touchdown.

462
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:12,885
Scott: But while you're celebrating you can't point and laugh at that guy.

463
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:15,718
Scott: Yeah, right Those are just some of the rules.

464
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:25,656
Scott: pretty much you celebrate on your own, you know You can do generic things like saying yeah, the Lambo leap is grandfathered in you know That's pretty much it.

465
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:28,069
Scott: I mean, I'm sure there's more details than that.

466
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,240
Rym: But but is that that's almost like?

467
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:37,950
Rym: like I said, this is this gray area where that's where a game has rules Describing what is and is not sportsmanlike.

468
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:43,990
Rym: I don't think that actually counts as sportsmanship because it once the game has rules about it That's just the rules of the game.

469
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:54,270
Scott: well in the netrunner tournament rules, right and I'm think the same goes for pretty much every You know game that has official tournament rules that you're gonna play in a game store, you know magic settlers, etc.

470
00:28:54,951 --> 00:29:00,890
Scott: There's a rule that says the judge can you know punish you for unsportsmanlike behaviors, right?

471
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,720
Scott: And it's that's really all it says.

472
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:11,543
Scott: it's like one sentence and it's like yeah Someone's being unsportsmanlike the judge can kick them out or do whatever they got to do Which can be problematic if people have different definitions of acceptable behavior.

473
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,490
Rym: Yep, and it's increasing.

474
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:17,570
Rym: It's especially problematic at lower levels of professionalism.

475
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:21,008
Scott: So yeah, what usually ends up happening is everyone has to be on their.

476
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:21,732
Scott: you know Your best.

477
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:22,033
Scott: you have to.

478
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:26,070
Scott: you have to lean towards your better behavior because you don't know this judge.

479
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:35,366
Scott: If you're just going to some random store in Cambridge, yeah, where the judges are actually great by the way of course it's interesting because We shouldn't necessarily like it.

480
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:39,770
Rym: Ideally you shouldn't need to explain to people like yo dog.

481
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:44,330
Rym: You shouldn't whip your dick out every time you score a point and netrunner.

482
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:47,890
Rym: That would be a great celebration.

483
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:48,529
Scott: Okay.

484
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,190
Scott: So here is an example of something that actually actually happened recently, right?

485
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,730
Scott: So and the team covenant is like a big-time store out in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

486
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:02,549
Scott: Right and they do a lot of netrunner there as well as Game of Thrones and other fantasy flight games and they're.

487
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:05,442
Scott: they have Big internet presence, you know in terms of like.

488
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,755
Scott: they stream all their stuff on Twitch And all kinds of right.

489
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:10,262
Scott: they make lots of videos on YouTube.

490
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:11,347
Scott: They're really popular.

491
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:22,726
Scott: So their netrunner regional tournament at their store was streaming live and I'm watching it and It gets to the elimination rounds and this dude comes and he has a lot of play mats.

492
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,314
Scott: cuz he played in a lot of Tournaments.

493
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:28,089
Scott: if I would have kept all the play mats from the tournaments I went to I'd have like five or six, right?

494
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,259
Scott: But I only have one because I got rid of all the other ones.

495
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,149
Scott: cuz what I want all these fucking play mats for?

496
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,050
Scott: They're all so ugly, but he had a lot of play mats.

497
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:38,210
Scott: So he sits down and he puts down the first play mat.

498
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:43,550
Scott: He puts on another play mat directly on top of it and then another one and then another one.

499
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,175
Scott: Yeah, he puts every play mat.

500
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,222
Scott: He owns into like an inch thick stack.

501
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:48,065
Scott: That's cool.

502
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,470
Scott: And then he starts playing, right?

503
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,716
Scott: So everyone in the stream is like death to Matt, man Fuck you, right?

504
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,924
Scott: Cuz you it's kind of being an asshole move.

505
00:30:56,985 --> 00:31:00,625
Scott: now unbeknownst to us That was like an inside joke for those people like.

506
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:01,309
Scott: they knew the deal.

507
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:05,001
Scott: But to us, you know spectators not knowing them.

508
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,110
Scott: that looked like unsportsmanlike conduct to us.

509
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:12,235
Scott: But he said as soon as he sat down before he did it We heard him say it on the stream.

510
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:17,416
Scott: I asked the judges and they said this isn't unsportsmanlike conduct It's just being a douchebag.

511
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:21,527
Scott: So I'm gonna do it and he starts landing up the play mats right.

512
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,823
Scott: So there that's the kind of example of something that actually happened in real life.

513
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,010
Rym: So there's you've never judge yourself.

514
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:31,645
Rym: I think that's perfectly acceptable.

515
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:32,610
Scott: I agree with the judge.

516
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,470
Scott: That is not unsportsmanlike conduct, but it is douchebag move.

517
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,297
Scott: I would not do that move and I would and I would look down upon the person who did that move and That guy lost.

518
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,710
Scott: he got what he deserved.

519
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:53,610
Rym: so in some high school sports, especially in the more acted like the not like The academic sports like the quiz bowls and the signs Olympiads all the game that you play now.

520
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:57,967
Rym: I saw this in some of the non basically non football sports as well.

521
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:03,410
Rym: Mm-hmm It was you could basically get in trouble if you beat the other team too badly.

522
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:07,489
Scott: High school level that I see that discussion a lot on.

523
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:17,757
Scott: Like sport like, you know real sports like TV and shit like sports commentators Like if some high school team beats another high school team in basketball like a hundred to two They'll be like what happened here.

524
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,143
Scott: This is wrong, right.

525
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:28,521
Scott: or even in pro sports It's like, you know, if a football team is like winning by 20 and they just keep trying to score touchdowns They'll be like, oh they're running up the score as bullshit.

526
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,064
Scott: Don't do that.

527
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:40,810
Scott: Yep, and You know, I mean for the high school situation or the kids situation I think the problem was a who even scheduled this game between really good team and really out.

528
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:48,315
Rym: Well, usually it's just because one town just one year is a bunch of really Do about that be.

529
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,322
Scott: why didn't they just forfeit or whatever, right?

530
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,950
Scott: Why did they make let that game go on right?

531
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:59,570
Scott: It's like, you know that that's shouldn't happen but in pro sports, it's like, okay, this is an NFL football team.

532
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:01,677
Scott: The score is gonna be with the score is gonna be.

533
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:08,230
Rym: I think college applies in the same way like watching Newman lose the game 24 goals to nothing in hockey.

534
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:13,506
Rym: Yeah is one of those wonderful things you can see in the world and World Cup which is you know topical.

535
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:19,684
Scott: right in the group Rounds at least they actively reward you for running up the score because the score differential matters.

536
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,690
Scott: So you better run up this car.

537
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,315
Scott: Otherwise, what are you doing?

538
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:23,677
Rym: Yep.

539
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:24,442
Rym: Well, I guess there this is.

540
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:25,890
Rym: there's actually a pretty clear way to say this.

541
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:31,630
Rym: What is the intent of the match in this case for little kids and like elementary schools?

542
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,468
Rym: The intent is for a bunch of kids to have fun and play the game.

543
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:36,915
Scott: the actual You know The intent is not for the kids to have fun.

544
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:41,270
Scott: The intent is for the parents to have fun taking photos of the kids going on.

545
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:49,196
Rym: Well, I think the difference is is it between and they feel like they're good parents between elementary schools Or elementary school teams?

546
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,125
Rym: or is it the little league that's separate from the school.

547
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,256
Rym: Yes for the little league Yeah, that's all.

548
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:58,850
Rym: that's mostly for the parents But for the schools, it's just part of the educational process.

549
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:12,330
Rym: but I feel like in almost all cases it is never really fair to Punish teams for that kind of behavior because that's kind of the behavior I would expect someone to put up against me.

550
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:21,779
Rym: Like I'd almost feel worse if someone could trivially score against me and after they beat me by a whole much just Stopped like just obviously stop trying.

551
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,924
Scott: Well, that's almost that.

552
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,370
Scott: it depends on how they do it.

553
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:33,030
Scott: Right, like if you're playing basketball Someone who just gets a basket right runs to the other end of the court steals the ball scores a basket and repeats, right?

554
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,230
Scott: That's really frustrating.

555
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:40,559
Scott: But if you imagine if the guy has the ball and he just he doesn't shoot and score he just keeps it away Just keeps it away from you.

556
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,603
Scott: You can't get it from just keeps it away And just running out the clock keeping it away keeping it away And then when the clock runs out, he like throws it out of bounds.

557
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:52,049
Scott: you go get it He steals it and then keeps it away until the shot clock runs out again.

558
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:54,639
Rym: Is that more or less sportsman-like than just shooting it?

559
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,350
Scott: It depends on the manner in which he keeps it away, right?

560
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:03,346
Rym: But now are you obligated to fake like you're trying but fail for the entire rest of a one-sided match?

561
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:06,321
Scott: I Think you know, this is why in Little League.

562
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,186
Scott: They have the mercy rule.

563
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:18,745
Rym: Yep So it mostly comes down to the organizers of an event deciding what the goal of that event is and Probably what the marketing around that event will be like.

564
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:32,090
Rym: they don't want you know A lot of online type games and especially like the PC competitive gaming circuits and the fighting game competitive circuits They have some image problems with people who aren't inside their little communities.

565
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,154
Scott: Well, look at hearthstone.

566
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:38,870
Scott: hearthstone for all its problems of you know money right and winning and collectible shit.

567
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:40,430
Scott: They solved all these problems.

568
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:53,967
Scott: You just can't communicate with the person other than like these like six or eight built-in things You can say which are like well played threatened Yeah, so already every time the other player fucks up well played.

569
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:56,382
Scott: Yep I mean, but that's all you can say.

570
00:35:56,402 --> 00:36:00,010
Scott: you can only use those pre-built built pre-built in messages.

571
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,828
Rym: Would you consider it unspoken like if I sent that message after every move the other player made for the entire match?

572
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,893
Scott: if you do That they can.

573
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:06,537
Scott: there's a button.

574
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,850
Scott: they can just mute and they see nothing that you say.

575
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,817
Scott: You can push those buttons as much as you want.

576
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:11,761
Scott: They'll never see the message.

577
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,488
Rym: Yeah, do I know they muted me?

578
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:18,804
Scott: No So pretty much it's like unsportsmanlike.

579
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,170
Scott: conduct can't happen.

580
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,294
Scott: The only thing you can do this.

581
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:30,460
Scott: unsportsmanlike is basically like if you have the match in hand Like you can whiz win anytime you want like this turn you could just win Instead of just winning.

582
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:32,453
Scott: you just drag it out Like you.

583
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:36,390
Scott: just let him go for another turn right and still let them try to do something.

584
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:40,810
Rym: I do that pretty much all the time when I'm playing neuroshima hacks when I'm open.

585
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:45,066
Scott: That's like the only thing that you can do in in Hearthstone.

586
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:46,010
Scott: That's unsportsmanlike.

587
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:52,750
Scott: So what about like and if you're against a serious opponent who is actually competitive with you, you can't afford to do that.

588
00:36:53,493 --> 00:37:08,537
Rym: So our friend Chie recalled in Dominion her primary strategy Seemed to be to come up with a combo that would both win the game And cause some sort of ridiculous near infinite loop to occur Just to rub it in.

589
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:09,079
Scott: Mm-hmm.

590
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,463
Rym: Is that unsportsmanlike?

591
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,510
Scott: I mean, that's how you play Dominion.

592
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,789
Scott: It's optimal play, right?

593
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,390
Scott: But I mean, let's say is you know, is it unsportsmanlike to just be better than your opponent, right?

594
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:34,210
Scott: so let's say you know, it's like you're Michael Jordan and you get into a basketball game and Against some other team and they're just not Michael Jordan and you win Easily, yep without much effort.

595
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,279
Rym: Was that a failure of matchmaking failure of the rules of the game?

596
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,730
Scott: if me and Rym play by the commando if we play nidhogg Is that is it just unsportsmanlike for that for us to play in the first place?

597
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,804
Scott: Yeah, I mean is Rym just supposed to like not commando.

598
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:52,724
Rym: Yeah, like you when we play a street fighter You're like fine only like jabs.

599
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:56,856
Rym: I will use Jab only like jab only.

600
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,340
Rym: just you're just in the corners.

601
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,466
Scott: I'm handicapping myself and then still winning.

602
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:01,710
Scott: Is that unsportsmanlike?

603
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,390
Scott: Insult you or is that balancing?

604
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,530
Rym: I remember I finally beat you when you were like fine only jabs and I will never jump and then I beat you barely.

605
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:30,530
Rym: Really what it comes down to in that front is if you're playing a game with someone where there is no Obvious and easy way to deal with your extreme skill disparity You just shouldn't play games with that type of person or that person or that game.

606
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:34,530
Rym: Yes, like for example dance dance revolution handles this really well.

607
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,850
Rym: You can play maniac mode right next to someone playing beginner mode and it doesn't matter doesn't do anything.

608
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:45,085
Rym: In fact, they feel like they're helping because if you start to fail they keep you alive.

609
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,730
Scott: They keep they keep your quarter alive.

610
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,008
Scott: Yes, you don't lose your money.

611
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:50,444
Rym: So it's partly an aspect of game design.

612
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:57,550
Rym: if you're designing a game You have to think a lot about what unsportsmanlike behaviors does the game allow and encourage?

613
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:12,677
Rym: And do you care mm-hmm I mean counter-strike if you have a server and you turn on all talk That is just ripe for the lots of unsportsmanlike contacts But at the same time with the right crowd.

614
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:17,470
Rym: if that's your goal like these sort of semi casual games that can be super fun.

615
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:21,299
Scott: So in terms of recommendations as a game player, right?

616
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:25,570
Scott: I recommend that you be sportsmanlike and not be a dickhead.

617
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,279
Rym: What is the definition of sportsmanship then?

618
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,343
Rym: are we you just have that?

619
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,246
Scott: you just have to?

620
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:35,090
Scott: if you're not a dick Then you have good judgment already and you know, yep, right.

621
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:42,022
Scott: so just use the good judgment that you have because a lot of people have good judgment and aren't dicks and Intentionally decide not to obey their better judgment.

622
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:43,910
Scott: true become and do dickish things.

623
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,615
Rym: But then there's that guy is the people who don't have good judgment But there's also the people.

624
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:51,870
Scott: there's no way to just tell them what good judgment is because it's subjective.

625
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,570
Scott: You have to just know yep, you have to be a socially aware individual.

626
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:00,004
Rym: And that's pretty much all it comes down to at least in everything but professional sports.

627
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,557
Rym: and like we said in professional sports Oh, you can start by not biting your opponent.

628
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:04,240
Scott: That's a good start.

629
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,519
Scott: Yeah, if you're not sure about what to do Start by not biting.

630
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,570
Rym: Oh, you know don't bite Don't tell them to go fuck themselves.

631
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,977
Scott: Well, I mean that depends right?

632
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:16,919
Scott: It's like.

633
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,470
Scott: it's like if I lose to someone I can be like, oh go fuck yourself.

634
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,138
Scott: There's the thing if you're.

635
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:25,416
Scott: but then I could be like hey Maybe you should go fuck yourself.

636
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:28,328
Scott: And if I say in a funny way, that could be totally.

637
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:33,045
Rym: All right It can be but if you're a person who doesn't already know if it can be if it can be.

638
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,450
Scott: All right, don't do it.

639
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,681
Rym: Yeah, the rule is unless yeah, you know, you can get away with it.

640
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,310
Scott: Don't do it if there's any uncertainty whatsoever.

641
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,730
Scott: Don't say or do whatever you were thinking or not or thinking about doing.

642
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:52,724
Scott: Opting to just not say or not do something Well is always safer than doing something unless it's saying good game.

643
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:53,587
Scott: You could say good game.

644
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,550
Scott: You can't get hurt doing that.

645
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:57,076
Rym: So here's a separate related question.

646
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:57,357
Scott: All right.

647
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:58,560
Scott: Thanks for playing.

648
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,230
Rym: or you know, this was relevant in like quiz bowl.

649
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,009
Rym: It's relevant in a lot of video games.

650
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:04,919
Rym: Good luck.

651
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:05,970
Rym: Good luck games.

652
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:07,995
Scott: So well played.

653
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:32,247
Rym: what about situations where there are things in the context of a game that are not in any sense either in the rules of the game or the rules of the tournament structure or the rules of the community like the written rules of the community organization, they're in no way against the rules, but they are part of the widely accepted unwritten social rules of the game.

654
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:35,350
Scott: like You want to talk about the bowing in Star Wars?

655
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:42,210
Rym: Is that you want to talk about the bowing in Star Wars or the things that would be considered cheating?

656
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:47,870
Rym: Except that they're not actually breaking any rules like observing other teams and taking notes.

657
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:50,374
Rym: That's what.

658
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:52,290
Rym: if there's some game we'll do that all the time.

659
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:58,710
Rym: Yes, and there are some games where the community greatly frowns upon that but it's hard to have rules against it.

660
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,345
Scott: They don't have specific rules in that run of the specific rule.

661
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:01,948
Scott: No scouting.

662
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,434
Rym: Yep What's the definition of scouting?

663
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:08,210
Scott: if the tournament judge thinks that you're going around looking at other people playing to figure out what's in?

664
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,386
Scott: Their deck so that when you play them, you know what they got Then they can just kick you out.

665
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,596
Rym: Yeah So is.

666
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:23,670
Rym: would it be unethical to have a friend go to the place where you know The people are gonna be in the tournament in the weeks before the tournament play and practice on their decks?

667
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:25,499
Scott: You can't you?

668
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,228
Scott: only time you can't scout is during the tournament.

669
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:31,389
Rym: Yep So would it be considered unsportsmanlike for you?

670
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:42,610
Rym: just hypothetical to have me go to Oklahoma or whatever for a month and Join the netrunner community there and hang out and play with these people and figure out what decks they're gonna use in the tournament?

671
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:43,508
Rym: They give you all that info.

672
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,935
Scott: People basically know whatever.

673
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:46,777
Scott: it doesn't really matter.

674
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,105
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying it so there's a no way unsportsmanlike.

675
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,148
Scott: No, not really.

676
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,234
Rym: All right I'm just curious.

677
00:42:52,776 --> 00:42:57,575
Scott: some I mean there might be a scandal if some No one no one cares.

678
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:00,463
Scott: Well, the other publishes their friggin decks on the internet.

679
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:04,493
Rym: is where we joined those Star Wars Servers those

680
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:05,536
Scott: Jedi Knight -

681
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:06,901
Rym: we played a lot of that

682
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:15,246
Scott: played that game when it was brand new because oh my god It was pretty much quake 3 mod But everything was Star Wars and it was FPS but also lightsaber for the lightsaber

683
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:16,370
Rym: combat was actually pretty fun.

684
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,724
Scott: yeah, so you play lightsaber duels against random people on the internet and people had this thing where.

685
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:30,789
Scott: but when the duel started they would You make their characters bow in game like crouch and uncrouch or lean look at the ground and then look forward again.

686
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,007
Rym: Whenever someone did that one I would force lighten them immediately which they always said.

687
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:38,629
Rym: no force lightning But I do it anyway And then I just rush in and fucking cut them.

688
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:47,628
Scott: I would just immediately push these when as soon as they started to bow I would time it and use the strongest Powerful lightsaber attack that was really slow and his suit at a time.

689
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,807
Scott: It's such that when their head was down it hit and then decapitated.

690
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:51,310
Scott: them is over.

691
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:56,210
Rym: I would usually also as soon as the lightsaber duel started back up pull out my blaster and start shooting them.

692
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:57,558
Scott: Yeah, that's also a good move.

693
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,450
Rym: I got kicked from a lot of servers.

694
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,890
Scott: Yeah, people would kick because it's their server.

695
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:11,419
Rym: they have a right to kick you if they want but But eventually you find the server where the mod isn't there and then you'd go nuts because that is in no way part of the Rules of the game only the rules of the community.

696
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:11,801
Scott: Yep.

697
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,450
Rym: Were we being unsportsmanlike?

698
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,314
Scott: No, I don't think so.

699
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:19,045
Rym: We were violating all the rules of the community to an extreme degree.

700
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:21,601
Scott: Yeah, I Don't feel bad about that.

701
00:44:21,722 --> 00:44:22,310
Scott: I would do it again.

702
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,541
Rym: I in fact not only do not feel bad about I'm kind of proud of it.

703
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,929
Scott: Yeah, I would do it the same way again.

704
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:31,810
Rym: I remember when one guy got so mad at me.

705
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,156
Rym: He's like for he said no force lightning.

706
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:35,679
Rym: that he told me and I quote.

707
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,123
Rym: that's unethical.

708
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,087
Scott: Do you snake in Mario Kart?

709
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,896
Rym: I Was the champion of snakes?

710
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:43,180
Scott: Okay, that is the same thing.

711
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:44,926
Rym: I have the scars to prove it.

712
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:47,169
Scott: Okay, then We're done here.

713
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:59,045
Rym: But I remember when that guy said that I said and I quote But I'm on the dark side and I proceeded to follow him around the server for doing nothing But force lightning him to death until he eventually quit.

714
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:03,483
Rym: nice roleplay Yeah, I wasn't griefing I was role-playing mm-hmm.

715
00:45:03,684 --> 00:45:04,770
Rym: I was I was I was dark Sith.

716
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:05,331
Rym: What do you want?

717
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:14,100
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott special?

718
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,900
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
