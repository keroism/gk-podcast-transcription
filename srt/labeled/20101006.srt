00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,935
Rym: It's Wednesday October 6th.

2
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:11,318
Rym: I'm ready.

3
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,228
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,340
Rym: all the new anime from October 2010 give or take some.

5
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:27,566
Scott: Let's do this Alright, so yesterday.

6
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:37,437
Scott: I'm bored at work, and I'm watching the tweets right and Alex Levitt from MIT He tweets out something about G is trending on Twitter with a link wow who watches the trending on Twitter?

7
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:37,618
Rym: like?

8
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:42,140
Scott: I can't think of Anything more useless, and there's actually a site that it will explain to you.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,682
Scott: I think it's called.

10
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:43,786
Scott: What's the trend?

11
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:44,488
Scott: and it explained.

12
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:47,780
Scott: if you don't know what why or what something is that is trending?

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,947
Scott: It will tell you what it is.

14
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:56,657
Rym: I just I've never Run into anything worthwhile because it trended on Twitter, but nothing I like friends on.

15
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:57,660
Scott: so I was curious.

16
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:12,695
Scott: I was like okay the word GEE is trending on Twitter right and a fellow anime Japanese culture person is tweeting it as if it's something nerdy Right as opposed to say something sports, or you know mainstream related or Duke Nukem forever.

17
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,660
Scott: exactly right, so I'm like huh?

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,359
Scott: All right, let me click and see what this is and what I saw was one of those.

19
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,200
Scott: You know those girl groups because you know in the u.s.. They tend to have like one girl like Britney Spears.

20
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:37,673
Scott: But in Japan Korea, you know they have these groups like AKB 48 Right it's like a team of girls that they train them all to be little robot Idols and they make a big team and they do pop shit and whatever right.

21
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:43,507
Scott: so this one the name of this group I think is like SDSN is like the.

22
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:46,175
Scott: is the the short way the abbreviation for it?

23
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:46,476
Scott: right?

24
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:50,072
Scott: because in Korean it's like four words that begin the first.

25
00:01:50,092 --> 00:02:10,044
Scott: you know SDS whatever and it's also known as girl generation, so they did this song called G and It's you know it's a trashy lame pop song like oh fashion and boyfriend But it's one of those things that gets stuck in your goddamn head Right?

26
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:15,030
Rym: see luckily the only thing that's been stuck in my head That's kind of insipid lately is remember that mashup that I forget.

27
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,420
Rym: who did it of every like the top 25 pop songs from 2009.

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,709
Scott: well they do that like every few months don't they?

29
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:32,436
Scott: or at least every year that mashup itself has been stuck in my head But not any of the individual songs, uh-huh anyway, so I'm like oh, that was pretty catchy, and it got stuck right, but then I investigated further.

30
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:33,580
Scott: so get this deal ready.

31
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:36,400
Scott: Why did this thing trend because apparently?

32
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:46,407
Scott: G was an actually a year or two old right and this group has been around since like oh seven no eight ish Apparently remember Boa.

33
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,240
Rym: Oh, yeah, we saw her in concert.

34
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,572
Rym: Yeah, she was a New York Tokyo anime or music festival in what?

35
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:52,612
Rym: 2001.

36
00:02:52,612 --> 00:03:01,420
Scott: It's not really a long time ago, and So she was a Korean pop singer, and she knew you know Korean Japanese and English.

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,604
Scott: She was multilingual right.

38
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:07,438
Scott: so apparently girls generation or SDSN is a team of Boas.

39
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,794
Scott: they all Know they all can sing dance and know three languages.

40
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,380
Rym: Oh, that's that's dangerous.

41
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:19,471
Scott: They basically train them, and they're so popular that according to Wikipedia They put up posters of them around.

42
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,164
Scott: you know like Seoul and South Korea Got stolen.

43
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:27,028
Scott: the posters were them in Like jeans t-shirts and roller skates.

44
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,680
Scott: right the posters were stolen and their phones are ringing off the hook Asking you people if to buy the posters.

45
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,700
Scott: So this is like insane apparently.

46
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:47,244
Scott: But what happened was is the G song was a huge hit in Korea And the reason it was trending globally on Twitter is because they redid the song in Japanese And it was just released.

47
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,677
Scott: and there's a music video and everything and it's kind of out of control.

48
00:03:52,118 --> 00:04:04,516
Rym: yeah G Okay, it amazes me how disconnected got I am from both Global like pop culture on the internet like trending Twitter and from local pop culture.

49
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:20,719
Scott: the thing that really bothers me Right is like you know I don't I don't think of myself as like a weeaboo right But the thing is you look at the world and you look at the internets And I'm I want to at least sort of get an idea of like what cultures are around the entire world.

50
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:21,762
Rym: Scott Who's Snooki?

51
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,669
Scott: I don't know anyway.

52
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,779
Rym: Can you name any movie that Leonardo DiCaprio was in?

53
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:36,547
Scott: Like Inception, okay, I saw that DiCaprio is a famous guy.

54
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,309
Scott: ah actor is using a movie is an actor You know.

55
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:47,569
Scott: But I kind of want to know if there's something that's ridiculously popular You know in some place in the world it might.

56
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,809
Scott: there could be things that are like in Eastern Europe that like a like a billion People are interested in.

57
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,200
Scott: that I wouldn't even know it existed.

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,698
Rym: And you see I just take Eurovision, and I assume that is what everyone in Europe likes, but those are for.

59
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:03,800
Scott: those are Specifically things that are not professionals, which is exactly what I want.

60
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:10,210
Scott: Yeah, but the point is is like if something happens in Europe like this We might know about it if something happens in Japan.

61
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,612
Scott: We're dead.

62
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,940
Scott: or you know Korea even or China.

63
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,440
Scott: We might know about it, but like the rest of the world is sort of like this mystery land like you know India.

64
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:23,580
Scott: We can get some Bollywood stuff and once in a while We can get a dollar mendi, but it's kind of hard.

65
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:24,403
Scott: You know this.

66
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:27,012
Scott: their stuff doesn't really go around the internet as much one.

67
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:29,260
Rym: Japan very pointedly and much purpose.

68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,824
Rym: Korea is like this too.

69
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:35,136
Rym: They try to export culture very much like by design.

70
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,460
Rym: Yeah, here is culture.

71
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,323
Rym: We were sending it out.

72
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,548
Rym: Yep, and other countries.

73
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,351
Rym: Don't try.

74
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,194
Rym: or if they do try.

75
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,463
Rym: They don't do it very effectively I think.

76
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:47,126
Rym: so couple this with the fact that we live in America where the internet is pretty much Like.

77
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:48,339
Rym: this is where the internet lives.

78
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,728
Rym: Yeah And I mean look at the Japanese internet.

79
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,400
Rym: even other than the phone SMS stuff people are using.

80
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:56,251
Rym: Their internet looks like geocities from the 90s.

81
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,460
Rym: I just don't know how to use the internet.

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Rym: I'm

83
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:16,246
Scott: just saying I wish that all the countries of the world would export their culture on the internet actively like Japan and such do to create these sort of you know to contribute to the world culture because otherwise Their cultures are getting washed away as the internet culture dominates And they're not gonna have their.

84
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:19,100
Scott: you know the internet culture will not be as influenced by them.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,953
Scott: I think it is by others who are actively export.

86
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,503
Rym: It's a lack of culture Exportation.

87
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:29,398
Rym: like they don't have the like the infrastructure built to do that sort of thing.

88
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:32,870
Rym: they don't design Songs from the ground up to be all right.

89
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,940
Rym: this song is going to be popular among this demographic.

90
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:44,652
Rym: We're going to get it out there with this means and we're gonna make people go crazy about it like they've got it down To a science in America and Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world.

91
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:53,130
Rym: I don't think they work to that cynical level of like kind of Manufacturing of media and manufacturing of culture.

92
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,560
Scott: that's true, but you know that the sad thing is like if you're Italian right?

93
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:06,492
Scott: I'm sure there's plenty of awesome music scenes in Italy that aren't big anywhere else, and you would like if you're creating this world culture That's a mishmash of everything on the internet.

94
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,040
Scott: You know that's gonna be the internet culture.

95
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:16,537
Scott: You would think that Italians should have their proportionate contribution to this world culture that will Regardless of whether they like it or not dominate all culture.

96
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:22,680
Scott: the other thing There's a. but if they don't if they don't actively put their you know their ingredients in the pot Then they'll be washed.

97
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:31,572
Rym: There are a lot of very strong ties between Southeast Asia and the Western world especially the United States And we don't have these ties in other places.

98
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,300
Rym: I mean Japan Europe.

99
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:39,300
Rym: Yeah, all right, so we've got Britain, but what do we get from Britain other than the Beatles?

100
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,499
Rym: Spice Girls and maybe Monty Python?

101
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:44,416
Rym: What do people know?

102
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:52,207
Rym: name any Singer from the history of the world from France Belgium or Germany.

103
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:58,015
Scott: Alizé all right name a second one Belgium or Germany or hell.

104
00:07:58,175 --> 00:07:58,920
Rym: all of Europe.

105
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:00,404
Scott: Oh all of Europe.

106
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:00,866
Rym: go for it.

107
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:01,427
Rym: all of Europe.

108
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:06,548
Scott: any singer any singer that girl that was at RIT from Croatia Fana Fana.

109
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,830
Rym: all right, so we got to obscure Britney Spears from Croatia.

110
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:16,186
Scott: I Got a non obscure Britney Spears from France, but look at internet culture.

111
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,170
Rym: look at nerd culture.

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,916
Rym: Here's where I'm trying to make this correlation.

113
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,527
Rym: nerds have a big crossover with internet.

114
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,977
Scott: all of Europe, dude There's so many fucking metal bands mocking eyes.

115
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,603
Scott: the premises from Europe alright alright.

116
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,567
Rym: You got some hands.

117
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:30,859
Scott: Yeah But you want to know an actual just just a singer.

118
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,830
Rym: a band doesn't count or name anyone from marking a supremacy.

119
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,009
Scott: Oh one guy's name is Johan.

120
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,379
Rym: That was a pretty good bet.

121
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,230
Scott: no I know it is because I wasn't looking at their website today.

122
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,799
Rym: That's the old trick of go to a wedding.

123
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,025
Rym: You'd be like hey John.

124
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,358
Scott: Hey Just wave around the whole room.

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,569
Scott: someone in that area has got to be named John.

126
00:08:50,812 --> 00:09:00,150
Rym: But look there's a big overlap by and large among geeks and nerds We're into tech stuff and our internet savvy and who are also into anime manga or comics to some degree.

127
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:10,650
Rym: And there's also an overlap there with you know weird East Asian cinema and kung fu movies and stuff too Mmm, and gojira because those things all overlap with the internet.

128
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:17,729
Rym: I think that culture from those places places is as a result overrepresented in our internet culture.

129
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:25,769
Rym: as a result I don't think those things are even on the radar of non internet people in the u.s.. Of course not so non-internet people in the u.s.

130
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:31,990
Rym: Are completely distinct from internet people culturally and we as internet people are in this weird culture.

131
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:38,422
Rym: That is also only the internet and internet savvy Manipulation machines from the rest of the world.

132
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,707
Scott: you know what I gotta say to that.

133
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:44,468
Rym: yeah Okay, I didn't listen to the song enough to get it stuck in my head.

134
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,779
Rym: Now God no fuck you.

135
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,250
Rym: I still have the goddamn Tetris song stuck in my head.

136
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,458
Rym: Who ranges the?

137
00:09:54,814 --> 00:10:03,385
Scott: So this weekend the 8th 9th and 10th of October Is the New York Comic Con and New York anime festival?

00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:06,730
Rym: M Night Shyamalan is gonna be there.

165
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:07,937
Scott: It's not the guy everyone hates.

166
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,948
Scott: they hate him now like I know something.

167
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,196
Rym: Why why do they hate him Scott?

168
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,743
Scott: because he makes bad movies.

169
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,068
Rym: No he made one bad movie.

170
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:16,855
Rym: well Well he was.

171
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:26,190
Rym: he was hated by some some people for later movies He made, but then he made a really really bad movie and people suddenly were like oh wow what the fuck.

172
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:27,320
Rym: He also made.

173
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,642
Rym: really good.

174
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:28,349
Rym: He made signs.

175
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:29,957
Scott: Remember that like them.

176
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,630
Scott: I was the one to where the water killed the alien.

177
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,578
Scott: Yeah, I didn't like that movie didn't like that movie.

178
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:36,570
Scott: well mostly cuz it was you know sort of the bullshit part of it.

179
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:39,528
Rym: Well that it's all downhill from there, okay?

180
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,110
Rym: He made that elevator movie the one who saw the trailer for yeah with a devil.

181
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,836
Scott: Everyone booed at because it was him.

182
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:50,290
Rym: yeah well everyone's watching the trailer like what the fuck is this movie?

183
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:54,043
Rym: And then it was like M Night Shyamalan, and then suddenly everyone's like oh, okay.

184
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,167
Rym: I get it anyway.

185
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,150
Scott: What's the M stand for?

186
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,969
Rym: Magic night.

187
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:03,070
Scott: So there's gonna be a zillion famous people there.

188
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,046
Scott: I'm not even gonna bother to list them because you just go to the website and look but it is up.

189
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,020
Rym: if you're in I Have GeekNights will be there.

190
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,386
Rym: Oh Carl Custer uncle yo will be there.

191
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:15,375
Rym: yep, yeah Daryl Surratt might be around.

192
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:16,638
Scott: oh my god watch out.

193
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,320
Scott: It's dangerous.

194
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,567
Scott: Yeah, there's gonna be the artists alley.

195
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,610
Scott: supposedly you're ready for this.

196
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:21,789
Scott: How many tables?

197
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:27,110
Rym: 450 tables I hear so significantly smaller than Otakon's artist.

198
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,341
Scott: I don't know how many tables the Otakon's artists alley have.

199
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,246
Scott: I think it's pretty close.

200
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,044
Scott: ah yeah 450 I mean that's.

201
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:39,890
Rym: but to be fair the tables Traditionally at comic cons are smaller than the ones at say an artist alley.

202
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,130
Scott: But it's not the size of the tables right it's the quality of the person sitting behind the table.

203
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:56,796
Scott: They could put everyone with a chair and a tiny little podium, and if there's 450 of them You know ranging from guys selling anime bookmarks to you know top-line comic creator Yes,

204
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:07,053
Rym: well at the same time It's tricky because comic-con artist alley tables are usually crazy expensive and they give them to famous people and it's there's a very different skew from say the Anime-con where

205
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:14,736
Scott: it's gonna be really interesting with this big mix of people at the tables you know from webcomic artists to Marvel guys to Anime people's you know.

206
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:16,121
Scott: there's also get.

207
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:18,650
Scott: every booth is sold out so every regular booth.

208
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,336
Scott: So it's gonna be crazy full.

209
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:24,090
Scott: I even hear that this is gonna be like Intel supposedly has the biggest booth.

210
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,120
Scott: That's gonna be kind of weird.

211
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:26,170
Rym: well think about this.

212
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,836
Rym: This is the comic-con.

213
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,950
Rym: the comic cons are becoming the Hollywood cons where the industry just jumps all over it.

214
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,817
Scott: Yeah, but Intel.

215
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,450
Scott: I mean that's a that's a pecs kind of booth.

216
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,270
Scott: You know with technologies and gaming and stuff and apparently Intel booth is gonna have loads of just open gaming video gaming at it.

217
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,749
Rym: yeah, they was weird because they were the con because it's a comic-con - was really gonna push gaming.

218
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:54,001
Rym: and Then they kind of backed off of that at least when I was talking to him originally because there's a lot less gaming than was Originally at least in my perception going to be there.

219
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,270
Rym: Wizards the coast is doing a bunch of crap.

220
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,973
Rym: They're same old.

221
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:57,836
Rym: you want to play D&D.

222
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:58,861
Rym: come play D&D thing.

223
00:13:58,941 --> 00:13:59,644
Scott: come play magic.

224
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,307
Rym: Yep.

225
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:04,781
Rym: Here's magic Running there that gamma world D&D which I can't.

226
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:07,409
Rym: it amazes me that we explain that to me.

227
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,433
Rym: really You'd never.

228
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,437
Rym: you don't know anything about gamma.

229
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:12,069
Scott: Why don't I think my gamma world so gamma is it a world of?

230
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,390
Scott: The Incredible Hulk is you know what I have cuz gamma rays and credit.

231
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,830
Rym: I have an issue of dragon magazine.

232
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,350
Rym: I'm a bomb that I'll have to dig out of my pile of old dragon magazines where an editorial was about gamma world.

233
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,150
Rym: It was the guy who had never role-played before and he went to a con and played gamma world.

234
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:37,074
Rym: Okay, and it's a world where character creation is kind of random and you play a mutant like I'm an ant-man with six arms And six lightsabers.

235
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:37,676
Scott: that could be fun.

236
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:46,310
Rym: Yeah, and I conceptually I feel like all the magic of a game Like that is going to be raped out of its corpse by using Wizards the coast D&D.

237
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,741
Scott: I'm a guy with six arms.

238
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:48,669
Scott: All right, this could be fun.

239
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,089
Scott: All right.

240
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,110
Scott: Now walk around the dungeon and kill them on other monsters with six arms highest average damage per minute.

241
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,245
Rym: Don't forget to use your healing surge.

242
00:14:56,607 --> 00:15:00,624
Scott: Yeah The thing is like I think a burning gamma could be pretty good.

243
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,270
Rym: Oh my god burning gamma would.

244
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,710
Scott: Anyway, it's not Tuesday No, what other awesome?

245
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,190
Rym: Originally planning to really cut down on the anime stuff do a whole bunch of gaming stuff at this con.

246
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,786
Rym: And then in the very end they were like, yeah, just do the anime stuff.

247
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:21,870
Scott: Never mind Yeah, and then they're like, okay do even less of the anime stuff that you were asking to do.

248
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:28,983
Scott: Anyway There's also gonna be a whole bunch of concerts all over the place.

249
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,190
Scott: a lot of them won't be at the con itself.

250
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,122
Scott: They'll be nearby for example vamps at the Roseland Ballroom.

251
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:36,250
Scott: Yeah extra pans gonna be somewhere puffy.

252
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:38,171
Scott: It's.

253
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:41,020
Scott: uh, it's crazy off the hook with all sorts of concerts.

254
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,287
Rym: There's that shami-san band with the two guys.

255
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:43,969
Scott: Oh nice.

256
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,656
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I forget their names.

00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:46,540
Rym: Oh, I gotta look it up.

258
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,027
Scott: It's not the Yoshida brothers.

259
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:53,001
Rym: No, it's not Other guys, I remember Otakon was working on stuff with them.

260
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:53,582
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,790

265
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:03,777
Scott: Where'd it go?

266
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:05,446

00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:29,262
Scott: I know about Adam war right hosted by some guy from TV.

272
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:43,630
Scott: It's like this crazy awesome concert and it's in the city somewhere and I will maybe post a link to it So you can find out about it, but that is like the craziest awesome.

273
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,637
Scott: That's like if I had a Packs right and the packs had.

274
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:51,210
Scott: it was a packs of comics instead of a packs of gaming and I had a concert.

275
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,829
Scott: That's who would be doing the Saturday night concert, right?

276
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:02,090
Scott: So you can think of it sort of as the real Saturday night concert of newer comic-con Even though it's separate from the con in a you know a city location.

277
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,180
Scott: But yeah, that's that's gonna be wicked crazy.

278
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:05,923
Scott: Awesome right there.

279
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:08,829
Rym: the biggest part about this con I mean the pet a lot of the panels.

280
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,710
Rym: There's so many panels and a lot of them are done by professionals which is good or bad.

281
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:22,990
Rym: I mean look at pass packs is mostly industry professionals doing panels and they're very hit or miss as a result But they're at least hit or miss in a professional manner.

282
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,249
Scott: Yeah, I actually heard that while I'm pretty sure the show floor and all that stuff is mixed You know.

283
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,018
Scott: But the anime and the gaming is all mixed.

284
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:29,661
Scott: right.

285
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,147
Scott: is the way they've done it?

286
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,330
Scott: is they sort of Categorized the show floor, right?

287
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:45,157
Scott: so even though it's one big show floor like one area will just be dealers and in fact like Guys selling old comic books will stand next to this, you know be next to the other guys, you know Selling old comic books, you know.

288
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:51,100
Scott: and the people selling like kid robot style toys and all that sort of stuff They have like a cult area that's got all that stuff.

289
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,409
Rym: So it's like the back by the right that area I'm really looking forward to check out.

290
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,606
Scott: So they've got like all the.

291
00:17:56,627 --> 00:18:03,455
Scott: you know There's one big show floor, but they've segregated the show floor to put all these similar booths next to similar booths Right.

292
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:07,794
Scott: in addition to that The Panel areas are.

293
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:13,270
Scott: all the comic-con panels are in one space and all the anime festival panels are in a different there.

294
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,680
Scott: They're in separate locations.

295
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,130
Scott: They're like two different panel hallways.

296
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,126
Scott: So that way, you know all the anime kids can hang out near the anime panel.

297
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,270
Rym: No, that's not gonna happen.

298
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,086
Rym: This is this is my interest in this con.

299
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:26,690
Scott: Oh so interest.

300
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:34,030
Rym: I mean I've Speculated to a degree that is unhealthy as to like what the panels would be like like the layout how it's actually gonna flow.

301
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:52,810
Rym: but the only thing that I really find interesting and I have no idea how this is gonna play out is to see all these Comic nerds all these Hollywood nerds and all these anime nerds in the same place at the same time because there are the people we Know that we see them at every read event in the Javits that go to the comic-con and the anime festival.

302
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:57,350
Rym: I don't think they're the majority and I can't wait to see what happens.

303
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,749
Rym: I just want to see like how these groups react to each other.

304
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,493
Scott: I think that's gonna be see.

305
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:12,390
Scott: the thing is there are cons out there that are such as Fan Expo in Canada or mega con in Florida, which are literally they don't even try to hide it everything cons.

306
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:21,990
Rym: they have gaming and anime and right and they But everything cons tend to draw the same kinds of people who will go to both New York comic-con and New York anime festival.

307
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:22,450
Scott: I don't know.

308
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,410
Scott: I think that when you have it everything con if there's enough comic dealers comic nerd guy shows up in enough numbers.

309
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:36,809
Scott: But the thing is this is a little different because you have an existing Big blob of comic people and an existing big blob of anime people and you're gonna smash them together at once.

310
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:49,452
Scott: now They did say I heard that there was like a seventy five percent crossover people who go to both something like that Which I think is a little bit high, you know I don't know if that maybe that number is wrong But I heard that there was actually a very large crossover.

311
00:19:49,472 --> 00:20:02,990
Scott: because they look at the names of people who bought one badge the names of people about the other in previous years and they Say aha, but I also heard that they're like a hundred and something percent Ahead of like estimated sales of pre-order badges.

312
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:14,397
Scott: So it is gonna be crazy crowded like oh my god This might be even though you know, they are going to report a false Attendance figure as they often do.

313
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:25,643
Rym: this is probably going to be if not this year then definitely next year The biggest nerd thing there is in America really rapidly Yeah, it's gonna be the second biggest con probably after the city.

314
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:25,944
Scott: Of course.

315
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,510
Rym: This is the East Coast effect.

316
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:40,769
Rym: I mean, you know people on the West Coast they have the Anime Expo and whatever but on the East Coast We got Otakon which is already too big to fit into the biggest convention center we got and like PAX East is already surpassing PAX Prime just because there's so many more people in the area.

317
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:53,768
Rym: and part of the reason cons don't happen that often in New York City is Because even if you put on a little con like I'm doing my little anime con you'll sell out immediately and then you'll have tens Of thousands of people at the door the day of the con trying to get in.

318
00:20:54,633 --> 00:21:00,510
Scott: Yeah, it's it's gonna be crazy good not so, you know I don't know how much more there is to say about this this con.

319
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,190
Rym: I mean really just have to wait until after it happens and then tell you that's why I didn't want to dedicate a whole episode.

320
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,129
Scott: I just wanted to get dedicated news portion to to this.

321
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:15,570
Scott: But yeah, New York and there's gonna be so and that you know There's still little news because everyone is holding their news and they're gonna announce all their news at the con.

322
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:20,800
Scott: So I'm sure the next Wednesday episode we do There's gonna be a whole pile of news and all.

323
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,752
Scott: we're gonna just probably spend the whole episode talking about You know the one or two days you spent at this con.

324
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:26,813
Scott: So there you go.

325
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,240
Rym: So things of the day.

326
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,127
Rym: What do you got for me?

327
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:42,577
Scott: All right, so this is video Called mouseland right and apparently the deal about Mickey Mouse.

328
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:45,548
Scott: No Set what it is about your mouse.

329
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,136
Scott: There was this guy and he was the socialist ID mouse.

330
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,160
Scott: All right, that's enough.

331
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:52,880
Scott: There's this guy named Tommy Douglas, and he was a famous Canadian politician.

332
00:21:53,041 --> 00:22:04,337
Scott: He was the socialist premier of Saskatchewan Right and he is the creator of the Canadian health care system And he's also happens to be the grandfather of some actor named Kiefer Sutherland.

333
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:12,018
Rym: Kiefer Sutherland He played the guy in Armitage the third or Armitage 3 polymatrix really?

334
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:23,300
Rym: Yeah Okay So the Armitage the third that was a matrix guy to to make it clear that Includes the second worst voice acted line in the history of anime.

335
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,192
Rym: I mean, it's really bad where Armitage gets shot and goes flying off of something.

336
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:27,115
Rym: and keep yourself there.

337
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:35,540
Scott: Lynn says no So his grandpa was this famous socialist guy and he gave a speech in the Parliament of Canada.

338
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,685
Scott: So it's e I Kiefer.

339
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:43,837
Scott: it's then it should be kee not.

340
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,733
Scott: If you see that and you don't know how it's supposed to be you would.

341
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:52,114
Scott: you would say Kiefer like right.

342
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,830
Scott: Anyway, I mean you the other way to pronounce it be like heifer But then it would be keffer and that doesn't sound like someone's name.

343
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,336
Scott: Hey keffer Kiefer.

344
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:01,300
Scott: It sounds like someone's name.

345
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,990
Rym: I guess it's another one of those pop culture.

346
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:03,353
Rym: Thanks.

347
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,648
Scott: So The here's a video of someone animating.

348
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:14,169
Scott: this guy gave a speech in the Parliament about mouseland Right, and it was awesome, even though it's socialist, but whatever.

349
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:14,690
Scott: It's awesome.

350
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:21,820
Scott: And so the guy animated it and Kiefer Introduces the video at the beginning, you know because it's about his grandpa.

351
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,171
Scott: So it's just really awesome video.

352
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:36,220
Scott: and even though you know it is socialist at least the fundamental point that it is making it is humorous and You know quality and it lacks any specific policies, you know.

353
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,822
Scott: So you it's.

354
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:39,793
Scott: it's hard for a a mouse to disagree with it.

355
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,499
Scott: cats might get really mad watching it though.

356
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:48,473
Rym: So not to fall back on an old standby of college humor, but there's.

357
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,820
Scott: it's been a few times there without you know.

358
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,939
Rym: There's nothing more amusing to me in all the world then watching squirrels try to figure stuff out.

359
00:23:56,742 --> 00:24:01,000
Scott: How about other animals trying to figure stuff squirrels trying to figure stuff out?

360
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,006
Rym: I like more cuz what squirrels are very long-lived.

361
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:08,429
Rym: an old squirrel has accumulated and not a lot of squirrely knowledge over the years Not as much as an owl.

362
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,105
Rym: Ah Depends, I don't see turtle.

363
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,656
Rym: I always don't have as many problems to solve as squirrels do.

364
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:15,117
Scott: that's cuz.

365
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:15,940
Scott: they're just so good.

366
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,395
Scott: They know right they know from the beginning how to not get into problem, but we live in a world.

367
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:20,620
Rym: and exactly it's boring.

368
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:22,510
Rym: You want someone who is just.

369
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,886
Scott: it's boring when someone's so badass They never fuck up exactly.

370
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:31,500
Rym: squirrels are great because they are just smart enough to realize there is a problem But just dumb enough to not realize.

371
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:34,326
Scott: Didn't get my joke.

372
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,131
Rym: I sidestep.

373
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:42,785
Rym: you're real really right away I was talking about elves and then I said, oh really I was gonna hit you later with a yeah, really Okay.

374
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,614
Rym: Anyway, or yarly as it were.

375
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:45,900
Scott: so you got a funny squirrel video.

376
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:53,209
Rym: So this is a funny squirrel video, but it's a perfect storm of squirrel video because you see Squirrels will try to figure shit out.

377
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:57,179
Rym: if there's food at the end of whatever there is to figure out Almost any animal will do that.

378
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,015
Rym: now a lot of animals either will never figure it out or won't realize there's something to figure out.

379
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:05,591
Rym: a lot of dogs if you Give them a certain kind of puzzle will not actively try to figure out.

380
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:09,986
Rym: they will literally run in every possible direction Until they just brute force their way through.

381
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:12,013
Rym: they don't think they don't stop squirrels.

382
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:12,616
Rym: Stop and go.

383
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:16,126
Rym: All right, I Think I can handle this.

384
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:19,820
Rym: they pause and look at something for a while and then they suddenly go for it and fail.

385
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:20,442
Scott: It should be.

386
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:22,890
Scott: you should use an octopus or a crow instead.

387
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,620
Rym: much smarter independent of squirrels and their nature.

388
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:37,416
Rym: nerds with cameras will set up squirrel traps just to see what happens and this genius took a Slinky and just hung it over the pole of his bird feeder and his squirrel can now figure this the fuck out.

389
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:41,419
Scott: Alrighty So metamoment the meta.

390
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,929
Scott: We already talked about that big convention.

391
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:45,133
Scott: So we're gonna not talk about that.

392
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:46,920
Rym: We are gonna talk about the other big convention.

393
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:49,120
Scott: Yes, you see you can't really go to it.

394
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,884
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's full.

395
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:55,252
Scott: there might be one spot open because I think he said he opened two spots this morning Three and then two went right away.

396
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:55,856
Rym: and I don't even know.

397
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,086
Scott: I don't know anymore But we are.

398
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:10,541
Scott: the reason I'm not gonna be at the Comic Con and such much on Saturday And maybe I'll be there Sunday But probably not is because we're going to 10 10 10 the burning wheel convention, which also occurs on 10 9 10.

399
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,907
Scott: Yeah, well 10 is same exact.

400
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,537
Scott: is this weekend the same weekend as the double mega con, right?

401
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:21,340
Scott: So Because the burning wheel was originally released on 5 5 0 5. he's having a convention on 10 10 10.

402
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,993
Scott: So the next one is gonna be what 15 15 which is also which is also binary day.

403
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,242
Scott: Yeah, maybe 20 20 20.

404
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:29,411
Rym: I think you should be 15 15 15 which would be?

405
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:31,340
Rym: I guess we have to use modulus on the months.

406
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,993
Rym: It would be like March.

407
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,480
Scott: No, what you would do is 15.

408
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,425
Rym: it would be March 15 2015.

409
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:40,108
Rym: No, it'd be March 2016.

410
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:40,256
Rym: Why?

411
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:49,364
Rym: Because if it's the 15th month of the year No, I say just mod you just do modulus on each individual component to make it be a real date Uh-huh.

412
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:59,117
Rym: Anyway, that's how I continue to celebrate International Day of Slayer Because until 2066 we will not get another true and proper International Day of Slayer.

413
00:26:59,198 --> 00:26:59,940
Scott: It's on the calendar.

414
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:01,830
Scott: Let me go if I could find out what it is if you need to.

415
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,400
Rym: yeah, but we had one that was the most I mean, I guess 1966, but we didn't have Slayer yet.

416
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:13,540
Scott: If we get if we become immortal will eventually be alive on 66 66 66.

417
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,825
Rym: Ah, and if only Slayer would still be alive.

418
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:27,379
Scott: Well, if we become immortal, maybe they will too, you know somewhere out there in the cosmos, of course, we'll use different methods We'll use science and they'll use the powers of Satan.

419
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,679
Rym: All right, I'm not even gonna make my homeopathic Slayer joke.

420
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,308
Rym: So yes, the burning con is this weekend.

421
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:43,090
Rym: if you're not already going and do not already have a registration You probably cannot go and that sucks.

422
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,046
Scott: the first also this Friday is Nerd NYC board game night.

423
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:49,250
Rym: Oh, yeah, we won't be there.

424
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:49,933
Scott: It won't be there.

425
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:51,860
Rym: It's the first one I've missed in a long time.

426
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,073
Scott: There's also about a bajillion other nerdy things in New York City.

427
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:56,539
Scott: You can look them up on the Internet's.

428
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,959
Scott: There will be no shortage of them.

429
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:08,100
Scott: I think there's a website called nerd York City that has like a Google calendar with every nerdy event of it in New York City As opposed to nerd NYC, which is just the board game.

430
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,270
Scott: So you like check their Google Calendar.

431
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,460
Scott: you can see nerdy events in the whole country.

432
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,798
Scott: Well, there's also some gaming thing going on upstate at some college this weekend.

433
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:22,857
Rym: Yeah Yeah, the thing is you put your little gaming thing at the same time as two other gaming related events.

434
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,198
Scott: Not smart dudes Yeah.

435
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:35,018
Scott: So the only other metamoment thing to discuss right now is the book club, which is World War Z I don't want to read this by Max Brooks and Z stands for.

436
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,813
Rym: zmabi Ordered it but I didn't hit submit yet.

437
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:44,700
Rym: because if I hit submit Then it's also gonna pre-order the next Prince of Nothing book and I won't get that zombie book until like March of next year.

438
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:45,645
Scott: Split that shit up.

439
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,480
Rym: But if I split it up, it splits the whole thing up and that's bullshit.

440
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:49,146
Scott: It is.

441
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,870
Rym: but I want an option that is Ship my pre-orders when they become available but bunch everything else up.

442
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,040
Scott: if you can you just order one and then you make another order.

443
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,660
Rym: I know but that's annoying.

444
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:04,691
Scott: Just lightly All right, so we watched a whole bunch of anime.

445
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:06,156
Scott: yeah, it's a new anime season.

446
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:07,320
Scott: I didn't watch.

447
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:12,300
Scott: I only watched three shows because they didn't have that much time because we only decided to do this a couple days ago.

448
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,786
Scott: I only watched four.

449
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:14,268
Scott: you watch.

450
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:16,376
Scott: Oh you watch more shows than me, but you didn't watch.

00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,260
Scott: we only how many show?

452
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,106
Scott: What shows did you watch?

00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:19,960
Scott: just how many titles I started watching?

454
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,907
Rym: Well here watch because I skipped through shin ray tent a Yakima that Detective with the glowing eye.

455
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,756
Scott: Okay, just do the titles.

456
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:31,110
Rym: and I watched bakuman All right, and I watched mm.

457
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,320
Scott: mm exclamation point.

458
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,680
Rym: Yeah, all right, and I watched arakara under the bridgie bridgie bridge ex bridge bridge bridge.

459
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,806
Scott: It's like hunter ex hunter in the show.

460
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,130
Rym: They say bridgey bridgey.

461
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:42,872
Scott: All right.

462
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:43,875
Scott: Well, then it's bridgey bridgey.

463
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:44,577
Rym: Actually.

464
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:45,620
Rym: I also watched.

465
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:50,625
Rym: I'm I can't believe I watched this Yosuga.

466
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,309
Rym: no, sorry.

467
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:52,234
Scott: Did you watch the whole episode?

468
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:56,640
Rym: I Started to watch it and then I decided that this was going in a bad direction.

469
00:29:57,103 --> 00:30:05,100
Rym: So I skipped through it to see if it did go in that direction And it not only went up to the line that I was worried about but it went way past it.

470
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,782
Rym: But we'll get to that.

471
00:30:05,863 --> 00:30:06,043
Scott: Okay.

472
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:08,111
Scott: All right, so I watched a bakuman also.

473
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,740
Scott: Yeah, I watched that penny stocking and garter belt.

474
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:11,764
Rym: See, that's the only one.

475
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:12,568
Rym: I didn't watch that.

476
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:13,492
Rym: I wanted to watch.

477
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,340
Scott: is that what we're talking about by guy next?

478
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,323
Scott: I was really really good.

479
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,188
Scott: I watched star driver.

480
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:23,791
Scott: I Start driver first here.

481
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:33,209
Scott: All right, so star driver This is the show that anime news network will not review yet because it is going to be like Premiering at the anime festival this weekend, right?

482
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:33,892
Scott: Oh, wow.

483
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:36,140
Scott: So but I just watched it on the Internet.

484
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:40,180
Rym: It is funny how they won't review things because obviously then they would have gotten them illegally.

485
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:45,620
Rym: Yeah, yet IMDb has reviews of stuff like months before it comes out and no one cares.

486
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,444
Scott: Yeah It's just.

487
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,640
Scott: it's basically an industry thing.

488
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,138
Scott: Right the company that licensed it asked you not to and so that they will still cooperate with you in the future.

489
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:54,148
Rym: you obey Yep, an anime news network can't?

490
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:55,897
Rym: they're like the AP wire of anime.

491
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,359
Rym: They can't.

492
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,459
Scott: So anyway, I watched this show and the first half of the show, right?

493
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,260
Scott: First of all, it didn't really have any characters that I gave a shit about right?

494
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:05,827
Scott: You didn't have any personalities.

495
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:06,429
Scott: I didn't care about.

496
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,733
Rym: you know, that's been a problem with a lot of anime I watched lately other than a few really big shows.

497
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:22,529
Rym: I liked like der I don't know a lot of anime I start watching like even bakuman was like, alright I don't really care about these characters so but However, the show did have that sort of anime.

498
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:26,260
Scott: cliche of is a bunch of mysterious stuff going on.

499
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,299
Scott: Whoo, don't you wonder what it is?

500
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:38,338
Scott: right, so the beginning of the show is basically these people are this girl and this guy are hanging on a beach and This dude gets washed up on the beach and they save his life and they don't call 911 or anything.

501
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,380
Scott: We bring them to their house where he wakes up and then they're just chatting like normal and like hey, she saved your life.

502
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,439
Scott: Oh, does that count as a kiss?

503
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:46,403
Scott: Whatever?

504
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:54,540
Scott: and then they go to school and the school is a little bit weird and then they sort of reveal to you that yes They're on an island and there's weird stuff on the island.

505
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:03,360
Scott: the guy who washed up on the island is looking for his dad and one of his dad's paintings is hanging in the school and The girl is some sort of magical maiden and his four maidens of the island.

506
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:08,956
Scott: And she asked like she's doing some ritual on the island with a magical seal on her chest.

507
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,239
Scott: is some rune or some shit?

508
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,267
Rym: Wait, wait, is this the show with the?

509
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,900
Rym: because I found a Wikipedia article about star driver kagiyaki no takuto.

510
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:17,746
Scott: This is just our bones.

511
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:18,649
Scott: I don't know.

512
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,632
Scott: it's hated by bones.

513
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:20,214
Scott: I don't know.

514
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:21,117
Scott: I didn't look.

515
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:21,940
Scott: it's just star driver.

516
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,368
Scott: Anyway, so it's just they set up.

517
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,471
Rym: Yeah, this is the same show.

518
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,180
Rym: So there's that includes the galactic pretty boy the ginga.

519
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,923
Rym: That's the show.

520
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:29,506
Scott: That's the show.

521
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,700
Rym: Yeah, so it gives you reeks of DNA angel.

522
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,350
Rym: So first no DNA squared not DNA.

523
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,675
Scott: So first is mysterious.

524
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:37,799
Scott: You don't know what's going on.

525
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:45,360
Scott: Then they set up all these supernatural mysteries, right and then basically They got the the the guy who washed up on the beach.

526
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,738
Scott: He's in the dorms and he goes to this meet that the dorm meeting where the.

527
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:54,193
Scott: you know The the RA is basically explaining the rules of the dorms Like don't go on the girls floor and that kind of shit.

528
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,280
Rym: and how to join the fight club.

529
00:32:55,673 --> 00:33:00,480
Scott: Yeah And then one while the guy actually the guy in the boxing club is trying to convince them to join the boxing club.

530
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,798
Scott: Yeah, and then right they freaking it's like alright and don't go to the abandoned gold mine.

531
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:07,460
Scott: It's dangerous.

532
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:09,873
Scott: Next scene he's going to be banning gold mine.

533
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,160
Scott: He goes in the gold mine.

534
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:14,279
Scott: There's giant robots and ridiculous shit down there and you know what?

535
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,049
Scott: Every character pretty much knows everything.

536
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,059
Scott: the maiden girl knows everything that's going on.

537
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,233
Scott: You know the red-haired guy the guy who washed up on the beach.

538
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:23,720
Scott: He knows how to pilot a robot.

539
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,460
Scott: He's all up in his business, right and they basically eliminate all these mysteries, right?

540
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,273
Scott: It's like all these people know the business and they're fighting right off.

541
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:37,676
Scott: right and there's a robot fight Down in the gold mine, this is all in episode one episode one, right?

542
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:39,192
Scott: I could take this What do you mean?

543
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,744
Scott: They just leave all these men.

544
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,258
Scott: the end that red-haired guy is the galactic pretty boy and he's told and is he?

545
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,799
Scott: that is the Kind of persona you don't have for the main guy.

546
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,048
Scott: It's a persona for a side guy, you know.

547
00:33:49,068 --> 00:34:02,680
Rym: now at the same time and this is part of the only mystery I don't like Bakuman that much but we'll get to that because I hate it lately when you have the main character Who's really generic or doesn't have like a really strong thing about them?

548
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:04,957
Rym: Because then I just don't care about them at all.

549
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,168
Rym: star driver Was like the extreme.

550
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:16,552
Scott: the only thing star driver had going for it was the fact that it had the cliche of mysteries stuff and then they sort of threw all the mysteries away.

551
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:17,998
Scott: except for where's this guy's dad?

552
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:19,792
Scott: and Basically all the characters?

553
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:20,540
Scott: none of that.

554
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:28,379
Scott: usually you need that one character who is also doesn't know anything that's going on that you can identify with and you discover what's Going on along with that character.

555
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:32,672
Scott: But this show all the characters know everything and only one guy was acting like.

556
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:43,259
Scott: he didn't know but he knows and you're now you're The viewer and you're the only one who doesn't really know everything But all the characters know everything or at least they know a whole lot more than you do and you're just like what the fuck?

557
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,120
Rym: Did you at least care about the answers to all these mysteries only because they were mysteries and I'm just naturally curious?

558
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,596
Scott: They didn't give me any reason to care.

559
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,759
Rym: So it's a situation where you watch a couple episodes give up

560
00:34:55,502 --> 00:35:13,000
Scott: Some guys who are up to evil magic and they're doing something that hurts the maidens or whatever and the other guy they're trying to Unlock some evil power on the island or some typical anime bullshit and the other the other people I guess are trying to prevent them From doing evil with the magical powers of the island and his dad is somewhere secret and involved and that's it.

561
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,019
Scott: Wow, and his robots in there somewhere.

562
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:18,067
Rym: so Yosuga no, sorry.

563
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:20,758
Rym: Ah, okay it opened to the.

564
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:24,816
Rym: you know There have been shows like kuji BK unbalanced where they're a joke show.

565
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:29,240
Scott: you get like the joke Unbalanced is part of another show, right?

566
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:41,180
Rym: I know but exactly you get off but when you're watching that it reeks of being a joke show like it's so cliche Or there's something so just messed up about it that you know, like alright, this is the joke show part of the real show.

567
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,199
Rym: The beginning of the show looked like that.

568
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:52,200
Rym: It was like a girl in this really elaborate dress with silver hair and this kid who with also with silver hair and they're sitting On like a bus or a train going somewhere

569
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:52,903
Scott: Okay,

570
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:57,080
Rym: and it seemed like such a cliche that it almost couldn't have been a real show.

571
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,133
Rym: But then that really was the show and it had creepy incest vibes.

572
00:36:01,715 --> 00:36:03,220
Rym: Okay, really creepy incest vibes.

573
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,185
Scott: Well, what did you find out?

574
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,753
Scott: where these two silver-haired people siblings?

575
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:06,839
Scott: Yep, real nugger.

576
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:10,331
Scott: now It's not the typical anime trick of their their steps up there.

577
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,956
Rym: They're twins twins.

578
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:12,458
Scott: Okay.

579
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:16,120
Rym: Wow So I'm thinking alright, this is edging into creepy line.

580
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,320
Scott: Was it like kiss excess where they're like, you know groping his boner or whatever?

581
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:25,440
Rym: No, because that was almost stupid and humorous enough to not be immediately repulsive.

582
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:30,039
Scott: Well, I think the reason it was repulsive was because they actually made it sort of graphic, right?

583
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,167
Rym: It was at the same time.

584
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:32,740
Scott: They were to let more the animation.

585
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,935
Rym: they could have made it more humorous, but at the same time it didn't give off this like in Incredibly creepy vibe that this show gave off it.

586
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:44,936
Scott: basically, you know Yeah, kiss exists is basically love Hina but even more perverted kind of vibe.

587
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,177
Scott: So

588
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:53,680
Rym: going through this They one by one introduce a just panoply of female characters with giant breasts and there's like every stereotype in the world

589
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:58,568
Scott: It's a quiet girl the strong girl They really excited energetic girl

590
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:02,080
Rym: the one girl with like the shrine outfit who also has a ho gay.

591
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:07,659
Rym: Yeah, and they say and they're all like fondling each other and it nothing's really perverted.

592
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:17,520
Rym: yet It's just except for big boobs and fondling each other not directly fondling fondling like oh, let me smell your perfume Blah-blah-blah, you know the same kind of anime bullshit that happens all the time, okay.

593
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:21,400
Rym: So I start skipping through to see all right, the show's giving me a creepy vibe.

594
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,016
Rym: let's see if it's just porn or what's going on.

595
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:27,020
Rym: and Yet it crossed the incest line less than halfway through the episode.

596
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,501
Scott: Like did.

597
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:30,270
Scott: was it just implying the incest or was there actual?

598
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:43,300
Rym: there's brother-sister kissing and then I skipped and the cliffhanger Like the way siblings kiss or no, they were kissing the way siblings kiss in utana, okay So it's okay for incest to be in utana.

599
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:44,602
Rym: You know what?

600
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:48,759
Rym: Yeah, because the moral of incest in utana was yeah not working out so well for you.

601
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:49,000
Rym: Is it?

602
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,201
Scott: So is this show like pro incest this show I Didn't.

603
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:58,600
Rym: I've run into all these shows doing zero research whatsoever.

604
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,492
Scott: Are you sure they're not cousins or they're not gonna reveal that they're not actually?

605
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,300
Scott: or did no one like breaks up there?

606
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,190
Rym: I'm pretty sure they are siblings having sex or are about to have sex.

607
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:18,096
Rym: I Yes, it was based on a porn game and but they actually left the porn in.

608
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:18,900
Rym: they left all the party.

609
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,325
Scott: It's not like that your heart.

610
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:25,985
Rym: anime was cute because it took all the porn out and was basically just kind of a dumb Comedy about dating.

611
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:30,340
Scott: Yeah, or what's that other with a fantasy one that was based on a porn game where they took the porn out?

612
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,570
Scott: Oh, well, there was the ass the guy wearing the mask.

613
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,535
Rym: Oh to water a room.

614
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:33,856
Rym: Oh, no.

615
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:37,540
Rym: Yeah that one Yeah, but that had the problem of the generic main male character.

616
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:39,163
Scott: Yeah What is up with this?

617
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:39,786
Scott: porn games?

618
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:43,586
Scott: having plots good enough that they can take out the porn and make a show Except this one.

619
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:48,900
Rym: the plot as far as I can tell is hey, dude You want to have sex with your sister, you know, there is totally okay.

620
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,137
Scott: There are a lot of animes out there based on the porn games, right?

621
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,029
Scott: So Let me ask something are there.

622
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,360
Scott: has there ever been an anime based on a porn game?

623
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,780
Scott: That was actually like not just good but really good like wow, that was a really really worthwhile.

624
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:04,326
Scott: Has that ever happened?

625
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:05,692
Rym: Has there ever been a porn game?

626
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:07,180
Rym: That was really really worthwhile.

627
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:18,538
Scott: I Was gonna say said five, oh no way I got one customers revenge.

628
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:22,052
Rym: Not beat him and eat him.

629
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:27,080
Scott: I Could come up with a few more if I have to anyway.

630
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:29,849
Scott: No, wait, that was a customer.

631
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,400
Scott: revenge doesn't count because there's never an anime.

632
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:35,840
Rym: What amazed me was how lush the animation was because I remember running into this problem.

633
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,431
Scott: You know hentai's always have the best animators.

634
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,620
Scott: Yes, that's what they make all the money.

635
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,069
Rym: What's the one that Daryl Surratt was talking about?

636
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:47,654
Scott: where that the crazy guy and Gerald I think was talking about it Where the one guy drew every frame completely over many years by hand.

637
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:56,487
Rym: Yeah ridiculous like that Yeah, but I remember before like when I was a freshman at RIT a friend of mine and I we uh, we found these Screenshots from an anime.

638
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:57,230
Rym: We didn't know what it was.

639
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:57,592
Rym: We're like.

640
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,740
Rym: it looked like this awesome fantasy thing.

641
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:05,268
Scott: it looked like it looked really really beautiful and I was trying to remember what the name of it.

642
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,272
Scott: words were.

643
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:07,096
Scott: Yeah words are hurt.

644
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:12,919
Rym: Yeah Then we're like, alright, let's see if we can find the anime and yeah, it was actually a porn game.

645
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:13,802
Scott: Oh, look at that.

646
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:14,224
Rym: Uh-huh.

647
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:17,916
Scott: Pretty horrifying for him, but there's such good pictures of it with that.

648
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:21,730
Rym: We're not in porn parts Yeah, but then there was like the skeleton dude.

649
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,493
Scott: Yeah skeletons.

650
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:23,055
Scott: Awesome.

651
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,380
Scott: Yeah, I have a lot of bones.

652
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,332
Rym: I think the skeleton dude was involved in the porn.

653
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:27,559
Scott: who's involved in the bones?

654
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:38,184
Rym: It bothers me that if I don't do research If I don't do research before watching like whatever's on TV in America I'm gonna get it worse.

655
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:40,030
Rym: some like crappy pop show.

656
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:45,250
Rym: if I don't do my research before I watch whatever anime is out Well granted it's gonna be at 3 a.m.

657
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:45,632
Scott: Right?

658
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:53,858
Scott: You're not watching TV at this hour Yeah, but only nerds TiVo and shit true, but at the same time it is Russian roulette kids at 3 a.m.

659
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,988
Scott: Sure, it's ramen.

660
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:57,816
Scott: It's rams Russian roulette in the u.s.

661
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:02,955
Rym: To Who even watches TV at 3 a.m They have like their people with no lives or insomnia.

662
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:05,543
Rym: now cuz they've got YouTube There there's.

663
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:11,680
Rym: there's so many porn and or kitten-in-a-cup videos on the internet that there's no reason to watch TV at 3 a.m.

664
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:14,959
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so I watched that panty stocking show, right?

665
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:22,020
Scott: And the first thing I noticed about the panty stocking show was that basically one of the characters is this pet dog, right?

666
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,046
Scott: It's a green thing.

667
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:25,260
Scott: and I was like they just stole that from invader-zim.

668
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,367
Scott: Alright, it's it's straight up.

669
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:27,970
Scott: I mean look at that.

670
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,035
Scott: They just straight-up stole Scott.

671
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:30,000
Rym: Did you ever watch invader-zim?

672
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,003
Scott: I watched a couple episodes.

673
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,132
Rym: What's the green dogs name girl?

674
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:33,494
Rym: Okay.

675
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:33,916
Rym: Okay.

676
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:34,920
Scott: It's got the zipper on the front.

677
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,740
Rym: Yeah, yeah, cuz he's actually a robot, right?

678
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,290
Scott: So anyway, so I'm like, wow, they just ripped that off.

679
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:45,869
Scott: and you know stylistically the whole show was actually a little bit Invader-zim ish and I was like what the fuck.

680
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:59,672
Scott: so I went to anime news network and I saw this Posting where they actually asked jonan vasquez about panty and stocking and he and I will quote I will read the quote from the anime news network article exactly and fully Dot dot dot took ger out of the whorehouse.

681
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:01,380
Scott: He was working in and gave him a new job.

682
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:06,900
Scott: It's nice seeing him get some work But I got to say it's a bit on the simple side for my taste What with the fart and shit jokes?

683
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,988
Scott: But the ending is pretty ridiculous and guy next produces some of the only Japanese animation I can stand without wishing I was the drinking type.

684
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,479
Scott: So I'm looking forward to more.

685
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:22,042
Scott: He also says Seems a little underused in the new show, but What's he?

686
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:27,740
Scott: he surmises that it's all the creators can expect from what's left of his mind after all the heroin.

687
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:33,280
Scott: So he's facing easy makes a joke about how ger is all washed up and he's glad he's got a job.

688
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,567
Scott: But you know, he's took.

689
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:35,492
Scott: he was on heroin.

690
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:37,060
Scott: so much that is he's not so good.

691
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,091
Rym: So Scott all I had to go on with panty stocking with garter belt.

692
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:45,062
Rym: is this one like poster from a Japanese Okay.

693
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,125
Scott: So here's what the show's about.

694
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:46,487
Scott: You're ready.

695
00:42:46,988 --> 00:42:49,036
Scott: There's these two girls panty and stocking.

696
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:49,577
Scott: right.

697
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:53,854
Scott: panty Loves to fuck and stocking loves to eat things that are sugary.

698
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:55,399
Rym: This is kind of like dirty pair.

699
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:02,958
Scott: panty is all like hot and you know blonde and like Oh baby and stocking is all gothy and like oh, you know.

700
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,295
Scott: and Garter belt is this priest and he's a big black.

701
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:08,520
Scott: He's like shaft, right?

702
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,339
Scott: He's got a big fro and he's he's in charge.

703
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,267
Scott: Alright so fun to have the pet.

704
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:20,340
Scott: the ger is playing the part of Chuck the dog and Basically, what happens is they need to collect like these heavenly coins to do something.

705
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:23,395
Scott: I think they're angels or some shit made magic powers.

706
00:43:23,415 --> 00:43:23,998
Scott: I don't fucking know.

707
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:32,321
Scott: And the way they collect these heavenly coins is by defeating ghosts and the ghosts are sort of a gatekeepers kind of thing Right.

708
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:43,440
Scott: So in the first episode the ghost that they have to fight is the poop monster and basically they learn that toilets are eating People all around the city and then eventually they go to investigate and panty gets eaten by the toilet.

709
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:45,957
Scott: And then the poop monster comes out and they fight the poop monster.

710
00:43:46,178 --> 00:43:52,380
Scott: Wow And the way they fight the poop monster is panty takes off her panties and her panties turn into a gun.

711
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:54,752
Scott: And I've just a name for the gun, but I forget the name of it.

712
00:43:55,013 --> 00:43:58,812
Rym: Oh, wow looking at that picture That was my sole understanding of this anime.

713
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:00,500
Rym: Yeah panty gun, right?

714
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,299
Scott: so then stocking takes off her stocking and becomes a katana.

715
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:08,871
Scott: and And Then they fight the ghost in some ridiculous action scene.

716
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,340
Scott: and they do this twice per episode because each episode is actually two parts.

717
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:31,840
Scott: It's a lot like a Cartoon Network cartoon, you know Like a Dexter's lab kind of thing right where they do So the first in the first half of the first episode they fight the poop monster and the second half of the first episode The ghost is actually this thing that inhabits vehicles So it starts off in a car and then it switches to a Mack truck and eventually switches to a train.

718
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:34,066
Scott: Right, and they're fighting it the whole way.

719
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:43,811
Scott: and it's basically just this ridiculous action scene with all sorts of sex jokes and poop jokes and pee jokes and All sorts of just lewd crude.

720
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:46,060
Scott: and it's not like disgusting lewd crude.

721
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,470
Scott: It's just sort of shallow ridiculous over-the-top stuff.

722
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:49,631
Scott: Now.

723
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:50,614
Scott: This is not a show.

724
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:53,804
Scott: I think that I would watch Intentionally, like.

725
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:56,340
Scott: I'm not gonna download the episodes and watch it or go out of my way.

726
00:44:56,441 --> 00:45:05,760
Scott: But if I was at an anime club This show would be so ace That people would be rolling in the aisles losing all their poop when they see the poop monster.

727
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,426
Rym: This definitely sounds like one of those shows that were we still running in the RIT anime club We would show this shit, right?

728
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:14,519
Scott: It's an excel saga sort of category, right?

729
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,425
Scott: So It's not the highest brow.

730
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,050
Scott: It's not an anime for the ages.

731
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,560
Scott: It's not even I'd say it's like in terms of staying power.

732
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,780
Scott: It's like a Full Metal Alchemist kind of thing or an Excel saga kind of thing.

733
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:43,155
Scott: But if you're looking for just a crazy, you know Slapping the kind of time, you know, and you got some excited people in a group panty stocking if you're willing to deal with you know, a Little bit of perverted, you know, it's not even perverted with the sex jokes.

734
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,520
Scott: The sex jokes are actually kind of funny.

735
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,920
Scott: It's just like panty likes to get with all these guys and then they make all sorts of you know innuendo.

736
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:50,939
Scott: It's you know, it's actually not that bad.

737
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:57,077
Scott: This is a show that you can reach for, you know, and you know, that's for it's pretty much it it's.

738
00:45:57,479 --> 00:45:57,960
Scott: it's interesting.

739
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,111
Scott: It's not something that you would expect from Gainax.

740
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,223
Scott: It like totally doesn't match, you know There are other.

741
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:05,004
Scott: it's got a little bit of FL CL in it I think.

742
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:11,172
Rym: so speaking of weird shows to show an anime club I think Arakawa under the bridgie bridgie is equally out there.

743
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:13,180
Scott: So you like you like this bridgie bridge.

744
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:16,260
Scott: I like this bridgie bridgie, but remember I like saying bridgie bridge.

745
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:17,446
Scott: We were at.

746
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:30,870
Rym: I don't know where we were but we found that really Weird looking manga the one that had like the priest with a gun and the guy with the starhead And the giant rabbit and like all the crazy one.

747
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,696
Scott: That's just really I'm talking about.

748
00:46:32,776 --> 00:46:34,845
Scott: Yeah, that's this Really?

749
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:35,347
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:36,533
Scott: Oh, she's watching.

751
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:39,405
Rym: I'm like, this is really familiar This is really familiar.

752
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,334
Rym: and then the starhead guy came out and I'm like no way.

753
00:46:42,394 --> 00:46:44,160
Rym: and then the priest came out of the others.

754
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:52,110
Rym: The nun that was actually a dude with the scar comes out and everyone's like sister blah blah blah and he's like Oh shit, it's that thing.

755
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,519
Scott: So why is it bridgey bridgey?

756
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,344
Rym: It's the second.

757
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:58,980
Rym: there was a first season 13 episodes of Arakawa under the bridge.

758
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,000
Scott: Wait, so the show of the crazy manga has been out and we haven't watched it.

759
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:16,998
Rym: Yes And now this is the second season of it and it looks like it's just following the manga because it went through like five Quote-unquote episode numbers through this first episode and each one was like kind of a different story and just kind of went through.

760
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:28,220
Rym: and the Numbers like 105 106 107 108. so the story now that I actually see what's going on here It's about an alien girl that comes down and just lives under a bridge with a bunch of weirdos.

761
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:29,427
Scott: Oh, so she lives.

762
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,599
Scott: her name's Arakawa and she lives under the bridge.

763
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:35,540
Rym: Her name's not Arakawa, but she doesn't live under the bridge the bridge bridge the bridge bridge.

764
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,424
Scott: Why is it the bridge?

765
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:45,000
Rym: because the title of the show is Arakawa under the bridge X bridge Or bridge - and in the show the characters themselves call it the bridgey bridge.

766
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,703
Scott: Are they friend?

767
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,254
Scott: Oh even so even in the first season they say bridgey bridge.

768
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:49,700
Rym: I don't think they did in the first season.

769
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:50,903
Rym: I think there's making it.

770
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:52,829
Rym: you'll see the show is very meta.

771
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:55,075
Scott: Are they friendly with hunter x hunter?

772
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:58,966
Rym: I don't think so But I don't know.

773
00:47:58,986 --> 00:47:59,589
Rym: This is just.

774
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:13,416
Rym: it's really really weird Like there's the mayor and he's a kappa but he's clearly just wearing a kappa costume Like a zipper showing okay, and they're all just kind of weird dicks to each other and it's just.

775
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,720
Rym: I Don't know how I can describe this, but I really like it and maybe I'll have to check out the episode.

776
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,885
Rym: I'll say I think you should.

777
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:21,875
Rym: I kind of want to go back and watch the first season.

778
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:22,477
Scott: maybe.

779
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,266
Scott: oh, yeah Maybe I should start with the first season.

780
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:27,280
Scott: See what's he was going on or going on with the bridgey bridge.

781
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:29,879
Rym: Yeah, cuz he kind of jumps right into the business here.

782
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,020
Scott: So if they're if they're referring to the bridgey bridge a lot, they must be hanging out near it a lot in the show.

783
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:35,887
Rym: Well, they trade you'll see.

784
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:36,830
Scott: All right.

785
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:38,356
Scott: Is that I get to say about it?

786
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:39,440
Rym: Yeah, it's all I got to say about it.

787
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,004
Rym: We got to move quick.

788
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,373
Scott: Okay, so bakuman right?

789
00:48:41,393 --> 00:48:42,320
Scott: Let me let me talk about this.

790
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,504
Scott: So bakuman is a manga.

791
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:47,700
Scott: that's that's coming out now from the death note creators same artist same writer.

792
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:48,787
Scott: So that's already a win.

793
00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:51,663
Scott: and the thing that I read the first volume It's already out in English.

794
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:55,655
Scott: and I gotta say I really like this manga because what it is?

795
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:57,340
Scott: a manga about manga, right?

796
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,600
Scott: It's it's got sort of a a cavalier and clay vibe to it.

797
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:05,500
Scott: You know with the with the sort of the way that it's two young kids like we're gonna make comics.

798
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,303
Scott: Yeah, let's do it.

799
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:11,020
Scott: And at the same time though, it teaches you a lot about the actual industry.

800
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:12,910
Scott: They talk about how much money you can.

801
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,915
Rym: he's not a manga guy.

802
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:14,780
Rym: It's just a gambler.

803
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,614
Scott: Yeah, and how hard it is to become, you know an actual manga creator.

804
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:20,160
Scott: and they even talk about like.

805
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:51,290
Scott: You know the tools that you need like the G pens and all this, you know It gets into details of manga about manga or if it gives a lot of information Even though it's a shounen jump thing, you know, it's it's it's pretty interesting and on top of that They sort of a generic school story that sort of reminds me of like, you know Every other anime story of you know, I can't actually you know, just go out with you We're gonna be all shy and blushy and crap and you know that kind of stuff.

806
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,937
Scott: And that's that's pretty much what it's about.

807
00:49:55,078 --> 00:50:14,785
Scott: so this anime of bakuman right the first episode came out And I read that I watched the first episode and it pretty much covers half of the first tanka bond of manga Pretty much directly literally and I think that shows that these two guys They also made death note Which also pretty much directly translated to anime without modification are really good at making manga.

808
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:16,370
Scott: that directly translates to anime without.

809
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,110
Rym: But you know at the same time, I don't know how well they really translate.

810
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:25,530
Rym: I mean, maybe if I had just started watching the death note anime had never seen the manga It might have grown on me.

811
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:31,767
Rym: But watching the anime Having already read the manga was kind of just boring and I just got sick of it and stops really cuz.

812
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:40,313
Scott: I watch the whole episode and while I knew everything that was gonna happen because I had read the manga already and I think I'm gonna stick with the manga over the Anime.

813
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:43,049
Scott: and I'm gonna but for a different reason than you'll think right?

814
00:50:44,232 --> 00:50:55,628
Scott: I thought that the anime actually sort of gave a little bit more Energy because you know with the voice acting and the people actually moving around right, you know They would get a little bit more, you know, it felt like they were more excited, you know.

815
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:58,950
Scott: Or you know their emotions came out a little more than it did in the manga.

816
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:02,430
Rym: See what's weird is I actually got the opposite vibe at least for the main character.

817
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:12,970
Rym: I very I don't know the voice acting and the way they kind of animated him and that whenever he was kind of Moving around and talking and his body posture didn't seem to fit the character that I'd seen

818
00:51:13,392 --> 00:51:24,015
Scott: I actually kind of like the main character because the way he like, you know He come when he especially in that scenery comes back to the school to get his notebook and he's just like, alright, dude Seriously?

819
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,265
Scott: Yeah, I'll just leave you with the notebook.

820
00:51:26,305 --> 00:51:27,370
Scott: You know, he was a lot more.

821
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,588
Scott: You don't see a lot of anime characters doing that sort of having that kind of.

822
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:31,990
Rym: Oh, yeah I like that in the manga.

823
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:41,110
Rym: But in the anime there were a couple of times where his character seemed just like suddenly revert to generic Protagonist for a while and then come back to the character.

824
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,250
Scott: I also liked how they open the show with the opener to the to the uncles anime series.

825
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,702
Scott: You gotta do that right with the superhero.

826
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:56,750
Scott: and then they brought this, you know They actually had that guy Animated and you could actually get a feel for what that manga was like a lot better than you could in the manga version.

827
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:03,792
Scott: now The reason I think I'm gonna stick with the manga over the anime actually is because I know that this isn't its meta knowledge Right.

828
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:06,204
Scott: This is an anime series the bakuman manga.

829
00:52:06,244 --> 00:52:07,430
Scott: I don't believe is done.

830
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,448
Scott: I'll have to research that.

831
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:16,490
Scott: Therefore is this anime going to continue to faithfully adapt the manga to the end or will it stop or will it change and divert?

832
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,105
Scott: I don't know and the manga was already so good.

833
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:19,850
Scott: I'll just stick with that.

834
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,772
Scott: So I know that I get the full real deal with no historically I mean look at what happened to Fullmetal Alchemist Exactly.

835
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:31,710
Scott: So I'm you know, while they the thing is when they animated Death Note They did it after many volumes of Death Note were out.

836
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:40,845
Scott: I'm not sure how many bakuman volumes are out and if I'm gonna look it up and if every volume of bakuman is out or It's nearly done then I know that the anime is probably safe to watch and I'll.

837
00:52:40,966 --> 00:52:41,930
Scott: maybe I'll go that way.

838
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:43,830
Scott: But I've already got volume one of the manga.

839
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:48,730
Scott: So if there's any doubt, I'll just stick with the safe manga bet because it's basically identical.

840
00:52:49,051 --> 00:52:53,420
Rym: See, I'm going with the manga more because I feel like it was made as a manga and it works as a manga.

841
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:55,135
Rym: Being an anime.

842
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:58,250
Rym: at least this particular show did not add much for me.

843
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,819
Scott: Well, the thing is I'm sort of two minds about it, right?

844
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:07,730
Scott: Because on the one hand it's a manga about people trying to be Right, so that manga about a manga thing really works.

845
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:12,202
Scott: Yo dog, I heard you like manga exactly but at the same time right there.

846
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:22,090
Scott: ultimate goal is to have their manga become animated right and then Have the girl voice acted so to have an anime about.

847
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,639
Scott: You know a manga adapted into an anime.

848
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:30,240
Scott: to have an anime about a manga being adapted to an anime That is itself a manga adapted to an anime.

849
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:38,165
Scott: is he could have this other Thing going on right with that extra double meta level double.

850
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:50,737
Scott: I heard you like meta in your meta So I put meta meta in your meta meta dog Right, but at the same time I guess my trouble was just that watching it felt Slower and full of less energy than the manga.

851
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:52,262
Rym: at least in my watching.

852
00:53:52,282 --> 00:53:55,466
Scott: the pace of it was definitely slower because I can read through a manga right.

853
00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:02,016
Scott: I read that one volume in less time than it took to watch this episode and the episode only covered half of the material in that volume.

854
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:12,370
Rym: and also like I said I feel like the main character was going off Character and many of the times where he would move around like his body language Didn't fit the image I had when I was reading them.

855
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,900
Scott: I thought I felt like it was pretty literal.

856
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:18,324
Rym: the other thing is a couple of times He would like get really Shinji ish for just a second or like.

857
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:26,710
Scott: the other thing is that two lines I really need to see right through the the next sort of major plot point to really judge the anime like how they portray.

858
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:28,736
Scott: You know them getting the.

859
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:31,485
Scott: I don't have a spoiler because it's in the first volume of the manga.

860
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:36,107
Rym: is it a spoiler that Takumi wins the first race in an initial D.

861
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:38,740
Scott: No No, it's that you know their parents right.

862
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,860
Scott: when he goes to ask his parents if he can become a mangaka They're like, yeah go do it and then they give him the uncle's studio.

863
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:45,948
Rym: See that's crazy cuz that never happens.

864
00:54:46,189 --> 00:54:46,590
Rym: every anime.

865
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,356
Scott: It's always like I want to die.

866
00:54:48,396 --> 00:54:54,255
Scott: No, that's why you have to go be sort of an early spoiler Right, but you know the when.

867
00:54:54,296 --> 00:55:06,000
Scott: I want to see how that part is portrayed in the anime because that's the part where the manga Sort of shifts to being very talky and death note style where they're in the studio Just talking about making manga all the time.

868
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,145
Scott: Like no you have to do this.

869
00:55:07,165 --> 00:55:07,828
Rym: That's my worry.

870
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:08,270
Rym: What did death?

871
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,134
Scott: No, I don't want to see how.

872
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:09,920
Rym: why did death note?

873
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,370
Rym: do it show light?

874
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:15,219
Rym: Talking and play music in the background and pan over stuff.

875
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,010
Scott: Yeah, I want to see how the anime portrays those scenes.

876
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:21,744
Rym: Them like drawing and writing while they talk.

877
00:55:21,764 --> 00:55:22,770
Rym: cuz that'll be really boring.

878
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:30,719
Scott: I would be really boring and that's why I wanted they need to see that part of the story unfold to determine which Medium is really better for this story.

879
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:32,988
Rym: See what I would do is keep cutting.

880
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:33,791
Rym: This is just me I've.

881
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:39,610
Rym: no I doubt this is what they do is when whenever they're talking about if they're talking about like what they're writing or what?

882
00:55:40,072 --> 00:55:45,770
Rym: They're doing Show like on the screen instead of showing like their characters talking writing in the room or whatever.

883
00:55:46,151 --> 00:55:51,193
Rym: Show like the sketches crudely animated and getting more refined as they go and like keep showing the scenes They're writing.

884
00:55:51,313 --> 00:55:52,178
Rym: Yeah, well stuff like that.

885
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:54,650
Rym: Yeah, that's the only way you could get me to watch the anime.

886
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,056
Rym: Otherwise, I'll just read the manga.

887
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:56,478
Rym: Yeah.

888
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:59,070
Scott: Anyway, it's it's you know, it's a good manga real good.

889
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,073
Scott: At least volume one is.

890
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:05,247
Scott: so so should definitely if you do one of the other at least, you know pick one.

891
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:06,009
Rym: so mm.

892
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,673
Rym: Exclamation point.

893
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:15,890
Scott: I downloaded it and I clicked on it and then I just sort of fast-forwarded through it and I saw like 10 seconds of Animation and I closed it because I was tired fast-forwarded through too.

894
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:20,730
Rym: So the subtitles never weren't really displaying because I wasn't catching like the start times on them.

895
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,646
Scott: I just I just got tired and I said fuck it.

896
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,049
Scott: I'm going to bed.

897
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:26,642
Rym: So I went all the way through, you know what the show is about what it's about.

898
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:27,926
Rym: It's about masochism.

899
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,519
Rym: Oh Yeah, it makes a lot more sense.

900
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:31,162
Scott: Why doesn't?

901
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:32,329
Scott: why didn't they call it SM?

902
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,190
Rym: Cuz he's just a masochist and that the girl is the sadist.

903
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,240
Rym: She's just indifferent and thinks he's kind of lame.

904
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:39,947
Scott: but it's about two masochists.

905
00:56:39,968 --> 00:56:42,301
Scott: No one Why don't you just call it M?

906
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:43,850
Rym: the dude is a masochist.

907
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:51,350
Rym: I guess it's already something called him and he goes and This girl just beats him with a baseball bat and as far as I can tell that is the entire plot.

908
00:56:51,732 --> 00:56:52,214
Scott: He likes it.

909
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:53,921
Rym: Yeah, but he doesn't want to like it.

910
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:55,929
Rym: He wants to not be a masochist anymore.

911
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:57,556
Scott: So I so he likes.

912
00:56:57,576 --> 00:57:00,729
Rym: it was like trying to get her to disavow him of his masochism.

913
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:03,777
Scott: Dude, the same way you get rid of anything else.

914
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:08,110
Scott: You don't want it's not cold turkey to quote DMC.

915
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:09,954
Rym: I'm a masochist.

916
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:14,268
Scott: Yeah, of course, but he the guy in DMC was a masochist was all about.

917
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:15,150
Scott: he didn't want to get rid of It.

918
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:15,914
Scott: he loved himself.

919
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,380
Scott: He was like, yeah, he's like fuck.

00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,164
Scott: Yeah masochism.

921
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:19,430
Scott: All right, let's stick with it.

922
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,642
Rym: But watching the show, you know, it was like, all right.

926
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:36,322
Rym: It's almost like this some kind of masochism show and Emily who could actually understand because there were no subtitles I'm skipping through is like yeah, he's a masochist.
