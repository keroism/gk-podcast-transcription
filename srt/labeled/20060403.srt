1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,929
Scott: It's Monday April 3rd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,100
Scott: Tonight is the long-awaited episode about monitor technology.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,357
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,832
Rym: So over the weekend we hit Gaming for Hope up at Marist College.

5
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:26,120
Scott: Which is much better than expected.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,179
Rym: Yes, it was definitely at least on par with the types of events we were used to back at RIT.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,860
Scott: Yeah, and it was 90% well organized much more than you know usual for these sorts of things.

8
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,540
Rym: Yeah, we got free pizza not once, but twice.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,020
Scott: Two times free pizza, and two times they brought exactly enough for everyone there.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,720
Rym: Not only- I mean the only thing that was really wrong with it was that the Mario Tennis Doubles tournament, one of the reasons we went, was canceled.

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,980
Scott: That's okay because we got to just leave because it wasn't gonna happen.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,340
Rym: Yep, but we'll have our coverage of that tomorrow on gaming day.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,660
Scott: Because it was mostly gaming of all sorts.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,197
Rym: Yep.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,700
Rym: Now also yesterday, Sunday, I did something kind of crazy and dangerous, and I thought I'd tell all of you.

16
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,300
Rym: So you can possibly emulate and not sue when you hurt yourselves.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,860
Rym: Now, I've mentioned it before, but we live in Beacon.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,499
Rym: And outside my bedroom window is Mount Beacon.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,680
Rym: Which is a 1500 foot small mountain that was used in the Revolutionary War by George Washington and various other things.

20
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:38,440
Rym: And at the top of it, at the very peak, it's the highest point in the area, is this 60 or 70 foot tall rickety ass, like 20 years of unmaintained, horrible, weather-worn, iron-rusting mass of a tower.

21
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:50,399
Rym: And I got in my head, I climbed the mountain, and I got up there, and then I climbed that tower, and it was rickety and scary, and I was kind of worried that the wind was gonna knock the damn thing over, but it didn't.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,075
Scott: It hadn't been knocked over yet.

23
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,640
Rym: See, that was my logic.

24
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,020
Rym: It didn't fall in the last 10 years of disrepair.

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,620
Rym: It wasn't gonna fall yesterday.

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,178
Scott: Well, maybe just no one had been on it for 10 years, in which case, uhh.

27
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:12,440
Rym: So I climbed this thing, and I eventually got to the top, and the cool thing is, from the top of that tower, in Beacon here, I could see very clearly the skyline of New York City, which I thought was kind of cool.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,540
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's, New York City's real tall, mountains real tall, not much in between.

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,979
Rym: Yeah, just about 70 miles of other smaller mountains.

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,920
Scott: No fog, no low clouds, you're all good.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:25,651
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,799
Rym: Now, the one thing, the startling thing was, one, the wind up there.

33
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:34,080
Rym: If you've never been on top of a tall, tallish thing, the wind just doesn't stop.

34
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,299
Rym: It's just this constant stream of howling wind.

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,660
Scott: That's pretty typical.

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,360
Scott: I mean, whenever you see videos of like Everest or anything, it's just sideways snow all the time.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,700
Rym: And two, once I got up there, and I was looking at the skyline, and you're kind of thinking about what I would do if the thing suddenly tipped over on me, and the answer to that question was die.

38
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,540
Scott: Maybe just severely injured.

39
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,420
Rym: Yeah, well, it's at the peak of a mountain, like literally the peak, like a big rock on top of the mountain.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,460
Rym: So I would have fallen much further than the height of the tower had the thing fallen over.

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,579
Scott: That's true, but if you didn't die, the helicopter would have come to get you.

42
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,378
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah, I had my cell phone with me.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,780
Scott: Yep.

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,198
Rym: And I got signal up there.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Scott: Well, it's hard not to get signal on top of a fucking mountain, because it's line of sight.

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,778
Scott: So you got line of sight to every cell tower within...

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,279
Rym: In fact, my cell tower was below me, I could see it.

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,177
Scott: Oh, there you go.

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,860
Rym: But the other thing I noticed up there that also frightened me a bit was that the top of the tower was riddled in bullet holes.

50
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:31,300
Scott: Really?

51
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:38,120
Rym: Well, you can see this tower from like all around the valley and all the everywhere, all these hills and trails and houses.

52
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:41,320
Rym: And I think hunters just take potshots at it when they're drunk and bored.

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,578
Scott: It could be.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,840
Scott: Are there a lot of hunters out there?

55
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:44,378
Rym: Yes.

56
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:45,899
Scott: Yeah, did you see some?

57
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:46,859
Rym: I didn't see any now.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,460
Rym: It's not really hunting season.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,939
Scott: Oh, you better be careful that they don't shoot you.

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,480
Rym: Oh, you realize that I have a blaze orange that I wear whenever I run in the woods.

61
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,140
Rym: In hunting season.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,560
Rym: But anyway, that's my story.

63
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,240
Rym: I didn't die.

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,834
Rym: I'm still here.

65
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:01,098
Scott: Damn it.

66
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:11,800
Rym: But anyway, in the news, for a long time, a lot of people have been pushing both for and against the dot xxx top level domain for DNS.

67
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,259
Rym: So instead of, you know, naked lesbians dot com, you'd have naked lesbians dot xxx.

68
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,759
Scott: I'm for and against this.

69
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:21,375
Rym: Yeah.

70
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:29,439
Rym: Now the thing is, the people who are for it, as in they want this to become a domain, don't want it to be a domain just so it's easy to find porn.

71
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:31,320
Rym: In fact, they want just the opposite.

72
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:40,259
Rym: They want the xxx domain and then they want laws requiring anything that is quote unquote pornographic to be there and not be anywhere else.

73
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,399
Scott: See, this is the thing.

74
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:53,439
Scott: I don't mind if, you know, I wouldn't mind if all the porn was on xxx because it makes it easier for the people who want to find it to find it and it makes it, you know, so people who don't want to look at it don't have to look at it.

75
00:04:53,861 --> 00:05:01,919
Scott: The problem is, is any law requiring the porn to be on xxx gets really tricky and shady and first amendment-ish.

76
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,480
Rym: I mean, it really comes down to the Supreme Court.

77
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:16,799
Rym: I mean, the Supreme Court is the only entity that has ever defined what porn is and they've basically defined it as an ephemeral thing that depends on the standards of the community in which the item is looked at.

78
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,500
Rym: That doesn't work on the internet when you can see it anywhere.

79
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:28,800
Scott: Yeah, what if I start a crazy Muslim community in New York and we decide that, you know, a picture of a woman's foot is pornographic?

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,119
Scott: Well, now every site with a woman's foot has to be on xxx.

81
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,099
Scott: Yeah, this is why it's no good.

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,597
Rym: Yeah, now the scary thing is the Christian right is very strongly both for and against this.

83
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,519
Rym: I mean, half of them want it because they want all the porn to be there.

84
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,800
Rym: Half of them are against it because they're afraid that if it happens, it means that porn is legitimized somehow or endorsed.

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,240
Scott: Yeah, the only way I could see this flying... See, I wouldn't mind if they made the domain.

86
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,700
Scott: I have no problem with that because that would just, you know, and you say nothing can be in the domain unless it's porn.

87
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,380
Scott: That's fine.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Rym: Or just make it a domain like everything else.

89
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,615
Rym: I mean, .org generally means organization, nonprofit, but there's no law that says you have to be.

90
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,260
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

91
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:26,240
Scott: The only thing is that, you know, the purpose of having the domain would be to protect people who, well, not to protect people, but to allow people who don't want to look at, you know, naked people or xxx screwing so they don't have to.

92
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,480
Rym: It's really easy to not look at pornography.

93
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,839
Rym: You simply don't look at it.

94
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:40,580
Scott: Yeah, see what the problem is is those people who don't know how to use the internet and they have Internet Explorer and they have a bunch of whatnots and then all of a sudden, you know, pop-ups come with boobs and God knows what.

95
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,320
Rym: Yeah, you know what, I don't want to sound like one of those ivory tower geeks, but that's not the domain systems problem.

96
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,680
Rym: That's your problem running Internet Explorer.

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,060
Rym: That's Internet Explorer's problem not working properly.

98
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:04,680
Scott: It is, but at the same time, you know, if we set up the little domain thing, then it just makes everything easier because those people would install little pieces of software that would just block anything from an xxx domain and they'd be set.

99
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,339
Rym: Yeah, but almost every porn site would probably also have a more legitimate, well-known domain anyway.

100
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,640
Scott: Yeah, yeah, oh well.

101
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:17,240
Rym: I mean, there's really, I'd like to see it happen just because it'd be another useful top-level domain, but I don't see it actually happening.

102
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,380
Rym: But anyway, that's not the news.

103
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,820
Rym: People have been pushing for this for the last, I don't know, decade.

104
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,252
Scott: Yeah, well there's the idiot port.

105
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:25,260
Scott: what guy.

106
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,140
Rym: Oh God, we talked about him a while ago.

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Scott: That guy's an idiot.

108
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:38,038
Rym: But anyway, the news is that ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, these are the people who decide basically how all these sorts of things work and how they all fly.

109
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,519
Rym: There's a lot of debate.

110
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,580
Scott: At least when it comes to DNS.

111
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:42,700
Rym: Yeah, and various other things.

112
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,616
Rym: Anything involving "assigned names and

113
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,079
Rym: numbers."

114
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,720
Rym: So they also have a say in how IP blocks work and everything.

115
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,300
Rym: We're not going to talk about how it works on a direct level because it's complicated how the Internet's run.

116
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,177
Rym: And in fact, there's a big controversy going on as the EU- Controversy?

117
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:06,200
Rym: Yes, the EU wants to take over DNS, or part of it, and take over a lot of Internet functions that they think the US has a monopoly on.

118
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,399
Rym: And the US, well, gave him the finger and there's- As they well should.

119
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:09,758
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,440
Rym: But anyway, the news is that ICANN said the XXX domain is useless, stupid, and done, and they won't consider it this time around.

121
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,019
Scott: Uh, well, maybe next time.

122
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,659
Scott: It'll be easier to find the prongs.

123
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:29,440
Rym: Yeah, well, the article I read, and I haven't read other articles on it, implied that the reason they turned it down was because of complaints from the Christian right.

124
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:30,737
Scott: Uh-huh.

125
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:39,818
Rym: And the article implied that that is more cause for Europe to take over the Internet because the Americans are xenophobic and afraid of pornography and controversial things.

126
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,000
Rym: I'm not sure.

127
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:46,240
Rym: I mean, I don't think ICANN thought it through that far.

128
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,099
Scott: I don't think ICANN thought it through that far.

129
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Rym: I don't think ICANN gives one shit either way, frankly.

130
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,440
Scott: ICANN cares about assigning the names and numbers properly.

131
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,560
Scott: That's what they care about.

132
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,080
Rym: Oh, they also care about being horribly corrupt and, you know, all that sort of thing.

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,320
Scott: They're not as corrupt as the way it was done before.

134
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:01,978
Rym: No, they're not.

135
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,679
Rym: I'll give them that.

136
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,070
Scott: That's the best I can say about ICANN.

137
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,520
Scott: is that what we had before we had ICANN was corrupt.

138
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,939
Scott: Though, actually-- Like Verisign?

139
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,219
Scott: Or no, it was Network... What's-his-name.

140
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:14,178
Rym: You know what?

141
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,058
Rym: You know what?

142
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,640
Rym: We should save this and do another Monday episode on how the Internet works on that level, all the organizations that control the various bits of it.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,359
Scott: How the DNS stuff works, yeah.

144
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,358
Rym: Yeah, 'cause I don't think a lot of people outside of the geek world really know that, and they'll hear things like, "Oh, ICANN did this," or "ITAR did this," and they have no idea what it all is.

145
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:33,394
Scott: Or the IEEE.

146
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,336
Scott: All right.

147
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:36,566
Scott: So, Microsoft.

148
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:39,088
Scott: Woo?

149
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:40,600
Scott: No, not really.

150
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:48,377
Scott: They have a piece of software called Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2, and it's due out early next year.

151
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:48,684
Rym: R2?

152
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,980
Scott: I guess it's revision two of Microsoft Virtual Server.

153
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:54,278
Rym: Open all the-- Yeah.

154
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,838
Scott: Open all the trash compactors on the detention level, R2.

155
00:09:59,342 --> 00:09:59,793
Scott: Oh my god!

156
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:03,400
Scott: Okay, anyway.

157
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:07,478
Scott: So Microsoft Virtual Server-- You see that?

158
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
Rym: Scott knew what I was-- I didn't even say my joke.

159
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,881
Scott: 2005 D2.

160
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,108
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,919
Scott: In case I can't let this joke go.

162
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:14,679
Scott: All right.

163
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,340
Scott: Oh my god, the word "spaceballs" is in this article.

164
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,000
Rym: We're done.

165
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:22,899
Scott: I'm not even joking, it's right there.

166
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,778
Rym: Why does it say "spaceballs"?

167
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:32,038
Scott: "Given these moves, we're reminded of the scene from 'Spaceballs,' and Lord Helmet orders an underling to thrust his ship from light speed to ludicrous

168
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:32,279
Scott: speed.".

169
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,659
Rym: Okay, what's the actual news here?

170
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:48,860
Scott: The news is that Microsoft Virtual Server, which is this piece of software that basically lets you run a bunch of Windows servers on one physical computer, is going to support running Linux in that next R2D2 version.

171
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,280
Rym: You know, if I could use that at work right now, that would be fantastic, because-- It's not free, of course.

172
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,651
Scott: Whatever.

173
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,600
Scott: But they will actually support running Linux on it.

174
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:10,339
Scott: If you decide to install Virtual Server, install an XP, a 2003, two 2000s, and two Linuxes, they'll hook you up if you call them for help and you paid for it.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,279
Rym: See, now, that's a really good thing.

176
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,326
Scott: Yeah.

177
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:27,559
Rym: I mean, partly, especially from me, a sysadmin point of view, that there are a lot of services that I want to run that are only easy or good to run on Linux, but due to idiots above me, I am forced to run Windows servers.

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,060
Scott: Now, hey, the other thing is Microsoft was actually planning to bring it out this year, but they've delayed pretty much everything, including Vista and all.

179
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,870
Scott: Oh, yeah, this will probably be able to do something with Vista, too, so you can have like a Vista and a 2000 and a Linux.

180
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,346
Scott: Ah.

181
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,519
Scott: Also, VMware, which provides a, you know, software that does the exact same thing as Microsoft Virtual Server.

182
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:55,860
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people use it in school when you have to-- especially in IT, when you have to set up a network of like 10 computers.

183
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,720
Rym: Instead, you'll have two computers running VMware and just emulate a whole bunch of PCs.

184
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Scott: Yeah, so VMware released a free VMware player, kind of like the Acrobat Reader is free, you know, it can only read, it can't create, and what that does is it lets you make images, which are kind of like ISO files, but different, and you can run those in VMware.

185
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,600
Scott: So VMware used to cost a lot of money, but recently they made it so that you can run images for free, but you couldn't make the images.

186
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:53,539
Scott: Well, people quickly found out how to make images and they've been making them, but now VMware is opening up officially the image format, which means they'll probably be a bunch of open source tools to allow you to make images soon, which, you know, VMware isn't making as much money as it used to because of stuff like Microsoft Virtual Server and this other company that I forget the name of, but I think they're going to get a lot of share with this, as in people using VMware instead, but they're not going to get a lot of money because no one has a reason to pay them anything.

187
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,140
Rym: Yeah, but I got to say, once I get my new fast computer, I would very much like to run a Windows in a little box so I could play my Windows games.

188
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,960
Scott: Yeah, the thing is those little VMware's don't do the games that well.

189
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,320
Rym: Someone could make one that could.

190
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:15,080
Rym: I mean, VMware itself, if you run like Windows in a VMware, it's not significantly slower than running Windows natively.

191
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,380
Scott: As long as you got plenty of RAM, it's cool, but when you try to run a game and it goes into like the 3D mode with the graphics, then it kind of gets a little hairy.

192
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,640
Rym: Yeah, but if you've got a dual core processor and a shit ton of RAM.

193
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,660
Scott: Oh, a dual core, you could be all right, depending.

194
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,199
Scott: But yeah, it could work.

195
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,779
Rym: All right, things of the day.

196
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:48,629
Scott: All right, so this is dude, and I don't know his name, but I see a picture of him, a couple pictures of him, and he either.

197
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,578
Scott: he works in a, I can't tell because his only pictures and no words.

198
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:53,158
Scott: So I'm just going to speculate here.

199
00:13:54,361 --> 00:14:04,540
Scott: He works in a metal shop or he has access to a metal shop and he designed and created a little metal dude, like a little action figure guy.

200
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,840
Scott: You ever seen those like wooden things, like little figure models?

201
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,917
Scott: They're kind of bluby and they're all ball jointed and you can pose them in different ways.

202
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:22,999
Scott: Well, this is made out of metal and it is like the most accurate, like, I don't know, it must be a foot tall human model I've ever seen.

203
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:26,580
Rym: It's one of the highest quality toys I've ever seen in my life.

204
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,819
Scott: I don't even know if I'd call it a toy.

205
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:28,880
Rym: It's an action figure.

206
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,578
Rym: You can pose it.

207
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,119
Scott: Yeah, it's like beyond toy.

208
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,280
Scott: It's like the ultimate human model.

209
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:41,080
Scott: This thing has every joint, like every little finger bit is movable and looks like it's really high quality and posable and everything.

210
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:50,399
Scott: I say that from now on when they make action figures, they should just make these and then put like goop on them to make them look like whatever character you're acting.

211
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,719
Rym: I mean, this thing is bad ass.

212
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:56,020
Scott: Like you look at it and you go, wow, God damn, I really want one.

213
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,380
Scott: But I think even if you mass manufactured these, they'd still cost a fortune.

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,396
Rym: All right.

215
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:09,699
Rym: So Chevrolet decided to have a little contest where you could go onto their website and you could design for them.

216
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,479
Rym: They gave you a bunch of footage and a little tool.

217
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:14,478
Rym: You could make an advertisement for their new Chevy Tahoe.

218
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,000
Scott: Awesome.

219
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:29,720
Rym: Now, this wouldn't have been news, but as Fark reported and other internet sites soon discovered, most people who are internet savvy seem to not particularly like SUVs.

220
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,279
Scott: I wonder why.

221
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:32,217
Rym: I don't know.

222
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:32,892
Rym: I don't know.

223
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:47,658
Rym: But imagine what would happen if a bunch of geeks and a bunch of SUV hating hippie types online found out that they could just make ads for the Chevy Tahoe and they would be Even if you put bad words in it?

224
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:53,199
Rym: Even if I submit the butt sex one that we watched just a little while ago.

225
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,972
Scott: Oh my God.

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,980
Rym: These range from poignant to scary to hilarious.

227
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,360
Rym: I don't think there's a single entry that I've seen that wasn't making fun of Chevy.

228
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:08,591
Rym: Wow.

229
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,679
Rym: And in fact, the article I linked to on Ars Technica that talks about this has a picture of the Canyon Arrow.

230
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:15,360
Scott: Canyon Arrow.

231
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,859
Rym: Two lanes long and four lanes wide.

232
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,320
Scott: Canyon Arrow.

233
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:23,943
Rym: There's one ad.

234
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:27,213
Rym: it's like this V8 engine gets 15 miles to the gallon.

235
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,415
Scott: Wow.

236
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,960
Scott: My car gets 30.

237
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,360
Rym: My car gets 30.

238
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,078
Scott: And I have a hatch.

239
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,980
Scott: If I got rid of the hatch, I'd get more.

240
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:37,476
Scott: You got a hatch.

241
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,460
Rym: I got three speeds in my transmission.

242
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,540
Scott: I got five.

243
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,040
Scott: I guess that's why I'm still doing 30, even though I got a hatch.

244
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,700
Rym: And your car is faster than mine.

245
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,377
Scott: Yeah, that too.

246
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,840
Rym: So today, due to popular requests for various topics, we decided to pick one of the topics that was suggested and we're going to talk about computer monitors.

247
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:03,020
Rym: Now we're not going to talk about the more, I guess, esoteric ideas like using plasma screens or projectors.

248
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,219
Scott: Yeah, not televisions.

249
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:08,240
Scott: There's a lot of television to discuss that we're going to avoid.

250
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,239
Scott: Only monitors we're going to talk about.

251
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,640
Rym: Yeah, so we won't get into any of that HDMI bullshit.

252
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,478
Rym: That'll be another show.

253
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,877
Scott: Yeah, we're not going to talk about display technologies for like iPods and DSs and PSPs or any of that either.

254
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:20,740
Scott: Basically.

255
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Scott: Monitors for your computer.

256
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,319
Rym: Which basically boils down to CRTs, cathode ray tubes, or LCDs, liquid crystal displays.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,280
Rym: Now it just so happens that Scott knows quite a bit about the latter and I know quite a bit about the former.

258
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,718
Rym: And between the two of us, we were definitely not experts, but we have quite a depth of knowledge here.

259
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,279
Scott: More than most people.

260
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,458
Rym: So I guess we'll begin with just a description of how these two technologies work and what they are.

261
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,320
Rym: We're not going to go into the deep, deep details because I doubt you care.

262
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,920
Rym: So anyway, CRT, a cathode ray tube.

263
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,480
Rym: Now those are the monitors that look like TVs.

264
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,938
Rym: They're big and boxy and heavy.

265
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,457
Scott: It's because they're essentially TVs.

266
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:01,678
Scott: Kind of.

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:11,820
Rym: Yeah, I mean basically a cathode ray tube on a very fundamental level is inside of it, it's a big funnel-shaped vacuum made of lead glass.

268
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,900
Rym: And the vacuum's really powerful.

269
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,820
Rym: In fact, it's dangerous.

270
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,738
Rym: If you were somehow able to crack the glass, it could kill you.

271
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,560
Scott: Good thing the glass is really, really, really thick.

272
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,094
Rym: Yes.

273
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,200
Rym: Now this isn't true in old, old, old TVs and old, old, old monitors.

274
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,739
Rym: If you ever find an old, this is just a warning before I start, a really old cathode ray tube, like an old ass TV that still works.

275
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,739
Scott: Stay away.

276
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,678
Rym: Yeah, be very wary of it.

277
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:41,820
Rym: But anyway, the technology, while complex, is very simple to understand.

278
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,259
Rym: In the back of this funnel there's an electron gun, a cathode, and basically it shoots an electron beam at the screen.

279
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,620
Rym: And on the screen are phosphors that when hit by electrons glow whatever color you want them to glow.

280
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,600
Rym: Some glow blue, red, or green.

281
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,640
Rym: Some can glow orange, white, but whatever.

282
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,260
Rym: They use red, green, blue in modern color monitors.

283
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:04,420
Rym: Monochrome is different.

284
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,454
Rym: We don't really need to get into that.

285
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:15,260
Rym: And basically, magnets and/or electromagnetic fields on the sides of this funnel aim this beam.

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,878
Rym: And the beam basically goes from top to bottom, left to right, painting your pixels on the screen one by one over and over and over and over again.

287
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,899
Scott: Really, really fast.

288
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:25,548
Rym: Yes.

289
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,658
Scott: Wicked fast.

290
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:38,039
Rym: Old, old, old, old, old-ass CRTs actually mechanically scanned, but all modern ones use various magnetic bits to make it move, so there aren't really moving parts in there per se.

291
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,359
Scott: That's good, because if there were moving parts they would not only suck, but be horribly slow at refreshing and such and such.

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:45,933
Rym: Yep.

293
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,320
Rym: Now, to talk about just modern CRTs, there are two basic types.

294
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,899
Rym: And the difference used to mean a lot more than it does now.

295
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,420
Rym: So you may hear fanboys talking about, "Oh, Aperture Grill is the way to go, blah blah blah,".

296
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,800
Rym: but they're basically blowing smoke up your ass at this point.

297
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:04,980
Rym: Now, there is a shadow mask and an Aperture Grill.

298
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,560
Rym: And basically all this has to do with is that you have this electron beam scanning the screen and hitting phosphors.

299
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:19,899
Rym: Now, how do you control precisely which phosphors it hits, especially when for every pixel there are three different phosphors, one of each color, red, green, blue?

300
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,640
Rym: And the answer to that is either a shadow mask or an Aperture Grill.

301
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:33,600
Rym: Now, for a long time Aperture Grills were a lot better, because basically all they are... These are the monitors that have the lines going across the sides.

302
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,540
Scott: Yeah, if you look closely at your monitor, you probably don't have an Aperture Grill unless you're like a CAD professional with some CAD monitor or something.

303
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,198
Scott: But the glass will actually be flat and not, you know, sort of bendy.

304
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,800
Scott: But there are also shadow masks with flat glass.

305
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,220
Scott: Yep.

306
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,720
Scott: But Aperture Grills with flat glass, if you look really closely, not even that closely, you could see lines going across the screen.

307
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,482
Rym: Yep.

308
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:58,420
Rym: Really, really faint.

309
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,017
Rym: They're much fainter now than they used to be.

310
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,738
Rym: Some people find them really annoying, some people don't even see them.

311
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,739
Rym: But those are called... Those basically stabilize it.

312
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:14,280
Rym: What it is is that instead what you have is a series of vertical wires, really, really tiny wires tight together under high, high tension.

313
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,519
Rym: And they go across your whole screen.

314
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,600
Rym: And those two or possibly three horizontal wires hold them all in place in the proper distance apart.

315
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:28,698
Rym: And those lines basically separate the different sets of three pixels or three phosphors.

316
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,660
Rym: And because they're just vertical lines and there's nothing horizontally, the net result is that more light comes out total from the monitor.

317
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,860
Rym: So Aperture Grills tended to be brighter and have higher contrast.

318
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,200
Rym: Now shadow masks have caught up recently to the point that this is almost not even a consideration anymore.

319
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:55,220
Rym: Shadow mask, which is used in most televisions and most monitors, is the same kind of idea, only instead you have a big piece of some kind of metal or plastic.

320
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,040
Rym: Usually it's metal.

321
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,660
Rym: Maybe it's coated in tin.

322
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:58,439
Rym: It doesn't really matter.

323
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,940
Rym: And it has a whole bunch of holes in it, usually in little triangles.

324
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,839
Rym: And the electrons are basically aimed so that they go through the holes and then they hit the phosphors.

325
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:12,780
Rym: See, that's not so difficult to understand.

326
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,459
Rym: And when it comes down to it, the two technologies, it doesn't matter which one you use.

327
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
Rym: The monitors that are made in the modern day are pretty much identical.

328
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:22,639
Rym: It's just a matter of taste.

329
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,360
Scott: Yep.

330
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:32,839
Scott: If I were you and I was planning on buying a cathode ray tube monitor, I would buy one that is the most glass you can get for the least money you can get.

331
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,939
Scott: Preferably the glass would be flat and not a curved glass, just because the flat glass is a lot nicer and easier to look at.

332
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,520
Scott: And considering your computer, most things are square.

333
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:43,559
Scott: It just, it's nice.

334
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:52,319
Scott: And, uh, preferably takes up the least physical room, because you can get some monitors that, you know, don't, aren't a mile from the front to the back.

335
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:57,159
Scott: You know, they're, they're, they're longer than an LCD, but there's not much you can do about that.

336
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,920
Rym: Now spec wise, one of the big advantages of CRTs is that they're highly versatile.

337
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,059
Rym: There's no real native resolution to a CRT.

338
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,140
Rym: There's just a maximum resolution.

339
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:10,977
Rym: And the quality will pretty much be the same, no matter what resolution you set it at.

340
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,320
Rym: And you can set it to just about anything.

341
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:23,420
Rym: This was really an advantage in the early days of LCDs, because when early LCDs came out, they generally, I mean, an LCD, as Scott will talk about, basically has one native resolution.

342
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,980
Rym: Which is great, now, because the resolution is good.

343
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,220
Rym: But way back in the day, it was usually kind of shitty.

344
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,520
Rym: And games used all sorts of different resolutions, and it caused trouble.

345
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,360
Scott: Yeah, nowadays, anything that runs full screen, you know, lets you choose your resolution.

346
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:40,199
Scott: So, it's usually all good.

347
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,280
Rym: Yeah, and if you're running one of those old DOS games on an LCD, well, I don't think you're gonna worry about the slight pixelation.

348
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,199
Scott: Nah, I wouldn't worry about it either.

349
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,720
Rym: But CRTs, I mean, the main benefits of them are, one, they're cheap.

350
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,059
Rym: I mean, they're generally very cheap for what you get.

351
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,999
Rym: Though your mileage may vary, because if you have it shipped to you from Newegg, the shipping will be quite a bit.

352
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,660
Scott: Yeah, if you're gonna buy a CRT these days, you can find a used one at a used computer shop for, like, nothing.

353
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,100
Scott: Or you can buy one on eBay for nothing.

354
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:09,730
Scott: Yep.

355
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,220
Scott: Or you can buy one from CompUSA for almost nothing.

356
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,700
Rym: Now also, another advantage is that they're very durable.

357
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:16,760
Rym: As in, the screen is glass.

358
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,380
Rym: Like, glass, glass, glass.

359
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,220
Rym: You couldn't break it if you tried at the front of that screen.

360
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:29,033
Scott: Yeah, people don't seem to realize, because when you look at a TV or a CRT monitor, the picture looks like it's right behind the glass.

361
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,740
Scott: If you actually get close and try to see, that glass is inches thick.

362
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,838
Rym: Inches.

363
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:43,958
Rym: If you want to see a demonstration of that, close one eye and take a finger and put it over something on your monitor, so that your finger covers it.

364
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:50,057
Rym: Then move your head to the left or right, and you'll see the thing around your finger, because the image is actually a little ways back there.

365
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,819
Rym: And the glass itself is very thick, and it's impregnated with lead.

366
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,079
Rym: Now, the lead isn't there just to make the glass stronger, it's there to protect you.

367
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,259
Scott: It's there to poison you, too.

368
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,680
Rym: Well, it'll only poison you if you grind it up again.

369
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:03,637
Scott: I know, I was just joking.

370
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:05,900
Scott: I gotta throw a joke in here somewhere.

371
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:13,720
Rym: But basically, the cathode ray, too, back there, is also making x-rays that are pointed right at your face.

372
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:15,560
Rym: Awesome.

373
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:20,699
Rym: Now, this is a very regulated technology, so the glass is there to keep the x-rays from actually hitting you.

374
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:22,017
Scott: And it works.

375
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:32,680
Rym: Yeah, though we had a friend, Greg, there was a tiny hole in the shield on the front of his CRT, and you could see that it not was all right, and I don't think he should have been sitting in front of that thing.

376
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,219
Scott: Yeah, he got a new one, though.

377
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,120
Scott: Eventually.

378
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,880
Rym: Yeah, eventually.

379
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,060
Scott: Yeah, it was okay.

380
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,720
Rym: Yeah.

381
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,799
Scott: But you ever see that old Simpsons where Homer is sitting in front of the TV, and then you see the wall has, like, this black shadow around?

382
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:47,959
Scott: You know, his body, there's, like, a silhouette of Homer on the wall?

383
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:50,880
Scott: That was how old TVs were like then, you know?

384
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:51,498
Scott: Not so good.

385
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,170
Rym: Yep.

386
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:58,720
Rym: Now, old CRTs, like ones made in the '80s, early, early '90s, tend to wear out for a number of reasons.

387
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:10,839
Rym: The main reason being that there's something called outgassing that happens inside the tube, where basically ions and basically things that are heavy and aren't electrons are in the air, well, in the vacuum in there where they shouldn't be.

388
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:16,399
Rym: And they get accelerated by the gun, and they hit the phosphor screen, slowly damaging it and wearing it out.

389
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,578
Rym: Modern CRTs, that has been almost entirely mitigated by a whole bunch of cool technologies I don't have time to talk about here.

390
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:27,000
Scott: Also, CRTs can get damaged by extra cleaning.

391
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:35,080
Scott: Like, if you don't clean them nicely, then you'll put a bunch of little tiny scratches in the glass, which you don't notice, you know, if you clean it once, you clean it twice.

392
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:45,718
Scott: If you clean it a hundred times over five years, eventually a million little tiny scratches in the monitor, all of which are individually invisible, will make your picture all blurry and bleh.

393
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,599
Rym: However, they're still more durable screen-wise than most LCDs.

394
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:50,399
Scott: Indeed.

395
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,580
Rym: It's real easy to scratch an LCD screen.

396
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,219
Scott: Too easy.

397
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,673
Rym: Yeah.

398
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,038
Rym: I mean, CRTs, you can just dunk it with your finger, poke at it, you can write on it with--.

399
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:02,200
Rym: I knew some people, I hated this, who would write on their monitor with dry erase markers.

400
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:02,965
Rym: Uh, uh.

401
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,580
Rym: It was painful to me, but it doesn't hurt 'em.

402
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,600
Scott: Yeah, you'll get oil and stuff on there and have to clean it, but as long as you don't clean it with, I don't know, sandpaper, you'll be alright.

403
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:27,059
Rym: Now in terms of specs, if you're actually looking to buy one, I'd recommend look at price the most, but the specs you really want to worry about are horizontal sync, which basically isn't much of an issue, and if you don't really know what the number means, don't worry about it.

404
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,200
Scott: But you're gonna need to know that number if you're on Linux, probably.

405
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:30,696
Rym: Yeah.

406
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,819
Scott: Or at least it's good to know if you're on Linux.

407
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,760
Rym: Yeah, though that number will be in the instruction book.

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,377
Scott: Yeah, it will be.

409
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:38,020
Rym: Vertical sync is much more important.

410
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,059
Rym: That's the refresh rate that most people talk about.

411
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:43,851
Rym: And you want to look for a CRT that'll at least do 75 or more cycles per second.

412
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,060
Scott: At the resolution.

413
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,340
Rym: Yeah, at the resolution you think you're gonna be running it at.

414
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:56,037
Scott: So if you're gonna run it 1600 by 1200, sure, my monitor can do that at 60 hertz.

415
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:57,379
Scott: That's not so good.

416
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,540
Scott: You're gonna want something that can do, you know, whatever.

417
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,434
Scott: Pick your resolution first, then make sure the monitor says that resolution at at least 75, if not 80 or more.

418
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,661
Rym: Yeah, you want to be at least at 75.

419
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:14,060
Rym: Below that, the monitors can trigger migraines in certain people or epileptic seizures.

420
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:22,458
Scott: Yeah, if you ever noticed, if someone points a video camera at a monitor, a CRT monitor, you can see that flickering going on.

421
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,860
Scott: Yeah, that's what it's all about.

422
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Rym: Yeah, and especially if you're in an office or a place with fluorescent lights.

423
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,295
Rym: Fluorescent lights go at 60 hertz.

424
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,316
Rym: A lot of old monitors go at 60 hertz.

425
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:36,579
Rym: That's not a great thing.

426
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,220
Scott: It hurts, trust me.

427
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,758
Scott: I've done it.

428
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,280
Scott: I've sat in front of CRTs for a long time, and it's not pleasant.

429
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,440
Rym: And the other main thing to look at, this is the key one, because a lot of people try to trick you on this, is the dot pitch.

430
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,740
Rym: Now, if your monitor doesn't have a dot pitch, that means it's an arpeggiator grill, and instead it has a line pitch or a stripe pitch.

431
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,192
Rym: Now, basically, in general, you want it to be 0.23 or less.

432
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,480
Rym: Smaller is better.

433
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,600
Rym: Basically, it's the size of the pixels, or the distance between the pixels.

434
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:13,199
Rym: The problem here is that everyone lies and measures it different ways so they can seem better than everyone else.

435
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,839
Rym: And a nice rule of thumb is that if they say just dot pitch, they're probably shady and lying to you.

436
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:27,880
Rym: If they say diagonal dot pitch, they're probably not lying to you, because diagonal tends to be the longest distance between any two pixels.

437
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,039
Scott: That is indeed true.

438
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:32,479
Rym: And of course, the last bit is how big you want it.

439
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,660
Rym: And basically, just think about how big you want your screen to be.

440
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,658
Rym: Will it fit on your desk?

441
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:41,698
Rym: Look at it in person, because a lot of people measure the size of monitors different ways to trick you.

442
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,120
Scott: Yeah, typically a monitor is measured diagonally across and such.

443
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,540
Rym: Yeah, but it used to be measured across horizontally, and some are widescreen and all sorts of things.

444
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,620
Scott: Some people include the plastic in the measurement.

445
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:54,297
Scott: You don't know.

446
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,060
Rym: Yeah, CRTs are effectively going to be obsolete completely within the next decade.

447
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:01,517
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

448
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:12,160
Rym: So I'd say the only reason to get a CRT at this point is for cheapness, or if you, for whatever reason, know that you're going to be running in a bunch of different resolutions all the time.

449
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:15,679
Scott: All right, so the LCD.

450
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,720
Scott: That's probably what you've got if, you know, you got a laptop, or you have a nice flat screen.

451
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,539
Rym: Yeah, I'd love to see a CRT laptop.

452
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,480
Scott: Yeah, right?

453
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,139
Scott: That'd be great.

454
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Scott: Well, didn't they used to have those?

455
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,500
Scott: What was it called?

456
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,873
Rym: Actually, at IBM, we have some really cool 386 laptops.

457
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:34,338
Rym: They're more like portable PCs.

458
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,399
Rym: They actually have gas plasma screens built into them.

459
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,887
Scott: Wow.

460
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:41,680
Rym: Yeah, they're monochrome orange, but they're actually gas plasma.

461
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,518
Scott: Holy crap.

462
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:47,079
Rym: So, you know, the myth of gas plasma TVs wear out, and they let the gas out?

463
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,979
Rym: That's complete bullshit.

464
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,700
Scott: They do wear out, though.

465
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,393
Scott: They only have X hours before.

466
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,420
Scott: they're not so good anymore.

467
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,719
Rym: Yeah, however- But it's for other reasons.

468
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,740
Rym: Yeah, and the number of hours is quite large.

469
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,179
Scott: Yeah, it is quite large, like hundreds of thousands of hours, or tens of thousands of hours, or something like that.

470
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,719
Scott: Anyway, liquid crystal display.

471
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:10,780
Scott: Whether you know it or not, it's not joking when it calls itself a liquid crystal display.

472
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,619
Scott: There is liquid crystal in there.

473
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,940
Scott: Like, holy crap, liquid crystals.

474
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,939
Scott: Whoa, it's crazy.

475
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,079
Rym: Wow, I mean, there's a cathode ray tube inside my CRT.

476
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,400
Scott: Yeah, I know, it shoots cathode rays.

477
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,219
Rym: Yeah, science words mean things.

478
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:31,420
Scott: Yeah, so, the way a liquid crystal display works is kind of stupid, stupidly easy.

479
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:35,232
Scott: You have liquid crystals inside a little flat thing.

480
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:38,718
Scott: that's really complex electronically, but you don't care about that.

481
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:46,817
Scott: And when electricity is passed through it, the crystals spin around and align themselves, and you can see them.

482
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,657
Scott: That's pretty much it.

483
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,940
Scott: Now, your CRT mod- That's, you know, that's the basic LCD that you're going to see in, like, a calculator.

484
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,540
Scott: You know, a little, you know, four function calculator has the little numbers at the top.

485
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:01,198
Scott: That's an LCD.

486
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:05,100
Scott: Tiger LCD games, they're called Tiger LCD games for a reason.

487
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,619
Scott: Now, the one in your monitor is a little bit more complex.

488
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,319
Scott: The way this is, it's sort of like layers.

489
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:21,860
Scott: The first layer is a piece of plastic that's pretty much transparent, and that's, like, the screen that protects, you know, all the inner bits that you're worrying about.

490
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,040
Scott: I've taken apart an LCD before, so I know this stuff.

491
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,539
Rym: Yeah, there's pictures on your flicker, too.

492
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,159
Scott: Yeah, there are pictures on my flicker of us taking apart the broken old LCD.

493
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:42,340
Scott: Now, this is the part that you're not going to want to scratch, but you are going to want to clean, so you're going to have to spray it with, like, it's not glass, it's not durable like the CRT, so you're going to want to use, like, a microfiber cloth and, like, a little wet nap thing.

494
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,300
Rym: Yeah, don't use Windex and paper towels.

495
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,880
Scott: Yeah, use, like, half rubbing alcohol, half water, and a microfiber cloth, and you'll be all set.

496
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,080
Rym: If your LCD comes with instructions, do whatever those say.

497
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,339
Scott: And Radio Shack, it's sort of a rip-off, but they're not too expensive, sells little cleaning kits for LCDs, they're not so bad.

498
00:32:59,043 --> 00:32:59,979
Scott: Especially if you buy them in bulk.

499
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,075
Scott: Anyway, the next layer is this lens.

500
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:12,380
Scott: Well, it's not really some, it is a lens, but it's a, it's an equally thin, flat sheet of plastic, but it's ribbed horizontally.

501
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,260
Scott: You know, like, those little, uh, what do they call those lenses that you buy?

502
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:16,859
Rym: Fresnel?

503
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:17,799
Scott: Fresnel lenses.

504
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:19,339
Scott: Think of it just like that.

505
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,220
Scott: It's a piece of plastic with little ridges in it, but they're all just horizontal lines.

506
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:29,558
Scott: The next one is clear, and you don't worry about that one, 'cause I'm not even gonna bother explaining it.

507
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,900
Rym: Yeah, I noticed we both skipped over a lot in our descriptions.

508
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,360
Rym: It's really hard to not talk an hour about each one of these.

509
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,280
Scott: Yeah, I'm just avoiding the, eh, eh, the technological bits that aren't necessary.

510
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:39,737
Scott: Yeah.

511
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,460
Scott: The next one is sort of like a Fresnel lens.

512
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:45,680
Scott: It makes it, um, easier to see.

513
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,880
Scott: You know, it, uh, arranges everything nicely.

514
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,759
Scott: Don't worry about that either.

515
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:56,179
Rym: Yeah, I was thinking that I, I thought I sounded kind of dumb, because I kept, like, uh, I'll skip that.

516
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,280
Rym: Uh, skip that on the CRTs, but you're doing the same thing, so I feel good now.

517
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,839
Scott: Yeah, now, here come the important layers.

518
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,920
Scott: There's the actual liquid crystal layer.

519
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:08,580
Scott: And then there's another layer with, uh, vertical lines, sort of like the one that was horizontal before.

520
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,520
Scott: Now, the way it works is, and behind that, of course, is a big piece of clear plastic.

521
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,960
Scott: Just a big, thick piece of plastic, like a half an inch thick.

522
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Rym: Yeah, like awesome Plexiglas or Lucite looking.

523
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,280
Scott: Like, you could bang someone over the head with this thing.

524
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:23,920
Scott: It's perfectly clear.

525
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,099
Scott: And it's fiber optic, too.

526
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,880
Scott: So what happens is, you, if you shine light in the top of it, or in the side, it comes out the front.

527
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:32,880
Scott: Fiber optics.

528
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,018
Scott: You know, light goes in one end, comes out the other end.

529
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,580
Scott: So there's two little thin, usually two thin, thin, thin lights.

530
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,540
Scott: They're not, they look like fluorescent lights that you have in, you know, the ceiling of an office.

531
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:45,579
Scott: But they're not.

532
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,780
Scott: And these turn on, and they're wicked bright.

533
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:53,820
Scott: And they shine straight down into this piece of plastic, and the light comes out the front.

534
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,380
Rym: Yeah, they also put out a special light.

535
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,040
Rym: It's, it's purely white, usually, or some perfect color curve.

536
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Scott: Whatever you do, don't turn, don't take apart an LCD and turn these lights on and look at them.

537
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,100
Rym: Yeah, well, while we're at it, don't ever try to turn on an electron gun if it's not shielded.

538
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,360
Scott: Yeah, feel free to take apart a monitor.

539
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:18,660
Scott: Just don't take apart a CRT all the way, and don't, and don't take apart one and then try to turn it on.

540
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:21,340
Rym: Yeah, I mean, those things are fucking bright.

541
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,880
Scott: Yeah, so, those lights go down into the plastic and out the front.

542
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,800
Scott: It goes through the horizontal, the vertical thing, liquid crystals, the horizontal thing, and then the front.

543
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:41,260
Scott: Now, normally, if the LCD is off, what happens is the light goes through the horizontal and then through the vertical.

544
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,419
Scott: Well, the horizontal and the vertical lenses, the reason that they're that way is because light doesn't get through.

545
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:52,059
Scott: If light goes through horizontal and then vertical, it just doesn't make it out to your eyes.

546
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:53,160
Rym: Polarization.

547
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:54,600
Rym: Hallelujah.

548
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:13,420
Rym: Now, if you want to see a nice example of this, if you've got polarized sunglasses, which you should, because if your sunglasses aren't polarized, they're not really that effective, but, and I digress, take them and put them on and stand in front of your LCD, and then start turning your head to a 45 degree angle, and the image will probably disappear.

549
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,358
Scott: Mm-hmm.

550
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:23,059
Rym: Actually, it pisses me off because my cell phone is polarized, so in the summer, I'll pull it out and try to look at it, and then I have to rotate it 90 degrees so I can actually see it.

551
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:23,732
Scott: Mm-hmm.

552
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:26,435
Scott: Now, in between, there's the LCDs.

553
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:47,520
Scott: This is where, basically, it's this big electronic flat thing, and it's got a grid of wires all along the side and a million transistors in it, and it's all crazy, but let it just be said that via electronics and your computer, it can control the color of any pixel in that entire LCD screen bit.

554
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:52,380
Scott: So, you know, the way the computer has it is the computer has a bunch of memory.

555
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,500
Scott: Let's say your resolution is 10 by 10.

556
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,297
Scott: I'm just making this up.

557
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:57,180
Scott: That means you got 100 pixels, right?

558
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,699
Scott: And you got a color for each pixel.

559
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:16,860
Scott: So you got a number, a number, and then a number for the color, because the color is something like OF 3456, you know, just like the colors you type into Photoshop or whatever, or MS Paint, and it stores pixel, pixel, color, pixel, pixel, color in the frame buffer on your video card.

560
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,559
Rym: Now, this applies to CRTs, too.

561
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,099
Scott: Yeah, it does, but LCDs a little more direct.

562
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:21,680
Rym: Yes.

563
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:39,919
Scott: The pixel, pixel, color, you know, it sends that whole frame buffer worth of stuff to the LCD basically a bajillion times a second, whatever your frame rate is, you know, and all the liquid crystals in this middle part change according to what color they're supposed to be.

564
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:50,680
Scott: And what happens is the light going through the vertical part hits the liquid crystal and then is skewed based on the arrangement of the crystal in that pixel.

565
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:59,819
Scott: And that allows it to A, be the right color, and B, make it through the horizontal part to your eyeball where you see it.

566
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,696
Rym: Now, think about this difference here.

567
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:03,979
Rym: Think about the way he just described that.

568
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:10,415
Rym: And then a CRT, you've got a different phosphor for each of the three colors, and then basically you have three phosphors together.

569
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,140
Rym: make one pixel.

570
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,140
Rym: Now, you can see why the LCD has much more potential for clear, crisp images.

571
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:24,300
Scott: Yeah, an LCD screen is essentially just a flat sheet of pixels that will always be the correct color with light shining through them to your eyes.

572
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,100
Rym: Yep, and it's a one-to-one correlation.

573
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,979
Rym: That's why, like I mentioned, and Scott will talk about more, the resolution is pretty much set.

574
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Rym: An LCD has A resolution, and you send pixels to it one for one.

575
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,980
Scott: Now, there's more technology to it.

576
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,360
Scott: I mean, LCDs used to be passive matrix, and now they're active matrix, you know, and passive matrix are the ones in the calculator, basically.

577
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,420
Scott: And now they're TFT, which is thin film transistor.

578
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:55,220
Scott: That just has to do with the ways they control the pixels and such, and how now they don't have to control them row and column, which cause bleeding colors and stuff.

579
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:58,260
Scott: Now they can actually control each individual pixel all the time.

580
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:03,540
Scott: So, as a result, an LCD has a set resolution.

581
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,594
Scott: Like, my LCDs, I have two of them, they're Samsung 172Xs.

582
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:08,919
Rym: They're very nice.

583
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,519
Scott: They are.

584
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,781
Scott: They're 1280 by 1024.

585
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,419
Scott: That's how many pixels there are.

586
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,400
Scott: They're exactly that many pixels.

587
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:17,119
Scott: No more, no less.

588
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:22,840
Scott: If I try to run a program at, oh, 1600 by 1200?

589
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:35,740
Scott: Well, then it's either going to A, the software on my computer will have to sort of change that, you know, into a 1280 by 1024 image, or the monitor will have to downsample it or something.

590
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,138
Rym: You don't want either one of those.

591
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,599
Scott: Yeah, you don't want that.

592
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:47,100
Scott: Also, if you run something in low resolution, and your monitor isn't ass, it'll usually upsample it, which works just fine, usually.

593
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:50,580
Scott: But, you know, you're not getting the most out of your monitor when you do that.

594
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,410
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:39:52,220 --> 00:40:01,999
Rym: So, once again, if you're going to be changing resolutions a lot for whatever reasons, maybe if you're developing software or something that needs that sort of thing, and you're a graphic designer, then get a CRT, but...

596
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,620
Scott: Yeah, it works well for, like, if you're emulating an old Nintendo game at 800 by 600, and it'll be alright.

597
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,200
Rym: Yeah, it's not something to worry about.

598
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,280
Scott: Yeah, but if you have an LCD, you've got to know the resolution of it, and you're going to want to set your desktop to be that resolution exactly.

599
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:21,820
Scott: Now, the next thing you want to know about an LCD monitor is the pixel pitch.

600
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,420
Scott: The pixel pitch is an exact measurement of the size of the pixels.

601
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,659
Rym: This is kind of like what the dot pitch tells you on a CRT.

602
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:40,620
Scott: It's pretty much the same thing, only it's really hard to fake this, because you can just look with your eyeball and see the pixel, and take a little tiny... If you have, like, a veneer, you can pretty much see exactly how wide the pixel is with your eyeball.

603
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,699
Scott: Then there's the contrast ratio.

604
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,060
Rym: Alright, now, this applies to CRTs too, and it's largely bullshit.

605
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:57,660
Scott: Contrast ratios on monitors and TVs, if you see... You'll see numbers like 500 to 1, 1000 to 1, 2000 to 1, 10,000 to 1.

606
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,439
Scott: Some crazy numbers.

607
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,138
Rym: Yeah, I looked it up.

608
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,380
Rym: My monitor claims to be 2,500 to 1.

609
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:10,878
Scott: A contrast ratio is the difference between the whitest white and the blackest black that the display can do.

610
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:12,419
Rym: Just the two extremes.

611
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:13,035
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:21,059
Rym: There's another thing called gamma, which is the curve of the differences between all the different shades, all the way from the blackest black to the whitest white.

613
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:28,459
Scott: Now, a better contrast ratio is better, like, bigger ones are better, because, well, it just means it's easier to see.

614
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,059
Scott: That's all there is to it.

615
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:38,859
Scott: But you really can't trust the numbers so much, because they're not... They're lying, as in, they're never going to be 100% accurate, because everyone measures them differently.

616
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,300
Rym: But you know the old saying, there's lies, damn lies, and statistics.

617
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:43,080
Scott: Yup.

618
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:52,160
Scott: So, you know, if one monitor says 500 to 1, and one says 700 to 1, there's not a big difference there, you know, because who could be embellishing?

619
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,040
Scott: But odds are, one that says 1,000 to 1 is going to be a little better than one says 500 to 1.

620
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,984
Rym: Though if you see a monitor that costs, you know, 100 bucks, and it says a million to 1... Yeah.

621
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,460
Scott: Some monitors will advertise a statistic called luminosity.

622
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:13,140
Scott: That's basically telling you how bright the thing can get, which has to do with the power of those little light bulbs I talked about.

623
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,919
Rym: Now, bear in mind that if a monitor is cheap, and it says it has a really high luminosity, odds are it has some washed-out color in there.

624
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:20,797
Scott: Yeah.

625
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:32,920
Scott: You also gotta watch out, like, in one of my monitors, I think it's from beating it up and carrying it around, one of the little light bulbs has died or dimmed, and now one monitor is slightly darker than the others, but it's still pretty damn bright.

626
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,998
Scott: So just watch out for that.

627
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,860
Scott: Now, one thing to watch out with LCDs that isn't a worry on CRTs is the viewing angle.

628
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:45,339
Scott: Usually, the viewing angle will be four numbers that are degrees.

629
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:50,520
Scott: 90 degrees being, well, perfect, but that's not really gonna happen.

630
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,620
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to CRTs, which have an infinite viewing angle.

631
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:55,540
Rym: If you can see the screen, you can see the image.

632
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:56,020
Rym: Right.

633
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:06,920
Scott: With an LCD, if you look at it dead on, like, you're facing right at the screen, you know, the light from the screen is coming directly at your face, you can see the image perfectly.

634
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:16,040
Scott: Now, what, say, uh, you know, you have a friend on the other side of the room, and the LCD is facing him, and you're sitting to his left, and you look at the screen.

635
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,560
Scott: Well, now, the front of the screen is making, like, a 40 degree angle, you know, between you and the screen.

636
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,580
Scott: Maybe he won't be able to see it if the monitor sucks.

637
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:32,940
Scott: So, if you're looking for privacy, you can buy LCDs with shitty viewing angles, but at the same time, they don't make those anymore because they suck.

638
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:46,640
Rym: Now, what they also make, and these aren't really within the grasp of the typical consumer, but you can buy them if you really want, you can get special polarized LCDs where you then wear a set of glasses, and only you can see what's on the screen.

639
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:48,840
Rym: Or anyone else who buys these glasses.

640
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:59,280
Scott: Yeah, but basically, you want a big viewing angle so that you can see your screen if you're not looking directly at it, or if you're at a different position in the room without having to turn your monitor all over the place.

641
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:06,160
Rym: But don't get a monitor with a big viewing angle to the expense of the more important things, like it looking good in the first place.

642
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,359
Scott: Now, there's only three more things you need to know about an LCD.

643
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,420
Scott: The most important of which is something people don't seem to understand, is the pixel response.

644
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:23,640
Scott: Remember how before we were talking about, like, vertical refresh in hertz, which is the, you know, number of times per second that the screen updates?

645
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,049
Scott: Yep.

646
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:41,800
Scott: So a 75 hertz CRT monitor means that the picture is completely refreshed 75 times every second, which means if you're running a first-person shooter video game at 75 FPS, every single frame that your video card renders shows up on the screen.

647
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:47,060
Rym: Now, I'll toss in right now, this isn't really important, but I didn't mention it before, but now we're talking about resolution.

648
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:52,280
Rym: If you see the word "interlaced" on a CRT, ignore that.

649
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:54,480
Rym: Don't buy it, don't use that resolution.

650
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,620
Rym: Interlaced basically means it'll fill half of the lines at any given time.

651
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,279
Rym: It allows a cheap monitor to do a higher resolution than it normally could, and it makes it look like ass.

652
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,900
Scott: Yeah, the alternative to interlaced is progressive scan, but that's mostly a television technology.

653
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,780
Scott: You're not going to see that too often on monitors.

654
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,020
Scott: Most monitors nowadays don't worry about interlaced because you're not going to see it.

655
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,400
Rym: Yeah, unless you're looking at, like, if you're picking up an old one on eBay.

656
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,598
Scott: Oh, old ones on eBay, you might see that, yeah.

657
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:23,700
Scott: But other than that, interlaced and progressive scan are TV things.

658
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,319
Scott: We'll talk about TVs in some other time.

659
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:25,775
Rym: Yep.

660
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,296
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

661
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,559
Scott: So, on an LCD, they don't measure it in hertz.

662
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,919
Scott: They measure it in milliseconds.

663
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:41,080
Scott: So, 12 milliseconds is the amount of time it takes for my LCD to change all the crystals and show a new frame of, you know, picture on the screen.

664
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,515
Scott: 12 milliseconds comes out to about 75 hertz.

665
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:45,820
Scott: That's just how it works.

666
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,659
Scott: You're gonna want 12 milliseconds or less.

667
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,260
Scott: That's absolutely, like, a must these days.

668
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:52,919
Rym: We're not kidding.

669
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,000
Rym: Otherwise, you'll get something called ghosting.

670
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,019
Scott: Yeah, you're probably going to want eight, if not, you know, fewer is a little insane, but 12 or less.

671
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,940
Scott: Ghosting is this thing that used to happen with LCD monitors with greater than 12 millisecond refresh times.

672
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:14,239
Scott: What happens is, let's say you're playing a game, and a frame of the game comes in, and it's rendered on the LCD screen.

673
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:16,879
Scott: Then, you move.

674
00:46:17,162 --> 00:46:19,960
Scott: You know, let's say I look to the left in Quake, or I fire a rocket.

675
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,520
Scott: Then, it takes more than 12 milliseconds for the screen to refresh.

676
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,420
Scott: So, the little crystals are, like, moving around, but they're not moving fast enough.

677
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:38,440
Scott: So, what happens is, if I move too fast, eventually, I'll still see where I just was while I'm seeing where I am now.

678
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,280
Rym: It's like the mouse trails you can set in Windows, only it's not on purpose.

679
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:44,620
Scott: Yeah, it's bad.

680
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,158
Scott: It makes it look like there's a ghost.

681
00:46:46,864 --> 00:46:51,898
Rym: It's one advantage of CRTs if you're looking to buy on the cheap, is that that'll never, ever, ever happen on a CRT.

682
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:52,740
Scott: Never.

683
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,439
Scott: But, most LCDs now, even, like, the cheap ones you can get a new egg, have decent pixel response time, so you're okay.

684
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,660
Rym: Yeah, as long as you're not using, like, the LCD that came with the crapo computer you bought from Gateway.

685
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:06,549
Rym: Mm-hmm.

686
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:12,000
Scott: Now, one thing we forgot to talk about is the connectors to monitors.

687
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,119
Rym: They're basically for computers, too.

688
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:15,079
Scott: There are two.

689
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,679
Scott: Don't worry about any of the other things.

690
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,758
Scott: There's VGA and DVI.

691
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:21,559
Scott: Everything else is either old hat or TV.

692
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,840
Rym: Yeah, the other thing is there's a component thing that uses BNC, and if you try to pick up an old Arbiter Grille CRT anywhere on eBay, you might need a special connector for it.

693
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,660
Rym: And, so, basically, if you pick up an old CAD monitor, and it doesn't say it comes with a cable, don't buy it, because you're not going to find that cable easily.

694
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,980
Scott: Right now, VGA is probably the monitor cable you're all used to.

695
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,920
Scott: It looks like a little, uh, what's the name of that?

696
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,959
Rym: It looks like a serial port.

697
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,020
Rym: Like a trapezoid.

698
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,380
Rym: Yeah, it looks like a serial cable, only has an extra row of pins.

699
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:51,120
Scott: Exactly.

700
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,420
Scott: Um, you know, it's got the two screws on the side and whatever.

701
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:58,360
Scott: On that wire comes an analog signal.

702
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:00,080
Scott: Like, analog.

703
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,220
Scott: Not ones and zeros, but a wave.

704
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:13,820
Rym: Now, that's perfectly fine for CRT, because a CRT, while it puts a digital image on, it does it in an analog way, and you don't really gain much from sending a digital signal to the CRT.

705
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:16,220
Scott: Yeah, a CRT just takes analog to analog.

706
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,019
Scott: It's an analog display, and it has analog signal coming in.

707
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:24,579
Rym: I've seen very few CRTs for computers that had DVI input.

708
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,019
Scott: I've never seen a CRT with DVI.

709
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,280
Scott: I still don't even know if they exist.

710
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,220
Scott: They might, there might be one with a converter in it somewhere.

711
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,800
Rym: Yeah, but even then, it's really, you're not going to get any advantage from it.

712
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,213
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,720
Scott: DVI is a digital signal.

714
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:42,860
Scott: This is actually sending directly to your LCD monitor, you know, the layout of the pixels.

715
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,360
Scott: You're basically copying the frame buffer over the DVI, and some things I'm not going to explain, right to the monitor.

716
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,439
Rym: Now, that has a number of advantages.

717
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,800
Scott: Insane advantages, such as, you don't need an analog to digital conversion.

718
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,309
Rym: Yep.

719
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:04,560
Scott: The screen is displaying exactly what your video card rendered, with absolutely no interference and no possible mess-ups and no extra conversions, and it's fast.

720
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:11,800
Rym: I mean, it also means, if you want to it also means less heat from your video card, because your video card doesn't need a RAM DAC at the end anymore.

721
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,680
Scott: It's, it's just great all around.

722
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:21,040
Scott: Not only that, but your LCD is going to display exactly the right resolution all the time.

723
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:28,720
Rym: And you no longer have the problem of interference, not interference in your display, but your display causing the interference for other things.

724
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:37,280
Rym: Because VGA cables, which have been the standard for computer video for the past over a decade, God, they are incredibly noisy.

725
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:41,000
Rym: And if, in fact, there are laws as to how long a VGA cable can be.

726
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:45,280
Rym: They're also standards, because if they get too long, the signal doesn't really get there so well.

727
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:49,880
Rym: But if you make a long enough VGA cable, you can broadcast VGA into the air.

728
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:51,099
Rym: It's bad.

729
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,339
Scott: So if you can, you want to use DVI.

730
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,980
Scott: And this is the cable, it's sort of squarish, and at one end there'll be like a plus, and then there'll be like this grid with three rows of pins.

731
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:07,880
Rym: Now it might look a little different, because basically their H- DVI, one version of it is compatible with VGA.

732
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,340
Scott: Oh really?

733
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,300
Rym: Yeah, we've got some of those at work.

734
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,879
Rym: It's a different DVI cable that doesn't quite fit in other DVI.

735
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:18,040
Scott: Oh, well I've never seen that.

736
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,779
Scott: I don't think anyone's gonna have to worry about it.

737
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,760
Rym: Yeah, well I've run into it a lot where I work, but I think it's just because of the Lenovo computers we get.

738
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,600
Scott: Oh, and if you think this doesn't make a difference, I have a computer with a video card that has a DVI and a VGA.

739
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:37,660
Scott: I have two of the exact same LCD monitors, one of them connected by DVI, and one connected by VGA, and it makes a big freaking difference.

740
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,579
Scott: Like, I could switch them around, and if one of them didn't have a broken brightness, you could tell right away which one was which.

741
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,130
Rym: Yep.

742
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,760
Scott: So use DVI with an LCD whenever possible.

743
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,720
Rym: But at the same token, if you don't have DVI, don't worry about running out and buying a video card to upgrade.

744
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,020
Rym: Just wait until you get your next computer.

745
00:50:56,283 --> 00:51:01,540
Scott: Yeah, plus if you don't have a DVI cable, because one didn't come with your monitor or your video card, they're expensive.

746
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,320
Rym: Yeah, they're expensive ripoffs just like USB cables are.

747
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,934
Scott: Yeah, I've got one, but you can't have it, so...

748
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,620
Rym: Though if you need to find one, troll around on the internet for a deal.

749
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:16,160
Scott: Or you can buy a monitor on Newegg that comes with one, then you'll get one.

750
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,400
Rym: And you'll have a monitor, but then you'll have N-1 cables for N monitors.

751
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:21,759
Scott: Well, you can hook the other one up with VGA.

752
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:22,878
Scott: It'll be alright.

753
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:23,996
Rym: Yeah.

754
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,480
Scott: Anyway, so you're gonna want to use DVI whenever possible.

755
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,599
Scott: The last thing, of course, is the size of your LCD.

756
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,060
Scott: Now, when measuring LCD sizes, you can't compare them directly with CRT sizes.

757
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:40,656
Scott: A 17-inch LCD is generally equivalent to a 19-inch CRT.

758
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,940
Rym: Now, generally, because once again, manufacturers like to play all sorts of bullshit games with these numbers.

759
00:51:47,381 --> 00:51:52,328
Scott: Of course, and you'll always get the ones that are like, you know, "Yeah, this is a 19-inch LCD, 18-inch

760
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:52,570
Scott: viewable.".

761
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,636
Scott: Or, you know, "This is a 19-inch CRT, 17 and a half inches

762
00:51:58,716 --> 00:51:59,259
Scott: viewable.".

763
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,240
Scott: All kinds of crazy stuff.

764
00:52:02,504 --> 00:52:09,880
Scott: So, your best bet is if you're shopping, take a little tape measure, and measure from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of the viewable area.

765
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:12,700
Scott: And you'll get it exactly right every time.

766
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:17,059
Rym: Or, if you know what you're gonna buy or just looking, go to Best Buy and Circuit Seed and all that.

767
00:52:17,461 --> 00:52:18,138
Rym: Look at all of them.

768
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:22,900
Rym: When you find the one that's the right size that you want, then go order it on eBay for cheaper.

769
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,199
Rym: But at least you got to see it in person before you ordered it.

770
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,220
Scott: And of course, the resolutions of LCDs are kind of related to their inches.

771
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Scott: 17-inch LCDs typically are 1280 by 1024.

772
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,160
Scott: 19-inch ones are usually like 1600 by 1200.

773
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,640
Scott: They can go up to, depends.

774
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,840
Scott: You know, the 21 inches are almost always 1600 by 1200.

775
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:44,909
Rym: Yep.

776
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:52,420
Rym: Now, it's not really concerned with LCDs, because once again, when you buy it, it'll tell you in the instruction book, this is the resolution it runs at, and you run it at that resolution.

777
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,620
Scott: Yeah, some of them even like 2400.

778
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,419
Scott: It gets pretty insane.

779
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:04,400
Rym: Now, if you have a CRT, it's much trickier, because in that case, you can pick any resolution, and most CRTs can run at like 15 or 20 different resolutions.

780
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:12,300
Rym: So, a general rule is that pretty much the resolutions of LCDs and CRTs per size tend to match up.

781
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:20,400
Rym: If you're running a 17-inch monitor, which is the standard, most people run in 1024, or one step up or one step down from that.

782
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:24,220
Rym: If you go any lower, it'll be huge, you can't read anything.

783
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,399
Rym: Go any bigger, you won't be able to read any text.

784
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:33,420
Rym: Yeah, I currently run at 1152, which is an oddball out, and don't ask me why.

785
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:35,719
Rym: I have a lot of stupid reasons.

786
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,280
Rym: Mostly because my CRT is old as shit.

787
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:45,455
Scott: Yeah, I had a 17-inch CRT, I ran at 1024, now I run at 1280, which is what I want to run at, because I like 1280.

788
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:45,579
Rym: Yep.

789
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:58,419
Rym: I mean, plus CRTs, you're limited by the dot pitch, the thing I mentioned way back, because the smaller the dot pitch, the higher resolution you can go within the spectrum of what resolutions the monitor can display and still read text.

790
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:06,460
Rym: Because while a CRT will run at a resolution, it is analog and it's kind of fuzzy in terms of aiming that electron stream.

791
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,779
Rym: So pixels tend to grow and be larger than the point at which the light's actually coming out, and they tend to overlap.

792
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,260
Scott: Whereas in a LCD, where every pixel is perfectly square, and is exactly the same size as every other pixel.

793
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,200
Rym: That's the main benefit of an LCD, is that you don't have to fiddle with it.

794
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,139
Rym: You plug it in, you turn it on, and it looks the way it's gonna look.

795
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:38,040
Scott: And even if you plug in the analog signal to an LCD, there's usually an auto button, which will automatically size it up to fit your screen at the right resolution and everything.

796
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:51,418
Rym: Yeah, CRTs, you have to fiddle with them a whole bunch, and I don't have time to talk about that now, but if anyone has a CRT and wants to know how to fiddle, ask in the forums and I can give you all sorts of information that I don't feel like saying out loud right now.

797
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,179
Scott: There's one last thing I want to say, because you're talking about readability of text.

798
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:10,200
Scott: The disadvantage of LCDs is that when you want to read text on them, since everything is just perfect pixels, you usually end up getting these jaggy black letters, because they're all made of little tiny squares, but they're not too tiny.

799
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:15,320
Scott: So they're still jaggy little squares on a white background, and the text looks real crappy.

800
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:20,025
Rym: Yep, CRTs, because they're a little shittier and the pixels are more blurry, that's not an issue.

801
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:22,020
Rym: It's like CRTs have built-in anti-aliasing.

802
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,238
Scott: Something like that.

803
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:31,500
Scott: So what you're gonna have to do if you have an LCD is somewhere in your operating system, depending on Linux, Windows, Mac I think does it all on its own, don't worry about it.

804
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:32,159
Rym: Oh, of course Mac.

805
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,760
Rym: Yeah, right.

806
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:35,560
Rym: If you have a Mac, you don't need to even worry about what we're talking about.

807
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,520
Scott: There's something called sub-pixel rendering, or there's a thing in Windows you can go activate.

808
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,660
Scott: I forget what the hell it's called.

809
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,560
Rym: Isn't it the one that just says, like, make my fonts look something?

810
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,420
Scott: Yeah, it says, like, make my fonts look nicer.

811
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:48,120
Scott: I don't know, there's some easy button somewhere.

812
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,320
Scott: I actually think there's a website you can visit in Internet Explorer, and it says which of these fonts looks the best.

813
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,598
Rym: Yeah, I went to that.

814
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,059
Scott: And you click one, and it sets your thing right.

815
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:16,760
Scott: Where what happens is your computer will render your fonts with sub-pixel rendering, which basically means it'll know when it's drawing fonts, and it'll say, oh, this is where it will look jaggy, so I'll change the color of the pixel on the corner to make it right, so it looks normal and it's very nice and readable.

816
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,260
Rym: Yeah, it's basically anti-aliasing.

817
00:56:18,944 --> 00:56:19,698
Scott: It's not anti-aliasing.

818
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:21,399
Rym: But it has a similar effect.

819
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:22,658
Scott: Kind of.

820
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,180
Rym: As in, it softens the edges of jaggies by putting other bits there.

821
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,800
Scott: Yeah, that's part of what anti-aliasing does.

822
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,176
Scott: Yeah.

823
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:38,820
Scott: So, yeah, if you have an LCD monitor, and you plan on reading text, which I hope you do, enable sub-pixel rendering, whatever it's called, in your operating system.

824
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,312
Rym: Yep.

825
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,914
Rym: And I guess one last thing about CRT.

826
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,080
Rym: I said that you want the dot pitch to be as low as possible.

827
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:45,979
Rym: There's actually a drawback to that.

828
00:56:46,521 --> 00:57:03,520
Rym: If you get the dot pitch too low, if your monitor is that high quality, you'll actually get this artifact where basically patterns will appear on the screen, because the pixels are so small they actually become discrete, and the pixels as a whole, your brain will say, hey, there's a pattern there.

829
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:05,859
Rym: And you'll see, like, this swooshing pattern on your monitor.

830
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:15,960
Rym: And you'll have to go into your monitor's settings and turn on the moire cancellation thing, which will basically blur your pixels.

831
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,160
Scott: I've never had to turn that on, ever.

832
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:22,020
Rym: I've never had a monitor that had such a low dot pitch in my life.

833
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,500
Scott: But every monitor had the option.

834
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,192
Rym: Yep.

835
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,300
Rym: Well, part of it is that there's no line at which it occurs.

836
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,898
Rym: It depends on who you are and what your brain and your eyes do.

837
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:38,319
Rym: So if you get a monitor that has really, really low dot pitch, and you see swooshing artifacts, that's probably what it is.

838
00:57:39,741 --> 00:58:00,540
Scott: Now, if you're worried about colors being precise, as in, because someone asked about this, the color of the monitor matching colors in the real world matching colors if you go to the printer and print it out, you're really not going to get that unless you spend a lot of money on an ultra professional video card, an ultra professional monitor, an ultra professional printer that are all in a matching set.

839
00:58:01,284 --> 00:58:01,496
Rym: Yes.

840
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:13,979
Rym: I mean, it's easier with LCDs because gamma, I mentioned it earlier, the gamma curve, it's basically the intervals and the steps of brightness and color that a pixel will go through on just as you're looking at it.

841
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,179
Rym: And it's basically a curve.

842
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:22,760
Rym: So for every unit, pixel, brightness I want, it'll have a corresponding change in luminosity.

843
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:29,040
Rym: LCDs have a linear curve, as far as I can tell, or linear, as all you non-Michiganders.

844
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:29,700
Scott: Linear.

845
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,340
Rym: Whatever.

846
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:31,560
Rym: Pop.

847
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:31,969
Rym: It's pop.

848
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:32,840
Rym: I drink soda.

849
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,678
Rym: I drink pop.

850
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,420
Scott: We should make a new brand of soda, linear soda.

851
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,433
Rym: But anyway, there's no curve there.

852
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:47,020
Rym: So even if the colors aren't accurate in an absolute sense, they're always generally accurate relative to each other.

853
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,600
Rym: On a CRT, there's actually a gamma curve.

854
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:52,500
Rym: It's a function of how CRTs work.

855
00:58:53,281 --> 00:59:06,400
Rym: And if you want the colors to be accurate in terms of professional design, you either need to run some sort of gamma correction, which will be a function of your video card, read the documentation, or you have to get a professional monitor that does that on its own.

856
00:59:07,102 --> 00:59:09,500
Rym: If the monitor says it's CAD ready, it'll do it.

857
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,299
Rym: If it doesn't say anything like that, you're on your own.

858
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,480
Scott: So basically what you need to do if you want perfect color is calibrate it somewhat manually.

859
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,300
Scott: You have to get some sort of, like, color reference.

860
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,298
Scott: Maybe, I don't know, what do they call them?

861
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,280
Rym: The test patterns?

862
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:26,855
Scott: Yeah.

863
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,838
Scott: Get one of those up there.

864
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:32,319
Scott: Get a piece of paper with those little palettes on them.

865
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,520
Scott: Match up the colors right.

866
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,040
Scott: Then print something out and look at those.

867
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,699
Scott: And, you know, it's not too much to modify with an LCD.

868
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,540
Scott: I mean, you got brightness and contrast usually.

869
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,060
Scott: Maybe a few other settings.

870
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:50,440
Scott: It's mostly going to be video card settings that you're going to have to worry about there, because you can really mess with colors in the video card area.

871
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,620
Rym: Now, read your documentation.

872
00:59:51,740 --> 01:00:00,038
Rym: Most video cards have a little utility where they'll put an image on the screen, and they'll say, "Adjust this parameter until this thing is no longer

873
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:00,440
Rym: visible.".

874
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:02,460
Scott: I know, the NVIDIA driver has that.

875
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,140
Scott: There's a little color modification screen where there's, like, a bunch of-- there's three sliders for red, green, and blue.

876
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:07,472
Scott: Yep.

877
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:13,600
Scott: And it displays this really lots of colors picture in a little box, and you can slide them until that picture looks just right.

878
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,229
Rym: Yep.

879
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,420
Rym: But some of them have actual expert systems where they ask you to do a whole bunch of tasks in a row.

880
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,680
Rym: Like, they'll say, "Move this slider until this box and this box are the same color.

881
01:00:23,122 --> 01:00:26,098
Rym: Then move this slider until you can tell the difference between this box and this

882
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:26,340
Rym: box.".

883
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,099
Rym: And when you're done, your monitor will be as calibrated as it's going to be.

884
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:42,280
Rym: Now, things like Photoshop and other photo/video editing solution things often will have gamma correction or color correction things built into them.

885
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:45,819
Rym: And a lot of these programs can interact with each other, and there are all these sorts of standards for that.

886
01:00:46,322 --> 01:00:50,680
Rym: But that's all software, and well beyond the scope of the hardware we're talking about today.

887
01:00:51,843 --> 01:00:57,400
Scott: As long as your monitor isn't ass, you'll be able to get colors that are good enough for any person.

888
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:08,260
Scott: And if you need them to be better because you're some crazy, wicked printing lots and lots of stuff, you know, in a giant printing facility professional, you've got enough money to buy something fancy.

889
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:15,359
Scott: All right, so if you're going to get a monitor or you already got one, now you know how it works and all that.

890
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:18,740
Rym: Yeah, we skipped over a lot of the technical details for a lot of reasons.

891
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,060
Rym: I mean, look how long we've gone already.

892
01:01:20,282 --> 01:01:22,139
Scott: Yeah, and also they're kind of boring.

893
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,700
Rym: Yeah, if you really want to know, just look on Wikipedia, because Wikipedia, actually, we were poking around for sources.

894
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,459
Rym: They have great articles on CRTs and LCDs.

895
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:40,559
Scott: You also want to look up DLP for projectors, TFTs, maybe OLEDs, LCOS.

896
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,140
Scott: Those are just some more acronyms to look up for related informations.

897
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,660
Scott: Active matrix, passive matrix.

898
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,820
Rym: We're going to do another show some point in the future, not next week, but some other week coming up on television technology.

899
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,720
Scott: Which are some of the ones they just talked about.

900
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,760
Rym: I mean, it's kind of the same.

901
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,540
Rym: There are LCD televisions, there are CRT televisions, but there's also, you know, front projection, rear projection.

902
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,220
Scott: Gas plasma, liquid crystal on silicon, all kinds of crazy stuff.

903
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:06,720
Rym: Yep.

904
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,099
Rym: Hiring a guy to stand and act shows out for you.

905
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:10,119
Scott: That's the best one.

906
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:10,613
Scott: Oh, yeah.

907
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:20,190
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

908
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,829
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

909
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:27,629
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

910
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,690
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

911
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:31,628
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

912
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,630
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

913
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,277
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

914
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,750
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

915
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,670
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

916
01:02:50,394 --> 01:02:53,550
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
