1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,657
Rym: It's Thursday June 11th.

2
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:12,298
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,384
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:17,963
Rym: We're gonna talk about losing stuff But it doesn't really go anywhere.

5
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:26,614
Rym: I'll be honest Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:34,668
Rym: So I realized that I start almost every show with the word so.

7
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:41,969
Scott: So yeah, I was listening to old episodes to start with the word knit instead or perhaps weave.

8
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:48,408
Rym: so anyway yesterday was.

9
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:56,978
Rym: It is rare, you know, usually when I have some sort of task before me some sort of journey I have to take some sort of thing I have to do.

10
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,689
Rym: that requires a lot of coordination has a lot of variables.

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:04,629
Rym: I plan it very meticulously and It always works out.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,530
Rym: Okay, but every now and then you run into the situation where you plan with allowances.

13
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,500
Scott: That's why you were home like not yesterday.

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,755
Rym: This is why I didn't get home until like 1045 last night Uh-huh.

15
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:16,990
Scott: I thought I was mistaken.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,879
Scott: I thought we had to do a show yesterday, but I was wrong.

17
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,296
Rym: No, but then today you're like We don't have to do a show today.

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,889
Rym: The last year we did was on Tuesday and today's Thursday.

19
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:33,130
Rym: So I was in a situation where I allowed for error at each step of the way which we do.

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,520
Rym: I mean anytime we're going to a con and the maximum error occurred at each step.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,700
Rym: the maximum possible error occurred at every Possible step of this journey.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,645
Scott: I just get to the point.

23
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:49,227
Rym: So Here's the task set before Rym I had to meet with my lawyer whose office is in White Plains.

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:02:00,150
Rym: Well actually Technically it is in Tarrytown Directly equidistant between the White Plains train station on the Harlem line and the Tarrytown train station on the Hudson line.

25
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:01,798
Scott: So you did you.

26
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:04,010
Scott: obviously you tried to take a train and then a cab or what?

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,334
Rym: So beyond that I needed to when I arrived at this lawyer have a cashier's check for some $20,000 Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:13,520
Rym: No big deal.

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,787
Rym: I come into the city.

30
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,810
Rym: I'm like, all right I can't go to the bank in Beacon because it opens it like eight and closes it like four.

31
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,107
Rym: And I think all right, there's got to be a branch in the city.

32
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:23,590
Rym: I get to work.

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,220
Scott: I'm doing stuff around 830 branches in the city.

34
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,630
Rym: The nearest branch is in like Yonkers.

35
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,341
Scott: Yeah, cuz you have a fuck bank.

36
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:31,923
Rym: Actually.

37
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,867
Rym: I have one of the biggest banks.

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:33,450
Scott: Uh-huh.

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,510
Rym: But anyway, it's not in the city not in the city, but it's everywhere out.

40
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,763
Scott: Foreign banks in the city, but not yours.

41
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:46,050
Rym: So I Look and I see sure enough within a mile of the train station in White Plains and I've been there.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,336
Rym: He's to work over near that area.

43
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:51,312
Rym: In fact, that's the mall right there where I bought the iMac Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,142
Rym: So my bank has a branch there that is open not until 4 but until 7.

45
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,290
Rym: Yeah, so my whole plan comes together.

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,970
Rym: I'm gonna leave work at 4 catch the 420 Harlem line train to White Plains.

47
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:07,870
Rym: I'm gonna take a leisurely walk get some food go to this bank get a cashier's check.

48
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,170
Rym: I assume that there's gonna be trouble and that's gonna take a half hour.

49
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,275
Scott: I would have assumed an hour.

50
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,082
Rym: No as in from the moment.

51
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,990
Rym: I say I would like a cashier's check.

52
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,890
Rym: I expected a half hour of BS.

53
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,496
Rym: Okay, no No, the walk everything was accounted for.

54
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,050
Rym: then I was gonna walk back to the train station pick up one of those cabs.

55
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,989
Rym: I'm gonna take the cab to the lawyer's office.

56
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,450
Rym: I'm either gonna tell the cab to wait cab couldn't find the lawyer's office.

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,030
Rym: That was a bad idea or I lined up to have another cab meet me there after I'm done with the lawyer.

58
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:38,870
Scott: The cab is never gonna know how to get to the lawyer's office.

59
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,740
Scott: You need to get the lawyer to come get you.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,006
Rym: I knew where the lawyers office was.

61
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:42,710
Rym: I could point them out.

62
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,116
Rym: Like I I drove.

63
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,250
Rym: I drove past that like every day when I used to work over there.

64
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,259
Rym: I knew exactly where all this stuff was.

65
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,464
Rym: I was totally set.

66
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,392
Rym: I Start to go.

67
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,616
Rym: I get on the train I go up.

68
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:59,314
Rym: I Can't find the bank.

69
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:02,470
Rym: I realize it's inside of the stop-and-shop and I go in there.

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,420
Rym: There it is the bank in the stop-and-shop.

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,942
Scott: This is bad.

72
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,470
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

73
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:11,062
Rym: So I walk up and I'm like hi I'd like a cashier's check and they're like, oh, yeah for how much?

74
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:16,897
Rym: and I tell him we go back and forth and then they go when they come back and they're like We're out of cashier's checks.

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,570
Scott: real so they could have done it, but they didn't have any.

76
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,752
Rym: What do you mean?

77
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,096
Rym: you're out of cashier's checks?

78
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:22,760
Rym: You're a bank.

79
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:23,724
Scott: you print them.

80
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:24,627
Scott: They have a printer.

81
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,558
Rym: I was like fine Can I have a certified check?

82
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,502
Rym: I'll just pay the difference.

83
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,169
Rym: They're like, yeah, we're out of those two.

84
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,225
Rym: So after a dumbfounded minute, I asked is there any way I can get this money?

85
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,450
Rym: and they're like, well you could withdraw it.

86
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,321
Rym: You just have to fill out a government form.

87
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,830
Rym: and for a second I considered this till I realized that that's incredibly stupid.

88
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,599
Rym: I did not want to be taking a cab in White Plains and then walking to a train station with $20,000 in hundreds in a briefcase.

89
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,622
Scott: Yeah, it's a bad idea.

90
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:55,592
Rym: They offered to give me a briefcase too Really?

91
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:56,596
Rym: They apologized.

92
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:57,559
Rym: They were so nice.

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,803
Rym: But fuck that bank.

94
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,766
Scott: They'd give you a brief.

95
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,030
Scott: It was a stop-and-shop bank.

96
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,235
Scott: It's not an actual branch.

97
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,460
Scott: It's a convenience brand.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,464
Rym: It was an actual branch.

99
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,949
Rym: really in a stop-and-shop It's a full branch.

100
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,770
Scott: Usually the branches in the stop-and-shop are just convenience branch.

101
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,710
Rym: Actually no, from what I can tell the branches in the stop-and-shops are better than normal branches because they're open a lot later.

102
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:20,326
Scott: Well, they do have better hours But they're mostly just for people to line up and deposit their checks.

103
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:27,450
Rym: You realize that At least for good banks if any branch can do all the services of the bank except for very special services.

104
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,603
Rym: So if it says branch you can do what you need to do.

105
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,169
Rym: I could have gone and applied for a mortgage there.

106
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:44,050
Rym: So after talking to them for a little while and determining that they're useless and they at some point they're like well How about this if we give you a new account and transfer all your money into that?

107
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,327
Rym: Then we can give you starter checks and then you can write a starter check.

108
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:55,999
Rym: and I was like Do you think the lawyer that is going to take this and give it to another lawyer to put in escrow is going to take A starter check number one for twenty thousand dollars?

109
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,209
Rym: and she was like, yeah, that probably wouldn't work.

110
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,313
Rym: So I was like fine.

111
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:01,895
Rym: Never mind.

112
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:02,336
Rym: Fuck it.

113
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:03,621
Rym: I'll sort this out.

114
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:03,922
Rym: Later.

115
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,250
Rym: I walked back to the terror town train station.

116
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,626
Rym: All right, I walk up to a cab like art.

117
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,270
Rym: I'll just go to the lawyer.

118
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,496
Rym: Anyway deal with the rest of it.

119
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,024
Rym: I'll wire in the money or something later.

120
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:14,930
Rym: Mm-hmm I walk as I walk up to the cabbie.

121
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:20,189
Rym: I remember the task that I did not complete at the bank because I was so vexed.

122
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,379
Rym: I did not withdraw money.

123
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,970
Rym: No regular money because you see independently.

124
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,796
Scott: Well, this is this is your fault here.

125
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:30,650
Rym: independently of all this my ATM card, which is also a debit card expired.

126
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,189
Rym: Oh, right has never happened to me in my life.

127
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,170
Rym: So I didn't expect it and I asked my bank and they mailed me a new one.

128
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,982
Rym: They're like, yeah, we had no money for this cab.

129
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,634
Rym: I had I had $33.

130
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,370
Scott: that's enough for the cab.

131
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,144
Rym: All right, but I have no way to get more cash at all.

132
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,897
Scott: after you get to the lawyer You can get some cash.

133
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,907
Rym: Well, I could ask the lawyer to front me some money.

134
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,237
Scott: You're giving a 20,000 he can front.

135
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:55,820
Scott: he's a lawyer.

136
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,222
Scott: He's got.

137
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,950
Rym: I was giving him money to put into escrow.

138
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,056
Rym: I wasn't giving him money.

139
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,746
Scott: You're gonna give him money also.

140
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:03,575
Scott: All right, he's Knows you're gonna pay him back.

141
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,744
Scott: And if you don't he knows how to come after you.

142
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:06,406
Rym: imagine this.

143
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:10,018
Rym: Here's my $20,000 check to buy this house.

144
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:14,150
Rym: and yeah, can I borrow 50 bucks to get on the train to take a cab?

145
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,629
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure the lawyer you being such a good customer should get a car for you.

146
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,809
Rym: No, so I walk up to the cab, you know There's a million cabs lined up and I'm like if you can't take credit and the guy just starts laughing.

147
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,543
Rym: So I was like how much to this address?

148
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:29,690
Rym: and he's like, where is that?

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,316
Rym: So I'm like, I know exactly where it is.

150
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,983
Rym: I tell him he's like 15 bucks.

151
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:40,644
Rym: All right, so I'm like Okay, I can probably do this mmm-hmm, however, okay, whatever.

152
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:42,690
Rym: so I get to there the lawyers running late.

153
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:47,530
Rym: I don't actually talk to him until like 7 which is fine cuz I didn't get there to like 645.

154
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,535
Scott: No, the banks closed now.

155
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,202
Rym: No, it was too late to get money.

156
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,729
Rym: Anyway, I know I'd given up on that.

157
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:57,750
Rym: I had already resigned Called the lawyer and then went home now because I had to sign the contracts.

158
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,915
Rym: Anyway, I can wire him the money.

159
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,883
Rym: Mm-hmm contract was the important part.

160
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,027
Rym: we go over that.

161
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:02,730
Rym: He's great.

162
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,330
Rym: I might talk to him about our the stuff we need for GeekNights, too.

163
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,248
Rym: Cuz he knows some people but he's far away.

164
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,579
Scott: Not really Well, if we got to go see him we're driving.

165
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,302
Rym: Yeah.

166
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:13,443
Rym: Yeah.

167
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,110
Rym: It's actually a really easy drive.

168
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,830
Rym: I only didn't drive because I would have had to pull such shenanigans like drive to Tarrytown in the morning park.

169
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,120
Rym: They're going to the city is an idea.

170
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,910
Scott: Just don't go to work that day.

171
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,207
Rym: I had to go to work because I have important work schedule the shit for another day.

172
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:34,342
Rym: I had to do it right away For other reasons, so I take care of this.

173
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:34,946
Rym: I'm all set.

174
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,708
Rym: I leave.

175
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,004
Rym: I Call the number of the cab service that I looked up before I went there.

176
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:40,466
Rym: Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,068
Rym: No answer.

178
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,022
Rym: So I walk to the Marriott next door and I'm like, alright Can I get a cab and pay for it with a credit card?

179
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,307
Rym: They were like, yeah, probably not.

180
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:52,684
Rym: I was like fine And I just get a cab and they're like sure.

181
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:53,550
Rym: they give me a bunch of numbers.

182
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,820
Rym: I call a cab and he's like, yeah 15 bucks.

183
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,870
Rym: How long will it take for you to get here?

184
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,443
Rym: I can pick you up in 45 minutes.

185
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,638
Rym: I look at when the next train is.

186
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,748
Rym: I realized that if he picks me up in 45 minutes I will miss it.

187
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:10,450
Rym: It will be faster to walk the two and a half miles at the train station than a way for the stupid cab.

188
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,296
Scott: Yeah, oh two and a half miles is not bad.

189
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:20,970
Rym: So I start walking down a sidewalk-less freeway Completely in the dark in the middle of nowhere across white plains and Tarrytown.

190
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,119
Rym: All right in a suit and wearing dress shoes.

191
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,383
Rym: All right, that was.

192
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:26,967
Rym: that took a while.

193
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:27,850
Scott: Yeah, that's fun.

194
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:36,150
Rym: It took me about 40 minutes to walk that partly because of the boots and the resulting blister Also because of the fact that I didn't actually get dinner because I was in a hurry.

195
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,890
Scott: This is a Harlem train that was taking you back to Grand Central.

196
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,169
Rym: No, no, no No, I took the Harlem train up.

197
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,070
Rym: Then I was gonna walk the rest of the way to Tarrytown and take that train home.

198
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:50,150
Rym: Okay, so I don't walk to that train and then the rest of my trip was fine.

199
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,866
Rym: But you know, it takes an hour to get home from there.

200
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,336
Scott: That was it.

201
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:53,901
Rym: That was it.

202
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:54,870
Rym: Nothing crazy happened.

203
00:09:55,432 --> 00:10:04,829
Rym: I ran into some strange people walking to the train station, you know I'm a guy in a suit walking in the dark and People wonder what's up with that?

204
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,230
Rym: So a lot of people pulled their car over and asked me stuff, but no one was willing to give me a ride.

205
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:10,577
Scott: What do they ask you?

206
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,950
Rym: one guy was like, what are you doing out at night?

207
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,974
Rym: Someone's gonna break your?

208
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,737
Rym: do something something.

209
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,364
Rym: and they drove off in Tarrytown.

210
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,067
Scott: who's gonna break your?

211
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:17,449
Scott: what it's?

212
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,312
Rym: Terry I was.

213
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,000
Rym: I was actually on the border between Tarrytown and white plains.

214
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:22,384
Rym: It's fine.

215
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,410
Scott: I don't know who's gonna break anything.

216
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:28,204
Rym: People basically pulled over and yelled weird stuff at me and kept driving.

217
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,670
Rym: All right, it was weird.

218
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,117
Rym: What can I say?

219
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,163
Rym: why would someone do that?

220
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:34,108
Rym: I don't know they're weird.

221
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,215
Scott: Yeah, okay.

222
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:37,018
Rym: That's it.

223
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,068
Rym: It was just fail every step of the way.

224
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,317
Scott: That wasn't such fail.

225
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:42,360
Scott: You mean mid homes?

226
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,204
Rym: Yeah, I succeeded.

227
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:53,440
Scott: I also I would have driven Yeah, but that introduced extra complications, but it would have helped with the cab situation Yeah, but it would have avoided all that bullshit.

228
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,695
Scott: you probably could have driven to a further away Bank You could have done all sorts of stuff.

229
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:01,966
Rym: Well one white play you realize the traffic and white planes around that time You basically can't drive.

230
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,140
Scott: No, but you could have you know parked and and got.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,375
Scott: you could have gotten to a place to park that was close and then Walked and you know, nah anyway That's all I got.

232
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,825
Scott: Yeah, is it?

233
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:14,610
Scott: we're not good to news?

234
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,555
Scott: I don't think there's not.

235
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,248
Scott: all the news is all sorts of tech gaming.

236
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:23,385
Rym: news For the proper days is all the rhetoric about how the new the drugs are.

237
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:28,987
Rym: said we're gonna end the war on drugs But then Obama made clear that no that doesn't mean legalize.

238
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,961
Scott: So oh So we'll still keep it illegal, but we'll just stop enforcing make it.

239
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,490
Rym: No, basically we'll make it slightly less illegal.

240
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,602
Scott: Yeah, that's not stopping the war on drugs

241
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:53,664
Rym: to a degree because if you stop the quote-unquote war I guess that basically just means stop all the rhetoric stop funding all the programs that don't work like dare and I don't know lower the minimum sentences or get rid of them.

242
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:56,950
Scott: I Mean, you know every little bit is good.

243
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,950
Rym: But I guess I'm just always disappointed that every time I see news that's like Obama administration does something crazy.

244
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:08,507
Rym: Awesome, if I read the articles like they basically completely backpedal to almost where they started by the end of it.

245
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,760
Rym: Yeah But who?

246
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:11,790
Rym: I don't know who to blame more?

247
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:16,366
Rym: I can't really blame the administration so much as the media for lying to me through headlines yet again.

248
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:23,534
Scott: Mm-hmm Well, you know, they got to boil everything down, you know to its simplest, you know, what levels of discourse episode I think we talked about that.

249
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:23,755
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:24,418
Rym: Okay.

251
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:25,622
Rym: Let's just get right on with it.

252
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,430
Scott: Okay, so you want to just do things today?

253
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,031
Rym: I think so.

254
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:38,270
Rym: So then moving right along here Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

255
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,558
Rym: I'm sure you all know that by the time you listen to this The Red Wings will have won the Stanley Cup again.

256
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:42,859
Rym: who?

257
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,562
Scott: what if they didn't?

258
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,884
Scott: I am so sure that Game sevens are basically a coin toss.

259
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,593
Rym: I am Absolutely.

260
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:50,874
Rym: Sure.

261
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,944
Rym: I guarantee a hundred percent.

262
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,010
Rym: The Red Wings are going to win.

263
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,275
Scott: It's totally 50/50.

264
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,398
Rym: No, they're not even close.

265
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,045
Scott: So so what if they don't?

266
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:01,847
Scott: what do you do?

267
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,790
Rym: There's no possibility.

268
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:08,050
Scott: Well, you have a guarantee which means a guarantee means that if it doesn't happen then you have to somehow.

269
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:13,690
Rym: Well, you know one I reference the movie Tommy Boy and two it doesn't matter because they're gonna win.

270
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,310
Rym: Ah, the Red Wings are absolutely going to win the Stanley.

271
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,965
Rym: In fact, you can effectively say that they already have won it for 2009.

272
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:34,183
Scott: Yes My thing today is the Red Wings winning the Stanley Cup in 2008 against the same team The same team which is now You know, which was a young team and is now older and more experienced.

273
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,350
Scott: Then the Red Wings is now.

274
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,089
Scott: They were old last year and experienced.

275
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,494
Scott: now They are just old.

276
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:44,506
Scott: old but because that's the penguins are only getting it better.

277
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,790
Scott: The Red Wings are only getting it worse.

278
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:46,703
Rym: I don't think so.

279
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,156
Scott: It's a young team versus an old team.

280
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:49,858
Scott: That's how it is.

281
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:49,938
Scott: Now.

282
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,689
Rym: Welcome to the world, but the Red Wings are just so good.

283
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:56,089
Rym: They just keep getting better.

284
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,661
Scott: No, in fact, they're worse than they were last year.

285
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,848
Scott: That's why they're in game seven.

286
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,861
Scott: last year They won well before game seven.

287
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,069
Rym: No, that was just flukes.

288
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:10,870
Rym: They see I'm gonna say I'm not gonna back this up at all that they pushed it to game seven.

289
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:12,782
Scott: How many hockey games did you even watch this year?

290
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,009
Rym: To make it more fun?

291
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,576
Rym: Anyway, they're definitely gonna win.

292
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,470
Rym: So my alternate thing of the day is this old NHL.

293
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:27,450
Rym: I don't know how old it is But it's an animation of the raising of the cup comprised of cup raisings from past Stanley Cup championships.

294
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,656
Scott: Yeah I just want to point out though that ESPN people's think the Penguins are gonna win just so ESPN's wrong because they are.

295
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,603
Scott: they're the what they're because here here is the.

296
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,930
Scott: here's the argument for why the penguins are gonna win.

297
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,135
Rym: I can see one argument.

298
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,118
Rym: they could make the argument.

299
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,306
Rym: That was the same reason why the Red Wings won in 96.

300
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:46,014
Scott: No Here's the correct argument.

301
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:46,455
Scott: Right?

302
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:50,927
Scott: The Penguins this year beat the Capitals away in game seven.

303
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,170
Scott: They're gonna do the same thing.

304
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,330
Rym: Yeah But I got it down.

305
00:14:54,471 --> 00:15:01,381
Rym: I've read a lot of articles in the past talking about how the Joe Luce arena is Statistically the most inhospitable away team arena there is.

306
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,666
Scott: I don't think it matters.

307
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:03,790
Rym: I think it does.

308
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,314
Rym: I don't think so.

309
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,450
Rym: Anyway, they're gonna win so it doesn't matter.

310
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:13,789
Scott: How could it possibly be more inhospitable than the freakin capitals where every single human being is wearing red and screaming?

311
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,290
Scott: The entire game I point doesn't get more inhospitable than that.

312
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:23,110
Rym: I point out that the Red Wings Actually used to cheat and their bench for the opposing team was shorter and the door was hard.

313
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,397
Scott: Yeah, but they're no longer cheating.

314
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,550
Rym: So I'm sure they're cheating in some other way.

315
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:31,461
Rym: Anyway, plus Joe Lewis's fist is right there.

316
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,306
Scott: It's outside where you can't punch you.

317
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,168
Rym: It's right next door.

318
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:34,670
Rym: Just waiting.

319
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:38,990
Scott: Yeah, if you go outside, it'll punch you but it can't punch you while you're ice skating.

320
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:49,082
Scott: So I was reading on Boing Boing that apparently it's illegal to possess Anything that belongs to an eagle.

321
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,629
Rym: so what I knock off his car.

322
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:51,954
Rym: What not like?

323
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:55,446
Scott: if you have an eagle feather you can get in serious trouble like $10,000 fines and worse.

324
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,656
Scott: Right, and that's that's pretty rough.

325
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:07,770
Scott: Obviously, it's the stop eagle poaching, but I think it has a side effect on oh shit An eagle feather landed in my yard and now I'm in trouble, right?

326
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:26,170
Scott: Also, it was pretty interesting because people were talking about how like at the veterinary places with it to take care of Eagles They have to take all of these sort of Eagle refuse and send it to this place that the government runs and then if Native Americans want said Eagle refuse like feathers for their kinds of stuff that they need it for.

327
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:33,270
Scott: Then they have to make like these bureaucratic requests that made that you know are very stringent and can be denied and such.

328
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:44,450
Scott: So yeah, so anyway in the comments of this post on Boing Boing talking all about owning Eagle bits Someone posted a link to a video and they said this guy's in serious trouble.

329
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:49,190
Scott: And this guy is some dude and it looks like he has an airport or something in the backyard.

330
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:57,100
Scott: I can't tell but he had 30 bald eagles in the backyard and His kids were playing with the bald eagles in the backyard.

331
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,637
Scott: and the reason that the Eagles were there was because they attracted them With the red seven.

332
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,089
Rym: Ah, the red salmon would attract me as well.

333
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:12,144
Scott: Yes, so they had the red salmon and like 30 bald eagles in the backyard and they weren't hunting them They were just having them in the backyard going on my hands.

334
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,564
Scott: Look at that 30 bald eagles and put it on youtubes and such.

335
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,868
Rym: but They're actually not super endangered anymore.

336
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:26,050
Scott: Yeah, so as I said, it used to be wicked endangered, but because they were protected so much they're only kind of sort of endangered.

337
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,450
Rym: Well, actually there there is a sliding scale and they are a least concern.

338
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:29,992
Rym: It is the.

339
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,292
Rym: it is the least endangered you can be and still be on the endangered list Exactly.

340
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:40,110
Scott: It's like, you know, they're not like say seagulls or pigeons to where it's like who the fuck cares.

341
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,074
Scott: There's a bajillion of them.

342
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:41,999
Scott: There's probably too many.

343
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:46,581
Scott: but they're also not like say Pandas where it's like fuck this five.

344
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:51,344
Scott: I Think there's more than five pandas, but you know, there's at least seven.

345
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,598
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot more than that I think but there's still not.

346
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,090
Scott: not a whole lot anyway.

347
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,608
Scott: so 30 bald eagles in the backyard video pretty cool.

348
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:02,055
Scott: So Today's episode I want to.

349
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,284
Rym: well tonight's tonight's episode.

350
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:04,866
Scott: You're correct.

351
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:05,087
Scott: Yes.

352
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:13,360
Scott: We're going to talk about Losing things because everyone in their life loses things, you know physical things, you know, they they disappear.

353
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:22,410
Scott: and You know, I lost something recently and it's sort of obvious and inevitable and foreshadowed years in advance.

354
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:23,654
Scott: Do you know what?

355
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,801
Rym: I lost you lost those expensive sunglasses?

356
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:26,683
Rym: Absolutely.

357
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:27,546
Rym: I can't believe it.

358
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:36,650
Scott: So Uh, so basically I realized not only did I lose them but I have determined scientifically why I lost them.

359
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:43,010
Rym: All right, I'm curious because I'd I you know, everyone's different about this, but I'm actually I rarely lose things.

360
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,839
Scott: See I used to but I'll tell you my losing history.

361
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,321
Scott: Why not?

362
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:46,622
Scott: Right?

363
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,023
Rym: All right.

364
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,615
Scott: So back in the day back Back in the day, right?

365
00:18:52,097 --> 00:19:00,543
Scott: I would lose shit and it was all I would never lose like completely normal shit Like oh I lost a pencil I would always lose the expensive thing, right?

366
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:06,610
Scott: And the reason was this number one If I had an expensive thing like say a fancy pen, right?

367
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,516
Scott: I'd want to use it a lot.

368
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:27,674
Scott: So I'd be bringing it all around thus increasing the chances of losing it Multifold right and also because it was such a special thing I would always be you know Treating it precariously and differently from other things putting it in special places and such and such Preteriously?

369
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:28,095
Scott: Yes.

370
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:30,265
Rym: That's that's quite an adjective there.

371
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:34,590
Scott: Yes, and thus Also increasing his chances of being lost, right?

372
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:41,330
Scott: If I would have just kept it in the pencil box with all the other pencils, it would have been just fine You know, but no I had to put it in a special place.

373
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,664
Scott: So we didn't get all messed up by all those regular pencils in the pencil box.

374
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,230
Scott: Of course it got lost, right?

375
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:56,359
Scott: I would also often lose watches wristwatches and I'm pretty sure if I still wore wristwatches I would still lose them because Number one right the wristwatch.

376
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,102
Rym: How could you lose it?

377
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,086
Rym: It's on your wrist.

378
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:01,370
Scott: Okay, so here's the thing Right the wristwatch while you're wearing it.

379
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:06,101
Scott: It's not a problem and if you get a waterproof one it's even better because you can bring it in the pool and such.

380
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,422
Scott: so it's even.

381
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:10,050
Scott: you know, you're hardly ever gonna lose it but They're sort of uncomfortable.

382
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,999
Scott: So I never liked.

383
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,565
Scott: actually I liked having them Wet, you know in the days before cell phones so I could tell the time but I never.

384
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,890
Scott: they were never comfortable on my arm.

385
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,360
Scott: I always used to get a Timex You know the kind that had the two big buttons on the front.

386
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,110
Rym: You gotta get the nice one with some sort of leather strap.

387
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,316
Rym: Anyway, I hate more comfortable.

388
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,683
Scott: Even though it's still uncomfortable to me.

389
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,165
Scott: I can't.

390
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,770
Scott: I hate a wristwatch anyway So it was always uncomfortable.

391
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,565
Scott: So for example, I would take it off when I went to bed or take it off for a shower.

392
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:41,483
Scott: or you know I would take it off and put it on adjusted adjusted, you know such and such.

393
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:49,563
Scott: maybe if I was like timing something Rather than like poke at the buttons while it was on my wrist I would take it off and hold it in one hand to get more accurate.

394
00:20:49,643 --> 00:21:00,830
Scott: Stop watching activity, right and Because of this constant maneuvering of the watch it was inevitable that I would lose track of it Especially since you know, I might not wear it every day.

395
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,189
Scott: So then it's like you don't remember if you're wearing it or if you're not wearing it or whatnot, right?

396
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,790
Scott: So the sunglasses, right?

397
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:13,710
Scott: So my whole life I've always bought cheap sunglasses because a I would lose them and B I would break them.

398
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,609
Scott: So I figured hey, I'm better off buying cheap ones.

399
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,441
Scott: That way I can break them and lose them and just buy another one.

400
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:25,061
Rym: see now that's the opposite of my philosophy Which is buy the best possible and keep them forever.

401
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,950
Scott: and I changed my strategy to that very strategy.

402
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,939
Scott: Yet all the whole time.

403
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,093
Scott: I was still thinking I'm going to fucking lose these things I'm gonna break them.

404
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:33,937
Scott: who knows what the fuck?

405
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:40,210
Scott: in fact, actually they were made of plastic as opposed to metal Which is sort of like hey, I paid $200 for these like a plastic instead of metal.

406
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,683
Scott: But actually that's better because it doesn't change in shape like metal ones.

407
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:49,208
Rym: bend right and then well Well, I mean if you get nice titanium ones, they don't they just bend right back.

408
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:49,750
Rym: That's true.

409
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,804
Scott: But you know the plastic ones they just stay in the same nice shape.

410
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,110
Scott: and the polarized lenses?

411
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,970
Scott: I was just so much better than the regular lenses and they were more comfortable.

412
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:02,049
Scott: The only complaint I really had with them is that my hair got caught in them, which is annoying and hurt.

413
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:06,430
Scott: But anyway, so I was very careful not to lose them.

414
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:14,469
Scott: But losing them was inevitable and the reason is thus number one Sunglasses don't stay on your face all the time.

415
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:19,206
Scott: You got to take them off when it's not sunny or if you're inside or who knows what right?

416
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:19,728
Scott: All right.

417
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,476
Scott: number two There is not when you take them off.

418
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,148
Scott: There isn't really a secure place to put them right.

419
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:26,850
Scott: that is consistent.

420
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,222
Scott: Like for example, Mike I used to lose wallets occasionally not too often.

421
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:39,730
Scott: I've lost I think two wallets, but I wouldn't lose them often because a I would always keep them in the same exact secure place front right pocket.

422
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,357
Scott: It was never in a different place.

423
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,124
Scott: front pocket, of course.

424
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:46,201
Scott: Whoa Rear pocket fucks up the way you sit.

425
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,650
Scott: I don't know why people put it in the rear pocket.

426
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:48,334
Rym: I don't.

427
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:56,510
Rym: I've never understood that because all the pants I have Where the rear pocket is is slightly away from where the tailbone is or where the butt bone is.

428
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,324
Rym: So it doesn't in any way affect how I say.

429
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:00,310
Scott: it's like sitting on a lump.

430
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,531
Scott: It's.

431
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,883
Rym: it's a pain in the ass pants that it does get in the way.

432
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:03,888
Rym: I can't deal with.

433
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,683
Scott: no Anyway, I've never used the rear pocket wallet.

434
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:07,870
Rym: You want to hear something crazy?

435
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:12,385
Rym: I knew a guy in middle school who wore his keys in his back pocket.

436
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,715
Scott: Whoa Didn't that poke him in the butt?

437
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,819
Rym: I have no idea.

438
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,330
Rym: Anyway, I would marvel at this kid.

439
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,150
Scott: Yeah, so, you know what?

440
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,368
Scott: I would consistently put the wallet in the front right pocket and whenever I sat down at a desk I would take it out and put on the desk.

441
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,380
Scott: But whenever I left the desk I put it back in that front right pocket where it was secure.

442
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,786
Scott: I couldn't fall out.

443
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:32,710
Rym: Why would you take it out?

444
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:33,452
Scott: What?

445
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:34,337
Rym: why would you take it out?

446
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:38,922
Scott: Because when I'm at a desk usually with the computer I might often need the credit card for typing in.

447
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,269
Rym: I only get the wallet out.

448
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:40,349
Rym: see.

449
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:43,462
Scott: Also, I hate sitting with a wallet in the pocket.

450
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,910
Scott: It's annoying even in the front pocket.

451
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:45,554
Rym: Here's the thing.

452
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:58,550
Rym: the real way to wear a wallet as I've always attested and as I now fortunately with my job get to do all the time if You're wearing a suit jacket or a blazer on the inside pocket put it in the blazer pocket.

453
00:23:58,711 --> 00:23:59,998
Scott: Yeah, I don't wear those though.

454
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,230
Scott: But when I do I was always.

455
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:11,438
Scott: I always feel rather dapper when I'm buying something at a store and it looks like you're gonna pull out a gun But then you pull out money, which is far more dangerous.

456
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,990
Rym: not just reaching into the front pocket always feels very dapper.

457
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:19,650
Scott: Yes, I also enjoy the front pocket, but I do not have the front pocket in my club anyway.

458
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:24,408
Scott: So the wallet right and the keys and the cell phone are the same situation right.

459
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:24,810
Scott: I do.

460
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:30,602
Scott: I always put them in the same secure place I always take them out in the same manner and I always put them back in right.

461
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,589
Scott: so wallet phone keys is a lock.

462
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:42,130
Rym: see now I think The issue with that it and in one hand creates a situation where you will very likely not ever lose it because you don't know Where it is, it's where you always put it exactly.

463
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,829
Rym: But at the other time if anything disrupts your schedule you are fucked.

464
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,283
Rym: If you like if something happens like your pants get you on fire.

465
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:50,970
Rym: you will never see any of those things again.

466
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:57,190
Rym: Even if you get them out of the pants, you're not gonna remember where you put them anyway.

467
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:00,657
Scott: That so the sunglasses right.

468
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:01,840
Scott: mistake number one.

469
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,244
Scott: I wore them on.

470
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,897
Scott: yeah two days ago when it was raining I thought it was gonna get sunny.

471
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:08,685
Scott: So I wore him even though I usually wouldn't have.

472
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:09,570
Rym: that's another thing.

473
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:09,891
Rym: Right.

474
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,198
Scott: the wallet every day no matter what.

475
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,726
Scott: the cell phone iPod no matter what every day.

476
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,689
Scott: the keys no matter what.

477
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,868
Scott: every day Right the sunglasses not every day.

478
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,997
Rym: So what other thing?

479
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,928
Rym: what now that I carry the messenger bag?

480
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,754
Rym: Sunglasses are in there.

481
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,417
Rym: Mmm.

482
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:28,550
Scott: Well, you have the clip beyond sunglasses that can go in your bag.

483
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,135
Scott: I don't.

484
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:29,679
Scott: I thought you did.

485
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:30,990
Rym: I had those a long time ago.

486
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:34,050
Rym: I I have very nice custom-made sunglasses.

487
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,796
Scott: How do you get them in the messenger bag though?

488
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:38,386
Scott: Because like when you fold up the Oakley's right?

489
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,610
Scott: They're sort of blob you list.

490
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,441
Scott: They don't really go in the messenger bag.

491
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:42,850
Scott: It's like they're gonna get crushed in there.

492
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,934
Rym: I have a metal case.

493
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,810
Rym: That is the exact minimum size and shape to hold these custom sunglasses.

494
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:48,574
Scott: Oh, see the case.

495
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:53,435
Scott: the Oakley's coming is a giant blob that is not good for you know Carrying around in a messenger bag.

496
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,847
Rym: Well, it fits in my messenger bag in the slot right next to my DS.

497
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:01,581
Scott: Oh Yeah, see these do not fit So I think I could not put them in the messenger.

498
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,412
Rym: if I carry them in the messenger bag You know what?

499
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,609
Rym: I can't put in the messenger bag, but books.

500
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:08,558
Rym: But what I could put would be a Kindle.

501
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,221
Rym: Uh-huh.

502
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,149
Rym: I really need a Kindle or the equivalent.

503
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:16,810
Scott: Yep So anyway, I could not put these in the messenger bag because they are big and blah and they would get crushed.

504
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,570
Rym: Why don't you get a special case for him and then put it on the clippy on the outside of the messenger?

505
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,090
Scott: Well, I was going to say that but I'm going to do now is of course I'm going to buy the expensive sunglasses again.

506
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:36,602
Scott: You need the bandolier on that bang and then I'm going to invent something which gives me the consistent and secure Storage place.

507
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:43,670
Scott: Okay, Scott Use that consistent and secure storage place even in the fucking winter that way to create the consistency necessary not to lose them.

508
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:44,290
Rym: Here's the problem.

509
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,929
Rym: Now you're gonna be out somewhere with the sunglasses on.

510
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:52,250
Rym: You'll be in a situation where you can't put it back into that exact configuration right then and it suddenly gets dark.

511
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:53,305
Rym: You'll never see him again.

512
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,709
Rym: Anyway, you'll set him like on top of your car.

513
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,159
Scott: So basically here's what happened.

514
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,203
Scott: right is that this is?

515
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,990
Scott: I sort of have this vague memory, right?

516
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,735
Scott: Which is the problem?

517
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,550
Scott: if I had a clear memory of it, I would have found them.

518
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,542
Rym: But it's always that way if you ever lose anything you can always think back to like.

519
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:11,890
Rym: well I got home So I had the wallet when I got on the train.

520
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:20,477
Scott: Yeah It's like first of all I couldn't remember if I wore them or not because like I was think I remember thinking in the morning Like should I wear them or shouldn't I wear them?

521
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:25,034
Scott: and I remember deciding yes, and I also remember deciding though I have two memories.

522
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,279
Scott: They're probably from different days.

523
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,564
Scott: They're both equally valid though.

524
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:29,130
Scott: Yeah, they're both equally valid memories.

525
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,580
Scott: It is, you know from different days.

526
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:41,480
Scott: I don't know which one went with which day But obviously the memory of wearing them went with that day because they weren't still in the case when I got home Unless someone came in the house and stole them out of the case.

527
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:42,865
Scott: That's not where they were.

528
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:49,646
Scott: so memory too I have was when I got out of the car at the beacon train station, and it was raining.

529
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:57,880
Scott: I sort of remember Maybe putting them on my head or maybe putting them down low I don't remember, but they were not anywhere at the beacon train station.

530
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:10,182
Scott: and then I had another memory of At the Grand Central Station when I got out of the terminal onto the street in the city I remember putting my hood on because it was raining.

531
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:16,410
Scott: and I remember thinking ah Because putting the hood on when the sunglasses on your head it sucks, right?

532
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,676
Scott: So I have two different memories of that.

533
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,887
Scott: one memory is I'm glad I didn't bring my sunglasses today.

534
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,573
Scott: putting on my head Hood is so comfortable.

535
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:28,068
Scott: and the other memory I have is uh, why are my sunglasses with the hood?

536
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:28,952
Scott: I hate this It sucks.

537
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:33,548
Scott: I'm gonna take my sunglasses off and put them down low somewhere and then I don't remember where they went.

538
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:46,324
Scott: and then basically from then on the next memory was leaving work where I got up to leave my desk at work and I Examine the desk to make sure didn't leave anything there and there were no sunglasses.

539
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,809
Rym: No, it's like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

540
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,135
Scott: And I was like did I bring them?

541
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:51,599
Scott: I don't remember.

542
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,344
Scott: are they really not around here?

543
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:54,146
Rym: fuck?

544
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:56,715
Scott: and then it was like They're gonna be on my up.

545
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,260
Scott: I guess I didn't bring them.

546
00:28:58,681 --> 00:28:59,825
Scott: they're on my desk at home.

547
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,150
Scott: get home not there.

548
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:03,500
Scott: Fuck again, that's the worst cuz.

549
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,789
Rym: now you're the whole day.

550
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,780
Rym: now You're thinking gotta get home to see.

551
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,349
Rym: if they're there gotta go home to see.

552
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:11,590
Scott: well It was as I left work at five o'clock the whole day nothing.

553
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,677
Scott: Nah while I was working didn't even think.

554
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,544
Scott: not, you know completely out of mind.

555
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,270
Rym: see at least I read in recent.

556
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:22,970
Rym: I have not lost anything really at all recently, but I have had a few close calls.

557
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:23,552
Rym: I did.

558
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:23,913
Scott: I did.

559
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:28,468
Scott: I did a send a report to the Grand Central lost and found which is a 60% return rate.

560
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,822
Scott: But you know, that's assuming I love to make Grand Central or the train.

561
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,668
Rym: Yep, and someone didn't just go.

562
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,950
Scott: Hey sunglasses Yeah, I mean if I would have seen those on the street out of it like fuck.

563
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,202
Scott: Yes, like I sort of had this a fantasy of.

564
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:42,948
Scott: maybe I'll see a homeless guy, right?

565
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,256
Scott: Who's wearing them?

566
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,770
Scott: and they're obviously mine cuz they're custom.

567
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,292
Scott: so I can.

568
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,603
Scott: there's no way that the odds of identical ones are extremely low.

569
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,007
Scott: and I just be like.

570
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:56,288
Scott: I Imagine that if the homeless guy admitted that they were mine, I would have let him keep them.

571
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,370
Rym: That's very Ultima quest of the Avatar exactly.

572
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:05,110
Scott: But if he would have been all indignant homeless guy would have gotten a cop and tried to get him back.

573
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,236
Scott: But I don't know what I could have done.

574
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,949
Scott: What kind of recourse is there in that case?

575
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,130
Scott: You could probably I mean I can prove that I bought ones that were that color.

576
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,936
Scott: Cuz I have the I can go get the receipt and they're custom.

577
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:20,499
Scott: So that's sort of almost Reasonable doubt that those are mine.

578
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:27,269
Scott: But it's you know, I mean there could sadly very sadly because the way because the guy's homeless I'd probably just get him back.

579
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,840
Rym: Yeah, that that's what I was about to say.

580
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,357
Rym: Yeah, well now wouldn't it suck if that guy saved up the money actually bought the exact same custom.

581
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:36,584
Rym: Oh, yeah How do you feel about that?

582
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,192
Scott: The thing is I figured this way right.

583
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,897
Rym: and what if his name was like Sam?

584
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,596
Rym: Robin-stein?

585
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:50,160
Scott: so No, I just had the polar the default inscription on there because I wasn't gonna pay extra for that film monogram.

586
00:30:50,461 --> 00:31:06,202
Scott: No, but I figure right I'm gonna buy another one if I lose the second pair game over fuck it That's right, cuz you know, but I figure hey worst case I'm back to square one, but I have an extra carrying case and an extra cleaning cloth and You know what?

587
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,335
Scott: I've spent more on less in my life, right?

588
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:14,290
Scott: I've lost worse Like five $50 time X's.

589
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,240
Scott: that's more money than the one sunglass.

590
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:24,500
Rym: You know the feeling where you lose something and it's entirely or just you screw something up It's entirely your fault and you can point at the exact monetary damage you cause to yourself.

591
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,227
Rym: Yeah, and you have that feeling of.

592
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:30,905
Scott: but if you but if you if you feel bad over it You're basically just doing more damage.

593
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:31,227
Scott: Yep.

594
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:34,680
Rym: Yep, but there's still that feeling and you can't a hundred percent escape it, right?

595
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,629
Scott: But I mean if I lose the second pair, that's it.

596
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,616
Scott: I'm back to the $20 sunglasses.

597
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:40,680
Scott: We're done, right?

598
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:46,575
Scott: But I'm gonna get the second pair and I'm also going to invent a way to not lose them.

599
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:51,071
Rym: You know what I've Only the only time I've ever lost a pair of sunglasses.

600
00:31:51,111 --> 00:32:01,566
Rym: Well, the thing is you're a glasses kneading person So it's completely different for you if I needed to wear them not because one clip-ons which I used to use There's no need for that.

601
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:02,491
Rym: It's just sunglasses.

602
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:03,375
Rym: It's like putting them on.

603
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:04,742
Rym: you don't think to use them They're not.

604
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,307
Rym: you know, it's the same deal.

605
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,720
Rym: You don't have a sunglasses instinct separate from the glasses instinct.

606
00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:13,979
Scott: Yeah, but I mean your sunglasses are prescription and you would if you wear them you just hang on.

607
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:18,320
Rym: Yeah, they are, you know There was a time when I use clip-ons instead in which case those are easy to lose.

608
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,332
Rym: But the only time I ever lost them was when I left them in a diner Right when we graduated from our IT.

609
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:28,020
Rym: I As I walked out I went oh crap my sunglasses.

610
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,384
Rym: I walked back in.

611
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:32,233
Rym: there was another family there and they they.

612
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,440
Rym: I am so sure that they just took them.

613
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:36,008
Scott: Oh, I remember this.

614
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:38,280
Rym: I'm absolutely sure I remember this story.

615
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:43,207
Rym: We forgot about the waiters like yes, I'm there and the waiters like yes I'm there to the family.

616
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,698
Rym: The family's like we didn't see nothing.

617
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:48,469
Scott: You should have gotten the police then.

618
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,760
Rym: it wasn't where it did take.

619
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,603
Rym: You know what.

620
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:57,426
Rym: as much as I enjoy watching the righteously indignant or people of that ilk squirm Especially then you had no money.

621
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:58,632
Rym: It is so.

622
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,380
Rym: no then I had a decent bit of money.

623
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:02,648
Rym: Okay, cuz remember I was working at IBM.

624
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,316
Rym: I drove back to our IT to quote-unquote.

625
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:05,457
Scott: Okay.

626
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:06,320
Scott: I thought this is pre.

627
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:07,625
Scott: This is the okay.

628
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,148
Rym: No, that was.

629
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,353
Rym: that was when I had so much money.

630
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:10,136
Rym: I didn't care anymore.

631
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:19,091
Rym: All right, but The only time I really like I've had a lot of close calls Mostly with keys or wallet was he is a thing right.

632
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:23,867
Scott: losing something is not the same as a close call And it's not the same as leaving something somewhere.

633
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:28,120
Scott: like sometimes you might leave something at someone's house or you get something behind.

634
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,980
Scott: It's not the same as losing it right like for example.

635
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,920
Scott: But I've left things in hotels and then later called the hotel and had the mail it.

636
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:42,691
Rym: Yeah, but there's the same situation because recently when I actually lost something that mattered I lost my keys while I went out for a run.

637
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:45,080
Rym: Oh shit because there was a hole in my pocket.

638
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:45,683
Rym: Oh shit.

639
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:46,347
Rym: I went for a run.

640
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:46,830
Rym: I get home.

641
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,560
Rym: I go open the door doors locked.

642
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,872
Rym: I'm like, let me just get my there's a hole in my pocket.

643
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,528
Rym: Ah And I'm thinking I'm picturing my keys.

644
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:59,779
Rym: and when I'm picturing my keys, I'm thinking keys to my car.

645
00:34:00,302 --> 00:34:01,911
Rym: Well, I got to get a new set of those.

646
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:03,359
Rym: He's to Emily's car.

647
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:13,388
Scott: Well Yubikey great, yeah RSA key fuck I Got some more Yubikeys in the in the room.

648
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:14,994
Rym: Yeah, I convinced my coworker to buy one.

649
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:15,797
Rym: He's loving it.

650
00:34:16,058 --> 00:34:16,420
Scott: All right.

651
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,351
Rym: So what do I do?

652
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:19,478
Rym: I spend the next hour?

653
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,257
Rym: Retracing my steps in the dark with a flashlight.

654
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:23,780
Scott: you find them.

655
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:27,353
Rym: I found them a mile and a half away from the house on the sidewalk.

656
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:27,935
Rym: Awesome.

657
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:29,139
Rym: I was very pleased with that.

658
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,034
Scott: That's not losing though.

659
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:32,882
Rym: Yeah Losing.

660
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,657
Rym: I almost always have close calls, but it's rare that I lose something.

661
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:41,559
Rym: that matters Yeah, but the one time I did the one time was in middle school.

662
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,726
Rym: Well, there wasn't middle school.

663
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:44,969
Rym: No, it was high school.

664
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,056
Rym: It was definitely high school because I have a driver's license.

665
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:51,373
Rym: Mm-hmm I was biking and I was wearing my trench coat.

666
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:53,100
Rym: because I wore my trench coat everywhere.

667
00:34:53,139 --> 00:35:01,800
Rym: Remember I even wore that thing at RIT like all the time along with that cowboy hat yeah, and I used to always keep my keys and wallet in these unsecured.

668
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:05,475
Rym: Don't zip up front pockets that were like four inches deep.

669
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,800
Scott: You had all those inside pockets.

670
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,562
Scott: They didn't use those.

671
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:08,525
Scott: use the outside one.

672
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,207
Rym: Well, they were.

673
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:13,359
Rym: they were inside really, but they didn't have anything securing items in them at all.

674
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,900
Rym: So and you know and I think back it was inevitable that I would have lost anything I ever put in those pockets.

675
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,240
Scott: Yeah, like they're in the fact that I did you put like cans of coke in there and shit.

676
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:32,600
Rym: I remember proving at RIT when Greg didn't believe me that I could fit an Entire 12-pack of soda in that trench coat with no visible bulges.

677
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:36,956
Rym: You did and walk not very fast mind you but I could walk.

678
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:37,860
Scott: Here's the thing, right?

679
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,943
Scott: I mean, why was it?

680
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:40,789
Scott: I don't understand why that was so unbelievable.

681
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,800
Scott: people store like like three shotguns in a coat.

682
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,355
Rym: Like you remember that video with the kid?

683
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:51,300
Scott: Yeah I mean, it's like if you can put three shotguns in a coat, you can put six cans of coke in a coat.

684
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,600
Rym: I think it was primarily remember way back when we were all at RIT.

685
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:55,242
Rym: I think it was.

686
00:35:55,503 --> 00:36:02,970
Rym: I think it was actually very similar or in the same era of when we watched that one episode of Malcolm in the middle with the peeps.

687
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:03,814
Scott: peeps.

688
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:05,039
Rym: You can't eat a hundred peeps.

689
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:18,291
Rym: I lost both my keys and my wallet Keys and wallet both same day.

690
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,216
Rym: they gone gone gone forever.

691
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:21,800
Rym: and the worst thing is the keys.

692
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,530
Rym: I was really bummed because the keys had a key fob on them.

693
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,342
Rym: That was a pewter dragon pocket watch Uh-huh.

694
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:29,365
Rym: It was so cool.

695
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:30,207
Rym: I love that thing.

696
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,171
Scott: It's gone now.

697
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:37,612
Rym: Yep, and the wallet was well my wallet And that was one, you know, I went home like mom.

698
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:40,878
Rym: I lost my keys and she's like I was like and my wallet she was like.

699
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,789
Scott: ah Thing is I've lost walls before.

700
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:51,276
Scott: it's not a real big in people like oh my god I mean, I basically just went to the credit card website disabled the car.

701
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,160
Scott: They sent me a new one.

702
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,244
Scott: It took one click.

703
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:53,646
Rym: right.

704
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:57,160
Scott: see it's much like to the DMV the new driver's license one click.

705
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,906
Scott: Yeah, it's so easy.

706
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:02,920
Rym: back then, you know and up until very recently wallet losing wouldn't have been a big deal.

707
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:14,019
Rym: But now I would have two credit cards ATM card like for insurance cards car insurance car registration Driver's license my insurance and registration in my car.

708
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,840
Rym: Yes, I also carry my insurance and registration in the wallet.

709
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:18,484
Scott: I did not.

710
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,140
Rym: everyone else in the world does that at least everyone else in the country?

711
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:21,601
Scott: I do not.

712
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:24,075
Rym: New York's all weird with the registration like taped to the window.

713
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:24,880
Rym: I never got used to that.

714
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:26,874
Scott: That's how it is in Connecticut.

715
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,660
Rym: I know it's weird.

716
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:33,080
Scott: And also Connecticut also does a sticker on the license plate that has just the date.

717
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:34,287
Rym: Yeah, Michigan used to that way.

718
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:39,059
Scott: cops can see from afar if you're up to date Yep, and actually they mail you that sticker in the mail.

719
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:43,940
Rym: But most importantly now train ticket because here's here's the situation in the city.

720
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:45,424
Rym: Lose wallet.

721
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:46,186
Rym: All right.

722
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:47,670
Rym: I can't get any money.

723
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,595
Rym: I don't have any money.

724
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,500
Rym: I don't have a train ticket home.

725
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,913
Rym: I've lost the time to buy the train ticket.

726
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:55,080
Scott: I lost the training one.

727
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:58,540
Rym: I don't have the ID to give the conductor to pay him later.

728
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:04,500
Scott: I lost the train ticket once because I bought basically a web ticket which is flimsy ass piece of paper.

729
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,067
Scott: Yeah, I lost it halfway through the.

730
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:06,649
Rym: what do you do?

731
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,653
Rym: You're about to leave work.

732
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:08,758
Rym: You don't have your wallet.

733
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:14,460
Rym: You basically have to go to the conductor and at his mercy be like look I lost my wallet.

734
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,593
Rym: I don't have any collateral to give you.

735
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,506
Rym: I guess I could give you my DS And then you get home.

736
00:38:20,727 --> 00:38:25,894
Rym: you still have to get a new train ticket, yep Train tickets are like cash man.

737
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:26,600
Scott: That's the thing, right?

738
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,126
Scott: That's why Galaxy Express is.

739
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:41,679
Scott: I can identify with it so much because the pass the pass ooh the Galaxy Express ticket is such this point of drama and like half the episodes because basically If you don't have it, you can't get on the train.

740
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:46,959
Scott: Otherwise they kill you this penalty of death right if someone takes your ticket.

741
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:47,280
Scott: That's it.

742
00:38:47,340 --> 00:39:01,588
Scott: they're on the train and you're not right and like you have to basically get off the train and all these stops and you pretty much have to like hold on to that thing For dear life and people are constantly trying to steal it and it cost a bajillion dollars And such and such.

743
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,760
Scott: and you only have one and it's like oh my gosh.

744
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:09,400
Scott: And it's like wow, it's exactly the same as all my train tickets and wallets and whatnot, you know.

745
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,026
Scott: And it's so.

746
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:10,854
Scott: it's just so true.

747
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:23,280
Rym: Yep But I actually the way I handle this pretty much as I just have a shoebox a really nice one that I put out And I put all my items of note that would be decanted from my pockets when I come home there.

748
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,700
Rym: So I have a spot to put all my change spot to put all my bills and a little thing to put my cell phone.

749
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,200
Scott: I can't on to my desk and then I decant off of the desk.

750
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,925
Scott: So the the desk itself is the.

751
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:40,940
Rym: well the problem with that is that I need my keys which have my RSA key Whenever I need to do work stuff or log into the VPN and I need the YubiKey.

752
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:43,378
Rym: So I need these when I'm at the computer pretty often.

753
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:47,053
Rym: now I need my cell phone around a lot because I'm making a lot of calls.

754
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:48,057
Rym: No doing this house stuff.

755
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:49,343
Rym: Mm-hmm Plus.

756
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,429
Rym: I got to charge the stupid thing.

757
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,314
Rym: I don't have my pre yet.

758
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,014
Scott: with my touchstone You're gonna get the stupid touchstone.

759
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:59,480
Rym: Probably not I. I'm actually 50/50 right now between the pre and the new iPhone.

760
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:02,660
Scott: I would wait for the pre roundtable podcast to make a decision.

761
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:07,160
Rym: Well, I can't buy one until the 30th which is when my contract expires.

762
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,350
Scott: The roundtable should be out in a couple in a day or two.

763
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,931
Rym: So maybe it's even out now, but right now I'm ambivalent one of the other.

764
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:18,152
Rym: Yep Okay, yeah, I wish I could get.

765
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:19,840
Rym: I mean I lost my cell phone a bunch of times.

766
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,429
Rym: Never lost a cell phone or an iPod.

767
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:30,930
Rym: well Kate I remember she lost her cell phone somewhere on RIT's campus in the winter and She came back the next day.

768
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,999
Rym: She's like I lost my cell phone.

769
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:44,592
Rym: So I just took our landline and had the redial and while I was playing a game I just kept hitting redial while she watered her on RIT's campus and like an hour later She found the phone ringing buried in snow and it was fine.

770
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,319
Rym: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

771
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:50,620
Scott: But now did you see how Apple actually on the new iPhone?

772
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:59,092
Scott: Mobile me right if you have mobile me, you can find your iPhone You can delete it or disable it remotely etc.

773
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,900
Rym: It said now the pre should just offer that for free.

774
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:05,999
Scott: yeah, well, yeah, first of all every phone has to offer that now every phone with the GPS right.

775
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:10,351
Scott: and Second of all, I think we need to start having a way to like.

776
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,060
Scott: why can't I GPS them sunglasses, right?

777
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,100
Scott: I mean it does.

778
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:18,974
Rym: You would need to have some sort of GPS device on the sunglasses.

779
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,257
Scott: Well, that's true Howard.

780
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,180
Scott: That's true.

781
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:26,055
Rym: Also also able also a cell device so it can communicate its location.

782
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:29,225
Rym: GPS is not to way No, but it could be.

783
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:41,440
Scott: so we need we should invent what it's sort of like an RFID of GPS Where the device itself has no GPS abilities, but it can be located by a GPS.

784
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:42,885
Scott: That's looking for it.

785
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:44,971
Rym: that's not feasible really.

786
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:46,275
Rym: just by the way the technologies work.

787
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,780
Rym: the best you could do is have a transponder.

788
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,367
Scott: That's why we need to invent it.

789
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,734
Rym: What do you mean invented?

790
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:51,919
Rym: How are you going to do that?

791
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,916
Scott: Invent something new?

792
00:41:54,742 --> 00:41:58,715
Rym: But Scott, all right, so it's gonna figure out its location with GPS.

793
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:08,747
Scott: No, it's not figure out its location It's just it has some sort of powerless thing attached to it such that it can be located Electronically by something else.

794
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:10,595
Rym: Okay, so stop saying GPS.

795
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:11,560
Rym: that has nothing to do with it.

796
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:14,519
Scott: I'm just saying I know has nothing to do with GPS, but you know what I'm saying?

797
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,027
Rym: It's called RFID.

798
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:28,700
Scott: The problem is you would you would have to Imagine the RF it would take to find the sunglasses from space ID on them like burn a hole right through the earth disintegrating the sunglasses.

799
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:40,037
Rym: I think it is technologically infeasible within the next 15 or 20 years Yeah, I don't know 15 maybe you know sort of some sort of mesh network and then some sort of shizuma device to put in It to power it.

800
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:44,220
Scott: I'm just you know, it's something to think about for all those inventors out there.

801
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,320
Scott: Yes, wait a way to tag things such that they can be found.

802
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,980
Scott: You know, it doesn't even have to be like find it from space, right?

803
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:56,812
Scott: It could be like I know I left it maybe at you know I would have maybe either at this train station or the next one or whatever.

804
00:42:56,852 --> 00:42:59,440
Scott: So maybe here's the problem a hundred foot radius.

805
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,245
Rym: Here's why this is so infeasible.

806
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:13,300
Rym: if it if it has to get its power from the thing that is going to find it you're really stuck with RF or something at the equivalent or Something that has not been invented yet.

807
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:20,422
Rym: No, you either have to transmit the power to it somehow or it has to already have the power Or it could be like, you know Like what?

808
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:27,358
Scott: like a metal detector where you can just sort of like detect it just needs to be detectable Scott You know how metal detectors work, right?

809
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:40,768
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah If you lose something metal About the totes I could have found the $20 plus sunglasses that were made of metal But not the plastic ones.

810
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,297
Scott: Actually, they're not plastic.

811
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:44,394
Scott: They're made of unobtainium.

812
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:48,200
Rym: Yeah, actually you see that new element.

813
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:49,984
Scott: It doesn't have a name yet.

814
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:51,691
Scott: Yeah, I think they should caught.

815
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,040
Scott: they should call it on a nun a nun a nun a millennium.

816
00:43:54,483 --> 00:43:55,249
Rym: I like those names.

817
00:43:55,491 --> 00:44:01,762
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time I like it when you give them a cool name Nubian.

818
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:03,130
Scott: the thing is you already have rubinium.

819
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,035
Rym: Just make it Nubian.

820
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:04,779
Scott: So I'm done.

821
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,496
Scott: We're good, we got it.

822
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:09,868
Scott: You got.

823
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:10,619
Scott: thanks Jay coverage.

824
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,146
Scott: Notice how they don't have to cost ernium.

825
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:13,728
Rym: That's common.

826
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:14,571
Scott: Yeah.

827
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:18,101
Rym: Yeah, I'm waiting for the you ready for number 500.

828
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,291
Rym: I'm waiting for the next island of stability.

829
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:21,075
Rym: Sure.

830
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:22,200
Rym: Plus what about a lyrium?

831
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:29,666
Rym: Uh, but you're not a leer you All right, this is kind of Peter.

832
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:30,450
Rym: not I don't know.

833
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,116
Rym: we really had to say anything else.

834
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,903
Scott: that has been lost I don't know.

835
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:35,730
Scott: lost and founds are cool.

836
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,895
Scott: You should make use of them.

837
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:38,923
Rym: Remember remember way back I lost that.

838
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:47,980
Rym: basically I had that brazier cell phone forever Mm-hmm, and then I lost it that one day and I called it and a dude answered and then I got my phone back.

839
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:48,703
Scott: Oh, right.

840
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:50,129
Rym: Yeah overnighted it to me.

841
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,074
Scott: You find some other dudes.

842
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:52,420
Scott: blackberry never give it back to him.

843
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:54,332
Rym: Yeah, I kept meaning to like.

844
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,036
Rym: I found like.

845
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:56,960
Rym: I looked into it I found all the email addresses in it.

846
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,219
Rym: So I just emailed all of them and I was like I found this blackberry and it's this guy's name.

847
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,068
Rym: Tell him and I'll give it to him.

848
00:45:04,128 --> 00:45:05,274
Rym: Here's my contact info.

849
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:06,680
Rym: No one ever responded.

850
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,366
Rym: Eventually, the blackberry ran out of battery.

851
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:10,072
Rym: Then I put it in a drawer.

852
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,658
Rym: I forgot about it for like two years.

853
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:13,704
Scott: Just sell it.

854
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:20,983
Rym: Yeah, I found it later and I was like, whoa too little too late I Don't know.

855
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,169
Rym: I should just turn.

856
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,999
Rym: I just like lose it in Grand Central.

857
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,964
Rym: Yeah donated somewhere.

858
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:27,449
Rym: I don't know when you work to the hospital.

859
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,295
Scott: Didn't you have the incredibly old-school blackberry?

860
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:32,243
Rym: No, I had a pager One way.

861
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,854
Scott: but the original blackberry was effectively a pager wasn't it?

862
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:35,778
Scott: Like you just had some.

863
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:38,351
Rym: but no I had an alphanumeric pager at the hospital.

864
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:38,733
Rym: You know what?

865
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,260
Rym: I lost that right?

866
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,433
Rym: I lost that like a week after I got there and No one ever paged me anyway, so it didn't matter.

867
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:50,379
Rym: and when I quit I was like, yeah I lost that pager and they're like, oh you're gonna have to pay for it.

868
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:55,038
Rym: And I said sure how much and they couldn't figure out how much and they never asked me again.

869
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:58,619
Rym: Good The thing was worth about five bucks.

870
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,277
Rym: Yep, it took double A's.

871
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:11,679
Scott: so either I'm gonna have one sunglass that cost twice as much but came with extra accessories or Maybe someone will find it at Grand Central and I'll have to.

872
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,335
Rym: ah That'd be crazy only two at twice the price.

873
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:18,293
Rym: Yeah All right, this Peter dad.

874
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,018
Rym: I think we're done.

875
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:19,380
Scott: We're done.

876
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,616
Rym: We'll pick up next week with mocha coverage, which will be a good episode and a crazy episode.

877
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:24,660
Scott: might it to be extra long?

878
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,710
Rym: Yeah, and Monday, there's so much tech news.

879
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,713
Rym: Well, we got some stuff.

880
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:30,640
Scott: It might just round it up even though I don't wanna.

881
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,099
Scott: No, we got we'll see.

882
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,021
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
