00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,478
Scott: It's Wednesday September 5th.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,582
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:15,310
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:18,561
Scott: Tonight we review the old Oav L hazard.

5
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,378
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:45,117
Scott: You may recall that I have been suffering for a little over a week because I've been forced to use the shitty ass Sony $10 headphone things instead of my usual Etymotic six-eye Solation thingies,

7
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:48,650
Rym: you know, I'd totally forgotten about that, but I just ordered a pair for me and Emily.

8
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:53,290
Scott: Yeah, but they're basically for anyone who hasn't listened to show ever before.

9
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:57,710
Scott: They're awesome earbuds, but it's unlike normal shit earbuds.

10
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:03,130
Scott: If you put them in your ears You can't hear anything except the music or podcast that is coming through them.

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,061
Scott: Thus you can turn the volume down really low.

12
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:13,325
Scott: even when you're in a loud place like the subway You're still able to hear what's being played and you save your ears a lot of damage.

13
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:14,588
Rym: and mr.

14
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,090
Rym: Train stop.

15
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:28,904
Scott: Yeah, I mugs you maybe but they're awesome and they're worth the money Especially if you care about having hearing later in life or even in very, you know soon in your life People lose a lot of hearing just going to concerts by the time they're like 30-something.

16
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,330
Rym: Yeah, but anyway anyway.

17
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:34,690
Scott: So I said there was a problem with them not that they were broken or anything at their fault.

18
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:46,430
Scott: But you know after being used for two or three years so much, you know They they become worn out and the wire going into the right ear was kind of loose and this audio would cut in and out.

19
00:01:46,972 --> 00:02:00,930
Scott: So, you know rather than buy new ones because they were kind of expensive I call I emailed the company and I was like, alright company, you know, if I send you these that are working Can you just like rewire them because there's nothing wrong with the buds, you know, the things themselves, which is the expensive part.

20
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:04,868
Scott: I just need a new wire which is like a you know a few dollars, you know What can you do for me?

21
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:14,770
Scott: And they said well if you send them in for an RMA then we'll determine if the warranty is valid or not Which I know it wasn't because it's only a one-year warranty, right?

22
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:24,226
Scott: And if it is they'll just replace them and if it isn't then they'll charge me like $75 for replacement pair which is fine because that's a lot less than what they cause.

23
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:28,688
Scott: new, you know me That's and there's like one website that sells them for like seventy six dollars.

24
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:36,350
Scott: Yeah So I sent him in for FedEx, whatever and They didn't ever confirm that they received them which is sort of annoying.

25
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:44,250
Scott: But I had a FedEx tracking so I knew they received them and they never told me You know that they were sending them back or anything like that.

26
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,518
Scott: But I get home today and there's a box sitting on the porch.

27
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:47,462
Scott: and like what's this box?

28
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:49,490
Scott: and the return address was them.

29
00:02:49,630 --> 00:03:02,130
Scott: So I'm like, oh, okay, and there was just a new pair in there and I read inside and it was like they were like Yeah, something, you know audio intermittent at the something whatever, you know.

30
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:11,159
Scott: They confirm the problem that I described and they just replaced them even though I had no warranty whatsoever on them anymore hot or anything.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,538
Scott: so, you know if you're Deciding between those and say like I think sure has a new Isolation earbuds that like $100 now.

32
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,250
Rym: There's also the super expensive Bose ones that are totally not worth.

33
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,511
Rym: You

34
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:38,809
Scott: don't want those, you know, if you're trying to decide and these look, you know Too expensive for you or something like that you might want to consider going with them because the company has the customer service that is like a bajillion awesomes and honoring your warranty when it's not necessary to.

35
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:45,814
Rym: So as you all know this past weekend was Dragon Con and despite the fact that a bunch of our friends went we were just Too busy with life.

36
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,381
Scott: Yeah, cuz where is it Atlanta?

37
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:49,670
Scott: Yeah, and what kind of con is it?

38
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,237
Scott: Isn't it like a sci-fi fantasy?

39
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:54,230
Rym: ish con looks like it would be a good time and a lot of our friends went.

40
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,575
Rym: I actually wanted to go.

41
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:56,699
Rym: I just one.

42
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,990
Rym: I hate flying not for any fear of flying or anything like that.

43
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,915
Rym: I just I'm unlucky and every time I have flown since I was in high school Has been with incident.

44
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:10,630
Rym: either the flights all get canceled or there's a blizzard or my flight gets delayed.

45
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,210
Rym: I have to take some crappy little puddle jumper prop plane in the middle of nowhere.

46
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:17,317
Scott: I have never had a flying Incident ever though.

47
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:27,505
Scott: the worst that's ever happened to me is I had to wait in line For like an hour at West Palm Beach to get on a plane But I got on the plane on time because I got there early and there was no problems

48
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:32,243
Rym: and the fact that they made me Take my shoes off every time I tried to fly.

49
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:34,010
Rym: Yeah, I really don't like that.

50
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,590
Scott: So I don't like it either but I've never had a problem and amazement was the last year not this past year.

51
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:46,438
Rym: But the year before that was the last con I flew to and as much as I wanted to go to Dragon Con It wasn't worth flying and there's no way in hell.

52
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,064
Rym: I was driving to Atlanta.

53
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,870
Scott: I really didn't care about going to Dragon Con.

54
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:57,459
Rym: we're going to enough cons, but anyway friends from anime world order went and You know, they're about to drive home and I get a chat message.

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,763
Rym: Hey Rym, check it out.

56
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,277
Rym: We got some really great Audio from the con.

57
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,484
Rym: I can't wait for you to hear it.

58
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:04,690
Rym: I'll send it to you as soon as I get home.

59
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,340
Scott: I have someone to be that excited.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,010
Scott: It must have been something pretty awesome going on.

61
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:16,497
Rym: well, apparently the reactions to the crowds at the con about Anime and anime related things were somewhat funny Uh-huh.

62
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,590
Scott: Well, it doesn't sound to me like it's an anime con.

63
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,230
Scott: So if you go around animating, you know, there's usually a lot of there might be a bunch of grumpy nerds.

64
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,150
Scott: We're like, yeah those anime kids, you know, it's funny.

65
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:41,390
Rym: you know now that I think about this because one of the primary things that anime world order always rails about is People who go to a con and aren't all about the topic of the con, you know A guy at anime con dressed up as a stormtrooper.

66
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,586
Rym: You were anime podcasters at a non anime con.

67
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:49,958
Rym: shut your holes Yeah, but anyway.

68
00:05:50,340 --> 00:06:00,150
Rym: so uh the next morning I See a chat message to our email from them and it basically said yeah that audio all silence.

69
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,475
Rym: No, I fucked up.

70
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,358
Scott: What happened?

71
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,021
Rym: I don't know.

72
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,048
Scott: How could that happen apparent?

73
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:17,868
Scott: Well one I think we're the only people out there who have an actual solid-state recorder worth a damn Well, everyone else uses like the I River and stuff, which is a solid-state recorder, but you know, it's it's really well.

74
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,771
Rym: What's it?

75
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,523
Rym: barely an mp3 player and I'm not gonna expect.

76
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:31,255
Rym: apparently one of the audios Something where someone was saying something about Dave and Joel is the only thing that got recorded Alrighty then.

77
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,203
Rym: So yeah, I found that hilarious.

78
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,292
Rym: and that's all I really got to say Nothing.

79
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:36,897
Rym: I didn't go to the con.

80
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:40,590
Rym: But oh the panels were subpar and all the things I would normally say.

81
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,213
Rym: But I don't know.

82
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:44,490
Scott: I don't know anything about the con really other than it's called dragon con.

83
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:49,295
Scott: It's sort of famous and it's in Atlanta and I guess enemy world order went For me.

84
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,440
Rym: that con is in the same list is like Jana, ma, ma Boston.

85
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,641
Scott: Oh and me.

86
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,610
Scott: it's in the same list as gen con.

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,666
Scott: It's one of those just general nerdiness cons that I don't really care about or go to.

88
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,110
Scott: that's sort of old and tradition.

89
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,239
Rym: But whatever see I like cons like that.

90
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,806
Rym: I just none of them are near us.

91
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:06,690
Rym: So that's the end of that.

92
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,014
Scott: Yep, anything else?

93
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:08,896
Scott: Not really?

94
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:18,550
Scott: Okay, so DC Comics who we are not the biggest fans of at least We're not the biggest fans of comics with the DC label on them because they're usually underwear pervert crap.

95
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:23,808
Scott: they sell their books in comic book stores and also in bookstores.

96
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:35,770
Scott: right and comic book stores, of course the company that brings the comics from DC to the comic book store is diamond because that the only company that brings things comic book store.

97
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,964
Rym: Yeah, we we've talked about diamond distributors before.

98
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:38,910
Rym: we're not gonna get into that.

99
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,592
Scott: No, we're not.

100
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:44,589
Scott: what we're gonna get into is the company that brings DC's books to the bookstores.

101
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:49,216
Scott: and Basically what was going on?

102
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:55,660
Scott: was the company that was doing this for DC was like Warner Books or something?

103
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,369
Scott: I think it was Warner Books.

104
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,790
Scott: and Because DC is owned by Warner Brothers, you know, that's why you see all the DC sort of cartoons.

105
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,603
Scott: I'm like the WB and stuff like that.

106
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:06,490
Rym: All right.

107
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:16,828
Scott: So obviously Warner Books would be distributing the DC Comics to the bookstores, but this company like Hachette book group purchased Warner Books a while ago.

108
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:29,685
Scott: so DC Finally said alright, we're gonna have someone else bring our books to the bookstores they're gonna have Random House do it and this might seem kind of like a What-the-fuck money pages news.

109
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:30,329
Scott: who gives a shit?

110
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:39,966
Scott: Well, the point is is that if you haven't noticed the manga and such things has been Doing real well in the in the bookstores.

111
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:52,615
Rym: Well, yeah I believe the last time we looked at statistics pretty much every like all the comic books combined didn't outsell even the moderately popular manga yep, and The comic books.

112
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:57,798
Scott: they're trying to print trades and things to sell them in the bookstores But they're not selling too.

113
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,610
Scott: Well, and it's like why wouldn't you know one comic sell too?

114
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,270
Scott: Well, you know and the other one doesn't and a lot of people like oh, it's the authenticity of the manga.

115
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,409
Scott: Oh, it's you know.

116
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:13,590
Scott: There's something else of the manga and that's just BS because the OELs are doing just fine and they're totally fooling everyone.

117
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,348
Scott: and there's no reason that you know, the Marvels and the DCs couldn't do the same thing.

118
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:23,310
Scott: and Random House, which I think all you know, it does what they do.

119
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,858
Scott: I think they own Del Rey don't the story have a point.

120
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:34,750
Scott: The point is is that you can expect DC to do a much better job of selling their books to bookstores.

121
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:50,769
Scott: And I think that with the help of Random House who actually knows what the fuck they're doing You know selling graphic novels to bookstores You're gonna see them catch up at least in the bookstore area and if they catch up enough The comic book store might be taking another hit which is fine by me.

122
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:55,409
Scott: Uh-huh, it's actually sort of like a premonition of things to come.

123
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:07,690
Scott: it shows the DC actually cares about what the bookstores stuff is happening and they're gonna try to make a move on it as Opposed to what we previously thought which is they're just complex store nerds doing everything stupidly.

124
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,230
Rym: Well, it wasn't that they were doing things terribly stupidly.

125
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,950
Rym: It was more that their business model seemed to be get a devout fan following and then milk them for all their worth.

126
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:39,414
Scott: that still seems to be their business model, but I think that The reason that they you know have been continuing to do the monthly comic crap is because they can make a lot of money there You know and then with the ads and with you know The incredibly high price for incredibly little content and then eventually they collect things into a trade and they're able to make a little bit more money in the bookstores.

127
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:48,182
Scott: if Random House does a good job, like it's been doing with their other comics and things then They can make so much money in the bookstores.

128
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,590
Scott: Maybe they'll just give up on the comic bookstores.

129
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:01,370
Rym: huh, I don't know about that because a lot of the really hardcore comic fans they like their little subscription where you know, They show up to the comic store once a month and pick up their box, right?

130
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,857
Scott: And those people make X dollars, you know They make them X dollars per whatever.

131
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:16,090
Scott: if you start making just so much insane amounts of money from the bookstore Where you could have been making the money all along and you just haven't been Then you don't need to waste your time with that small change anymore.

132
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,549
Scott: And the only reason they waste their time with that small change is the only small change they've got.

133
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:24,548
Rym: See, it's really hard to say I mean, I don't really like a lot of those comics I don't really pay attention to them.

134
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:34,141
Scott: Yeah, well being decent, you know, this also Reno counts for everything else DC publishes not just the underwear pervert stuff So all the vertigo stuff and the wild stuff.

135
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:35,526
Rym: That's a lot more interesting.

136
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,570
Scott: You see that's DC.

137
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,174
Scott: Oh that that's all DC Comics.

138
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,598
Scott: It just doesn't say DC on it.

139
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,967
Rym: I think that's a very calculated move on their part.

140
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:55,797
Rym: Yeah Anyways, so, you know, we normally talk about anime news But I was looking through the various news sources we have and there's basically Jack all There's really nothing I care about.

141
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:58,087
Rym: and you know, oh this show was announced this show wasn't.

142
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:03,845
Scott: there was nothing particularly Interesting or fascinating and all con seasons over every anime companies made their announcements.

143
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:04,648
Scott: What else is there to say?

144
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:07,216
Rym: Yeah I mean I could talk about stuff that's coming up.

145
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:07,597
Rym: I don't know.

146
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:08,901
Rym: in December.

147
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,730
Scott: I think in December we'll talk about December.

148
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,736
Rym: Yeah, maybe in November.

149
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,568
Rym: We'll start previewing what we're gonna be doing.

150
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,190
Rym: But So this is so barely related to anime that it's kind of sad.

151
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,926
Rym: But it's on the anime news network and it happens to be about Japan.

152
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:23,749
Rym: So I'm going with it.

153
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:27,870
Scott: Yeah, anything that happens in Japan is anime news apparently.

154
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:31,028
Rym: So what other anime news sources there?

155
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,972
Scott: anime news service dot-com Right.

156
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:44,021
Rym: So DVD according to this article love hotels in Japan Make more than twice as much money as the anime industry.

157
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:45,124
Scott: that makes sense.

158
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:52,410
Rym: Yeah, I don't doubt that at all and My only point is simply why don't we have love hotels in the US?

159
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,482
Rym: I think they'd be really convenient particularly in big cities.

160
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,150
Scott: I think we do have love hotels.

161
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,235
Scott: They're seedy.

162
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:02,614
Scott: they're seedy and we don't have a lot of them and they're not sort of public But they're just.

163
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:08,878
Rym: there's no place in New York City where a guy can just get his groove on Nicely with someone who isn't a prostitute.

164
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,540
Scott: Yeah.

165
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,194
Scott: Yeah, there really isn't and I don't know.

166
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,530
Scott: I think if we open those things a lot of crazy people would be trying to shut them down.

167
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:20,317
Rym: Now what I find more interesting though I'm highly dubious of this number.

168
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:33,740
Rym: the article makes a claim that in according to a study about 50% of all sexual intercourse between Japanese people living in Japan Occurs in love hotels, that's a bit much.

169
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,830
Scott: I don't I. I think I think that's just reported.

170
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,703
Scott: I mean there's so much going on in places that they don't know about that.

171
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,766
Scott: They're not counting.

172
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:45,972
Rym: highly dubious remains Doubtful.

173
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,358
Rym: he doubt she has.

174
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,765
Scott: I mean I would.

175
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:55,130
Scott: I would accept maybe 30% of all Japanese sex is in love hotels because love hotels are really popular there and really awesome.

176
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,861
Scott: And if I was in Japan, I'd Brian I was having sex.

177
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:59,830
Scott: I'd have sex in love hotels a lot.

178
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,304
Rym: Anyway enough of that.

179
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,135
Rym: It's time for things of the day alright.

180
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,523
Scott: Let's get to the good business now Not that crap business.

181
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:13,326
Scott: You're just dealing with.

182
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:17,220
Scott: so you know about 4chan the website.

183
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:17,842
Rym: Why?

184
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:18,706
Rym: yes, I do.

185
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:22,059
Scott: well some people out there might not in which case lucky them.

186
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,058
Rym: lucky indeed

187
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:41,519
Scott: regardless if you would like to get familiar with say I don't know the The aesthetic stylings of 4chan and in a rather you know quick manner There is a video here on YouTube, and if you watch this you will know everything there is to know about 4chan.

188
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:45,601
Rym: It's pretty much a documentary About.

189
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:55,355
Scott: I call it a documentary because it doesn't actually document, but well certainly the same function in that you watch it and You get all the knowledge that you need to get.

190
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:57,524
Rym: so you see the way I would say it was the documentary.

191
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:03,847
Rym: is that from the perspective of a 4chan or in the fortune if 4chan made a documentary This is what it would look like.

192
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,576
Scott: oh probably this is what you would get.

193
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:08,108
Scott: I fortune Collectively made anything.

194
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,819
Scott: This is what it looked like because it looks like fortune.

195
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:17,096
Scott: It's just fortune in in the form of a five-minute video, and it's worth watching.

196
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,480
Scott: so you never have to go to fortune.

197
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,447
Rym: The the best part in this video.

198
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:25,668
Rym: I was going to avoid this and just say seeking and let Scott say the response to that And then move on.

199
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:25,912
Rym: but

200
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:26,176
Scott: yeah

201
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:46,440
Rym: There's this style of humor that wasn't started by fortune And it was started as far as I know with a comedy goldmine on something awful entitled Lord of the Rings on the go and it is the style of take a face of a Character from a movie and make it big and put it on something and possibly change it or anime.

202
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,437
Scott: I'm pretty sure that Lord of the Rings on the go is not the original place for that style of comedy.

203
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:53,691
Rym: originally however I've never seen anything before that was like that.

204
00:15:53,731 --> 00:16:01,540
Rym: if anyone can find it enlighten me, but Fortune has really jumped on this concept with my favorite King King Leonidas.

205
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:15,279
Rym: It's not just fortune, but it is a mostly fortune That's doing this and I just want to say in this video the scene from that terrible movie final destination Or the sequel what I know is one of the final destination movies because I remember seeing that scene.

206
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:20,999
Rym: There's a scene where King lion Leonidas kills a guy, and you'll know it when it happens.

207
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,910
Rym: All right, I quite enjoyed that.

208
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:30,154
Rym: it was a good one definitely, but anyway Ha ha ha the suit suit Ava who bazot zot numb.

209
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:34,800
Rym: I can't believe Who a ta a ta who a ta a nom nom?

210
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,509
Scott: I can't believe this hasn't been a thing of the day before.

211
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,440
Rym: so I think we talked about this way back And we had Jeff to Tarik on the show and we were talking about anime music videos.

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,699
Scott: Yeah, this is a classic thing of the day right here.

213
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:54,283
Rym: This is I would say I would argue One of the top 50 anime music videos ever made I'd say top 15 I would.

214
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,587
Rym: I think I could definitely go there.

215
00:16:55,687 --> 00:17:01,846
Rym: It's just so perfectly timed so fit to a concept Original in its choice of song.

216
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:10,777
Rym: the song by the way is I believe haba haba zoot suit by the band Caramba But I I'm not sure if I made that up anyway.

217
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:23,440
Rym: and the sad scary thing is that Scott and I both know the entire song by heart and It might sound silly because it sounds like the song is just gibberish, but now we could karaoke this and we could do it convincingly.

218
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:28,294
Scott: Yeah, I've seen the video so many times and it's not exactly that complicated.

219
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:34,079
Scott: all I remember like three verses And you're good to go, and then you have to remember the timing of like the mori mori.

220
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:35,306
Scott: That's the best part.

221
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:53,029
Rym: ava ava mori mori yep You're good to go now also Coincidentally this video happens to be concerning The show we're talking about tonight one of my favorite anime one of the classics definitely a top 20 anime I know is that 20 anime, but it's a top 20.

222
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,013
Rym: It's definitely it's.

223
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,200
Scott: it's an above-average anime everyone should watch.

224
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,526
Scott: It's not like an a-plus anime.

225
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:58,088
Scott: It's like a.

226
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,217
Rym: I think it's a minus b-plus anime.

227
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:00,940
Rym: It's right up there.

228
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,742
Rym: Yeah, but we're talking about El Hazzard the magnificent world the original Oav.

229
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:07,827
Rym: I don't know.

230
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,380
Scott: wait wait we're talking about an OAV here.

231
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:11,512
Scott: How many episodes was it like?

232
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:16,772
Scott: six I think Seven seven a seven episode OAV named El Hazzard the magnificent world.

233
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,739
Scott: we are not talking about all right.

234
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:27,471
Rym: well First off if you think you can buy this anime You're wrong if you see it for less than a hundred dollars.

235
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:29,999
Rym: It's either bootleg or it's not the right thing.

236
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:35,216
Scott: So uh or tell us about it right because we haven't been able to find it.

237
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:46,080
Rym: yes in fact I will pay like up to seventy five dollars for a non bootleg copy of the original OAV of El Hazzard The cheapest I found it at Otakon was a hundred and nine.

238
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,747
Scott: Anyway, that's a lot for seven episodes.

239
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:55,820
Rym: it is so El Hazzard the magnificent world was no a V Directed by a man named Hiroki Hayashi.

240
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:03,533
Rym: You might know this gentleman from the original tenchi muyo Oav but not from a lot of other tenchi stuff, and I'll get to that.

241
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:07,149
Rym: so uh they directed El Hazzard Which is magnificent?

242
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:07,631
Rym: It's great.

243
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:08,879
Rym: That is what we were talking about.

244
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:14,535
Rym: Not too long after that they made a spin-off called El Hazzard.

245
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:16,300
Scott: the wanderers don't watch it.

246
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:17,569
Rym: It was a TV show.

247
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,174
Rym: it's 26 episodes.

248
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:29,844
Rym: It's basically the exact same show only drawn out and for reasons that we'll get into when we review the real show It's not that good And it's not that funny And it's not worth watching.

249
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,896
Scott: someone takes seven episodes of stuff and stretches it out over.

250
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:33,377
Scott: what 26 episodes?

251
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:36,048
Scott: It's not gonna be worth your time.

252
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,775
Scott: you could have just watched the seven episodes.

253
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,080
Rym: it has some funny moments But it's not worth watching seriously.

254
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,434
Rym: And if you doubt me watch the OAV then watch the first Episode or two of the wanderers, and you'll see that it's just.

255
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:49,459
Rym: it's not up to stuff.

256
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:58,626
Rym: So anyway that whatever they decided then and by they I mean people other than the original creator and director To make a sequel to El Hazzard.

257
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,478
Rym: El Hazzard to the magnificent world which is also an OAV.

258
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:07,343
Scott: But isn't it not only bad, but also Lesbians?

259
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,551
Rym: well the first El Hazzard was good.

260
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:15,752
Rym: the second El Hazzard here is Pretty much just edgy kind of porny crap.

261
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:17,298
Rym: It's just it's dribble.

262
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,048
Rym: It's not good It's not worth watching.

263
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,420
Rym: wasn't directed by the same guy.

264
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,088
Rym: Kind of crappy, but wait.

265
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:24,914
Scott: There's more is there really?

266
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,059
Scott: is there a manga there.

267
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:26,801
Rym: Ah yes There is.

268
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:31,699
Rym: it's not so great, but then there is El Hazzard the alternative world.

269
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:38,472
Rym: now We've already got to at least two Alternative worlds to El Hazzard the TV show and the OAV world.

270
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:44,539
Rym: as far as I'm concerned the real OAV world stops at the end Of the first one, but then there's this alternative world.

271
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:53,360
Rym: Ho-ho, it's after the second OAV and all our friends get transported to another dimension and everything's all kooky And it's just shit.

272
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:55,632
Scott: so we've got here.

273
00:20:55,652 --> 00:21:07,628
Scott: we have an OAV a Sequel to that OAV a TV series that tells the same story as the original OAV and a Another alternate universe that tells a story.

274
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:12,140
Scott: after the sequel to the OAV is that a TV series the the alternate world.

275
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,654
Rym: But they're all OAVs except for though.

276
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,940
Scott: It's like 12 for the wanders.

277
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,154
Scott: Yeah, yeah, and we've got a manga and all of them are complete shit except.

278
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:22,495
Rym: Oh, no.

279
00:21:22,555 --> 00:21:23,017
Rym: I'm wrong.

280
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,160
Rym: alternative world was a TV.

281
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,560
Scott: They're all complete shit except for the original OAV.

282
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,554
Scott: There's only one of these things is worth watching yet all of them are called El Hazzard.

283
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:41,704
Rym: now funnily enough I said that this director You know he only did the original first OAV of Tenchi and like one other thing the Miyoshi special Which is actually pretty funny.

284
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,320
Rym: I will note that almost all I mean I like Tenchi.

285
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,978
Rym: I think Tenchi Muyo was a pretty good show.

286
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:58,400
Rym: Almost all of the Tenchi Muyo TV shows and OAVs and spin-offs and specials After that much like El Hazzard were not directed by this person and are really crappy.

287
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:17,018
Scott: It seems like this guy has sort of a habit of starting something that people like and then Rather than continue on and make more of it other people come along take the property and they make more of it And they seem to ruin it completely so that the people who like the original do not like what they continue with.

288
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:25,080
Rym: now There's a lot more to that story, but unlike other shows I don't think you want us to talk about the director for an hour, so I think we'll leave it at that.

289
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,965
Rym: Yeah But I cannot stress enough.

290
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,840
Rym: do not bother watching El Hazzard unless it is the original OAV.

291
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:36,408
Rym: Now you might ask us well Rym and Scott How can we get a hold of the OAV?

292
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:37,836
Rym: and the answer is I don't know.

293
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,600
Scott: I don't know either.

294
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:39,779
Rym: I really want to see it.

295
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,438
Rym: No It's not.

296
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:49,019
Scott: We watched a tape of VHS tape of it that Rym taped off the sci-fi channel when he was a kid and happened to still Have when we were freshmen at RIT.

297
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,625
Scott: That's the only way we were able to see it.

298
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:56,785
Rym: yes there there were some fan subs of it in the anime club library But we threw those away.

299
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:57,968
Rym: I forget why?

300
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,352
Rym: probably because they were illegal.

301
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,519
Scott: I don't know, but there are DVDs.

302
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,751
Scott: We just have a hard time finding them and when we do find them.

303
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:07,638
Scott: They're expensive, and they're you know.

304
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,660
Scott: I'm sure There's bootlegs out there also, but you know they're bootlegs.

305
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,324
Rym: I'm not down with that.

306
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:20,220
Rym: no because the I mean actually I really want to own the original DVD even though I really think at some point this show is gonna get re-released in some fashion.

307
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:25,940
Scott: Well, it's one of those shows that you know only that like people who were it's sort of like one of those shows.

308
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:26,525
Scott: It's not.

309
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:29,885
Scott: it's not an unknown show But it's not a super A+.

310
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:42,480
Scott: everyone knows about it show and thus people who are really into anime at the time When the show comes out notice it, but people who are into anime at any other time don't notice it And it's just gone.

311
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:46,260
Scott: You know it just sort of disappears, but people were into anime at the time it came out.

312
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,619
Scott: It's a show they noticed and only those people seem to remember the show or care about it at all in any way.

313
00:23:52,222 --> 00:24:04,080
Rym: But anyway, if you want to know what the hell is this show about now We're going to be very careful to avoid spoilers because the show is short enough And it moves quickly enough to where it's pretty easy to ruin a lot of the seven episodes.

314
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:16,719
Rym: If I tell you what happens in the second episode we're already well into the story ruining things Yeah, but what I do want to say is that the show is a drama and a comedy And it's one of those rare shows that pulls off both and a fantasy.

315
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:23,960
Rym: well Yeah, but it pulls them off equally and well And that's saying a lot because a lot of shows tried to do that and fail.

316
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:25,826
Scott: This is one of those shows where it's.

317
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:30,300
Scott: it's really just about a cast of characters and all but none of them suck.

318
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:40,687
Scott: They're all awesome in some way particularly mr.. Fujisawa and also jinai and his sister and The bug queen pretty much everyone.

319
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:44,940
Scott: yeah, right and those magic girls the the one with the red hair who's all crazy.

320
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:52,980
Rym: So the story of El Hazzard is basically there's this guy Makoto and he's in high school, and he's really kind of awesome.

321
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:02,700
Scott: He's a stalwart stand-up really smart guy, and there's some other people in the high school who are Annoying or funny in their own ways like jinai his rival.

322
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,604
Rym: Yes The original.

323
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:17,459
Rym: when you watch the show like the issue is makoto is just a good guy and jinai is well jinai if you If you want to understand this character music video thing of the day pretty much spot-on.

324
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:24,180
Rym: So Makoto is friends with jinai nominally and likes him and just really nice to him and doesn't seem to have any issue with him.

325
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:35,240
Rym: but jinai has unspecified issues with Makoto Also, he's scheming and evil, and he pulled some shady business to be the head of the student council and all this business.

326
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:46,659
Rym: Makoto ends up getting him kicked off and There's kind of this flashback montage of all the reasons why jinai hates makoto And that is one of the funniest things in the entire show.

327
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:57,196
Rym: It's definitely a pretty funny bit and it's basically just makoto is better and smarter than jinai in every Possible and conceivable way and even when he isn't by dumb luck he just always wins.

328
00:25:58,018 --> 00:26:04,140
Scott: and jinai Just keeps getting more and more pissed off and he tries more and more crazier things to come out on top.

329
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Scott: But he sort of doesn't care about being evil or anything like that.

330
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:08,678
Rym: So it kind of ends with it.

331
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,800
Rym: Well in the beginning that plot with him snapping and like trying to kidnap makoto and tie him up in an office somewhere.

332
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,049
Rym: I don't know what he planned to do with him.

333
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:17,720
Scott: Yeah, that was just sort of crazy.

334
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,220
Rym: That was to prevent him from testifying in an impeachment trial.

335
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,990
Rym: I forget exactly, but that's not the plot.

336
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:29,860
Rym: because then sure enough Underneath the school they find some ancient ruins.

337
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:36,220
Scott: Yeah, sort of completely randomly, but they do foreshadow it because they show you the ancient ruins a few times.

338
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:41,800
Scott: But the characters in the show Really have nothing to do with these ancient ruins until they randomly stumble upon them.

339
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:42,261
Scott: so

340
00:26:42,341 --> 00:27:00,320
Rym: one thing leads to another and makoto ends up in these ancient ruins and a thing happens and opens up and we don't really Know why and there's a woman in there and she falls into his arms and says something to the effect of I've waited so long To see you again, and then she sends him off to El Hazzard and then the story really begins.

341
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:16,825
Scott: Yeah basically it's one of those get transported to a fantasy world shows where a bunch one or more people in the Normal world that is a lot like our world end up in a fantasy world and they get tied up in the adventure and the politics Of that fantasy world.

342
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:20,240
Scott: and then do they get back at the end to the real world?

343
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:25,108
Rym: You Really got to avoid spoiling.

344
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:37,949
Rym: but what the thing that really works about this show that a lot of you know Someone gets sent off to a magical world shows fail at is that all the characters deal with it and interesting and sometimes Hilarious ways and it's really not kind of ours.

345
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:52,465
Scott: I think one thing that's really cool is how normally, you know Like an eska flown if she gets transported to the other world, right and what she's just a girl in another world That that's it in this a sort of comedically and also plotly I guess if that's a word.

346
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:56,780
Scott: every person who gets sent to the other world ends up with some sort of power.

347
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,987
Rym: Um, I think you forget that.

348
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:04,252
Rym: who told me dad's quite a bit of power in Eska flown a and she's pivotal to but not like not like this.

349
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:06,540
Scott: This is more like they have a direct superpower.

350
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:07,906
Rym: She has a superpower.

351
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:10,879
Rym: She just doesn't realize how powerful it is until near the end of the show.

352
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,290
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I know what you're saying.

353
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:16,717
Scott: I'm like, mr Fujisawa is the is the teacher and he gets sent to the other world.

354
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:21,140
Scott: now mister Fujisawa is the is the comedic relief of greatness.

355
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:25,594
Rym: He is the smokiness drink in his Fuji saw a kick kind of awesome professor.

356
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:32,144
Scott: and when he gets sent to the other world He basically becomes the drunken master as long as he's Inebriated.

357
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:33,331
Rym: No, it's the exact.

358
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:33,915
Scott: All right.

359
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:34,700
Scott: That's right.

360
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:37,844
Scott: He's so drunken in the normal world But so.

361
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:47,480
Scott: but when he's in the fantasy world when he is sober He has superpowers of fighting and kicking ass, but it's hard for him to stay sober because he's an alcoholic.

362
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,373
Rym: There's an awesome scene in the beginning.

363
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,945
Rym: when they're first in this world it's just cuz actually the other cool thing.

364
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:59,288
Rym: all the characters get split up and then all kind of comes back together later, but Makoto and Fuji saw her together and they're.

365
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:01,837
Rym: they get attacked by giant bugs Oh Noah's.

366
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,872
Rym: and Fuji saw would discovers he has superpowers and starts kicking their asses.

367
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:09,845
Rym: So Makoto says oh man I bet I have superpowers too.

368
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:14,017
Rym: This is great and he totally doesn't and he totally gets his ass.

369
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,946
Rym: He has some other powers Yeah, but that doesn't come in later.

370
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:17,508
Scott: No, it doesn't.

371
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:22,202
Scott: but yeah everyone everyone who gets transports the other world has powers and Some of them are.

372
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:27,160
Scott: they're all different and they're all hilarious or useful in some way that you'll just have to find out.

373
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:27,847
Rym: I love out.

374
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:28,940
Rym: I mean Jedi's sister.

375
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:38,480
Rym: You don't really see a lot of her but she's in the world and she's basically just getting by Being a shopkeeper and selling food to people and working as a waitress and just kind of living her life.

376
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,801
Scott: Yeah I don't.

377
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:49,440
Scott: she's definitely like one of the best characters in the show because she she's a lot does a lot of the things that You would never see a character in the same kind of show do like people who go to other worlds.

378
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,632
Scott: You know in anime they don't do that sort of thing.

379
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:54,213
Scott: So to see her do that sort of thing It's like yeah, that's what I would do.

380
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:57,809
Rym: All right so Jenna and this is the part where I'm gonna kind of leave you.

381
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:07,619
Rym: after this Jenna ends up by himself and these same bugs kind of come around and Realizes that he can talk to these bugs and he kind of likes him and they kind of like him.

382
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:15,438
Rym: So they sit around and talk and one thing leads to another and he ends up leading The Empire of these bugs and he's a great general among their people.

383
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:21,675
Scott: now The guy who was super annoying in high school that was evil and scheming is now the bug Emperor It's got.

384
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:30,840
Rym: I mean it's kind of an interesting thing that now that like jinn I has actually a lot of potential and he's very smart and he's just He's actually a very confident person.

385
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Rym: Yeah but the real world the world of you know you and me going to school really didn't let him get out his full potential because When is he gonna be a general of a bug army in high school unless he finds a jar of ants somewhere?

386
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,159
Scott: I think that's one thing that makes the show pretty interesting.

387
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,520
Scott: Is that if you have a short attention span like a YouTube watching kid?

388
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:52,500
Scott: You have all these different characters that you're looking after.

389
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:52,861
Scott: right?

390
00:30:52,942 --> 00:31:03,929
Scott: some that are that we're always living in the fantasy world and some that were from the high school and travel to the fantasy world and others that who knows you maybe meet later and They're not together in like this party.

391
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,620
Scott: So you're always looking at all these different things going on.

392
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,940
Scott: You'll see the bug rooms, then you'll see something with these characters.

393
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,939
Scott: then you'll see these characters wandering in the woods and these characters in the castle and these characters in the other castle or something.

394
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:18,460
Scott: and It keeps moving around and you've got all these different things.

395
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:33,858
Scott: you're watching and they all sort of come together like they do in good stories and You're never gonna be bored watching it because as soon as some part of the show gets boring like you're tired of Janai and his Bug room, they're not funny anymore You'll be back in the castle where there's some castle hijinks going

396
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:34,080
Rym: on.

397
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,680
Rym: See now this is actually one of the show's greatest strengths And I think it's also conversely the exact reason that the Wanderers was pretty crappy.

398
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:46,100
Rym: The show was short enough to where and the action moves at such a pace.

399
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:51,660
Rym: It's seven episodes people pretty much the moment you start getting bored with any given plot line or any given situation.

400
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,831
Rym: It just kind of moves on just as you start to get bored with it And as a result, you never really get bored with it.

401
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,400
Rym: and then the show's over.

402
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:02,640
Scott: I mean you've seen how many you know travel to another fantasy world animes, right?

403
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,908
Scott: Well, usually that you get you're like.

404
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,454
Scott: I seen this before I'm done here.

405
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:13,200
Scott: I got nothing to see whatever But when it's only seven episodes, you'll be done before you start saying I've seen this before whatever.

406
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:13,523
Scott: I

407
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:25,309
Rym: mean eska flown a did this really well, too even though that might have been by accident because According to the story eska flown a was supposed to be I think 39 episodes and they cut it short so they compressed a whole bunch of plot into the end

408
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,132
Scott: didn't seem to hurt it

409
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:26,574
Rym: well.

410
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:31,013
Rym: as a result the show got a lot tighter and This show took that to the extreme.

411
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:31,979
Rym: The show is really tight.

412
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:35,378
Rym: It's no AV it's yes, but no part of it drags out Really?

413
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,880
Rym: It just keeps moving along and it's really solid in that regard.

414
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:43,819
Rym: The Wanderers meanwhile just drags and drags and drags and drags and drags and I couldn't bear finishing it.

415
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:52,916
Scott: And while the story itself is not some like, you know Amazing literary story that's going to enlighten you for all time with some amazing message.

416
00:32:53,478 --> 00:32:54,340
Scott: It's not a bad story.

417
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:54,581
Scott: It's.

418
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,700
Scott: it's a very good story and it's well-written and there's no like loose ends hanging around and everything makes sense.

419
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,945
Scott: And it's cool.

420
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,752
Scott: and the characters are all there.

421
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:03,936
Scott: There aren't any really characters.

422
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:04,960
Scott: You don't like in the show.

423
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,715
Scott: I mean some are better than others, but there aren't any characters like all that character again.

424
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:11,240
Scott: I don't want to watch them fast forward.

425
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,325
Scott: It's all of them are good.

426
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:14,878
Scott: All right, some were paying attention to someone now.

427
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:22,331
Rym: All right Yeah, I mean like Scott said the plots really solid and it you know it starts out a kind of this there's ruins under the high school.

428
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:31,339
Rym: blah blah blah girl says something go and Everything gets resolved in a very well done way and it's not an ending that I predicted at all.

429
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:36,820
Scott: No, it's definitely not something that you would predict mostly because you don't know enough about what's gonna happen.

430
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,989
Scott: You know until you're into it and then it ends so quickly You didn't have time to think about what was gonna happen.

431
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:45,507
Scott: It's like just as you start to think Oh, maybe it'll end like this.

432
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,372
Scott: Oh, it just ended.

433
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:47,478
Scott: It's only seven episodes.

434
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,899
Scott: Oops Okay, the end awesome.

435
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,347
Scott: Anything else to say about El hazard?

436
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:53,372
Scott: Oh, it's not El hazard.

437
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:55,260
Scott: By the way, if you say that I'm gonna smack you.

438
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,320
Scott: Yeah, El hazard and only the first OAV is worth watching.

439
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:05,989
Rym: I guess we could talk a little bit about the dub because the dub is you know It's from that era of anime like the late 90s.

440
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,775
Scott: It's like all those other dubs from that time.

441
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:10,592
Rym: It's not great It's not terrible.

442
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:11,360
Rym: It's watchable.

443
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:21,527
Rym: I don't believe there are too many terrible inaccuracies But I can't recall because I haven't seen the dub in I don't know nine years Did I never see the sub?

444
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:25,000
Scott: I think because we've only watched that dub VHS from sci-fi channel.

445
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,649
Rym: I've seen both but I can't recall.

446
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:32,646
Rym: I mean when I saw the sub that was back when I wasn't as Familiar with the Japanese amazing.

447
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:36,560
Scott: I remember as much about the show as I do considering I haven't seen it in like six years.

448
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,107
Rym: Well, because it's a really good show.

449
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:41,040
Scott: It was really good and I want to watch it again.

450
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:41,702
Scott: That's not good.

451
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:42,505
Scott: It was one thing.

452
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:46,520
Rym: I remember from the dub is that there's a scene early on where this.

453
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:51,737
Rym: You'll know it when it happens, but ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

454
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:52,159
Scott: I don't know.

455
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,426
Scott: Maybe that was taken from the sub.

456
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,571
Scott: It's tough to tell ba ba ba.

457
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,239
Rym: No, that was definitely from the doubt.

458
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,759
Rym: now They might have done something similar in the sub.

459
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,980
Scott: But yeah, you notice sometimes we'll say something like ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba that that's from El Hazzard.

460
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:08,935
Rym: That's a fairly obscure El Hazzard reference a very obscure El Hazzard reference.

461
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:10,580
Scott: you go around anime con you go ba ba ba.

462
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,104
Scott: No one's gonna know what the hell you're doing.

463
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:16,574
Scott: However, if someone does that person is either a really scary nerd or they're us.

464
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,823
Rym: I Think we'll leave it at that.

465
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:22,290
Scott: Yeah, you should try to find El Hazzard.

466
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,376
Scott: help us try to find it.

467
00:35:24,577 --> 00:35:28,980
Rym: Maybe that'd be nice Yes, but because I mean I don't want to ruin anything about the story in the plot.

468
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,899
Rym: But the show is super worth watching and I highly highly highly highly recommend it.
