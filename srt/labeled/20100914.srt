1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,157
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday September 14th.

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,546
Rym: I'm Rym Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:23,321
Rym: packs 2010.

4
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,338
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,760
Rym: So we had packs and then we had the weekend you had packs.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,047
Scott: Hey, how did you have it?

7
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:32,274
Rym: as in we were at packs?

8
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:33,240
Rym: We had packs happen.

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,658
Scott: In what way do you own it?

10
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:40,940
Rym: In that that is a common grammatical construct that is not a problem for most normal people.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,828
Scott: I believe you would say you went to it.

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:43,793
Scott: so we had part.

13
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:52,668
Rym: you part took and then The following weekend without a break we had a nerd NYC board game night on Friday And then we had a nerd NYC recess.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,712
Scott: that we did.

15
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,260
Rym: I basically haven't had a rest from gaming.

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,865
Scott: You're not plenty games today.

17
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,813
Rym: I played counter-strike as soon as I got home.

18
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,098
Scott: Oh that was your choice.

19
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:04,004
Rym: Yeah Yeah, no rest.

20
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:08,076
Scott: I notice you were playing a siege a very classic map.

21
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,280
Rym: It was a remake of siege.

22
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,373
Rym: I did not recognize it at first because I didn't notice the name.

23
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:12,976
Rym: I just joined.

24
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:13,920
Rym: it was a weird server.

25
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:22,574
Rym: There's a lot of weird new counter-strike servers, and it all seems to be like People who are noobs to counter-strike running servers, so they don't ban the auto.

26
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,019
Rym: they don't ban the AWP.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,983
Scott: Why would you don't?

28
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,149
Rym: why would you ban that?

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,194
Rym: every server does that?

30
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,360
Rym: why just they do?

31
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:29,867
Scott: Why would you do that?

32
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,400
Rym: because they do everyone's stupid?

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,701
Rym: I don't.

34
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,254
Scott: that's not why that's just they do know because that's not the reason they do.

35
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:36,960
Rym: how am I supposed to know they're stupid every?

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,447
Rym: Counter-strike server I ever see.

37
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,698
Rym: bands the AWP they ban the autos.

38
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,329
Scott: well They're stupid is a reason.

39
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,048
Rym: they also give everyone 16,000 money every round.

40
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:47,092
Scott: what yeah?

41
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,040
Rym: a lot of them even banned smoke grenades.

42
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,905
Scott: What yeah why?

43
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,091
Rym: and half the servers don't even run real maps.

44
00:01:53,111 --> 00:02:00,779
Rym: they either just run office 24/7 dust to 24/7 or they run those weird bullshit maps like jailbreak.

45
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,586
Rym: Yeah, jailbreak isn't?

46
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,453
Rym: it looks like a quake one map.

47
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:05,256
Rym: it is awful.

48
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,039
Scott: I mean gun games.

49
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:12,239
Rym: alright I like gun game yeah, but I like gun game and the more realistic maps more so than on like Tetris.

50
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,583
Rym: Tetris.

51
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,820
Rym: yeah, I don't like those Tetris weird-ass maps.

52
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:20,334
Rym: But anyway all the servers run by noobs are kind of default rules.

53
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,340
Rym: no bullshit, and it's great.

54
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:22,822
Rym: I get to.

55
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:26,160
Rym: so suddenly I'm playing all these maps that I didn't know existed in source.

56
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:28,732
Rym: So I'm on this map and I play like three rounds.

57
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,240
Scott: I think you need to run your own seat server.

58
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:38,585
Rym: I'm working on that but other things that the GeekNights server is so low on my priority list right now And once it five comes out.

59
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,471
Rym: It's basically at the bottom of the list.

60
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:44,162
Scott: so many goddamn games unfinished damn It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:44,664
Rym: sit five.

62
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,151
Scott: I know, but it's like I said five.

63
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,739
Scott: I never finished that borderlands game whatever.

64
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,120
Scott: so five I know whatever, but the point is I paid money for it, and I haven't finished.

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,474
Rym: I think my trouble with Borderlands is that once I got going in it.

66
00:02:57,534 --> 00:03:00,410
Rym: It was fun, but every time I want to co-op everyone.

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,114
Rym: I know is that a different level and It's not fun to be the lowest or the highest level guy.

68
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,280
Scott: that is a problem.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,425
Scott: Is that level matters.

70
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:11,200
Scott: instead of just FPSing it should really game had no levels and only equipment.

71
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,903
Scott: It'd be much better.

72
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:17,609
Rym: or if it did a Pokemon thing and just brought everyone to the same like equivalent level just to make It work man.

73
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:24,677
Scott: I think it would just be fine If there were no levels in the game and everybody just had equipment and the equipment.

74
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:25,420
Scott: you had any on it.

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,533
Scott: You could use any equipment no matter what but some equipment is just better right.

76
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:36,260
Rym: so the better equipment would be in the harder places Alright, so then I'm loaded out with all the crazy equipment And you don't have anything.

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,213
Scott: But the equipment doesn't make as much a difference as the levels do.

78
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,946
Scott: so even the crazy equipment is fully better But it wouldn't be enough.

79
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,515
Rym: so what about the player abilities?

80
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,964
Scott: the player What do you mean?

81
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,454
Rym: you got to unlock all those abilities.

82
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,199
Rym: you got a level up?

83
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,194
Scott: You just make them into items or some shit.

84
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:52,007
Rym: alright But they give you a huge advantage.

85
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,351
Rym: having those not really they.

86
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,538
Scott: it just like the auto turret and stuff like that isn't?

87
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,120
Scott: or the eagle?

88
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,038
Rym: They're not that as the siren mine are.

89
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:04,620
Scott: Main difference is that just as you get more levels you get more HP, and you do more damage just straight up.

90
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,060
Rym: And yeah, I know that's a problem.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,370
Scott: They should just get rid of that entirely.

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,740
Scott: you just always do the same damage.

93
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:11,932
Rym: You realize most gamers want that even like Dave Riley and all them like.

94
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:12,615
Rym: they love games.

95
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,860
Rym: you level up and have tech trees.

96
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:20,745
Scott: Yeah The reason they like that is because it makes you feel like you're mad skilled and makes you feel like you're improving when you're actually Not improving it.

97
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,619
Rym: I don't think that's the reason a lot of people like it.

98
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,189
Scott: I'm a psychological reason that it's in there for some people.

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,755
Rym: that is definitely true, but not everyone.

100
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:34,520
Rym: some people just enjoy The like exploring the tree of abilities as you progress through a game, and that's a legitimate utility in gaming.

101
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,090
Scott: But that a tree of abilities is the exact same thing.

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,780
Scott: it psychologically they might you know not might not be conscious.

103
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:45,613
Scott: But that is the reason that that is enjoyable is because it makes you Way too many assumptions.

104
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:46,580
Scott: That's absolutely true.

105
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,220
Scott: That's why this is why get flash games that have that mechanic are the ones that are the most popular by an order of magnitude.

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,400
Rym: Yeah, but just because a implies B. Does not being mean that B implies a.

107
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:57,164
Scott: What do you mean?

108
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:58,029
Rym: you're not.

109
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,240
Rym: I don't agree with your premise that all Exploration of tech trees is enjoyable only because of this one mechanic.

110
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:12,407
Scott: well, I mean there are things that you could call a tech tree such as for example the Technology in civilization.

111
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,317
Rym: Yeah, so I level up my sieve and my better than this.

112
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,587
Rym: if they didn't level up It's not leveling up.

113
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,391
Rym: So what's the difference?

114
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,075
Scott: a different thing?

115
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:19,356
Scott: How?

116
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:19,999
Rym: what's different?

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,869
Scott: there's a difference between Leveling up and leveling to the right right.

118
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,420
Scott: so for example Mario levels to the right.

119
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,957
Scott: He goes to the next level where things are more difficult.

120
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:35,580
Rym: all right What if so we're playing Mario, but I get the hammer suit and you don't have the hammer suit.

121
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,047
Rym: I'm clearly at an advantage.

122
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,314
Rym: I leveled up.

123
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,480
Rym: I explored that tech.

124
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,860
Scott: I got the hammer suit, but the hammer suit isn't something that you earn simply by time.

125
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,838
Scott: It is something you earn by skill.

126
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:51,899
Scott: So you have to get to actually do difficult things to get the hammer suit.

127
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,569
Rym: yeah You can do that with tech trees too in games Yes, like in civilization where you have to generate.

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:05,160
Scott: You know it's actually quite difficult to generate enough Beakers faster than the other people while also making sure everything else doesn't fall apart.

129
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,592
Scott: I I still disagree with your argument.

130
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:14,360
Scott: you get levels simply by Not doing anything more difficult by simply doing the easy things over and over again.

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,424
Rym: Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

132
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:21,860
Rym: what I'm saying is even in a game like that not everyone gets their enjoyment Just because of that one particular psychological thing.

133
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:30,834
Scott: I'm saying that that if in a game where you level up by doing something that is not more difficult Right in there the difficulty of Borderlands does not increase at any point.

134
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:35,420
Scott: Yeah, same difficulty throughout Yeah, and they simply scale up your numbers and the bad guys.

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,015
Rym: Yeah, I don't disagree with any of this and the only reason that that is enjoyable.

136
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,260
Rym: No I disagree with that.

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,866
Rym: It's not the only reason why would that be enjoyable?

138
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:43,888
Scott: for any other reason.

139
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,451
Rym: some people like unlocking stuff.

140
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,433
Rym: some people like you know.

141
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,798
Rym: Why do people like steak?

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,681
Scott: Steak?

143
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:53,890
Scott: is it because it tastes good?

144
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,240
Rym: what someone else doesn't like steak?

145
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,088
Scott: Yes, because it doesn't taste good to them.

146
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,840
Rym: Yeah, so what if leveling up tastes good to some people?

147
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,700
Scott: I don't know why it is leveling up taste.

148
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,824
Rym: Why does steak taste good?

149
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:07,517
Scott: because there's things in your tongue in your brain that you're you.

150
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,389
Scott: it touches your tongue And there's fat and sugar and good stuff in there.

151
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,540
Scott: all right, but not it tells your brain that it tastes good.

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,543
Rym: Not everyone likes that.

153
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,730
Scott: no because some people have fucked up tongues.

154
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,319
Rym: some people have different tastes right.

155
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,090
Rym: so Gaming as well.

156
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,279
Scott: the reason that leveling up?

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,511
Rym: Not everyone who likes steak likes it for that one particular reason.

158
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:27,180
Rym: some people might like steak just cuz they like fucking killing cows.

159
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,869
Rym: Maybe they just like eating that texture.

160
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,519
Rym: There's lots of different reasons someone might like something.

161
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,301
Scott: no It is.

162
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:40,646
Rym: I disagree with this premise that the only reason anyone could ever have for liking a tech tree in any Capability is there at stake.

163
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,455
Scott: first of all you're lumping a bunch of different tech trees together.

164
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:45,080
Scott: right the thing is is that there?

165
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:46,725
Rym: Clearly to find the difference?

166
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:57,514
Rym: the reason that games in which simply playing repeatedly I agree with you on this too, but you need enjoyable fire for many people not for all people It's for everybody.

167
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:58,483
Scott: now I don't.

168
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:02,199
Scott: there's no reason to enjoy that kind of thing for you for anybody.

169
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,048
Rym: now I disagree.

170
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,060
Scott: otherwise you just lie to yourself.

171
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,659
Rym: I don't like those games, but I'd still disagree with you.

172
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:19,107
Rym: But anyway, maybe we'll have to do a show on it do a panel on it regardless The complaint we get whatever we do Panel shows or con shows or event shows on GeekNights and it's always weird.

173
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:30,116
Rym: because if we talk about a con we went to and We just kind of talk about our personal experiences and review the con Half the people email us and say I don't want to hear about these bullshit cons cuz I don't go to them And I don't give a shit.

174
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,467
Scott: Maybe you should go to them and give a shit.

175
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,620
Rym: and the thing is they always say why do you do these shows and we?

176
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:48,782
Rym: Get an equal amount of feedback saying yeah, I'm glad to hear about it I was there and it was awesome, or I didn't get to go, but it was awesome hearing about it from you and Both sides don't seem to realize that it's 50/50.

177
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,296
Rym: It's not like we're catering to this audience of like four people who went to PAX.

178
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:58,500
Rym: when we talk about packs I would say that the majority of you guys want the shows about conventions, so shut up haters.

179
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,295
Scott: Yeah, but we have figured out a plan to appease both sides.

180
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,980
Scott: if you're one of those convention people You're probably you know who hates these shows.

181
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,336
Scott: Maybe you didn't even start listening to this one because you're like oh, it's about packs.

182
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:10,959
Scott: I'm not listening.

183
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:26,679
Scott: well You fail because in the first half of the show we're gonna just talk about games all the games We happen to have played at PAX, and then we will do the part that some people You know might not enjoy Which is talking about the things that happened at PAX in the second half of the show.

184
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:34,395
Scott: So anyone who just didn't listen to the show at all because they didn't want to listen to a convention show You missed half a show you probably want to listen to.

185
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:35,099
Scott: so fail on you.

186
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:37,647
Rym: Not that they'll ever know.

187
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:41,040
Scott: some of them might know because they might find out eventually.

188
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:46,332
Rym: So Saturday was like the gaming fucking night for us at PAX.

189
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:52,878
Rym: we basically had nothing to do except our panel and We pretty much hung out in tabletop almost all night playing.

190
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:55,473
Rym: in fact We were some of the last people out of the convention center.

191
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:59,160
Rym: the enforcers were like all right We're locking the door, and we're going to bed.

192
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:03,300
Rym: You've got to be out by to close the door behind you and then they left.

193
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:08,555
Scott: That's fun guess cuz we had enforcers with us playing so it was pretty rockin.

194
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,718
Rym: We played a free market.

195
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,649
Scott: Yep Well that was Saturday.

196
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,220
Scott: I mean what about the games we played on Friday?

197
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,010
Rym: I was just talking about Saturday to start you jumping over to Saturday.

198
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,520
Scott: that this doesn't matter cuz we're not talking about the convention yet.

199
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,311
Rym: Plus we didn't play that many games on Friday.

200
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,640
Rym: Saturday was like the game at night.

201
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:27,491
Scott: I can't remember which day I played which games or all the games I played because I played so many games.

202
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:34,000
Rym: the note for you because I actually remember on Saturday we played free market Bonanza power boats modern art push fight Dominion jungle speed.

203
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,961
Scott: We didn't play this because you probably sat there while I was biking over here and thought and tried to remember really hard and wrote Them all down.

204
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:40,222
Rym: No.

205
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:41,465
Rym: I just have a memory.

206
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,430
Rym: captain doesn't remember anything from any media.

207
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,673
Rym: We ever consume ever.

208
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:59,675
Rym: I remember name any Character other than your own from the last RPG that we played with Alex the burning wheel game The burning wheel game any character NBC PC their name I could tie getting.

209
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:09,155
Scott: I could tell you that like Adam was the wolf and Pete was the rat and Kate was bitch name more than two characters from the Prince of Nothing series the entire series.

210
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:19,645
Scott: nay, all right as Manet, all right The the crazy priest dude Starts an M.

211
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,431
Rym: My thinet Matt.

212
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:21,833
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,779
Rym: All right, so far you've only got two.

214
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,614
Rym: You didn't even name the protagonist yet.

215
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:31,289
Rym: Oh Okay, you're getting there.

216
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,100
Scott: I came in all right.

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,806
Rym: Regardless this is not a member.

218
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,593
Rym: member of like super memory.

219
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,680
Rym: It's just a matter of remembering what games I fucking.

220
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,400
Scott: It's not it's not easy.

221
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:48,820
Rym: So yeah, Scott ran free market at PAX cuz we had like some hours to kill and we played with some listeners.

222
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,743
Rym: It was totally awesome.

223
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,095
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing about free market is, you know, I'm trying to Gia.

224
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:56,069
Rym: I realized Scott You don't have any flavor text.

225
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,079
Scott: My GM is my GM skills are low.

226
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,228
Scott: So the thing is I realized.

227
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:08,379
Scott: also the only way to up the GM skills is practice Which is a chicken and egg situation because nobody wants to play a game with a shitty GM.

228
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:18,780
Scott: but the only way to make a good GM is either have Talent just you're born with it or Play a bunch of games with the shitty GM until the shitty GM isn't shitty anymore.

229
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,586
Rym: See now here's here's the real trouble.

230
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:26,119
Rym: if you want to run a shitty game with inexperienced players They're never gonna want to roleplay again.

231
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:31,019
Rym: If you want to if you're gonna do that with experienced players, they know and they're not gonna show up.

232
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:31,903
Scott: That's right.

233
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:32,787
Rym: You know how I learned.

234
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,011
Scott: it's a chicken and egg situation.

235
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,180
Rym: I GM really shitty games in high school.

236
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,204
Scott: That's right.

237
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:43,592
Scott: It seems like that's the only way to do it because in high school People are getting the kids are gonna play no matter what right you can.

238
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:44,957
Scott: you can get away with shitty GM.

239
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:48,490
Rym: in my high school There's a king because they like the shitty GMing.

240
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,735
Scott: they'll enjoy it no matter what.

241
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,140
Rym: I ran the worst game ever.

242
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,742
Rym: It was this week.

243
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:52,585
Rym: We called it guns.

244
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,348
Rym: It was the system.

245
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,278
Rym: We made to fix D&D set in the modern era with d30s.

246
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,588
Rym: I'm not even kidding.

247
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:14,080
Scott: or even in college You know Alex got a whole bunch of GM and skills playing a bunch of D&D with us that increased in quality over time You know, yeah But free market, I don't know how much you want to talk about it now But it isn't like the easiest game in the world to GM Like it's so easy.

248
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:21,292
Rym: Well, it's easy as long as you are able to come up with very detailed and very creative flavor text No matter what the characters are conflicting.

249
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:22,157
Scott: Well, I have a new.

250
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:22,780
Scott: I came up.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,100
Scott: I realized that my flavor text was weak and now I have come up with a flavor text strategy.

252
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,460
Scott: They're going on master now my flavor text strategy that I'm going to employ in the future.

253
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,429
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, because I have a very simple one.

254
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,293
Rym: Let's see if it's the same thing.

255
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:35,439
Rym: Just make shit up.

256
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:42,220
Scott: No, because making shit up is hard And you need a. you need a procedure to follow so that it is easier to make shit up, right?

257
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,036
Scott: So here's my new procedure to make my flavor text not suck.

258
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:46,839
Scott: You ready for this?

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,180
Scott: Whenever anything is happening, right whenever you open whenever I open my mouth to describe anything that is happening, right?

260
00:13:54,681 --> 00:14:08,350
Scott: I must pick at least three of five senses of seeing tasting touching hearing smelling right the five and I must pick at least three and say what they are and that is How you will get the good flavor text.

261
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,544
Scott: I'll be like instead of just being for example Here's the bad flavor text.

262
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,052
Scott: you go into the dungeon.

263
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,135
Scott: It's a dungeon.

264
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,600
Scott: There's a monster here, right?

265
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,207
Scott: So now I have to pick three senses ready.

266
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,235
Scott: So you go into the dungeon.

267
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,760
Scott: I'll do the seeing in the dungeon.

268
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,431
Scott: It is an incredibly dark dungeon.

269
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,500
Scott: You can't even see three feet in front of your face.

270
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,752
Scott: Right before you there are some slimy rocks and then I'll do the smelling.

271
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:39,869
Scott: it is really dank and there is a hint of Rotting flesh wafting at you from deep into the darkness.

272
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,791
Scott: and then the hearing you hear some growling from around the corner Is a monster Scott.

273
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:48,540
Rym: I head down to the loading docks.

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,326
Rym: I'm looking for some dust bunnies.

275
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,309
Rym: help me clean up a problem.

276
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,517
Scott: You go down to the loading docks.

277
00:14:54,018 --> 00:15:18,579
Scott: you see you know many barges here and there are merchant Marines running about loading and unloading cargo containers onto the boats and You hear the sounds of the waves splashing against the the boardwalk and you smell the salty sea air and It is quite humid with all the the recent this coming storm.

278
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:23,140
Scott: All right, and you go to get some dust bunnies from the dust bunny dealer.

279
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:23,862
Scott: And he is.

280
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:28,980
Scott: he looks like a really he's a really old nasty man with a with a peg leg and an iPad.

281
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,491
Rym: You didn't tell me what he smells like.

282
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,382
Scott: I'm getting there Already.

283
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:38,320
Scott: I did the three senses for the docks and now I'm doing the three senses for the dust bunny salesman.

284
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,942
Rym: I'm good practice.

285
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:43,877
Rym: I'm thinking because that Arabian Nights game very pointedly requires you.

286
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:47,139
Rym: when you make characters You have to describe them in terms of five senses.

287
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:52,798
Rym: Every character has a sentence related to a sense and you have five sentences.

288
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,220
Rym: and that's it.

289
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,270
Scott: But do you see how this is?

290
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,300
Scott: this is the number one?

291
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:03,340
Scott: This is the key for the for the indie role-playing games is they give you a procedure some Rules to work with because nerds are good at rules.

292
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:07,517
Scott: They give you a instead of D&D which just says his rules for fighting.

293
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:11,160
Rym: and oh, yeah You should roleplay right thinking of which I picked up again.

294
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,720
Rym: You heard NYC another copy of the second edition advanced Dungeons & Dragons players handbook.

295
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,700
Rym: Yeah, then I opened it up and I opened it.

296
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:28,098
Rym: I happen to randomly open it to the page that says in the upper left hand corner weapon proficiencies and all this tag non weapon and on the bottom right of the next page non weapon proficiencies.

297
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,388
Rym: and it's like Cooking and swimming right?

298
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:43,671
Scott: The thing is the not the indie RPGs the good ones, you know Not all of them, but many of them give you an actual rules-based procedure for doing the role-playing Which turns nerds like me into quality role-playing.

299
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,120
Scott: Did you see how my shitty flavor text became?

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,045
Scott: satisfactory flavor text when I applied a procedure of Describe the three senses?

301
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,755
Scott: right if if I would if you know, just make shit up.

302
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:56,999
Scott: I'd be like, alright make shit up.

303
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:02,955
Scott: But instead I have a specific thing I have to do do seeing.

304
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:03,838
Scott: what does it see?

305
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,420
Scott: What do you see?

306
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,349
Scott: What does it smell like and what do you hear?

307
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,160
Scott: and I'm like, okay, what do they see?

308
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,861
Scott: They see this, you know and I picture it in my head and then it comes out because I have a procedure and that is The key.

309
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:23,220
Rym: but at least an experienced game master who knows the rules really well can whip out free market Including character creation at a con in like four hours.

310
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,989
Scott: I know the thing of the greatest thing about free market is that you really only imagine It's like learning a card game.

311
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,420
Scott: It is learning a card game, right?

312
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,572
Scott: It's like if you know how to play poker, you know, it's just a different poker not really related to poker But it's a card game like that and it's like those are.

313
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:38,879
Scott: that's how many rules you have to know.

314
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:47,238
Scott: Once you know all those rules You're good Because for example if you're GMing burning wheel or D&D their decisions the GM has to make that are sometimes difficult.

315
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,392
Scott: even in D&D It's like okay, you're gonna have to do a fight.

316
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,100
Scott: You're gonna have to do a skill challenge.

317
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,227
Scott: You're gonna have to do.

318
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,274
Scott: give me a this role.

319
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,240
Scott: Give me a strength check.

320
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,855
Scott: You have to figure out which rule to apply in which situations.

321
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,296
Scott: in free market You don't have to answer those kinds of hard questions.

322
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:09,468
Scott: as a GM All you have to decide is am I going to say yes and just let them do what they want at this point Or is it gonna be a challenge?

323
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:10,713
Scott: if it's a challenge?

324
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:11,817
Scott: It's all it's just.

325
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:12,440
Scott: it's a challenge.

326
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:13,243
Scott: That's it.

327
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:17,800
Scott: The only two rules are roleplay or have a challenge and having a challenge is also role-playing.

328
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,044
Rym: So I'm just amazed.

329
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:28,660
Scott: we pulled off a free market at a con because and it did it felt like when we were doing it I felt like oh my god I'm only have three days at PAX and I'm using like four hours on a free market.

330
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,531
Scott: But it totally in looking back at PAX.

331
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,896
Scott: It didn't take up that much time.

332
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:33,980
Scott: It was totally cool.

333
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,623
Scott: I mean we could have.

334
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:39,598
Scott: we should have done a few more challenges to really finish out the session But what we did was certainly enough.

335
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:42,317
Rym: Saturday night was the big like board gaming.

336
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:47,740
Rym: night though We played one round of this game called power boats, which actually was like it was a racing game.

337
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,606
Scott: And uh, you know, the thing is like.

338
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:53,440
Scott: I like racing games in theme, but not as much in practice.

339
00:18:53,782 --> 00:19:04,159
Rym: See now this game had good mechanics because the mechanics of power boats is pretty simple You can roll dice to kind of build up speed but if you want to slow down, it's not so easy and if you crash too much you explode.

340
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:13,770
Rym: and it's kind of this like momentum math odds game and you're racing against other people and We play it on like baby baby baby mode.

341
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,360
Rym: and it was still pretty damn fun and I I sucked.

342
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:33,605
Rym: It ended like I was way ahead and then a bunch of people caught up and it was a good game and I lost in the And I like third place But Scott and one other player kind of got caught in the back and Scott just went around in circles Backwards around one buoy.

343
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:38,422
Scott: the problem is the problem is I tried to take sort of a Mario Party kind of route and that did Not work.

344
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,540
Rym: So then you killed yourself because that was easier than making it to the head.

345
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,100
Scott: You know what that game needs ramps.

346
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,806
Scott: You can jump if you hit the ramp Whatever your speed is.

347
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:48,140
Scott: when you hit the ramp plus one you jump that many forward.

348
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,062
Scott: But if you land on a rock you die, but if you land in the water awesome These ramps.

349
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,133
Rym: maybe if you land you should keep your momentum no matter what.

350
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,397
Scott: I don't know.

351
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,140
Scott: so it needs jumps.

352
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:58,879
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

353
00:19:59,101 --> 00:19:59,806
Rym: I'm sure we can.

354
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:03,889
Scott: you can hit the side of the ramp and you would take damage But if you hit the front of the ramp you jump.

355
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,679
Rym: I say you should be able to ram other people, too.

356
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:06,865
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

357
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,820
Rym: It needs ramming and we need to be able to drop fucking mines.

358
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:11,985
Scott: Okay, it's a little bit too much.

359
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:12,930
Rym: no, I don't think it is.

360
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,080
Rym: I think oil slicks are enough plus imagine this taste.

361
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,304
Rym: So take the mechanics right?

362
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:17,688
Scott: Oh, no, you know what the game should be.

363
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,313
Scott: You don't control the boat.

364
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,637
Scott: You control a water skier, huh?

365
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,203
Scott: Attached to the boat.

366
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:23,965
Rym: No, so get this.

367
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:28,739
Rym: take the mechanics of the game with all the momentum and everything and make it a combat game.

368
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,430
Rym: It's basically Atari combat the board game and that can be pretty fun.

369
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:42,500
Scott: actually maybe I kind of just want to play Formula Day Because it has a better theme because formula racing is much better than power boat racing is pretty awesome.

370
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:45,780
Scott: I'm much more fan of Formula Race plus reading on board game geek.

371
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,480
Rym: It seems like people actually seem to prefer power boats as a better game probably because it has a lot more replay value.

372
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,960
Scott: I think so, but formula day has so many maps and like actual Monaco.

373
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:56,477
Scott: Oh, man.

374
00:20:57,061 --> 00:21:05,426
Rym: But we didn't even we played on the baby mat and we put the buoys in the babyest baby places and I still sucked And I haven't played.

375
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,216
Scott: I don't have a lot of racing games under my belt.

376
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:08,402
Scott: so, you know It was hard.

377
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,249
Rym: we played with me Scott and Ian.

378
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,674
Rym: quick game of modern art.

379
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:12,959
Rym: now you did warn him.

380
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,491
Scott: Well, you said I quote watch out Rym is good at bidding games.

381
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:20,024
Rym: Yep, and he didn't listen and it was his game And he got owned.

382
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:20,887
Scott: I even owned him.

383
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,872
Scott: I was pretty close to you.

384
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,720
Rym: actually you were but I ignored you.

385
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:24,988
Rym: Cuz you suck at bidding games.

386
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,660
Scott: I I was doing good at that bidding game.

387
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,884
Scott: I figured it out mostly.

388
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:35,403
Rym: we learned this back in the day when I was undefeated at Pizarro and you were undefeated at power grid Not power grid the web of power I like.

389
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:44,379
Scott: I just really like modern art compared to the other bidding games because if you look at some of the other bidding games Like say Pizarro, right the values of things are pretty much set.

390
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:49,460
Scott: But in modern art the values of the things are bidding on might change in the next auctions.

391
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:59,100
Scott: Not only are you bidding on who will own this thing that is up for auction But you're also bidding on how will the value of the things that are currently available?

392
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,080
Scott: Change based on the results of this auction and what comes up for bid next.

393
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:17,589
Scott: So you might be bidding a whole bunch on something because you think it's gonna be really valuable and then it ends up being worth Shit, yep, especially when you bust out or vice-rare Picasso or vice versa, you know It's the game with good mechanics.

394
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,360
Rym: And I like all that has all the Rainier Kinizia.

395
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,022
Scott: How can you go wrong?

396
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:25,080
Rym: has all these different kinds of bids like the sealed bid the open bid the once-around that is.

397
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:30,500
Scott: That is something I also love about it is that a lot of bidding games only have one kind of auction.

398
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,571
Scott: You know every auction in this game is the is a one.

399
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:36,160
Scott: you bid once and whoever bids the most is it or a power?

400
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,462
Scott: Grid.

401
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:39,298
Scott: every auction is go-around, you know bidding.

402
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:44,700
Rym: But in this game you have the jumping bidding where one jump is huge and you can leapfrog people and all that.

403
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,160
Scott: Yeah, but in this game all that you do all different kinds of auctions all the time, which is totally sweet.

404
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:51,626
Rym: So it's a fun game.

405
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:52,550
Rym: I enjoyed it.

406
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,680
Rym: I actually bought it because it was really cheap on Amazon.

407
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,054
Scott: I want to make a side note here.

408
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:57,764
Scott: right because We do.

409
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,991
Scott: we buy board games British.

410
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,460
Scott: every board game we have we bought right?

411
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,711
Scott: Yeah, and we've only re-boxed a few games.

412
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,180
Scott: re-boxing is pretty popular.

413
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:17,036
Scott: That's when you have a board game that takes up a lot of room or has a really big box and you go to the craft store or whatever and you buy maybe a Compartmentalized plastic box or something so that you can store the same board game in a smaller area

414
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,800
Rym: row made for me as a gift A long time a while ago that Carcassonne bag.

415
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:25,662
Rym: Yeah, it takes up a lot less space than a Carcassonne but although it has the little patch on the outside for the starting Tile.

416
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:29,480
Scott: Yeah, because when you have a lot of board games each of those boxes a lot of air in it.

417
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,140
Scott: So if you can compress the games to a smaller area, you can save a lot of space in your board game shell.

418
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,232
Scott: However, I've discovered a new thing which is the printout board game.

419
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:38,753
Scott: Basically.

420
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:39,937
Rym: I was impressed by this.

421
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:40,740
Rym: that was Ian again.

422
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,402
Scott: Yeah, it's more.

423
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:41,603
Scott: it's.

424
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:49,132
Scott: it's more common than I thought because people talking about it at recess to where let's say there is a board Game that is out of print or do or difficult to get a

425
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:49,614
Rym: dune

426
00:23:49,875 --> 00:24:00,435
Scott: right or something like that Don't buy it at the store Alright Just print your own copy make your own box Get your own chits and pawns and make your own copy of the game.

427
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,900
Scott: Just get the rules off board game geek.

428
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,306
Scott: Look at the parts list.

429
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:09,276
Rym: get some dice and with the right kind of glue and a little bit of skill I mean he had this doom set and it looked really good.

430
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,790
Scott: like it looked at me I didn't realize that it was a printed out set.

431
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:13,373
Scott: I thought it was.

432
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:17,592
Rym: he owned the game as well as I said to him Hey that dune is in crazy good condition.

433
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,687
Rym: He's like, yeah, I made it myself Yeah, and I was like what?

434
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:21,269
Scott: no way.

435
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,145
Scott: so if this some out-of-print game that you just can't buy You know make it.

436
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,360
Scott: and the thing is you might think I'm making it is some kind of evil piracy.

437
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:35,399
Scott: The thing is making a copy of the board game will often be just as if not more expensive than buying a copy.

438
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,739
Rym: is Making a copy of a board unless the game is good.

439
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:49,115
Rym: I have a moral question for you is making your own copy of a board game from you know Engineering it on your own any worse than singing Britney Spears songs to yourself.

440
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:49,938
Scott: No.

441
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,620
Rym: Well, there we go.

442
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:52,248
Scott: It's nothing wrong with it at all.

443
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:52,710
Scott: I'm not.

444
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:54,037
Scott: I'm not putting it down in any way.

445
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:54,600
Scott: I'm lifting it up.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,663
Scott: I'm saying people should do this.

447
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,188
Scott: Yeah, it's totally cool.

448
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:01,699
Scott: Especially because if you make it right not only let's say I make my own Carcassonne, right.

449
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,978
Scott: Okay, the Carcassonne guys are gonna miss out on a few bucks But you know what?

450
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,860
Scott: It cost me more to make it than it in time and money than it would cost to buy one.

451
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,134
Scott: so really I'm not cheating them out of anything.

452
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:15,359
Scott: I put in hard work for that.

453
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:20,900
Scott: and Secondly, I might put some probably gonna put some unique touches on my own carcass.

454
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,135
Scott: Oh, and so it's really a different game because I'm gonna make some better meeples.

455
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:27,716
Scott: Maybe I'll use camels Maybe I'll you make a different theme you get creative.

456
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:28,340
Scott: It's like artwork.

457
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:33,017
Scott: So it's totally cool to make your own board games, you know, why would you buy a monopoly?

458
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:33,780
Scott: make your own monopoly?

459
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,235
Rym: So we played this really quick game called push fight and it's kind of like a.

460
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:39,420
Scott: it is an online version.

461
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,778
Rym: I found out yeah, it wasn't in unity - yeah of all things.

462
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,354
Rym: Yep It's kind of like oshi not as good but it's pretty.

463
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:47,520
Scott: you don't think it's as good as oshi.

464
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,940
Rym: I think oshi is a much better game.

465
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:57,811
Scott: I think that it actually had a slight advantage over oshi in that you don't get the oshi has a special Exception rule so that you don't go back and forth.

466
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,620
Scott: push fight didn't even need that rule.

467
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:01,567
Rym: No push right has the rule.

468
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:05,420
Rym: you move that piece around and you can't remove a piece that has that piece.

469
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,840
Scott: But I think that the red the red guy was a little more elegant than the oshi rule.

470
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:12,953
Rym: I think we should just incorporate the red guy into oshi.

471
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:16,960
Scott: whoever you push with Whenever a piece you move can't be pushed.

472
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:18,665
Rym: Put the red guy on him.

473
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,859
Rym: We could try it or put the red guy into the spot where he came from or something like that.

474
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:25,747
Rym: Something we'll have to fiddle with it.

475
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:28,299
Rym: It was fun, but it's another one of those games.

476
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,013
Rym: notice I'm bringing up all the games that I was awesome at before.

477
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:31,817
Rym: we talk about all the games.

478
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,259
Rym: I lost.

479
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,708
Rym: I Was undefeated at this game.

480
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,055
Rym: I played Scott like six times.

481
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,000
Rym: I played a bunch of other people.

482
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,868
Rym: No one can beat me because this game.

483
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:45,115
Rym: you realize here's everyone's mistake, you know that game I always talk about with the sticks where you cross off sticks taking turns.

484
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,200
Rym: Whoever picks up the last tick lose.

485
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,764
Scott: I was the same.

486
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,658
Scott: Oh, they're the stable state in the unstable state.

487
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:50,303
Scott: I knew.

488
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:51,949
Scott: I knew it was that game right away.

489
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,640
Scott: The problem is I could recognizing the pad.

490
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,510
Rym: I could stable and I couldn't recognize the state.

491
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,360
Scott: I recognize some of the stable and unstable states.

492
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:03,575
Scott: Mostly I had a hard time recognizing the unstable states.

493
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,120
Scott: I recognized the stable states All right.

494
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:16,100
Scott: The other problem I had is there were some unstable states that were actually one turn away from an obvious unstable state But there was still no escape from them and I couldn't recognize those for shit.

495
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,447
Scott: Yeah, see but it was that.

496
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:24,678
Scott: it was one of those situations where there's things, you know There's things you don't know there's things you know, you don't know and there's things you don't know you don't know.

497
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,792
Scott: Yeah, this game was full of things.

498
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,680
Scott: I knew I didn't know.

499
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:32,929
Rym: See I guess the game actually broke down really simply pretty much two turns in.

500
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:42,472
Rym: I knew if I won or not and if I and if I knew that I Lost I knew that the other person sucked and I could just push it back I could flip the unstable state and then I'd win no matter what.

501
00:27:42,854 --> 00:27:43,035
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:49,620
Rym: Yeah It had the neat mechanic and like oshi though where you can basically move pieces anywhere.

503
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:55,328
Rym: So it's more about blocking off areas of the board Than it is necessarily about like push.

504
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,210
Rym: that was always.

505
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,800
Scott: if you got your guy you're square behind their lines.

506
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:00,485
Scott: That was it.

507
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:02,540
Scott: You're that was a huge advantage right there.

508
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,780
Scott: All right, what other games we play?

509
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,554
Rym: I don't know if I'll ever play that game again because I'm undefeated at it and I want to remain that way.

510
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:12,646
Rym: Yeah, we played Bonanza so of an end.

511
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:13,449
Rym: I want to talk about this.

512
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:16,440
Rym: Bonanza is a. it's a game that looks stupid.

513
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,325
Rym: It's awesome box.

514
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,270
Rym: You're like, yeah fuck this game.

515
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:25,160
Scott: and when they brought it out ultra rare cocoa bean I was gonna bring up the ultra rare cocoa bean ultra rare and cocoa is the best root bean in the game.

516
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:28,532
Rym: We started this game late like after this game.

517
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,960
Rym: We played like two rounds of Dominion and then it was two in the morning.

518
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,735
Rym: This is like the last real normal and we had like a ton of people playing.

519
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:35,940
Scott: It was a full loadout.

520
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,194
Rym: It was the West Coast crew the West Coast front row crew and the Azen posse.

521
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,900
Scott: It was loaded up big time.

522
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:45,750
Rym: So they whip out this game and I'm really tired Like they whipped it out while I was out getting the drink.

523
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,540
Rym: and I come back and I'm like, what the fuck is this game?

524
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,793
Rym: We're playing it and they're like we bid on beans.

525
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:51,977
Rym: and he explained to the rules.

526
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,765
Rym: and I'm like this look I don't remember who won.

527
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:54,990
Rym: I did handily.

528
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,055
Rym: I kicked everyone's asses.

529
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,023
Scott: I thought I did really well I don't remember now.

530
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:58,867
Scott: I'm pretty sure I did.

531
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,354
Rym: Well, I want hand over fist.

532
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:01,639
Rym: Whatever I did.

533
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:07,354
Rym: Yeah, but anyway this game they whip it out and every packs are.

534
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:08,818
Scott: now on we're gonna have a game log.

535
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,980
Rym: Yeah I'm very very very much a proponent of this because I won almost every freaking game.

536
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,080
Scott: I played a pack and now once you have a game log, you're gonna lose every game.

537
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:18,666
Scott: That's gonna be awesome.

538
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:21,020
Rym: So this game looked dumb and then it was row.

539
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:25,380
Rym: You know our West Coast front row crew friend and she starts off in the game.

540
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,910
Rym: You know, she's starting to play and I'm just like whatever.

541
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,730
Rym: I'm gonna bid on this and she turns to the guy She can bid from and she's like yo brother.

542
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,694
Rym: I need this bean.

543
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:34,758
Rym: I need some green beans.

544
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:35,846
Rym: right now I need the bean.

545
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:40,332
Rym: Give me the bean then fuck y'all B. And she got really into it and then they all got into it.

546
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,059
Scott: Everyone got into it big time.

547
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,960
Rym: The West Coast crew is into this game the way we're into our own games.

548
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,680
Rym: They had a shtick and the shtick is 90% of the fun of this game.

549
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:51,244
Scott: I don't know.

550
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,079
Scott: I think the game would have been fun even without the shtick.

551
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,465
Scott: It wasn't even so.

552
00:29:54,485 --> 00:30:03,420
Scott: it is a game where I think the best thing about this game Is that you look at other games that have trading settlers even traders of Genoa Genoa, right?

553
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:10,200
Scott: Is it's often a good idea not to trade and in fact it usually want to reject most trade offers in this game.

554
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:14,380
Scott: People are desperate to trade because the rules are so ingenious.

555
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,528
Scott: So you're basically trading constantly.

556
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:19,680
Scott: you want to get rid of this shit and in fact you need to get rid of it.

557
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:23,020
Scott: So you will try to get something for it, right?

558
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,164
Scott: hopefully there'll be competition for whatever there is.

559
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:28,535
Scott: you're trading away like say I need that Pinto be like.

560
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:34,260
Scott: if I really need to get rid of this Green bean and there's more than one person who wants it then I can get a good deal for it.

561
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,230
Scott: But if there's only one person who wants it or if nobody wants it I still really really really need to get rid of it.

562
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:42,277
Scott: So I'll give it away for free.

563
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:45,894
Scott: I'll give it as a gift I'll you know, and if it gets accepted I would get.

564
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:46,919
Scott: I just get rid of it.

565
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,006
Scott: So people are bargaining every single turn hardcore on every single bean big time So every.

566
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,359
Rym: you might wonder why we keep saying the ultra rare cocoa bean.

567
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:02,700
Rym: So every round it goes around and you can only like make actual trades with the active player.

568
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:05,953
Rym: So every round the active players trying to trade with everyone.

569
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:15,625
Rym: Everyone's kind of like I got I got pitobee I got black beans I got this bean I got that bean and then there'd always be a silence and then Scott would just say with the exact Intonation and pacing and everything.

570
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,332
Rym: Does anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean?

571
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:23,167
Rym: and he would say it in that exact way Every single person's turn.

572
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:29,000
Rym: and it got to the point that like what he said it and we just like we all lost it I couldn't deal with the ultra rare cocoa bean.

573
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,668
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is is I drew this.

574
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:36,300
Scott: every card every bean has a number on it And that number is how many beans of that bean are in the dead black eyed beans.

575
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,565
Scott: So for example the game.

576
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:46,740
Scott: I use a lot of wax beans in the game and there are like a zillion wax beans in the Game like 20 something like a ton of them, but I drew early in the game the ultra rare cocoa bean.

577
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,566
Scott: It had the number four on it Which means there's only four cocoa beans in the whole game and it paid out real quick and I was like goddamn this bean It's in my hand.

578
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:59,000
Scott: I need to get it out of my hand and Anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean, right?

579
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:08,740
Rym: so I'm like no one else has one and if they do big deal right cuz then he would hold his cards like in two fists and he Would like make this earnest gesture like does anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean?

580
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:12,885
Scott: So what eventually happened though is I drew and I Randomly completely by luck.

581
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:16,900
Scott: I drew another one and another and then I had three out of the four cocoa beans.

582
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,109
Rym: So then you cashed in.

583
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,560
Scott: I cashed in cocoa bean.

584
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,082
Scott: it worked.

585
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:23,494
Scott: but the thing is I was trying to trade that first one away cuz.

586
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,183
Scott: it was no good if you only have one of them.

587
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,967
Scott: and Yeah, it was pretty ultra rare.

588
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,940
Rym: So I note this two bidding games at PAX.

589
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:42,126
Rym: I sat to the left of Ian who's good at bidding games and He ignored me because I was the new guy and then I won left-right mechanics Mechanics big big deal.

590
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,594
Rym: Yeah, we were talking about left-right mechanics a lot for some reason in fact Cuz we kept talking like it kept coming up.

591
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:50,080
Scott: It was weird Yeah, so I think it was Saturday morning before he played free market.

592
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:55,280
Scott: I played this game that I've seen around but I never played it before and it looked really stupid.

593
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:57,275
Scott: But I played it anyway, and it's called we didn't play.

594
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:57,919
Scott: test this at all.

595
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,506
Scott: Oh, no, we play and it has.

596
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:01,956
Scott: it has an expansion pack called we didn't play.

597
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:02,719
Scott: test this either.

598
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,200
Scott: now The way this game works is it's a lot like flux.

599
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,776
Scott: You have cards and every turn you play it draw a card play a card or I forget.

600
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,803
Scott: if you play and then draw Doesn't matter.

601
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:14,212
Rym: you say it's like flux, but I it is like flux.

602
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:20,680
Rym: if flux had almost no rules Well, that's the looks has so much more like game to it.

603
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:27,580
Scott: It's like flux in that the only rules are draw card play a card and all the rest of the rules are on the cards.

604
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:36,670
Rym: that's the similarity right, but there are cards like you win or You lose or Everybody loses or make everyone vote.

605
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,333
Rym: Yes or no.

606
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:38,316
Rym: if they all vote.

607
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:39,039
Rym: Yes you win.

608
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:44,620
Scott: Yeah, I love the voting cards or the rock-paper-scissors cards because there's like a whole bunch of different ones.

609
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:49,460
Scott: So it'd be like art everyone rock-paper-scissors and you have no idea which rock-paper-scissors card it is.

610
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,055
Scott: Maybe it's a card that says everyone who plays rock loses.

611
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:54,528
Scott: Maybe it's a card That says everyone who plays scissors loses.

612
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,225
Scott: There's all three of them are in the deck somewhere Unless you've seen what it got to

613
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:09,639
Rym: the point where you don't know the guy who happened to be the shortest person playing the game with us Drew a card that said something to the effect of if you just lost and you're the shortest person at the table you win.

614
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,560
Scott: Instead I think it was just play this card if you're the shortest person at the table you win.

615
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:20,907
Scott: It was something like otherwise you get five points and anyone who has 15 points wins But you can change that to 100 points.

616
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:28,993
Rym: now Scott played this game and none of us did so he whips it out like 11 O'clock after playing bonanza on like Saturday night, and we're all like.

617
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,438
Rym: I don't want to play this stupid game.

618
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,442
Rym: shut up Scott Go away.

619
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:33,592
Rym: Don't play this game with us, and he makes us play it.

620
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:35,060
Rym: and it was funny.

621
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,766
Rym: Everyone said this sucks this sucks.

622
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:38,589
Rym: Let's stop.

623
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,393
Rym: and yet when we said alright.

624
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:40,975
Rym: Let's stop.

625
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,830
Rym: They all said now one more round No, let's play one more time.

626
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:46,179
Rym: Let's see this again.

627
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:47,601
Scott: It's just.

628
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:48,806
Scott: it's not a good game.

629
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:49,228
Scott: It doesn't.

630
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,054
Scott: it's not a skill game or anything like that.

631
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:52,520
Scott: It's just epic lols.

632
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:53,266
Rym: It's a game.

633
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,739
Rym: I think I might buy it.

634
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,405
Scott: I guess oh, that's a lol generator.

635
00:34:56,525 --> 00:35:03,674
Rym: because if you buy it this game has one purpose you whip it out at a convention Once and you'll be the guy.

636
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:06,640
Scott: the thing is every convention I've been to has the game in their library.

637
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,152
Scott: So there's no reason for me to buy it because I'd only want to play it at a convention.

638
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:12,145
Rym: so here if you run a Convention buy this game.

639
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,556
Scott: Yeah, and put it in your conventions game library for open gaming.

640
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,845
Rym: if I were at Connecticut Let's make a tournament happen.

641
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,729
Rym: That's hard.

642
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,055
Rym: Yeah for serious.

643
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:21,080
Rym: It would take like 10 minutes.

644
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,427
Scott: All right sure I'll run it.

645
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,432
Scott: We didn't play.

646
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:25,115
Scott: test this at all.

647
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:26,924
Rym: tournament listeners We might forget.

648
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:28,170
Rym: remind me to run this tournament.

649
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,496
Rym: I totally will if you remind us.

650
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:37,744
Scott: there's another game I played the Rym didn't play called squirrels and the guy who made the game was there pimping it at a little table and robot it.

651
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:44,580
Scott: so we played it with her and some other people and Basically the way the game works is you're a bunch of squirrels fighting over nuts, right?

652
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,840
Scott: So what you're trying to do is you're trying to get sets of nuts in sets of three.

653
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:54,820
Scott: So you're looking for like, you know the card with four daddy three nut You'll have a card with four nuts on it and the number four.

654
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,547
Scott: so you want three of those right.

655
00:35:56,627 --> 00:36:04,099
Scott: and then you if you when you get them you make sets out of the nuts and Basically, I didn't have a good time because I basically couldn't get a set to save my life.

656
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:08,040
Scott: But there are some special cards sort of like jungle speed, right?

657
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,579
Scott: So one of them it's like slap your hand down on the hoard and whoever does it first gets the hoard And stuff like that.

658
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,160
Scott: And there was a whole bunch of or there would be like a quarrel and the way the quarrel works.

659
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,494
Scott: You have a quarrel with somebody.

660
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,477
Rym: Oh squirrel quarrel is.

661
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:28,397
Scott: so If you have a squirrel with someone you play the highest card you have and then the second highest and so on.

662
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,620
Scott: and it's like War, you know, where whoever has the highest wins.

663
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:37,703
Scott: Ah, so I did a quarrel with someone and I got all the way down to the last card And then I won.

664
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:41,660
Scott: and then I got a whole bunch of cards and I laid down a whole bunch of sets.

665
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,847
Scott: You know, it's sort of like that.

666
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:48,960
Scott: So it's not a huge skill game It's a lot of luck, but it is still pretty entertaining if you play it a few times.

667
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:54,073
Scott: So, you know, it's if you're gonna play war you're better off playing squirrels time.

668
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:59,633
Scott: It's like war plus jungle speed plus Like, you know rummy is squirrels.

669
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:00,920
Scott: It's not bad.

670
00:37:01,582 --> 00:37:06,180
Rym: So we played a whole bunch of Dominion and there's not a lot to say about it except that it was Dominion.

671
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:09,840
Rym: Scott and I had a joint victory because we exhausted the tiebreakers.

672
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,223
Scott: That's a good win.

673
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:14,388
Rym: That was a good win.

674
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:17,780
Rym: I was very disappointed at the lack of a final tiebreaker though.

675
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,674
Scott: Yeah, we played roll through the ages, but I think we've talked about that before.

676
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:24,223
Scott: Yeah, it's Yahtzee plus Civilization.

677
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:28,197
Rym: We played a whole bunch of jungle speed because you can just whip that out nowhere and it just works.

678
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:29,060
Scott: We played jungle speed.

679
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:31,560
Rym: Yes, you played I didn't play in this that catacombs game.

680
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,852
Scott: Oh, so catacombs a real interesting game because what it is is it's a dexterity game where you flick things just like crocodile But it's a dungeon crawler.

681
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:40,880
Scott: So you'll be there.

682
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,968
Scott: You'll have a wizard and you want to do a melee attack.

683
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:46,060
Scott: you flick your wizard and try to hit a skeleton.

684
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:50,520
Scott: That's a bad guy and the one person plays all the bad guys and four people play the heroes.

685
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:51,526
Rym: It looks really fun.

686
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,034
Rym: The game looked like it had problems.

687
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:53,960
Scott: It needed to be bigger.

688
00:37:54,161 --> 00:38:03,723
Scott: Yeah, conceptually the game was mad fun, right because like I want to shoot a fireball So you take the fireball token put it down within an inch of your wizard and flick it at a bad guy and that does The damage to him.

689
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:07,777
Scott: and you do the day and I some of the guys have one HP and they just die.

690
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,659
Scott: and some guys Have more than one HP.

691
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,616
Scott: so when they get hit you flip them over and then you hit him again and then they die and they have different powers like Some guys will paralyze you or whatever.

692
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:28,753
Scott: and you know It was a dungeon crawl where you flick Your bat your got your heroes and your spells and your arrows at the bad guys to kill them and we got all the way To the Lich, but then he killed us, which is pretty good.

693
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,919
Scott: We got all the way that far.

694
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:32,733
Rym: Um, I want to see more games like this.

695
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:33,800
Rym: It's a really cool concept.

696
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:37,760
Rym: I just I want metal pieces and the board to be like ten times bigger.

697
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,960
Scott: Yeah, the board is really small and has the obstacles and it's not really precise.

698
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:48,100
Rym: I also want someone to make that game but make it shuffleboard size and run it at a con.

699
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:53,222
Scott: That is exactly what needs to happen because the game would be so much better if you you know There was.

700
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:56,920
Scott: the pieces are so small and sort of flaky and the board is small.

701
00:38:57,261 --> 00:39:06,100
Scott: So it's really sort of imprecise, you know, not like crocodile, which is incredibly precise or shuffleboard, which is incredibly precise You know if you have a you have a dexterity game like this.

702
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,180
Scott: It needs to be like on the money, you know, so it needs to be bigger in the scale and everything.

703
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:18,540
Scott: So get it needs a ruler You know to make sure that you're putting the spell within one inch of you and all that kind of stuff.

704
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:24,599
Scott: But other than that, I mean it was you know It was mechanically sound and conceptually original and interesting and I applaud it.

705
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:26,628
Scott: I don't know if I'd buy it probably never.

706
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,520
Rym: but and I guess the only other game there was that poo flinging game.

707
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,525
Rym: We didn't actually play.

708
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,188
Rym: play the poof.

709
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,900
Rym: a lot of people were talking about it and playing it at the con.

710
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,655
Scott: The poofling game seemed like a random card game and the way it worked is.

711
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,282
Scott: you played cards But you would.

712
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:43,020
Scott: the cards would fling poo with the other monkeys and the other monkeys of the other players.

713
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,660
Scott: So you had these gems and you would basically put the gems on the other people to signify who got.

714
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,751
Rym: You know, why doesn't the game come with little pieces of poo?

715
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:53,079
Scott: because it doesn't have that high production value.

716
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,480
Scott: Yeah Yeah, are there any other games I can remember?

717
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,815
Rym: So things of the day, what do you got for me Scott?

718
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:19,152
Scott: So You know, I'm always complaining about those guys in the city who You know, they use the stupid track bikes, which are totally cool But they use them on the street where you're not supposed to use the stupid

719
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,177
Rym: hipster assholes

720
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:24,280
Scott: because there's you know I mean and I'm usually I'm not a person who's in favor of a helmet law.

721
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:28,540
Scott: I mean, you know because it's like hey, if you don't have a helmet, who are you putting in danger yourself?

722
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,060
Scott: It's your own decision, right?

723
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,880
Scott: Obviously a children is a little different situation like the helmet laws that say children have to wear them.

724
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,496
Scott: It's like okay because then it's a parent putting their child in danger, whatever.

725
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,440
Scott: There's arguments to be made.

726
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,715
Scott: The point is you want to put yourself in danger.

727
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:42,399
Scott: That's totally cool.

728
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:51,287
Scott: If you want to put other people in danger, that's not cool and riding around a bicycle on a street where there are pedestrians and cars Without brakes is not cool.

729
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,853
Rym: and you might think who would do that?

730
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,440
Rym: and the answer is New York hipsters.

731
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,067
Rym: I see them every day.

732
00:40:56,087 --> 00:41:02,383
Scott: about like 25% of the bicycles that I see going around the city Have no brakes at all just because they're track bikes They're meant for.

733
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:05,560
Rym: they try like their stupid boot on the back to try to slow down.

734
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:12,540
Scott: No, they put their crusty old van They rub the bottom of their crusty old van on the bottom the back tire to slow down.

735
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:17,478
Rym: I I'll admit every time I see these people I want to just jump out in front of them.

736
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,907
Rym: Yep You're like, oh couldn't stop could you?

737
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,353
Rym: Yeah, but then they hit me.

738
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:22,899
Scott: so yeah, that's the thing.

739
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:29,556
Scott: and it's like Okay, if you hit the back of a car because you have no brakes The thing is oh you're hurting yourself, which is fine.

740
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:32,129
Scott: I don't mind that You're damaging this dude's car.

741
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:34,620
Scott: and what if you hit an old lady trying to cross that in the crosswalk?

742
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,099
Scott: I mean, come on, that's not cool.

743
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,130
Scott: but anyway There was this video.

744
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,158
Scott: It was on College Humor.

745
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,420
Scott: All right that showed an actual track race and I actually learned a lot about track racing.

746
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:49,439
Scott: I knew already the track racing is done in a velodrome, which is a nice smooth banked track.

747
00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:52,239
Rym: That's where roller derby used to happen.

748
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,600
Rym: But now roller derby happens on a flat which is why roller derby is heaven.

749
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,520
Scott: It's actually helping it out because there aren't too many velodromes.

750
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,310
Scott: In fact, there's so few velodromes that in Wikipedia.

751
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,597
Scott: There is a page list of velodromes.

752
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:10,860
Scott: Wow Yeah, so anyway I knew that and I knew that it was incredibly fast and that they use these bikes with no brakes.

753
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:19,330
Scott: what I did not know is that the reason that the bikes have no brakes is because Moving backwards is actually ixnay.

754
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:20,294
Scott: You can't do that.

755
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,680
Scott: You get in trouble if you go backwards.

756
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,245
Scott: So if you had.

757
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:28,228
Scott: and the other thing is that they don't go fast the whole race They don't just go go go go go from the beginning.

758
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:30,680
Scott: It's actually the whole beginning of the race.

759
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,539
Scott: What they will do is they will purposefully go slow.

760
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:36,375
Scott: In fact, they will try to stop which is really hard to do with.

761
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:36,978
Rym: no play that game.

762
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,224
Rym: as a kid I'm going slower than you.

763
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,128
Rym: I'm going slower than you.

764
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:47,720
Scott: All right, they'll purposefully try to slow down Which is really hard when you know, the the the pedals are directly attached to the wheel.

765
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,570
Scott: You know pedaling backwards makes you go backwards.

766
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:52,256
Scott: It's you know, it's that kind of bike.

767
00:42:52,859 --> 00:43:08,139
Scott: So It's really you can stop with the power of your legs and you know by going up high on the track on the bank You know oval and turning the tire inwards and physically holding yourself still now Why would you want to do that in a race?

768
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,690
Scott: Well, the reason is because of aerodynamics and other things.

769
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:12,231
Scott: you're.

770
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:21,820
Scott: it's actually advantageous to be behind the other guy because then you can get into his Aerodynamic trail and that'll and then you can use that to just boost around the side of him at the very end of the race.

771
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:31,951
Scott: All right, so you will try to purposefully these guys go slow on purpose to be behind to win and That's why there's no brakes.

772
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:36,596
Scott: because if you had brakes You could just sit there on your brakes without going backwards and it would be no point to the race at all.

773
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,800
Scott: So Is this cool video that shows a really sort of dramatic race?

774
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:53,018
Scott: And you know the stronger buffer dude is dramatic But other than the very end it looks like two kids playing a dumb game with their bikes Exactly, which is why track racing I think is not that popular in the u.s.

775
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:56,412
Scott: However When they do go behead hitting.

776
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:56,814
Scott: that's right.

777
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:00,940
Scott: when they do go fast They do go incredibly fast like oh my god fast.

778
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:14,485
Scott: Now the other thing about this is I actually looked up, you know by you know I was researching and I found out about this other kind of track racing called the care in and it's in Japan and The way the care in works is.

779
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:19,100
Scott: you actually have like say I think eight dudes maybe and they all race at once.

780
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,160
Scott: But the way it works is to prevent the going slow and the stupidness.

781
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,494
Scott: There's a motorcycle and the motorcycle goes in front of them.

782
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:26,760
Scott: It's not like a Harley, right?

783
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,467
Scott: it's like a you know a bicycle but it's motorized and He that guy will pace the race.

784
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:36,540
Scott: So he basically they go around one lap and you're not allowed to pass the motorcycle.

785
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:37,546
Scott: That's the only rule.

786
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:43,717
Scott: you can't pass the motorcycle and the first lap He'll go like 20 miles an hour and then 40 at what kilometers?

787
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:44,280
Scott: now, right?

788
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:48,118
Scott: Every lap he'll speed up and then on the final lap or two, right?

789
00:44:48,782 --> 00:44:50,499
Scott: He'll just get out of the way and you can go nuts.

790
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,699
Scott: so basically everyone speeds up gradually to a ludicrous speed and

791
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,301
Rym: Then

792
00:44:56,642 --> 00:45:08,993
Scott: and then everyone gets let loose and sometimes is amazing high-speed crashes which are epic And sometimes it's just a really fast awesome race where like eight dudes are on bikes go in like 50 kilometers an hour All right, maybe even 70.

793
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:09,760
Scott: It's awesome.

794
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,030
Scott: So here's some awesome track bike racing videos.

795
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,280
Scott: and if you want to be a track bike racer, that's totally awesome.

796
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:16,783
Scott: Go for it.

797
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:19,980
Scott: Keep that fucking bike off the street and get one with fucking brakes.

798
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:20,562
Rym: You know what?

799
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:24,700
Rym: I gotta look for on YouTube now videos of hipsters on track bikes hurting themselves.

800
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:27,428
Rym: That would be totally out there gonna make compilation.

801
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,211
Rym: Yep.

802
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:34,373
Rym: So pig with the face of a boy Is it just genetically modified or was a band?

803
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:44,479
Rym: Okay in the UK Alright and they made a music video that is entitled a complete history of the Soviet Union arranged to the melody of Tetris.

804
00:45:45,263 --> 00:45:47,754
Rym: This is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

805
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:49,160
Rym: This is fucking awesome.

806
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,479
Rym: Like this is way off the hook.

807
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,227
Rym: How off the hook could it be one?

808
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:57,727
Rym: the production values are super super super high like it is Amazingly, well, that's I guess.

809
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:01,040
Scott: I guess pig with the face of a boy is a popular band like the big.

810
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:04,080
Scott: Or is it like an okay go situation?

811
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,546
Rym: I really can't tell.

812
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:21,940
Rym: but this is like it's off the hook that the quality is so amazing Like it looks really really professional and not only is the song good and the video good But it really is the history of the Soviet Union as set to the melody of Tetris and furthermore the metaphor of Tetris.

813
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:27,740
Rym: You know building these walls that disappear as you complete them never finishing.

814
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:34,852
Rym: Your only options are to play forever and achieve nothing or die trying Yeah, and apply that to the Soviet Union.

815
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:43,229
Rym: and it goes through, you know The czar all the way up to perestroika And they today are all the czar the last czar.

816
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,572
Scott: Oh, that's where it starts.

817
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:47,360
Scott: It starts right around with Nicholas the second.

818
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:49,027
Scott: Yes, see I won't.

819
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:52,746
Scott: why does it start with like Peter the great and shit you're missing all the good stuff I've in the terrible.

820
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:53,912
Rym: there was no Soviet Union.

821
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:59,920
Rym: Catherine the also great Starts with you know, the advent of the Soviet Union and the Bolshevik Revolution.

822
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,049
Scott: It's not the history of Russia is the history of the Soviet Union.

823
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:03,731
Scott: Yes.

824
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:18,197
Rym: Okay, but every section of the song Covered like it's weird It embodies the the sentiment of that era and like what Russia was like but is also like a video period piece like it looks like video looked from that era

825
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:18,779
Scott: and it's

826
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,079
Rym: Stylized like it's from that era and like Russia in the 80s and Russia in the 50s and Russia's in the 20s

827
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,730
Scott: The video keeps getting better and better.

828
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,455
Rym: the video looks better and better But it looks better and better in the stylized way and it ends with Putin and it.

829
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,446
Rym: this is fucking brilliant And I think everyone's got to see this.

830
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:36,314
Scott: So if we were gonna make history of the u.s.

831
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:40,183
Scott: In You know starting I guess with 1776 right.

832
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,338
Scott: So what song would we do?

833
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,862
Rym: We need a song.

834
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:47,089
Scott: what would video look like in 70?

835
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:48,594
Rym: we need a song that looks.

836
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:49,256
Scott: think about that.

837
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,285
Scott: film is older than the Soviet Union.

838
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:56,199
Scott: well Soviet Union is also dead but Film is not older than the United States.

839
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:57,708
Rym: But they could do those silver prints.

840
00:47:57,768 --> 00:48:00,020
Rym: even back then and in the Civil War we had photography.

841
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,089
Scott: There are no silver prints of George Washington.

842
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,917
Rym: Yeah, but we didn't have those then.

843
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:04,640
Rym: so you know what?

844
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:09,547
Rym: It's just black and then it's just paintings maybe Yeah in the beginning.

845
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:11,560
Rym: Yeah, we got to come up with a song there.

846
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,265
Rym: Remember, it can't just be a good song And it's be a good song that we cover.

847
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:28,785
Rym: that itself is a metaphor for everything that the United States stands for across all Of its eras from a video game cuz the lyrics are like I am the man who arranges the blocks and it's This is this is fucking brilliant.

848
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,555
Rym: All right, so we've played a whole bunch more games at PAX.

849
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,992
Rym: Oh Sweet and I don't.

850
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:40,280
Rym: yeah You know anything to say about the games we played.

851
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:42,548
Scott: I'm just trying to remember because they were all video games.

852
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:48,469
Scott: in this huge blur because the expo hall was double big Hall, I keep saying off the hook.

853
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,800
Rym: my friend Conrad I think infected me with that phrase.

854
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,519
Rym: But if anything at PAX was off the hook it other other than the omega-thon finale.

855
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,209
Scott: Yeah The omega-thon finale was on the hook.

856
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:03,319
Rym: It was only on the hook for the winner.

857
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:12,494
Rym: Anyway, if anything at PAX other than the omega-thon finale was off the hook It was the expo hall PAX East and the previous PAX Prime.

858
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:24,843
Rym: the expo hall was awesome But there were like two to four like big tall like crazy boots and everything else was awesome But it was like kind of smaller and normal This year.

859
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:34,360
Rym: it seems like everything in the entire place was just like gigantic Like every booth was crazy tall and filled with spectacle everywhere you went spectacle.

860
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:39,820
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is a lot of the spectral was for things I didn't know about or care about, you know.

861
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:43,076
Scott: And then even some of the things I completely ignored.

862
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:50,089
Scott: later I found out that they might have actually been good and some of the things I paid attention to that I thought might be good and maybe we're not as good.

863
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:53,200
Scott: I found, you know, it was like ah disappointing.

864
00:49:53,462 --> 00:50:05,700
Rym: So we're not gonna talk about the expo hall We're just gonna talk about the games we saw that stood out beyond the spectacle in the expo hall Except of course Duke Nukem forever because Duke Nukem forever.

865
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,640
Scott: I played it technically so we can talk about it, but that is probably only time we'll ever be played in the history of the world.

866
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:14,275
Scott: It's an elaborate scam and it wasn't the full thing.

867
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:14,717
Scott: We should demo.

868
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:15,220
Scott: it doesn't count.

869
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,640
Rym: I was talking to people in line to play it, you know, I went in and just played it.

870
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:21,580
Scott: You know when you go in that room, they just gas you and rape you.

871
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,591
Rym: No, the guy in line like he was talking to his friend.

872
00:50:23,611 --> 00:50:25,240
Rym: He's like, I don't think the games in there.

873
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,140
Rym: I think they're gonna tell us to lie to everyone else and give us a t-shirt and some money.

874
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:39,260
Rym: No, they gave me a t-shirt and some steroids But the spectacle of that booth is worth noting because it had it was a solid black booth.

875
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:41,769
Scott: You couldn't see anything that was going on inside.

876
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:45,643
Scott: So that was like adding to sort of the mystique of oh, oh what's in here?

877
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:56,300
Rym: all around the outside was security guards and this long queue and These portraits of Duke Nukem much much like the portraits of George Washington on the civilization booth.

878
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:00,195
Rym: I would not mind having one of those portraits in my apartment as a poster.

879
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:02,522
Scott: I'd buy one Astronaut.

880
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:03,264
Scott: one was pretty good.

881
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:07,660
Rym: So was the one with him accepting like every possible award ever at the same time.

882
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:09,791
Scott: Yeah, there was also.

883
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,942
Scott: they had two things, you know The things.

884
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:13,609
Scott: you put your face in it and then have a picture.

885
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,020
Rym: It was Duke Nukem with two Catholic schoolgirls.

886
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,334
Scott: Yeah, so you could put your face in the Catholic schoolgirl and have your photo.

887
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:19,876
Scott: take it that it.

888
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:20,900
Rym: that sounds really horrible.

889
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,607
Rym: They also had a whole bunch like this.

890
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:24,590
Rym: It was amazing.

891
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,117
Rym: But inside I did play Duke Nukem forever.

892
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:28,100
Rym: I played it.

893
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,265
Rym: I've actually played that game.

894
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:29,687
Rym: John St.

895
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:30,993
Rym: John was like, hey Rym, come on in.

896
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:31,656
Rym: I skipped the line.

897
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:32,460
Rym: I stood there.

898
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:34,129
Rym: I watched them talk about it.

899
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:35,115
Rym: And then I played it.

900
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:40,385
Rym: I urinated in a urinal and It was exactly what I expected.

901
00:51:40,505 --> 00:51:51,540
Rym: it's really fucking dirty and really really tasteless in this kind of hilarious Homage kind of like how Duke Nukem 3d was almost this like homage to schlocky horror movies.

902
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:56,454
Rym: This was sort of homage to like Duke Nukem itself.

903
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:57,817
Rym: It's like this meta thing.

904
00:51:57,837 --> 00:52:03,400
Scott: I Kind of I think I'm actually gonna buy it maybe not right away because I don't think the multiplayer is gonna go anywhere.

905
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:05,312
Rym: But I don't know cuz Duke Nukem 3d.

906
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,680
Rym: It's a fucking awesome multiplayer.

907
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:12,060
Scott: But I do want to play all the single-player just to see all the stuff that I know is gonna be crude.

908
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:17,120
Scott: But I will also find it hilarious and I'll probably buy it when it's like 20 bucks on Steam or whatever.

909
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,012
Scott: See, it's almost late.

910
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:27,048
Scott: through the whole thing It's almost a period piece because remember because I haven't had enough a single-player FPS action lately, you know I mean It's pretty much valve is the only one still cranking that.

911
00:52:27,088 --> 00:52:33,799
Rym: so remember the 90s when video games that were violent like that was the thing Like oh my god Mortal Kombat on the Sega with the blood code.

912
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,840
Rym: This game is like homage to that era.

913
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:43,055
Rym: specifically I Feel like the whole game is just saying hey remember those days check this out hookers.

914
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,760
Rym: Oh my god She's giving you a blowjob and the Duke's just saying Duke stuff the whole time.

915
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:57,076
Scott: Yeah, I didn't actually go in to play it but I saw enough of it to know that it was real.

916
00:52:57,156 --> 00:52:58,160
Scott: people actually played it.

917
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,450
Scott: I looked inside.

918
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,519
Scott: I saw people playing it.

919
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,134
Rym: Remember when I said hey, I gotta go and I ran down.

920
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:03,879
Rym: that was when I went in.

921
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,716
Rym: Yeah, cuz the Duke just texted me is like, hey, you want to see you want to come in.

922
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:11,693
Rym: and I was like, okay Yeah, and the the booth babes were funny because they were.

923
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:15,434
Scott: they were being very Want to talk about the booth baby.

924
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:17,560
Scott: This is the first year of packs booth babes.

925
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,860
Rym: Well save it for the proper review of packs.

926
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:28,379
Rym: But suffice it to say there were booth babes at many of the things and Duke Nukem I think had more booth babes than everyone else combined.

927
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:42,259
Rym: But when once the fanboys were gone like they let him into the next room and then it's just like us and like all the People who work for the company's involved in Duke Nukem forever The booth babes totally stopped smiling and are checking their Twitter and like, oh my god.

928
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:42,849
Rym: Yeah.

929
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:45,364
Scott: So did you?

930
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:48,214
Scott: um, did you play any the packs 10 games?

931
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:49,840
Rym: I played a whole bunch of them.

932
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:51,690
Scott: I don't have anything really.

933
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:58,380
Rym: they all were really interesting But I didn't have anything really to say about them other than the meat game was really fucking hard.

934
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,293
Scott: Yeah, the meat that's the one I wanted there.

935
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,380
Scott: a couple I wanted to talk about.

936
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,284
Scott: I don't wanna talk about all the meat.

937
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,772
Rym: game was advertised like hell.

938
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:05,460
Rym: I came with that comic book in the bag.

939
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,465
Scott: Right super meat boy, right looks like a really fucking good platform game like oh damn It's really good, but it's like.

940
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:15,614
Scott: it's not a puzzle platformer, which seems to be all the rage these days.

941
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,178
Scott: It's a real platformer.

942
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:28,677
Scott: aware Incredibly precise jumping is necessary and it is hard as balls Like you must jump precisely and with perfect timing and the right place in order to get past these levels.

943
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:34,238
Scott: and you know since you're made of meat you can sort of slide on the walls and that's what makes it a little bit interesting.

944
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,300
Scott: and I think I think I might buy it when it comes out.

945
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,239
Scott: It's gonna come out for pretty much all the downloadable so you can download it on Xbox Wii or PC.

946
00:54:42,742 --> 00:54:44,753
Scott: I guess not PlayStation, you know, that's.

947
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:45,900
Scott: I think that's gonna be a good one.

948
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:48,773
Scott: The other ones that looked interesting were the Retro City rampage.

949
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:48,994
Scott: You see?

950
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:54,000
Rym: Yeah, that looked awesome Like it looked like the old Grand Theft Auto's mixed with passage.

951
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:57,580
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, it's basically it's the original Grand Theft Auto games, right?

952
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,846
Scott: Not too many people have played them.

953
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,620
Scott: A lot of people have only played the 3d ones, but I hate the 3d ones.

954
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:06,571
Scott: I only really like the old 2d ones Especially the London one which I think not many people like or have played.

955
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:10,586
Scott: where there it's a top-down 2d game I love when I'd good voice act.

956
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:23,862
Scott: the original Grand Theft Auto was a top-down 2d game And this is basically the exact same game as that only obviously newer But it has 8-bit graphics whereas the original Grand Theft Auto games had DOS graphics it also.

957
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:30,826
Rym: what I noticed at least playing it a little bit was that the cops were smart and the AI like it felt like Those cops had a plan.

958
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:45,020
Scott: Yeah, even though the game was only 8-bit Style graphics not actual 8-bit but pixelated retro styling the game play was ultra modern Like way better than any Grand Theft Auto 2d game ever, you know.

959
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,320
Scott: And you can like go in all the buildings and there was stuff in there and the cops just chase you in and a corner.

960
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:52,710
Scott: It is damn good.

961
00:55:53,212 --> 00:55:53,995
Scott: I'm looking forward to that.

962
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,260
Scott: It's gonna be we only though.

963
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,413
Rym: So speaking of top-down 8-bit style and games now, we're gonna get.

964
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:08,440
Rym: uh, we're gonna have an interview about this But we played this game that is basically 8-bit top-down Lupin the third mixed with Grand Theft Auto.

965
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,412
Scott: Yeah, I mean I it's called Monaco.

966
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:15,120
Scott: I've known about it for a while So when I saw it there, I really wanted to play it bad badly and I did.

967
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,267
Scott: But we're gonna interview the creator.

968
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,658
Scott: So I don't want to devote too much time to talking about it.

969
00:56:20,683 --> 00:56:27,859
Rym: So we got to the expo hall kind of early and we played it with two other people and it was super fun But it blue-screened the first time we played it.

970
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,611
Scott: That's why don't we save this for the time?

971
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,703
Rym: we talked to the guy now But we can do.

972
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,752
Rym: it's the unbiased GeekNights opinion.

973
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:36,792
Rym: before we have him on to moderate our view I was gonna talk about the blue screen.

974
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,730
Rym: when he was on the show I tried to blue-screen it again and I couldn't.

975
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:41,740
Rym: I'm pretty sure their PC just overheated.

976
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:43,627
Rym: Yeah, probably that's what it felt like.

977
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:44,289
Scott: anyway.

978
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:52,226
Scott: next to it was a game that was incredibly popular called spy party Which I didn't get a chance to play but it was kind of like the ship but it was more from what I heard.

979
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:56,122
Scott: the way it works is this like a sniper and there's and there's a whole bunch of People and

980
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,366
Rym: the sniper has one bullet

981
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:09,237
Scott: and the sniper has one bullet and the other person is the spy the secret agent and they're Trying to do accomplish a mission Without giving away the fact to the sniper that they are the spy because the sniper will shoot them.

982
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:19,609
Scott: if they shoot the sniper shoots The right person then the sniper wins But the sniper shoots the wrong person or misses then or if the spy does what they're supposed to do Right, then the spy wins and it's it's.

983
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:27,518
Scott: it seems like a much better execution of Sort of the ship Concept by limiting it to such that narrow focus of the sniper.

984
00:57:27,638 --> 00:57:34,400
Rym: and yes But I feel like if it does well what they could do is take that Focused like perfected game and make that a part of a larger game.

985
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:35,484
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

986
00:57:36,046 --> 00:57:38,756
Scott: Like if it was a give us three things in sequence like a three-parter.

987
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:39,780
Scott: I would that be cool.

988
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:49,119
Scott: Oh if you took that sort of style of thing and mixed it with like rescue the embassy mission It basically is it a lot of it is I think now that I think about it.

989
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:51,764
Rym: Rescue the embassy mission.

990
00:57:51,804 --> 00:57:52,967
Scott: Yeah rescue the embassy mission.

991
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:53,890
Scott: Why don't we?

992
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,056
Scott: there's a fucking egregious the unrealized potential.

993
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:57,119
Scott: Where's the new version of a?

994
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:00,771
Rym: Yeah, I would only chemco was my man.

995
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:02,579
Scott: rescue the embassy missions got to come back.

996
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:04,525
Scott: Let's just do it.

997
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:06,131
Scott: Let's just make a modern version of rescue.

998
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:08,320
Rym: So we also know this was cool.

999
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:19,760
Rym: There was a game called jam city roller girls and it is basically the real rules of roller derby Plus a little bit of Mario Tennis mixed in Mario Kart Mario any Mario sport.

1000
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,309
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I think that the the logic there.

1001
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,620
Scott: we talked to these guys quite a bit for like five or ten minutes.

1002
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,715
Rym: They actually is frozen code base and they actually had a real roller derby team the rat city roller girls.

1003
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:32,480
Rym: They're like hanging out.

1004
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:39,930
Scott: Yep, and basically we learned about roller derby recently from Luke Crane who you know and friends who are heavily involved With the Gotham City roller girls.

1005
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:41,480
Rym: Yeah, Luke Crane, you know the guy who rode.

1006
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:50,900
Scott: Well, the thing is I knew the roller derby was girls roller rollering guys So - I asked, you know, they rollerskate in a circle and they hit each other.

1007
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,502
Scott: That's all I knew.

1008
00:58:51,522 --> 00:59:03,459
Scott: but he apparently there was a change in roller derby some years ago to where instead of using the bank track They just do it in a gym on a flat surface which makes it much more accessible and a lot more people can do it in different places.

1009
00:59:03,479 --> 00:59:05,566
Scott: and The rules changed.

1010
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,980
Scott: and actually he told me the rules and just based on a pure theory.

1011
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,164
Scott: It's way awesome.

1012
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:14,032
Scott: Like because you're playing offense and defense simultaneously.

1013
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,560
Scott: go look up the rules of roller derby and watch some of it on YouTube.

1014
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,484
Scott: It's totally sweet.

1015
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:21,600
Scott: I think I'm gonna you know, get more involved in it when I have more free time at least be a spectator.

1016
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:25,718
Scott: It says something about roller derby when plus we have a team to go check out.

1017
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:26,100
Scott: Yeah, we do.

1018
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:28,861
Scott: It's not like we have to go figure out what team to root for But

1019
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:39,237
Rym: anytime you can take a sport and turn it into a video game and the rules are awesome for a video game Independently of a sport like if you remove the athleticism and make it just about the rules of the game.

1020
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:40,180
Rym: It's still a fun game.

1021
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:43,600
Rym: Yeah, the game looked pretty good too when it's their first like big effort.

1022
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:49,080
Scott: Yeah, apparently they had made a bunch of other games before on contracts to other people But they really wanted to make this game on their own.

1023
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:55,020
Scott: So they did it and it's gonna be on the Wii as a downloadable You know WiiWare game and it's bit, you know.

1024
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,028
Scott: They had to add something to it to make it a little bit more appealing to the rest of the world because they made it a pure simulation Which I guess they thought about doing.

1025
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:05,200
Scott: it would really only appeal to people who already knew and cared about roller derby.

1026
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,220
Scott: So they added some Mario Kart to it, you know.

1027
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:13,194
Scott: So you can like put a boost to go faster and you know do like a big magical hit to freaking crush someone that kind of stuff.

1028
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:16,448
Scott: But yeah, this game actually looks like it's gonna be.

1029
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:20,240
Scott: at least it'll be equivalently fun to like Mario soccer.

1030
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,785
Scott: I think you know Mario well.

1031
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:25,336
Scott: Mario strikers like that level of game if that's you're looking for.

1032
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:27,590
Rym: so sadly There's a ton of other stuff.

1033
01:00:27,611 --> 01:00:29,665
Rym: that was in the expo hall But it didn't like.

1034
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:33,179
Rym: I'd either didn't play the games or I wasn't gonna stand in line to play the games.

1035
01:00:33,783 --> 01:00:36,015
Scott: Yeah, I mean for example portal too, right?

1036
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:36,800
Scott: I mean it was there.

1037
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,900
Scott: It was looking awesome from what I saw on one of the video screens, but you know what?

1038
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,195
Scott: I'm not waiting in line to play a game that I'm gonna buy no matter what.

1039
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:49,484
Rym: Yep, like Civ 5 I could have waited in that line forever to see but I'm I mean It's already on my computer.

1040
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:51,912
Rym: if I could crack that fucking encryption.

1041
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:52,333
Rym: I could play.

1042
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:54,380
Scott: now one week from today is Civ 5.

1043
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,598
Rym: By the way, yeah, their gig nights is done on that day.

1044
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:06,241
Rym: The gig nights will be a 24/7 stream of me explaining my strategy as I play Civ 5.

1045
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:07,386
Rym: You think we're fucking joking.

1046
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,172
Rym: you think this is some sort of game.

1047
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,040
Rym: even my co-workers they know me.

1048
01:01:11,443 --> 01:01:15,431
Rym: I was like, yes if I've comes out, you know Like it's actually gonna come out and my boss is like.

1049
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,757
Rym: so you're gonna take like a month off.

1050
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:24,639
Scott: Yeah Mom I've learned a long time ago Well a beer or two ago that taking a day off for a video game is a bad idea.

1051
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:26,291
Rym: That depends on the game one.

1052
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:27,500
Rym: You can't mess it up.

1053
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:31,497
Rym: You don't want to take the 21st off if the game unlocks at midnight that night.

1054
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:32,140
Scott: That's true.

1055
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,860
Rym: You also don't want to take the day off for an alpha or a beta.

1056
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:35,704
Scott: That's also true.

1057
01:01:35,724 --> 01:01:37,612
Rym: If I had taken the day off for the NS alpha.

1058
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:39,199
Rym: I might have cried myself to sleep.

1059
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:42,675
Scott: That's a waste of a day off I play.

1060
01:01:42,736 --> 01:01:45,310
Scott: so far The thing is in the history of gaming right.

1061
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:49,840
Scott: there has never been a single day Where I've never actually taken a day off for a game.

1062
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:51,808
Scott: There has never been a single time.

1063
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:56,246
Scott: I have considered it though and every time I considered it in retrospect It would have been a bad idea.

1064
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:57,251
Scott: It never would have.

1065
01:01:57,271 --> 01:01:59,120
Scott: I never regretted going to work.

1066
01:01:59,240 --> 01:01:59,722
Rym: Here's the thing.

1067
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:04,380
Rym: think about the fun, especially a single-player game like this where it's infinite.

1068
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:13,020
Rym: It's not like portal where two hours and you've played it, but this if I take the day off It's not like I'm spending my entire Saturday in the apartment playing this game.

1069
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:16,753
Rym: I have this day with nothing but Civ 5.

1070
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:17,877
Scott: Here's the problem, right?

1071
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:21,256
Scott: Problem number one You have to assume the game will actually come out in the morning.

1072
01:02:21,336 --> 01:02:26,840
Scott: number two If you do the no take the day after off take okay, so even if you do the next day, right?

1073
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,289
Scott: Maybe the game will be all buggy because it's the.

1074
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,636
Scott: it's just at the release time.

1075
01:02:30,736 --> 01:02:31,500
Scott: Is it really gonna work?

1076
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:31,904
Rym: You know what?

1077
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:32,228
Rym: I'll do that.

1078
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:32,978
Rym: I'll just go into work.

1079
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:37,560
Scott: Also, you need all your friends to take the same day off for a single-player game.

1080
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,920
Rym: I gotta play a day's worth of Civ 5 before I start the multiplayer game.

1081
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,988
Scott: It was a single-player game.

1082
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,466
Scott: just bring your laptop to work and play it Probably can't play that game.

1083
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,120
Rym: What I'll have to check my laptop.

1084
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:51,560
Rym: It does okay with Civ 4 but it runs the battery out in like an hour and a half.

1085
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:57,720
Rym: If you're gonna be sitting at your desk at work So plug it in and the video kind of stutters and I had to turn off a lot of the effects.

1086
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,620
Scott: Yes, the thing is you can play it at work next to your work on your laptop your personal laptop.

1087
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,568
Rym: Nah, I don't think my laptop can do it.

1088
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:05,150
Rym: I don't know.

1089
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:05,934
Rym: I gotta try.

1090
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,460
Scott: you can go buy a new laptop.

1091
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:11,547
Scott: Yeah, I could buy a new laptop and then Play it next to your work.

1092
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:17,460
Scott: My laptop's got like three more years of use though I would I would my laptop had more use too, but I bought a new one anyway.

1093
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,491
Scott: But this one is definitely gonna last many years.

1094
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,135
Rym: There's no doubt.

1095
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:27,913
Rym: I'm holding off though I think I'm gonna get two more years out of this laptop because you know Unless it breaks now that I don't have the commute on the train anymore.

1096
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:29,920
Scott: All you use it for is like presentations and stuff.

1097
01:03:30,261 --> 01:03:33,250
Rym: I don't even need my laptop to be small anymore.

1098
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:36,560
Rym: My laptop is something I bring to like conventions for display.

1099
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:37,651
Scott: Small is still better.

1100
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:38,540
Scott: I would not get a big one.

1101
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,430
Rym: I don't need a gigantic one, but I don't need like.

1102
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:44,220
Rym: I don't need it to be tiny tiny tiny and weigh nothing.

1103
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,218
Rym: In fact size matters more than weight.

1104
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,090
Scott: now I was still would not buy a 15 inch.

1105
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,278
Scott: 13 inches pretty much the man.

1106
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,340
Rym: I would be willing to buy a 13 inch that weighed a fuck ton more and was more powerful.

1107
01:03:54,882 --> 01:03:57,632
Rym: Because now I'm not carrying it everywhere, but you wouldn't.

1108
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:00,929
Scott: but sitting is if you're not carrying it everywhere You're never using that power.

1109
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:09,810
Rym: because the thing is you know I use my laptop for I travel somewhere and I have a computer where I am or I'm on a plane or I'm on a boat, right?

1110
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:15,290
Scott: So you in fact it'd be a better idea to just get a netbook which would be even lighter and he has not gonna place it.

1111
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,796
Scott: Five that's true.

1112
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:21,895
Scott: Yeah, but maybe by the time that this laptop is dead If six a netbook will place it.

1113
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:24,002
Scott: five six six six won't be.

1114
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:28,921
Rym: I I'm loving though like much like the pictures of the Duke Those pictures of George Washington and Bismarck.

1115
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:30,930
Scott: I need that as my wallpaper, but I can't find it.

1116
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:33,260
Scott: I could find other George Washington's and other Bismarck's.

1117
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,590
Scott: they have a Bismarck wallpaper on the official sit by website Yep, but they don't have the George Washington and they don't have him pointing.

1118
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:43,095
Scott: I looked if you're searching Google Images for like Civ 5 Washington He's there but he's not pointing.

1119
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:54,148
Rym: but the the style be like art deco style like I kept walking over to the Civ 5 booth like All right, that's enough about that.

1120
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,698
Rym: What we didn't get to see rage.

1121
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:58,606
Rym: I kind of wanted to see that but we totally missed.

1122
01:04:58,646 --> 01:04:59,530
Scott: I totally missed it.

1123
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,978
Scott: Yeah, it's a new game FPS from id software.

1124
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,784
Scott: That's probably a skill based FPS.

1125
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,490
Scott: Yeah kind of interested in that.

1126
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:08,942
Scott: What other there was that firefall which I didn't even look at.

1127
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:11,271
Scott: cuz I saw a big booth and I'm like firefall Whatever.

1128
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,479
Scott: that sounds like shit and it had a big booth and whatever.

1129
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:16,448
Scott: Yeah, and you know what it was actually apparently tribes.

1130
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,649
Scott: ish.

1131
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,936
Scott: So I'm kind of disappointed.

1132
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,390
Scott: I didn't look at it, but it wasn't tribes.

1133
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,558
Rym: No, I just remember when we did egregiously unrealized potential.

1134
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:29,045
Rym: as soon as I said tribes to about a quarter of the audience went all tribes.

1135
01:05:29,574 --> 01:05:32,783
Scott: There was a game called Brink.

1136
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:45,110
Scott: well I knew about brink because I saw some videos before the packs that talked about how it has an interesting thing to help noobs figure Out what to do sort of like giving them mini quests like hey go heal this guy or hey go defend this area.

1137
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,627
Scott: Right and they would help the noobs out if they didn't know what to do.

1138
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,189
Scott: But I went to watch it.

1139
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:56,494
Scott: So we're standing there watching other people play because I wasn't about to wait in line and they basically were spending like five minutes Customizing their characters.

1140
01:05:56,515 --> 01:05:57,077
Scott: I was like, okay.

1141
01:05:57,097 --> 01:05:57,217
Scott: Fuck.

1142
01:05:57,237 --> 01:06:03,311
Scott: I don't want to watch this Lego universe Which is an MMO very disappointing.

1143
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:09,340
Rym: Oh, here's here's what's wrong from a distance Just looking at someone else playing for more than five seconds.

1144
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:09,901
Rym: It is.

1145
01:06:10,202 --> 01:06:15,256
Rym: it is entirely obvious why this game is completely not worth bothering with and that answer the.

1146
01:06:15,437 --> 01:06:22,900
Rym: the reason you're able to determine This is that the Lego characters are Lego characters and the enemies are Lego characters and there's Lego stuff around.

1147
01:06:23,301 --> 01:06:25,430
Rym: The ground was brown MMO dirt.

1148
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:29,124
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't Lego ground Because the world is not Lego.

1149
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:33,760
Rym: It is just a generic MMO where you collect Lego pieces and then build Lego shit in your sand.

1150
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,540
Scott: It's really not really a generic MMO.

1151
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:37,647
Scott: It's more of an action MMO right?

1152
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:41,720
Scott: because it's basically like Lego Star Wars Lego Indiana Jones Lego Batman.

1153
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,807
Rym: They go Harry Potter not worth play.

1154
01:06:43,827 --> 01:06:45,413
Scott: It's exactly that game.

1155
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:47,340
Scott: You know that game you've played it, right?

1156
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:56,298
Scott: It's that exact same game only Everyone in the world is playing it all at once in one spot And the only cool thing about it is that you can customize your own Lego guy your

1157
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:58,286
Rym: avatar Just wait until with any

1158
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:08,379
Scott: Lego piece and apparently you collect Lego pieces while by playing the game and you can take those Lego pieces back to a Private area where you can make anything you want out of Lego.

1159
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:15,260
Scott: But it's like the whole game should be one shared area where anyone can make anything out of Lego and everyone has infinite Legos.

1160
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,988
Rym: Imagine if I make my Lego clan and I build.

1161
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:24,654
Rym: we build a castle out of our own fucking Lego and that is our base And people attack us and steal our Lego to make their own Lego base.

1162
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:25,760
Scott: That should be the whole game.

1163
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:26,502
Scott: That's it.

1164
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:27,445
Scott: That's all they needed to do.

1165
01:07:27,485 --> 01:07:32,360
Scott: make one giant world where everyone can make anything out of infinity Legos anywhere.

1166
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:36,399
Rym: So if you want if you think at all, I should play the Lego MMO.

1167
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:43,518
Rym: No Just get like Lego Star Wars and Minecraft and World of Warcraft and between the three door fortress and war fortress.

1168
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:46,720
Rym: between those four You will get everything that Lego whatever has to offer.

1169
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,708
Scott: What other games are going there?

1170
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,140
Rym: Nothing else really stands out in my memory to be honest.

1171
01:07:51,602 --> 01:07:55,000
Rym: Yeah, I did other than the games we played like the board games and stuff.

1172
01:07:55,401 --> 01:08:00,560
Rym: There was crazy gaming Thursday before the con like all day in the Sheraton Lobby.

1173
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:05,400
Scott: Oh, the Sheraton Lobby was basically like but is where packs like it was like an extra tabletop area.

1174
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:11,858
Rym: So before pack started gaming after packs ended gaming Monday, there were people gaming Sunday people gaming after the con.

1175
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:12,740
Rym: I'm worried.

1176
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,495
Rym: We want to do an after-party like a for real after party like all.

1177
01:08:16,535 --> 01:08:17,438
Scott: let's call the red line.

1178
01:08:17,459 --> 01:08:18,389
Scott: I'm telling you We don't know.

1179
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,788
Rym: Here's the problem It's not over the holiday this year.

1180
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:24,240
Rym: Are people gonna not stay all day Sunday?

1181
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:28,194
Scott: No, let's just do the Thursday night to be safe as a trial Thursday night trial.

1182
01:08:28,214 --> 01:08:30,000
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, this is critical.

1183
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,723
Rym: We're on the show.

1184
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:31,005
Rym: Now.

1185
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:34,420
Rym: Are we gonna commit to something like we've committed to in the past?

1186
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,920
Scott: No, we're not committing because we don't know how much it's gonna cost.

1187
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:45,340
Scott: but okay, let's see what it would cost to get a ballroom with Rented tables and chairs rectangular tables six to eight chairs each.

1188
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,774
Rym: I wonder if I can get the Sheraton now out from under pack.

1189
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:48,520
Scott: You don't want to do that.

1190
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,207
Scott: We don't want to interfere with packs, right?

1191
01:08:50,247 --> 01:08:50,791
Scott: We want to get.

1192
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:52,096
Scott: let's go to one of the other.

1193
01:08:52,318 --> 01:08:56,595
Rym: imagine this So we get the Sheraton ballroom for Thursday and then cuz coo remember there's the problems.

1194
01:08:56,656 --> 01:08:57,640
Scott: I'll just take it from us.

1195
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:03,404
Rym: No There was that other stupid convention that was in the way on Thursday that he couldn't get rid of if we got it and they Needed it.

1196
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:07,106
Rym: We'd be like, here you go Yeah, yeah, what's that gonna do?

1197
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:07,647
Scott: I don't know.

1198
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:08,149
Rym: I'm looking.

1199
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,939
Scott: I'm poking around but check the nearby hotels that are at the Sheraton.

1200
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,091
Rym: We can talk about this off the show.

1201
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,015
Rym: get a ballroom.

1202
01:09:16,055 --> 01:09:23,944
Rym: what we need to say Officially is that if it is feasible we will run a non sanctioned pre-party.

1203
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:25,951
Rym: and if that works, what's a pre?

1204
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,359
Scott: it's a pre packs tabletop event.

1205
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,899
Scott: It's a pre PAX Prime party and we're looking for sponsors.

1206
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:34,625
Scott: Anyone who wants to sponsor this?

1207
01:09:34,645 --> 01:09:37,613
Scott: we're looking at you RPG tabletop game companies.

1208
01:09:37,995 --> 01:09:47,898
Rym: more importantly if this succeeds Then I guess PAX Prime 2012. if it's back on Labor Day, then we're gonna do it after packs instead of before maybe both both.

1209
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,426
Rym: Oh, man Why not?

1210
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:51,060
Scott: why just one half just all week?

1211
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,455
Rym: Why not just make a pack store in Seattle cuz it wouldn't be crowded all week.

1212
01:09:54,817 --> 01:10:00,973
Scott: It might be It'll be Thursday night and Sunday night after packs closes from like 7 p.m.

1213
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:02,076
Scott: To midnight both times.

1214
01:10:02,217 --> 01:10:04,243
Scott: That's a good schedule All right.

1215
01:10:04,303 --> 01:10:06,911
Rym: So this was not obviously a review of packs.

1216
01:10:06,971 --> 01:10:08,957
Rym: This was a review of the games at packs.

1217
01:10:09,218 --> 01:10:09,980
Rym: We will soon.

1218
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,700
Rym: I'm not going to say when we love a show.

1219
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:17,060
Scott: I guess this sort of voids the the Opening part where we talked about how we were gonna talk about packs in the second half of the show.

1220
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:17,442
Scott: We're gonna

1221
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:35,660
Rym: talk about it in the second half of this show, which is a two-parter Though I do want to give a couple of shoutouts to Robert Greg Khalil Matt Graham Molly 23 And I'll have a reasons why I was shouting out to you and I'll shout out to more people in the next show.

1222
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,610
Rym: But you guys rocked it for us.

1223
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:45,137
Rym: Every single Aaron Z is shadow Every goddamn enforcer and everyone we played games with was awesome.

1224
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:52,260
Rym: at no point Did anyone I interact with in any capacity annoy bother or offend any of my senses ever?

1225
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,305
Rym: Yep, and I hate to say that.

1226
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:59,583
Rym: I have to say that but I have to say that because other game dramatic theory and anime Conteo.

1227
01:10:59,623 --> 01:10:59,864
Rym: lady.

1228
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:00,145
Rym: Yip.

1229
01:11:00,788 --> 01:11:01,451
Rym: Yeah, we're sorry.

1230
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:05,945
Rym: We couldn't come to your wedding reception, but your husband Steve are omega.

1231
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:06,707
Rym: not I'm sorry.

1232
01:11:06,748 --> 01:11:10,140
Rym: You lost in the first the random round, which is bullshit.

1233
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:11,327
Rym: Zombie dice.

1234
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:13,260
Scott: Oh, let's talk about zombie dice for a sec.

1235
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:18,440
Rym: Zombie dice is a random odds game, but Steve Jackson is brilliant and he's going to make boatloads of money off.

1236
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,043
Rym: he already did.

1237
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:26,371
Scott: I mean the thing with zombie dice is it is a random game completely random, but it Is a lot of fun for I think gate.

1238
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:28,319
Scott: This is what micro hoolick said, right?

1239
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:33,060
Scott: He easily it's a lot of fun for a fucking cup full of dice and it is right is really fun.

1240
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:41,051
Scott: And the thing is the first time I played nobody told me that the green dice have more brains and the yellow dice have a kind Of even and the red dice are all shotguns.

1241
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:42,440
Scott: No one told me that right?

1242
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:45,819
Scott: So if I would have known that I would have done much better on my first few playthroughs.

1243
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:52,324
Scott: So if you play zombie dice, remember if you've got a lot of green brains out and you're right Then you want to stop rolling.

1244
01:11:52,364 --> 01:11:57,020
Scott: if you've got like a red and yellow brains fucking roll, baby roll and you'll get more brains.

1245
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,402
Scott: That's how it goes.

01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:01,210
