00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,682
Rym: It's Thursday April 25th 2019.

2
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:12,765
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:16,796
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight us the 2019 horror film.

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:24,319
Rym: Let's do this as opposed to unmet a show about us.

5
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:28,090
Rym: Yes, we've done enough of those in the old days.

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,732
Rym: You can find them.

7
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:30,258
Rym: GeekNights have been going for like 15 years.

8
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:33,466
Rym: So what do you got?

9
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:34,591
Rym: a bike home in the rain today?

10
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:36,139
Scott: Oh do you wet a little bit?

11
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:39,720
Rym: I'm glad I got that roll-up fender though because I don't care like I will bike.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,248
Scott: I checked the weather and therefore did not bike.

13
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:45,318
Rym: when I got up the weather said it will rain it like 8 p.m.

14
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,300
Scott: When I got up, and I checked the weather it said it will rain on your way home.

15
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,425
Rym: Yeah, when did you get up?

16
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,605
Scott: cuz I left for work it like not just the way home to here But also the way home from here.

17
00:00:55,027 --> 00:01:00,096
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have rained then but when I checked the weather It said no rain is like 8 or 9 p.m..

18
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:04,938
Scott: Anyway So it's a new year of a bike commuting time.

19
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:17,060
Scott: finally It's warm enough, so I you know my plan was you know I got the road bike But I want to commute on the road bike yeah, and I got you know the new office There's like a bike room, and I managed to get the key to it by by you know luck.

20
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:21,580
Scott: I don't know if anyone else in my office is gonna be able to get a key, but we'll find out anyway.

21
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:26,460
Scott: So I'm like now want to put my nice bike road bike in the bike room.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,191
Scott: So I'll use my keep using my commuting bike.

23
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:29,520
Scott: and I was like commuting bike.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,633
Scott: You know it's a little old as 10 years old.

25
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,854
Scott: It was only like $500 10 years ago, it's gotten beat up a lot.

26
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:37,160
Scott: the seat has like holes in it.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,390
Scott: Yeah, it's always been like an inch too big for me right.

28
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:43,780
Scott: I always needed like one size smaller, but it's still rideable.

29
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,185
Scott: You know it still goes Alright, so I'm like.

30
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:49,620
Scott: you know what you know for my last year of this bike.

31
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,080
Scott: I'll take it in and I'll get like some real maintenance.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,477
Scott: So it's super smooth, and I can like drive it like crazy.

33
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,365
Scott: this last year I was thinking I'd get a new chain.

34
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:58,750
Scott: you know make sure the.

35
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,998
Scott: you know maybe new brake and shifting cables You know make everything real good.

36
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,675
Scott: You know true the wheels if they need it, so I bring it in.

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,820
Scott: guy looks at it.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,388
Scott: We talked about some problems.

39
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,076
Scott: You know and then he's like alright.

40
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:11,820
Scott: I'll work on it later.

41
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:12,887
Scott: He doesn't start working on.

42
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:13,874
Scott: it's like 530 when I get there.

43
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:21,180
Scott: But you know he's going to true the wheel, and he's like well hold up this this rear wheel.

44
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:24,840
Scott: Check this out, and so I thought the rear wheel was out of true.

45
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,245
Scott: It actually wasn't.

46
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:32,869
Scott: despite being ten years old both wheels were actually pretty damn true Spoke-wise yeah, because you don't bike that aggressively.

47
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,177
Rym: and especially I'm like a commuter like cheaper bike.

48
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:35,880
Rym: so I could see why.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,179
Scott: You know, but I only own my wheels cuz I keep popping spokes going in the shitty roads of Manhattan and such.

50
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,396
Scott: anyway He's like the rear axle is broken.

51
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,040
Scott: I'm like what?

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:56,659
Scott: So he shows me and is sure enough even though the quick-release skewer is like intact and good Right which is why I didn't have any problems riding or die.

53
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:03,220
Scott: The skewer was basically holding the wheel together And was keeping it secure on the on the frame.

54
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:11,622
Scott: But the actual axle you could spin the bolt on one side of the wheel and the one on the other side Did not turn.

55
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:20,909
Scott: so this is funny because I go and you can feel that the axle was like two different pieces Inside the wheel not touching each other.

56
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,899
Rym: so I just googled like broken rear axle to try to find like.

57
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,345
Scott: so I didn't bother to do that.

58
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:25,927
Rym: so get this.

59
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,520
Rym: the first result is a stack exchange where someone says broken rear axle.

60
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,776
Rym: Why does it happen and is it worth trying to repair?

61
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,459
Rym: This is really short?

62
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,589
Rym: So I'm taking the time to overhaul my bike.

63
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,079
Rym: whole drivetrain was full of oil road salt, etc.

64
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,211
Rym: So I started taking stuff apart.

65
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,379
Rym: once I got the back wheel off I ended up with half the rear axle in my hand and a bunch of ball bearings on the floor.

66
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,168
Scott: Yeah, he's bait.

67
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,786
Scott: the guy was basically telling me like yeah if I go to true the wheel I got to take the skewer out.

68
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,300
Scott: if I take the skewer out the wheels gonna fall apart.

69
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:59,789
Scott: And then you had to buy a new wheel, but he's like as long as I don't take it apart It's safe to ride for now.

70
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:09,945
Scott: Yeah, I'm like I can ride this home safely, and he's like yeah And I'm like all right do not take my $80 for a tenure to fix a ten-year-old $500 Right just you know.

71
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:13,139
Scott: make sure the brakes are good so I can ride home safely and I'll be on my way.

72
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:18,317
Rym: So I think we're both because I got to replace my rear wheel my cassettes and my chain probably.

73
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:29,175
Scott: so on Saturday I think I'm gonna go to some Brooklyn bike shops that have better selections for the kind of commuting bike I want and Replace my ten-year-old bike with hopefully a bike that will last 20 year.

74
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:30,260
Rym: You can check out.

75
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,545
Scott: I still have to bike.

76
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:36,683
Scott: it's worth checking out REI because I doesn't have the kind of commuting bike I'm looking for now.

77
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,125
Rym: have you looked?

78
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:41,620
Rym: because they also been there recently because they will also ship bikes in from other re eyes.

79
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,475
Scott: Yeah, but the REI only has like a lot brand and some other.

80
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,482
Scott: you know they don't have the kind of bike I'm looking for.

81
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,783
Rym: I've never actually shopped for bikes there because I tend to pick the manufacturer I want.

82
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:53,145
Rym: well.

83
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,620
Scott: I don't manufacturers for bikes don't really matter.

84
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,572
Scott: It's like there's actually a ton of manufacturers who make the kind of bike.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:58,953
Scott: I want.

86
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,640
Scott: it's the kind yeah, right.

87
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:03,780
Scott: So it's like you know the kind like the kind of bike I have for a road bike.

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:13,920
Scott: There's actually tons of choices, but for the commuting bike that I want There's only like maybe you know five or six choices and most of the bike shops don't carry that kind.

89
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:19,040
Rym: I am continuing to idly look at mountain bikes because I'm not getting a road bike.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,905
Rym: I'm just keeping like the road bike performance hybrid that is light like a road bike with the twitchy tires But it's not a road bike.

91
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,410
Rym: It's still got bullshit handlebars.

92
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,400
Scott: Yeah, just you know for going a long way.

93
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:31,988
Scott: You know it's yeah.

94
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,140
Rym: Yeah, there's a reason why I don't do the century.

95
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,960
Scott: There's a reason I got two bikes right to go a long way.

96
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:40,733
Scott: I mean, I can't go a long way even on a better commuting bike.

97
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,980
Rym: I mean really I I'm a perfect world.

98
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:43,945
Rym: I would have three bikes.

99
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:49,211
Rym: I would have a I would have a a full suspension mountain bike I would have a hybrid and I would have a road bike.

100
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,798
Scott: you should try you should rent a road bike.

101
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:54,753
Rym: one time I've ridden road bikes before I know the feel but for a long ride.

102
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,400
Rym: Yeah, I thought about it.

103
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,759
Rym: I found some places that'll random, but it ain't cheap.

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,685
Rym: No, it's cheap.

105
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:01,649
Rym: Goodbye.

106
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,919
Rym: It's cheap to rent a road bike for like a month But to rent it for like a weekend like one long trip and now worth it ready for a month.

107
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,482
Scott: then You could just rent a road bike every summer and always have a great road bike and then a winner you don't need you have To store it.

108
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:16,723
Rym: Yep.

109
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,754
Rym: The real problem is because I primarily ride on mountain bikes and hybrids.

110
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:25,559
Rym: I still have mostly mountain bike and hybrid physical reactions and reflexes.

111
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:33,231
Scott: But yeah, I'll probably you know, go get some bike on Saturday But that I'll probably keep poking around most like it.

112
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:33,633
Rym: at my met.

113
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,422
Rym: my current hybrid repaired It's just.

114
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,340
Rym: it's accumulated a lot of wear and tear over the last decade.

115
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:49,125
Rym: So in some other news Not to get it into all the great parts for mine all the ridiculous politics right now because it's uh, there's a constitutional crisis Ongoing in the US for the past.

116
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,028
Scott: how many years.

117
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:53,097
Rym: it's worse now because now you've got even.

118
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:54,060
Rym: here's the summary.

119
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,345
Scott: It's even worse.

120
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,615
Scott: We're still not doing anything and it's even worse.

121
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,800
Scott: They're still not doing well.

122
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,620
Rym: The problem is we can't do anything.

123
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:07,080
Rym: We already vote for people or who could do the right thing and we have no other political power.

124
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:13,532
Rym: But the the deal that's going on right now it for those of you who don't live in the u.s And actually those of you who do in the live in the u.s.

125
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:14,740
Rym: Because a lot of people don't know how this works.

126
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:23,460
Rym: there's three branches of the US government and They are co-equal in power and ostensibly they have checks and balances against each other.

127
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,940
Rym: Oh, he says they taught us the school like any two of them can technically like override the third.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Rym: but For various reasons one of those branches is split in two the house in the Senate That's Congress and they have different powers.

129
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:47,037
Rym: And right now the broken evil party controls one of those and the actually good political party The Democrats controls the other one.

130
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:55,000
Rym: So the Democrats control the part the part of our Congress that is allowed to basically investigate things.

131
00:07:55,784 --> 00:08:02,494
Rym: so they started investigating a bunch of things and Our executive branch just said nah, we're just not gonna answer your questions.

132
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,678
Rym: What are you gonna do about it?

133
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:08,312
Rym: fight me and the Constitution Makes this a weird problem.

134
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:09,340
Rym: That's gonna be hard to resolve.

135
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:17,753
Rym: so independent of all that because this isn't GeekNights politics As you may know we tend to endorse candidates on GeekNights for various things.

136
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,860
Rym: Rym does well GeekNights does officially.

137
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,511
Scott: We should endorse candidates for things that aren't political but do involve voting.

138
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:24,715
Rym: That's a good idea.

139
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:39,440
Rym: We should endorse like Joey Jojo for head of panels at some convention we go to But in the Democratic Party's primary has begun even though the election is not for a long long time.

140
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,962
Scott: I don't know why they do this shit So early.

141
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:48,049
Scott: they should like have some sort of rule that like you can't do this until you know What exactly would the rule say?

142
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,200
Rym: what if I'm not technically running for president?

143
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:54,575
Rym: I'm just going around like giving speeches about great stuff.

144
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:58,088
Rym: I care about in my own opinions Like what's the line?

145
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,862
Rym: That's why it's hard to legislate that I Mean.

146
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:07,554
Scott: there are countries that don't have freedom of speech But heavily regulate political campaigning like Japan where it's like.

147
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:13,880
Scott: really I remember learning I don't know how true this is anymore where it's like you can only send X Flyers out.

148
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,577
Scott: They're like a specific number like they really live like.

149
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:28,422
Scott: specifically They were like you can drive your van around with megaphones on it for this much time during these hours like Everyone was limited to exactly the same amount of campaigning Resources.

150
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,091
Scott: like to like really specific details.

151
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,480
Scott: right so we could we could go to that far.

152
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,042
Scott: I have no.

153
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,494
Scott: actually don't have a bunch of a problem with that as long as you're not.

154
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:40,049
Scott: you know some principled For you know free speech person right.

155
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:48,356
Scott: so yeah, you can say whatever you want, but you may give ten speeches You may have five rallies you may have you may be on TV for ten hours total right.

156
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,620
Rym: so what if I don't declare?

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,719
Rym: That I'm running yet, and I just have a big party?

158
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:54,862
Rym: Like?

159
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,411
Rym: I just throw a giant house party.

160
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,879
Rym: I ran out of convention center and have a party.

161
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,274
Scott: Well, it's we check you go.

162
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:00,899
Scott: You're a candidate.

163
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,059
Scott: now Let's see how many parties you've had in the past.

164
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,188
Scott: You know well all that.

165
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:08,360
Scott: all the stuff you've done that may contribute is now gonna count.

166
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,553
Scott: You know it's like okay You drove your campaign van around all last year and now you want to run.

167
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:17,740
Scott: oh actually you can't run because you've already gone over The limit and as soon as you go over the limit you're kicked out.

168
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,446
Scott: You're not even the ballot.

169
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,394
Rym: the end the other.

170
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:20,120
Rym: the other problem.

171
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,740
Scott: If you did the exact limit, and you've used it all up, it's like oh you've already met your quota.

172
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,400
Scott: I can't do it anymore, but you're running so you got to use the other stuff now.

173
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,724
Rym: Yeah, but then here's the problem.

174
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,272
Rym: This is this is sort of a fundamental problem in American politics.

175
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,964
Rym: someone else who is a fan of you Does not?

176
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:38,320
Rym: they just throw their own parties, and they like you as they give their personal opinion.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Scott: I wonder how Japan gets around that if they still do have these cells from.

178
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,191
Rym: Generally the reason this is not as much of a problem everywhere else in the world is a combination of Democracy isn't as direct in those places clearly.

179
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,761
Rym: It's on a lower like a smaller scale Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:53,962 --> 00:11:00,264
Rym: there's fewer people involved and fewer people who vote actually give a shit about issues Like.

181
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:07,210
Rym: it's very contentious right now, so our participation rates are rising and And America has a lot of unique problems as well, but I digress.

182
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:14,493
Rym: I'm gonna say is that there are like 4,000 people running for the Democratic nomination for president right now.

183
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,863
Rym: too many and a lot of them are pretty good And I'm gonna be blunt.

184
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:20,132
Rym: There's not a lot of awful ones.

185
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,400
Scott: There's just some that are clearly better than others.

186
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,129
Scott: It's like well look at all these chocolate bars.

187
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,999
Scott: even the Hershey bar still tastes good.

188
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,580
Scott: Yeah, cuz I'm not gonna buy it, but it I'm not gonna poop it.

189
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,268
Rym: We're basically we're voting on.

190
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,680
Scott: if it was the only one I would totally eat it and go mmm delicious.

191
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:39,140
Rym: We're voting on which candy bar of any kind is gonna run against a literal piece of shit, right?

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,900
Scott: So we're trying to find you know the golden you know Swiss chocolate bar.

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,159
Scott: That's the one we want, but we'll take pretty much any chocolate we can get because right now We have shit yep.

194
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:56,900
Rym: So in that primary with a lot of people like I will vote in the general election for literally anyone the Democrats nominated.

195
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,751
Scott: I will take the Hershey's chocolate yep.

196
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:05,776
Rym: Yes, but I Would prefer and I think as GeekNights tasting dark chocolate 88% cacao.

197
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:16,890
Rym: We're going to endorse Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary because she has actual well-thought-out policies.

198
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:24,235
Rym: that are Scott ideas But with actual numbers and plans behind them and no other candidate has this.

199
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,740
Scott: it's like voting for me only.

200
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:29,320
Scott: Yeah, smarter more serious like Bernie Sanders.

201
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,359
Rym: I'd be like bro.

202
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:30,942
Rym: We should.

203
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,720
Rym: we should blow up the blah and change the blonde free college for everyone's voting for angry old man Scott.

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,474
Rym: Yeah, but Elizabeth Warren is more like let's break up Amazon.

205
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,000
Scott: trying to be reasonable Scott.

206
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:46,266
Rym: let's break up Amazon in these way like for these reasons or Let's forgive college debt.

207
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:47,954
Rym: and here are the numbers.

208
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:48,576
Scott: how to do it.

209
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:55,554
Scott: the only politician I've ever heard say you know that was pretty much the moment I decided like all right you are now the tastiest chocolate for now.

210
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:59,851
Scott: Yeah, right because the only politician I've ever heard say let's bust up Amazon with Zephyr.

211
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:04,438
Scott: teach out who in was a New York Someone who ran for governor of New York and did not do that.

212
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:11,158
Scott: well Yeah, but you know was sort of a more out there candidate still even though she's really smart and cool.

213
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:21,880
Scott: Yep, right I like her a lot, but then to have someone running for president with a good chance You know come out with the same kind of position in a more reasonable less far out way.

214
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:27,419
Scott: Just you know like I saw a tweet like Elizabeth Warren just says I want to break up Amazon, and I'm like.

215
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:37,306
Scott: well Yep, I saw the college debt person with Amazon credit card and prime account and bought her buys everything on Amazon You know votes for Canada.

216
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:49,278
Rym: who says let's break up Amazon and says Amazon get out of my neighborhood Yep, so yeah If we would recommend that you also support Elizabeth Warren in the primary with the caveat that we all understand.

217
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:54,666
Rym: now if you're saying I don't care if a Snickers bar three musketeers gets the nomination We're eating it now.

218
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,220
Scott: if you might be saying well wait a minute the primary is like when?

219
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,647
Rym: Well forever right.

220
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,891
Scott: and you might be saying well.

221
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:01,935
Scott: Why does this matter now?

222
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,480
Scott: this primary is so far out?

223
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,431
Scott: I'm gonna vote then if I probably might even get to vote for her.

224
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,020
Rym: if she loses like voting is the least important part of The she might drop out in some earlier round.

225
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,292
Scott: Yeah, and I will tell you exactly why this matters right now.

226
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:21,659
Scott: because like we said you know We don't have those restrictive rules of Japan or anything like that right you know you can do right now.

227
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:27,554
Rym: You can give Elizabeth Warren money right now Or you can also talk about her on social media.

228
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:32,113
Rym: like that sounds dumb and silly But that is what gets people to pay attention.

229
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,820
Rym: It's weird, but it works anyway.

230
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:43,804
Scott: So if you have money yeah, and you got money to spare or you might be saying well I could just give my money directly to something cool like you know Planned Parenthood Which you could do that too.

231
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:48,160
Rym: You should maybe but all those things will be destroyed if the Democrats don't retake power.

232
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,642
Rym: That's right.

233
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,512
Scott: This is an indirect right.

234
00:14:50,572 --> 00:15:02,780
Scott: so you can give like $20 to Elizabeth Warren and if she somehow wins you effectively then Multiplied your money because that will then redirect trillions of dollars in the US budget.

235
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:04,888
Scott: Yep, and then you won't need to be given $20 to.

236
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:13,478
Scott: you know whatever it is You're gonna give you $20 to yeah some fight cancer fund because the NIH will be funny.

237
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:19,080
Rym: Instead the bajillion dollar also a secondary reason that we're for her.

238
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,540
Rym: I just clicked on her webpage randomly, and she's just holding up a microphone.

239
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,014
Scott: I can see her webpage say give me money on it.

240
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:31,072
Rym: of course of course It's American politics, but you vote with your dollars and your social media.

241
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:34,020
Rym: actual voting is like the least important part of our process.

242
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:40,927
Rym: But she's holding what looks like either a sure SM It might be a sure beta 58 a I can't tell.

243
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:49,690
Scott: It's one of those two, okay She knows how to use a microphone.

244
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,479
Scott: yep, that's a big plus.

245
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:53,266
Rym: What do you got in the news?

246
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:54,975
Scott: What do I have in the news?

247
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:55,960
Scott: Let me see what was my new?

248
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:16,622
Scott: So you know we often talk about scenarios where someone is out there making usually a video game and that video game is new and it's usually a remake or a remix of some kind and has a blatant complete disregard for all copyright and trademark law and Property.

249
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:20,354
Scott: intellectual property rights is across the board for example.

250
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:21,900
Scott: It was like a Metroid remakes.

251
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,587
Scott: Yeah, 3d chrono trigger remake.

252
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:25,109
Scott: right.

253
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:31,919
Scott: things along that line have happened many times and on this show long ago I would maybe Rym can find the video again and and link it.

254
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:38,540
Scott: Someone gave the excellent advice which is also my advice that they just made a video expressing the advice better than I did.

255
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:48,416
Scott: Maybe find the GeekNights episode where we had it as thing of the day News whatever it was and basically they were saying hey if you're making one of these things Shut your fucking

256
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,122
Rym: mouth Don't tell

257
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:58,355
Scott: anyone you're making it until it is done done done, and then release it and then even if it gets taken down It's okay because everyone has it

258
00:16:58,838 --> 00:16:59,020
Rym: right.

259
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,665
Scott: so Here we go.

260
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,972
Scott: somebody made and this isn't a big deal.

261
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,319
Scott: It's not something you're actually maybe gonna want to play.

262
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,145
Scott: It's a big deal.

263
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:14,700
Scott: from a like technology stand It's like I want to play the Metroid remake and the chrono trigger remake that got posed.

264
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,451
Scott: Yeah, but I don't really want to play this so much, but what it is?

265
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:28,959
Rym: they remade Super Mario Brothers 1 For the Commodore 64 and if you're old enough to have YouTube like be from that era that is shocking to hear.

266
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,153
Scott: it is Incredible that they were able to make that hardware play that game.

267
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:39,560
Scott: considering other games for that hardware From when that hardware was popular we're nowhere near as good as any s games.

268
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,873
Scott: Yeah, right, so they were able to do this pretty incredible.

269
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:45,787
Scott: Jana sisters for Commodore 64 Which is like all.

270
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:51,232
Scott: even that was getting you know sued by Nintendo Was nowhere near as good as this thing looks like.

271
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:51,533
Scott: you know.

272
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,820
Scott: it's like incredible looks.

273
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,588
Rym: It's shocking how smoothly it plays.

274
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:59,540
Scott: yes, so it basically looks like Mario Brothers with slightly met colors.

275
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,913
Scott: Yep, right and it plays super smooth.

276
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,039
Scott: It looks exactly right.

277
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,384
Scott: It plays exactly the same.

278
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,287
Scott: the levels are the same.

279
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:11,080
Scott: it's obviously a blatant copyright trademark infringement on Nintendo's property.

280
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:15,940
Rym: It's also the kind of thing that I think needs to be protected by a modern revitalized copyright system.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,595
Scott: But regardless the people who made this we're very smart, and you know what they did.

282
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:21,980
Rym: they shut the fucking mouths.

283
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,460
Scott: They released version 1.0.

284
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,963
Scott: It's out.

285
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:36,140
Scott: you can get it from someone else who got it and then Nintendo came and shut them down And it was like okay, we that was surprising that you even this Commodore 64 thing and in 2019 you're shutting down really, okay?

286
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,124
Scott: But I guess you're Nintendo.

287
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,395
Scott: That's what you're gonna do, but guess what everyone has this.

288
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:40,199
Scott: now you can get it.

289
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
Scott: Yeah, it's not you know gone gone.

290
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,147
Scott: It's not stopped before it was finished.

291
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:44,689
Scott: development.

292
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,021
Scott: what I think it was like one dude spent like a shit ton of years working on It.

293
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:49,407
Scott: it's amazing.

294
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,999
Scott: you can go get it if you really want to or at least watch a video of it.

295
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,700
Scott: And Nintendo got burned because someone followed the correct advice.

296
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:59,275
Scott: So if you're doing anything like this follow the same advice.

297
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,459
Scott: yeah, it works.

298
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,029
Rym: So I don't have any news cuz.

299
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:07,052
Rym: as much as I would like to hurry like yell about politics I'll just yell into my pillow.

300
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,385
Rym: tonight It's got Star Trek.

301
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,276
Scott: Voyager is a show isn't that a really old one.

302
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,340
Scott: It's a really old Star Trek.

303
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:14,704
Rym: it's the one that came after.

304
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:19,019
Rym: basically there was next generation in d-space 9 and then this was the one.

305
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,164
Scott: and The reason.

306
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:22,991
Scott: here's what Scott who doesn't like Star Trek knows.

307
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:36,712
Scott: right all right the old Star Trek the original one Right that was like Captain Kirk Yeah But that was the one where it was like alien babes on alien planets old-school kind of pulp sci-fi Galaxy Express like land on a planet.

308
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:37,536
Rym: There's a crisis.

309
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,687
Rym: we deal with it We leave right you know.

310
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,435
Scott: and then next generation one.

311
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:49,767
Scott: that one was more When I watched some episodes back when it was on the TV in the old days and that one at least to me felt more Like daytime soap opera.

312
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:53,260
Scott: only everyone happened to be on a spaceship and occasionally they would be aliens.

313
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,043
Scott: But not really.

314
00:19:54,143 --> 00:20:08,055
Scott: I didn't really feel any different watching that than watching like any of the things that would be on after the price Is right hmm right, but it was just you know in space, so I guess that made it more acceptable to watch Even though it's basically the same thing and it had a shit.

315
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:08,760
Scott: too many episodes.

316
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:12,853
Scott: And then the DS 9 one which I watched maybe one episode of ever.

317
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,883
Rym: people have described it as the wire in space The one.

318
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:21,666
Scott: what I know about that is they weren't on a ship they were on a space station Yep at the edge of like Federation.

319
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:21,887
Rym: Well.

320
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,692
Scott: I didn't know that part.

321
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,287
Rym: It's called deep space 9 because it's in deep space It's way out there.

322
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,880
Scott: I just realized that just now.

323
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,549
Rym: And the Beatles isn't the bug it's the musical.

324
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,060
Scott: I learned that long time ago, but also okay same kind of real thing.

325
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:45,056
Scott: Yes, it had a guy with real big ears on it And I think it was basically you know like a sitcom.

326
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:48,788
Scott: only they were on A space station that didn't move.

327
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,458
Scott: so I guess they didn't have aliens visiting and ships shooting at them.

328
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,693
Scott: so in 1995 so this is one I know that there was one called Voyager.

329
00:20:56,753 --> 00:21:01,995
Scott: they came after yep And I know nothing about it other than I assume there was some sort of voyaging going on.

330
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:05,170
Rym: so the shake of Voyager Is that there's this rebellion.

331
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,960
Rym: so there's all these settlers?

332
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,660
Rym: Colonizing like illegally colonizing territory that isn't in the humans or this amelian humans.

333
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,514
Rym: Okay, and like basically Federation ship bags are colonizing planets.

334
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,640
Rym: They are they getting there on in spaceships?

335
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,525
Scott: How do they have spaceships if they're bad?

336
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,792
Scott: well the spaceships all belong to the good.

337
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,240
Rym: you know lots of people have spaceships, okay?

338
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,458
Rym: Anyway, they're there.

339
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:37,343
Rym: There's a whole like thing going on and Voyager is a new ship that was developed with new technology And they send it to go deal with them, and it was just like the humans are gonna Go shoot other humans.

340
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:42,700
Scott: basically yeah, okay, so it's like a mad warship unlike that like the Enterprise like an exploring ship.

341
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,995
Scott: Right yeah, this is like a warship sort of.

342
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,747
Rym: it's got a little more going on But it's designed for like these special kinds of missions.

343
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:50,750
Rym: It's new technology.

344
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,656
Scott: It has human killing weapons.

345
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:58,352
Scott: Yes, it has weapons And the weapons don't just go pew like this the end.

346
00:21:58,392 --> 00:21:58,713
Rym: It's more.

347
00:21:58,753 --> 00:21:59,475
Rym: It's pretty powerful.

348
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:02,985
Rym: They go to deal with this thing and It's a star destroyer.

349
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:08,183
Rym: They get transported to the opposite side of the universe By accident.

350
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:09,987
Rym: yeah some alien technology happens.

351
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:15,640
Rym: some of the rebels and them get transported like further away than anyone has ever explored.

352
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:20,020
Rym: Okay, the Delta quadrant like way out middle of nowhere.

353
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,598
Rym: Because of it because of random because of alien thing that happens uh-huh.

354
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:34,100
Rym: so then Basically the whole thing is them flying back home them and the rebels just all get on the one ship and the goal is how The fuck do we get home even at our maximum?

355
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,670
Scott: So the whole plot of them being rebels and them not being rebels goes away because like well We're all in this together now.

356
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,818
Scott: It doesn't matter that your rebels Yeah, we're fucked now.

357
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:51,800
Rym: But you can settle in the Delta quadrant if you want even at warp 9 like many many times the speed of light It'll take us like a hundred years of direct flying to get home.

358
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,294
Scott: Well, I assume they do the hundred years of direct flying.

359
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,220
Scott: it just takes a hundred years.

360
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,413
Rym: So their goal is just to not die and get home right.

361
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,560
Scott: so I would just do the direct flying in a hundred years.

362
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,587
Scott: Just try to live a hundred years.

363
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:06,980
Rym: Oh, yeah, but along the way they try to like can we make our engines better?

364
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,090
Rym: Can we find a thing can we get a message to?

365
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,880
Scott: they try to stop and like at place?

366
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,394
Rym: Yeah, they basically they continue their mission of explore.

367
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,740
Rym: like do the thing of Explorer?

368
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,350
Rym: Well, it wasn't explore.

369
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,537
Scott: their mission was kill the rebels.

370
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,709
Rym: well Yeah, but the general mission of Starfleet is to explore Oh, you know to go where no one has gone before and all.

371
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,758
Scott: I thought that was only big a bold enterprise.

372
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:28,976
Rym: this mission That's that's the Federation's mission, okay?

373
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,522
Rym: Anyway, that's the show, but it came out in 1995 and ran till 2001.

374
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:34,608
Rym: I didn't know I ran that late.

375
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:38,528
Rym: Well, it has like two hundred and seventy episodes.

376
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:47,258
Rym: all these things have too many fucking episodes, but it was the era for in my life and in the life of many people around our age that it straddled the.

377
00:23:47,278 --> 00:24:13,148
Rym: I Still watch things on TV, and I don't even have cable anymore Which made it interesting because as a kid I remember really liking the beginning of it And then just stopping watching it even though I really liked it because I didn't watch any TV anymore cuz fuck TV Mm-hmm, and I decided to watch it again because I needed a show to watch like on my shitty Kindle fire while I'm like Running on the treadmill in the winter

378
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,914
Scott: to read a book instead of why I can't

379
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,540
Rym: read a book while I'm running on a treadmill.

380
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:24,400
Rym: not I Dare you to run on a treadmill and read a physical book at the same time.

381
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,959
Rym: You could not yeah, I'd hold a book.

382
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:28,908
Rym: All right, you're wrong.

383
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:29,673
Rym: Yeah, I want.

384
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:35,880
Rym: I want to see video We will video this for GeekNights of you running at nine miles an hour on a treadmill.

385
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,373
Scott: I don't know if I can run nine miles an hour.

386
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:40,507
Rym: all right We'll figure out how fast you can run.

387
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:44,299
Rym: and you've got to run at that speed for like 20 minutes while reading a book.

388
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,694
Scott: I don't know if I can run in any speed for 20 minutes.

389
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:49,929
Rym: Yeah I'm picking a walk for 20 minutes.

390
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,595
Rym: Yeah, I could read a book while walking.

391
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,040
Rym: Why would I walk on a treadmill?

392
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:54,480
Scott: Cold outside.

393
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,080
Rym: The whole point of being on a treadmill is to exercise.

394
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,635
Rym: I'm gonna run it like nine or ten miles an hour on the treadmill.

395
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:01,359
Scott: not a thing I do.

396
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:08,700
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so I watched all the Voyager okay, and I guess it must have been good enough for you to keep watching It.

397
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:09,924
Scott: here's the problem is bad.

398
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:11,229
Scott: I imagine you would have just stopped.

399
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,657
Scott: Here's what's fascinating a hundred something episodes.

400
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:14,098
Scott: Here's what's

401
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,585
Rym: fascinating I I realized re watching this show with

402
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:18,266
Scott: adult brain

403
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:31,770
Rym: and then and also like with adult brain and Continuing to watch the show beyond where I stopped watching I Realized that the show is actually really good and the only reason I stopped watching and remembered it being boring.

404
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,800
Scott: You stopped watching TV.

405
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:33,810
Rym: Yeah, it was commercials.

406
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:41,128
Rym: That's true, too I had because when I watch these episodes every time like I see the moment coming of it's gonna come to commercial break.

407
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:46,504
Rym: fuck this I realized when I was a kid as soon as the first commercial break happened.

408
00:25:46,805 --> 00:26:01,410
Rym: I turned off any TV show Just instantly, so I remembered the first setup of every single Star Trek Voyager episode up until like the year 2000 And I don't remember how it resolved cuz I turned it off or fell asleep as soon as the first commercials came on.

409
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,030
Scott: Yeah, I'd only ever watched Ten Commandments on television, and I'd never watched the whole thing in one go.

410
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,339
Scott: Yeah, I always what.

411
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,014
Scott: but I've seen all of it Moses Big fan hot

412
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:12,656
Rym: yule Brenner

413
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:32,876
Scott: right, but I watched it again because it was Passover and I downloaded a 1080p HD And I watched it all at once and it is this 1080p I downloaded even included like this introduction at the beginning is basically what you would have seen in the theaters in 1956. it included intermission and the overture Yeah, and it no commercials.

414
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:38,250
Scott: and the fact that there are no commercials made it way easier to watch and understand more impact.

415
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,274
Scott: It's just better in every way.

416
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:46,930
Rym: I Nothing but smoldering pictures of yule Brenner.

417
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:51,329
Scott: There's no such thing that you could just type you'll Brenner because there is not a non smoldering.

418
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,904
Rym: You'll Brenner picture might have been the hottest one of the hottest men to ever live.

419
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:55,908
Scott: He's up there.

420
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,153
Rym: Yeah He's definitely up there.

421
00:26:57,635 --> 00:27:01,650
Rym: Anyway, my law my geek bite is by the way, you'll Brenner smoke themselves to death.

422
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,438
Scott: We have on cancer.

423
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,368
Rym: don't smoke don't smoke.

424
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:13,832
Rym: But Star Trek Voyager in a moderate like watching it on Netflix where there are no commercial breaks really good Really tight Tells.

425
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,382
Scott: only they could remove track from other show.

426
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:21,390
Rym: I know but because it's not a comedy There's no laugh track and as a result, I was good.

427
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:30,713
Rym: I will say that Voyager is actually one of my favorite Star Trek's now that I've watched it in a modern post commercial post television Context.

428
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,710
Rym: and the best characters are the non human characters.

429
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:45,404
Rym: Basically, the doctor who is a hologram and the Borg are the only two actually good characters Yeah, and all the like human or effectively human characters.

430
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,210
Rym: pretty boring and a boring human arcs.

431
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:51,423
Rym: but the non human characters actually have pretty good arcs and pretty interesting stories.

432
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:55,055
Rym: and if you thought that Voyager was boring because you Tried to watch it on TV.

433
00:27:55,076 --> 00:28:02,388
Rym: I would recommend giving it a second go because Commercials ruin everything that is good and ads are a cancer upon entertainment.

434
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:12,038
Rym: and now it's time for the wings of the day.

435
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:27,462
Rym: so Scott say you've got a Cube Okay, that weighs like a kilogram all right, and you got another cube that weighs a kilogram and you got a wall and you'll push what the one one cube.

436
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:34,288
Rym: add another cube and It'll hit that cube and then that cube will hit a wall and bounce back toward the thing.

437
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:38,299
Rym: You just knocked Like you understand this this concepts.

438
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,745
Rym: Yeah in a physics world.

439
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,423
Rym: They're both one kilogram Yeah, or two kilograms or some number of kilograms.

440
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:47,739
Scott: both the cubes are the same The same same man, let's say they're the same right.

441
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,815
Scott: the first cube hits the second cube Yeah, it stops moving.

442
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,523
Scott: The next one carries all the energy.

443
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:54,849
Scott: Yeah goes into the wall.

444
00:28:55,131 --> 00:29:03,290
Scott: Yeah bounces off the wall goes back into the first cube Then the first cube is moving and then eventually runs out energy and you got to push that first cube hard enough.

445
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,130
Scott: Well, it might stop somewhere in between.

446
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,730
Scott: Other than the friction heat and wind air resistance energy that gets lost.

447
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,270
Scott: Right, you know all the energy is going into the movement of the cube.

448
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:18,991
Scott: It would be the same if you just push the one cube against the wall and it bounced off Right.

449
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:26,610
Scott: So what if let's what does like when you have all the balls on a string and you hit one at the end You let it go and then the one on the other end jumps out and all the rest of them is not moving.

450
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:28,290
Rym: So let's assume there's no friction.

451
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:29,776
Rym: So it is just one to one.

452
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:33,470
Rym: you hit cube one and it's cube to cube to bounce off the wall comes back.

453
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,488
Rym: How many collisions occur?

454
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,878
Scott: Let's see cube one hits cube two.

455
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,324
Scott: Yep one two hits wall.

456
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,770
Scott: Yep cube two hits cube one.

457
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,383
Scott: Yep, that's three three three.

458
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:44,169
Rym: All right three.

459
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,486
Rym: What if the first cube weighs more like two kilograms or 16 kilograms or 64 kilograms?

460
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,551
Scott: All right.

461
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,017
Scott: Well the first cube comes in the.

462
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:56,206
Scott: so the first cube is bigger.

463
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:56,306
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,256
Scott: All right The first cube is bigger.

465
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,281
Scott: So it comes in.

466
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:00,689
Scott: it hits the hits the second cube.

467
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,948
Scott: I guess the bigger first cube would not would keep moving along right.

468
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:06,670
Scott: it would keep going.

469
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,563
Rym: So it's getting closer and closer and closer, right?

470
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:15,285
Scott: So the second cube Cube is gonna fly towards the wall, but the first cube isn't stopped.

471
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:18,938
Scott: It's gonna keep moving along Slower than it was but still moving.

472
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:30,926
Scott: It just put a bunch of its energy into that for a second cube Yep, and then the small one is gonna bounce off the wall come back and hit again Yeah, and then so there's a lot of collisions.

473
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:35,530
Scott: actually probably Yeah, you're probably gonna get like a ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding any situation and they eventually stop.

474
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,010
Rym: So what if I told you that if you calculate for this situation?

475
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:48,921
Rym: The number of collisions the bigger the first cube is compared to the second cube it The number of collisions ends up being PI.

476
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:50,690
Rym: It's the digits of PI.

477
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,463
Rym: It is the digits of PI.

478
00:30:54,825 --> 00:31:07,430
Rym: if it's a 1,000,000 kilogram cube and a 1 kilogram cube the number of collisions is 3140. and if you keep increasing this it converges on the digits of PI.

479
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:10,130
Rym: It sounds crazy.

480
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,128
Rym: That is the answer.

481
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,584
Scott: That's just an artifact of how we do math and not an artifact of the universe.

482
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,090
Rym: No, it is an artifact of the universe.

483
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:25,116
Rym: So if it is a 1 oh Kilogram cube against a 1 kilogram cube.

484
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:30,670
Rym: the number of collisions is three three million one hundred forty one thousand five hundred and ninety-two.

485
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,924
Rym: It does in fact calculate PI.

486
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,310
Rym: this video is called.

487
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:38,278
Rym: So why do colliding blocks compute PI?

488
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,862
Rym: and in 15 minutes?

489
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:42,650
Rym: The answer is amazing and terrifying.

490
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,389
Scott: What if the mass of my cube?

491
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:46,926
Scott: Was e?

492
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:49,849
Scott: Would it bounce negative one time?

493
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,365
Scott: Then anyway, no the mass I think has to be negative one then it would bounce e times.

494
00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,770
Rym: Yeah can't have negative mass.

495
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:04,309
Scott: Or yup, I bounce a black hole into a Rym's face.

496
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,922
Rym: Anyway, this video is you know that numberphile channel.

497
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,130
Rym: we link to it kind of often because it's a really fun channel.

498
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,187
Scott: They've been making a little less videos lately, but they did put it out recently.

499
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:14,650
Scott: They're not dead.

500
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:15,949
Rym: Yeah, they make really good stuff.

501
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:21,910
Rym: But numberphile is like here's a cool math concept explained at Rym and Scott's like current understanding of math.

502
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,310
Scott: Explain it to educated person who can do basic arithmetic and knows like algebra, but who hasn't actually done much serious math since college.

503
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:38,310
Rym: Yeah, so or ever Three blue one round is a channel that basically is numberphile for people who actually continued to study math.

504
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,217
Scott: Oh, so I can't understand anything in this video.

505
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:44,070
Rym: You will it's just you have to give this video your full attention.

506
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,240
Scott: But I'll just trust you on the PI thing.

507
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,584
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

508
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:53,301
Scott: the explanation good fucking God that is an amazing colliding block is amazing.

509
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:59,889
Rym: if true calculates PI and The reason it calculates PI actually does make sense.

510
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:01,994
Scott: What about spheres?

511
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,036
Scott: always fears instead?

512
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:07,488
Rym: They do the same thing because they're wouldn't they calculate some square.

513
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:11,321
Rym: Here's the problem Are they the same physical size just with different masses?

514
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,324
Scott: Well, no, they're not sliding.

515
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:13,970
Scott: They're rolling as opposed.

516
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,509
Rym: We already said perfectly elastic no friction, so it wouldn't matter.

517
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:22,930
Rym: But if one's bigger than the other one, it matters a lot because now their center is in a different position.

518
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:26,090
Rym: So the first one might like bounce over the top water.

519
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,015
Scott: What if I got us?

520
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,170
Scott: I hit a small thing into a big thing, but I hit it fast enough.

521
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,406
Scott: So the big thing moves and the big thing starts out close enough to the wall that it still bounces back.

522
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:36,489
Scott: I don't know.

523
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:40,027
Rym: Anyway, they calculate PI and it's fucking amazing.

524
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:40,569
Rym: What do you got?

525
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,993
Scott: What do I have?

526
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:45,890
Scott: so, you know in the world we have lots of languages and alphabets.

527
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,632
Scott: Yeah, right.

528
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,718
Scott: and then we have ways of music notation.

529
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,282
Rym: Yeah, pretty much convert right.

530
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:52,950
Scott: you draw dots on sticks on bars, right?

531
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,298
Scott: You know how music looks like when you're writing sheet music.

532
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,666
Rym: Yeah, I've studied music theory in detail.

533
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:58,689
Scott: even I know how to read that.

534
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,221
Scott: You know, there are other ways of writing musical notation.

535
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,890
Scott: There's like guitar tabs, which are slightly different, right?

536
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,056
Scott: They're pretty much still dots on bars kind.

537
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:10,525
Rym: Yeah, you know, but not exactly the same.

538
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,032
Rym: I've always considered tabs to be Guitar.

539
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:16,626
Rym: players want to play chords, but don't actually want to learn how to read music.

540
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:17,590
Scott: Yeah, basically.

541
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:22,090
Scott: But you know there have been other musical notation systems in history.

542
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:30,989
Scott: There still are many in use in some places But pretty much the normal one that you think of with treble clef's and shit is the one in most of the world.

543
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:35,630
Rym: Yeah, right, but a comic combined with Italian language like that's what we use.

544
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,149
Scott: Yeah, but here is one that I'd never seen before and this whole article about it.

545
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:45,370
Scott: That is really amazing and not mostly amazing just because it looks fucking awesome.

546
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:47,190
Scott: Yeah, like it's a work of art.

547
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,417
Scott: Like if I look at some sheet music sheet music can occasionally be a work of art But it's generally kind of meh.

548
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,263
Scott: It's a better heard than seen.

549
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:55,065
Rym: Yeah of all people.

550
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,110
Rym: so you want to know a side story.

551
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:03,536
Rym: I've heard tell that Wagner would write certain notes or certain parts in different colors Just for reasons.

552
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:06,389
Rym: I'm gonna make sure that's actually true and not just something a music teacher told

553
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:17,160
Scott: me I just checked that you'll render did die of lung cancer After he quit smoke like a few years after he quit smoking and then after when he realized the smoke and killed him He was like god damn it and made like anti-smoking ads.

554
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,588
Scott: no like don't die of lung cancer like I didn't.

555
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:20,070
Scott: I'm like.

556
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:26,749
Scott: I'm going to All right anyway, so anyway, so this is a Tibetan way.

557
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:28,356
Rym: That might be a myth.

558
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,450
Rym: the color thing is not on his Wikipedia page anyway.

559
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:37,647
Scott: This is a Tibetan way of a musical notation And it looks fucking awesome and regardless of what it sounds like it is beautiful to behold like.

560
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,109
Scott: I kind of want to get one Of these just hanging on the wall or something.

561
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:48,736
Scott: but actually I also learned from this that this is used to denote a type of throat singing that sounds a lot like Mongolian throat singing.

562
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:52,050
Scott: so I guess those places in the world Tibet and Mongolia are pretty close to each other.

563
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:58,966
Scott: So I guess there is some sort of shared Ancestry or shared cultural ancestry related to throat singing.

564
00:35:58,986 --> 00:35:59,630
Scott: that's pretty cool.

565
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:02,345
Scott: And once you know that this is denoting throat singing.

566
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:07,403
Scott: you sort of make sense When you look at it why it's you know denoting that kind of music.

567
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,570
Rym: yep also singing is really awesome.

568
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,498
Scott: Yeah, I also like throat singing a lot.

569
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:14,390
Scott: like I just go and Spotify type in some throat singing.

570
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:18,264
Scott: There is a metal band, I think it's called the who band.

571
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,950
Scott: it's a Mongolian throat singing metal band.

572
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,830
Scott: They're fucking awesome, and I think they've been a thing of the day before.

573
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:26,850
Scott: But I was reminded of their existence recently and this is relevant.

574
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,390
Scott: So I figured why not bring up that awesome throat singing metal man so funnily enough?

575
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:31,630
Rym: I got it in high school.

576
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,955
Rym: You know I talked about like.

577
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:38,198
Rym: I got whistling lessons in high school because we wanted to perform a thing like they did a whistling Clinic we have.

578
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,530
Scott: did you see the world whistling championships?

579
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:42,329
Rym: I know of the world whistling championships.

580
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:43,295
Scott: I watched a video.

581
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:46,068
Scott: some people who like went there and made like a mini documentary about it.

582
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,998
Rym: whistling is Difficult to do well, but anyway.

583
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,872
Rym: so we had another clinic for a song We were gonna do.

584
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:54,702
Rym: that involved throat singing and we had a throat singing expert.

585
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:57,150
Rym: come in awesome and give lessons in throat singing.

586
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,919
Rym: I was unable to do it.

587
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,010
Scott: I feel like that takes a lot more practice to even make any sound.

588
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,637
Scott: So basically for sound.

589
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:11,249
Rym: so we did a clinic with anyone in the class able to make the right thing Like six people who were able to pull it off like at all.

590
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,365
Rym: So then they got a much more intensive class to be able to do it for a song we performed.

591
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:17,770
Rym: It was really fun.

592
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,703
Rym: I really wish I was able to do it, but I couldn't make it work.

593
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,290
Rym: so and we were under pressure.

594
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,837
Scott: So they like all right who can throat sing?

595
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:24,480

00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:41,790
Rym: yeah the amnesiac hero, that's very relevant to the story here.

626
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:45,038
Rym: Our bunch of our bunch of our panels are on YouTube.

627
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:45,781

632
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,089
Scott: Yep, these are the times.

633
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:07,335
Rym: if you Want us to do more content the best thing you can do to make that happen is to take the videos we upload to YouTube.

634
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:24,810
Rym: so judge anime real harm of games rare game mechanics the three videos we just made and seriously Post them on the reddits and all the places you do your internet shit like the forums and reddits you hang out on that We don't hang out on because we do not go shamelessly self-promote our videos.

635
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:30,436
Rym: We just promote directly from our source, so if you want us to make more things like that Promote them for us.

636
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:33,410
Scott: You know I already tell you not to give Rym your patreon money.

637
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,710
Scott: Why are you doing free labor for him to promote his content?

638
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,989
Scott: And he should be hiring a PR firm or a marketing firm or something like that.

639
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,720
Scott: Don't give your labor freely to Rym.

640
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:44,468
Rym: I am saying or your money.

641
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:52,200
Rym: I'm just saying if you want us to make more videos the best way to get us to do that I'm not making more videos no matter the view.

642
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,512
Scott: count on the videos will not determine how many more videos I make.

643
00:39:55,652 --> 00:40:01,115
Rym: you're just saying that cuz real harm of games is getting way less views than a rare game mechanics Despite being equally promoted.

644
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,724
Scott: I mean I didn't even know what the views were.

645
00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:05,290
Scott: yeah, I don't look at views.

646
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:12,650
Scott: Yeah My only way that it would ever change than the amount of content I make is if it made you enough money to where you could quit your job, right?

647
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:15,400
Scott: It's not like I check the views or the money.

648
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,864
Scott: someone have to come to me and be like hey Did you know your thing made a bunch of money?

649
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:20,790
Scott: You don't have to go to work tomorrow?

650
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:23,596
Scott: Right cuz I don't look at it ever.

651
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:31,808
Rym: I'm just saying views are like buying lottery tickets Probably not gonna change anything in our lives, but it only takes one thing going viral to be good.

652
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:34,235
Rym: hmm We have now the bay.

653
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:37,690

661
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:57,954

Rym: Maybe I'll watch it all.

666
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:06,110
Scott: that was zero of it, and that's I plan to keep it that way.

667
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:19,030
Rym: I would put it this way Scott the if you watched the first season of Game of Thrones for Shane long You would probably really like it Because it'll scratch a lot of the same itches that like Prince of Nothing kind of thing does the pry hand.

668
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:21,302
Scott: And it always seemed more like a l5r to me.

669
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:33,350
Rym: Well I guess the way I'd put yeah with the wall and those yeah I can see that like the little I know Or care about Game of Thrones it basically felt like l5r with different skin on it.

670
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:40,482
Rym: I'll put it this way season one is pretty good mostly because There's a hand there's smart care the characters even the good the good ones the evil ones everyone.

671
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:48,969
Rym: They do the smart thing and It's pretty good, and then Wheel of Time also have a wall with bad guys on the other side.

672
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:53,901
Rym: You can sort of in the Northeast yeah It's got a couple things like that.

673
00:41:53,921 --> 00:42:00,166
Scott: uh-huh fucking Wheel of Time any fantasy things have a wall with bad guys on the other side because that's it.

674
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:01,912
Rym: the kaiju wall is a fun Thing to have.

675
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:09,992
Rym: I remember when Yorkie when you encountered the kaiju wall when we were playing that l5r game The first thing you did was like Time.

676
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,880
Scott: I had ever encountered that trope wasn't a trope.

677
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,370
Rym: then it was fresh, but you got really excited about the wall.

678
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,320
Scott: You're like what's on the other side cuz it was new now.

679
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:16,783
Scott: It's a trope.

680
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:18,913
Scott: I've seen like four walls now I don't need anymore.

681
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:22,270
Scott: I remember you was only exciting the first time were you're like crab clan.

682
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:28,491
Rym: I forget what you were but you grandpa ninja Yeah, you ran to the other side of the wall sort of roll around in the dirt to see if it would do anything to You.

683
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:30,359
Scott: yeah, someone said it was evil on the other side.

684
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:39,410
Rym: Yeah, but uh I. Anyway the last episode of season one does something really surprising and shocking and good and interesting.

685
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,868
Rym: And then after that it just got kind of boring and I stopped watching.

686
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:43,938
Rym: So you can watch just the first season.

687
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,046
Rym: you get everything you need to get out of.

00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:46,830
Scott: just watch something else.

00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:47,694
Rym: That's pretty good.

690
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:48,297
Rym: It ain't that long.

691
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:48,880
Scott: I'll watch.

692
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:50,830
Scott: he who punches only one time.

693
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,495
Rym: Oh, yeah, or I'm gonna finish.

694
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:55,184
Rym: door row row row row row row row row and there's gonna be.

695
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:56,970
Rym: there's the new horror anime.

696
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:01,178
Rym: There's stuff to watch Adventure times done so you don't have to watch that anymore.

697
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:01,459
Scott: Nope.

698
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:03,287
Rym: All right, let's get into it.

699
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:07,420
Rym: I Am a huge huge fan of horror movies.

700
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:10,950
Rym: There are not that many good horror movies in the world.

701
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:16,690
Scott: I am also a fan not huge but a regular sized fan of horror movies.

702
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:22,450
Rym: I spent my whole life watching horror movies from a very young age because my mom also likes horror movies.

703
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:25,622
Rym: That's why I want and also my mom also likes the harm.

704
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:30,885
Rym: I like torture porn gore movies Movies slasher movies every kind of horror fiction.

705
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:31,950
Rym: I am down.

706
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:38,675
Scott: My problem is is that you know, I tend to only it's like I really like Horror movies when they're good.

707
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,704
Scott: They are just extremely rarely good now.

708
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,750
Rym: also there are very very different subs.

709
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:48,148
Scott: It's like how can it's everyone's like you're a horror movie fan, but like you only like like a handful.

710
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:53,957
Scott: it's like yeah Well, ninety nine point nine and nine percent of them are really kind of lowbrow crappy cheaply made Blah look like.

711
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:59,030
Scott: and it's not the fault of the genre It's the fault of the fact that you know, it doesn't make the biggest money.

712
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:04,738
Scott: So they don't invest the biggest money into making horror films that often Budget lower production value.

713
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:06,385
Rym: I'd say it's - it's two factors.

714
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:08,373
Rym: It's the factor of one They don't make.

715
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:12,730
Rym: it's like even a great horror movie just won't make that much money compared to like another movie.

716
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:17,269
Rym: And horror is like comedy and that it's really fucking hard to do.

717
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,702
Rym: Oh, yeah, like it is real hard to make a good horror movie.

718
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:25,481
Scott: It's real hard to make an actually funny movie Yeah, but like my you know, my top ones are like alien.

719
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:27,769
Scott: Yeah, John Carpenter is the thing.

720
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,074
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

721
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:30,679
Scott: those are pretty much the best ones.

722
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,070
Rym: but it also look at subgenres like horror is one of those things where?

723
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,267
Rym: People who are aficionados like really get granular about the subgenres.

724
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:44,528
Rym: I should watch anyway Or like like slasher matrix and again, oh we were talking about watching The Matrix.

725
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:52,167
Rym: the other day I I watched a Clip from The Matrix because someone did a thing of like how they did this scene that I didn't think about.

726
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,443
Rym: guns lots of guns Yeah, no that scene.

727
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:58,950
Rym: I know what they did it But it was it anyway, I saw trying to hit me and hit me.

728
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,858
Rym: I saw this clip and I was like, oh shit.

729
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,003
Rym: I just want to watch The Matrix.

730
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:02,586
Rym: Of course.

731
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:07,570
Rym: Oh, no Oh, no, if I should I show you a Star Wars clip, but no I got shit to do tonight.

732
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,650
Rym: Scott let's watch just one episode of cowboy bebop and stop as long as it's the last episode.

733
00:45:17,613 --> 00:45:20,330
Rym: Even then I'll watch the end of it and I'll be like who I should watch the beginning.

734
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:21,963
Scott: Let's watch for some of the image.

735
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:27,566
Rym: Oh, no No, the first episode the the moment where Evangelion grabs me.

736
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:35,870
Rym: if I watch the very beginning I'm fine until you see that end to palm bomb go off and then you see the nuke like explosion.

737
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:39,910
Scott: I'm fine until the shot where the car is driving towards the city and the building start coming up.

738
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,589
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty good too for me.

739
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:47,890
Rym: It's the moment where the bomb goes off and then the the old men are like we did it we fucking nuked it.

740
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,954
Scott: I know needed to shit.

741
00:45:48,994 --> 00:45:50,922
Rym: Yep, and then you just see the alien.

00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:51,785
Scott: They're still walking.

743
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:52,930
Rym: Yeah, I'm just still walking.

744
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,535
Scott: Anyway, let's get on topic.

745
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:59,790
Rym: but like slasher movies the first slasher movies were good at what they did.

746
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,217
Rym: And then there are a million clones.

747
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:07,430
Rym: a lot of times when a horror movie is good There will be a million knockoffs of that particular sub-genre of horror.

748
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,772
Rym: They're all.

749
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:13,570
Scott: and even though a lot of those movies were good in their day For me at least a lot of them have not aged well, right?

750
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,689
Rym: Like I can recognize the Evil Dead is a is a product of its time.

751
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:22,049
Scott: I can recognize You know the quality the the legacy all the.

752
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:26,885
Scott: you know The parts of say a Friday the 13th or a nightmare on Elm Street or a Halloween,

753
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,450
Rym: but I play one

754
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:35,528
Scott: Right, but any of those while I can recognize and and respect them like to watch them now for me is kind of a

755
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:36,713
Rym: yeah Yeah,

756
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:38,002
Scott: but I was right.

757
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,070
Scott: It's not like watching alien.

758
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:46,707
Rym: I watched them mostly the way I watch old movies that don't hold up where I'm watching them like as an exploration of that era of cinema.

759
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:57,130
Rym: But yeah us is a good modern horror movie That is hard to put in a genre of or a sub-genre of horror.

760
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,916
Scott: Well, we got to talk about get out first.

761
00:46:59,097 --> 00:46:59,398
Scott: Okay.

762
00:46:59,499 --> 00:46:59,820
Rym: Okay.

763
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,630
Scott: So yeah, so is Jordan Peele, right?

764
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,050
Scott: Yeah of key and peel the great comedy duo.

765
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:09,690
Rym: Yeah, if you do not realize Jordan Peele is responsible for both get out and us, right?

766
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:10,631
Scott: So, you know It's like.

767
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:17,450
Scott: I remember key and peel when they were comedy dudes doing funny comedies that I like and are hilarious human beings.

768
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:19,055
Scott: But I guess they stopped doing that show.

769
00:47:19,477 --> 00:47:23,590
Scott: and now Jordan Peele's producing slash directing horror movies.

770
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,119
Rym: Total aside you ever watch Fargo the TV show?

771
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:27,785
Scott: I watched Fargo the movie.

772
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:33,522
Rym: Yeah Fargo the TV show There's three seasons is a plus like a plus television.

773
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,507
Scott: It's just like retelling the movie or what?

774
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:36,370
Scott: No, what is it?

775
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,414
Rym: Well, let's say lady to the movie in any way Yes, well, we should.

776
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:40,775
Rym: we'll talk.

777
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:41,899
Rym: we should talk about this separately.

778
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,124
Rym: We'll go on for a while.

779
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:48,600
Rym: They're real good movies good, but They are in one of them as FBI agents.

780
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,347
Rym: Oh, that's funny and they're a plus.

781
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,377
Rym: I can imagine Independent of the show being a plus.

782
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:57,570
Scott: so he made the movie get out which was much lauded.

783
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:08,329
Rym: We went to see in the theater and it was a combination of horror and social commentary Which I shouldn't need to say because all good horror movies are some form of social commentary, of course.

784
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:12,037
Scott: Yeah, it was actually get out was way good.

785
00:48:12,178 --> 00:48:13,622
Rym: get out is scary as shit.

786
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:14,986
Scott: It's not scary.

787
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:15,748
Rym: It's a horror movie.

788
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:17,454
Rym: It's scary It's suspenseful.

789
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:18,237
Rym: It's got it's got.

790
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,803
Rym: it's got suspense scenes.

791
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,530
Rym: It's got good jump-scare scenes.

792
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:23,678
Rym: It's got good like existential scene.

793
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:26,730
Rym: It's got all the trappings of a horror movie.

794
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,685
Scott: I mean it is a horror movie doesn't trappings of it is.

795
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:32,761
Rym: well you have this weird thing If you say that no movie is scary, it isn't scary.

796
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:33,727
Rym: All right, what?

797
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:34,350
Rym: what's a movie?

798
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,774
Rym: You've ever seen that was scary?

799
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:41,882
Scott: because your definition of scary is ridiculous and I digress I mean when I was a kid, I was scared of mr.

800
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:45,199
Scott: Boogity, which isn't even a I'm not anymore.

801
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,066
Rym: If we ever make a Small if we ever make a GeekNights movie club to go alongside the book club.

802
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:50,287
Rym: Mr.

803
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,896
Rym: Boogity is good I'm sure it's just on YouTube.

804
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,004
Scott: Anyway, he's googling.

805
00:48:56,425 --> 00:49:00,393
Scott: All right, so The mr.

806
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:02,921
Rym: Boogity whole movie there you go on YouTube.

807
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:06,070
Scott: Okay, anyway commercials no.

808
00:49:08,151 --> 00:49:09,998
Scott: Anyway, so get out was real good.

809
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:11,685
Scott: and because get out was so good.

810
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:13,030
Scott: I'm like, well that was so good.

811
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:14,396
Scott: I will go see us.

812
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:22,870
Scott: your new horror movie, you know, not it's not a sequel It's not related to get out directly other than another movie in the same genre made by the same people in the theater again.

813
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:28,000
Scott: Yes, I will go see that just like you write a good book and you may write another book I'll read that one too, right same deal.

814
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:32,050
Scott: So he went to see us and Us is also real good.

815
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:38,360
Scott: I don't think it's as good as get out, but it's still real good and I will still go to Yet another horror movie if they make another one.

816
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,132
Rym: I mean, I think the main difference around gonna spoil anything It's a movie.

817
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:43,845
Rym: just go watch it and it's a horror movie where there are twists.

818
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:44,790
Rym: You'll probably see him coming.

819
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:46,360
Rym: Maybe you don't saw him coming.

820
00:49:46,602 --> 00:50:00,086
Rym: Yeah, though I actually expected a deeper twist of like one of the two people Changing as opposed to have anyway, I there was another way that could have gone.

821
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:01,350
Rym: that would have been a very similar twist.

822
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:12,081
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and I I thought it was going more in that direction But it was obvious at a certain point with a certain thing Where we both said this is getting dumb.

823
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:12,703
Rym: Oh, wait.

824
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,606
Rym: No now it's good again.

825
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:14,128
Scott: Yep.

826
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:17,837
Rym: Yep so the theater read.

827
00:50:17,877 --> 00:50:25,005
Rym: the good points about this movie are that number one the Score and soundtrack are just perfect.

828
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:27,552
Rym: Hmm They they use where.

829
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:31,237
Scott: so I remember during like while watching it.

830
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:35,610
Scott: right not not the score the the orchestral music.

831
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:42,610
Scott: Yeah, right But the you know the tracks that they you know of popular music that they selected and inserted into the movie.

832
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:47,292
Scott: We're always the most appropriate song possible Yep But they weren't.

833
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:54,032
Rym: they served a good purpose in the sense that the movie is both a horror movie with various kinds of scariness And such.

834
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:57,564
Rym: but it is also funny and it does.

835
00:50:57,604 --> 00:50:57,724
Rym: it's.

836
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:08,662
Rym: it's the kind of horror movie that has some dark humor and some just straight-up humor all interwoven and It's sort of a. it has a complex palette of emotions while you're watching

837
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:23,654
Scott: right and most of it was that the music they selected Was not only super appropriate and super great music But also it wasn't what happens in a lot of movies where they selected like the brand new hit song For promotional

838
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:23,954
Rym: purposes.

839
00:51:23,974 --> 00:51:25,479
Rym: No, no, no, fuck the police.

840
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,650
Scott: They were selecting the song for you know, for the movie purposes.

841
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:44,681
Rym: There's it like there's a moment that there is a serious Horrifying scene happening and a character basically does the equivalent saying Alexa call the police and Alexa's like playing Fuck the police by NWA And then fuck the police just starts playing right.

842
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,890
Scott: and that brings me to my second point about this movie.

843
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:55,141
Scott: Is that perhaps better than any movie I have ever seen ever horror movie at least Where characters are in a difficult situation?

844
00:51:55,161 --> 00:52:00,961
Scott: and it takes place in the present day Like everyone's got cell phones.

845
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:04,317
Scott: There's Alexa right there There's cars this boats this.

846
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:07,670
Scott: every conceivable modern technology is available.

847
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:09,720
Rym: They're in like a beach town with a lot of people.

848
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,910
Rym: they're not even that isolated not isolated at all.

849
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,492
Scott: They're not right.

850
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:21,220
Scott: and yet despite all that the horror scenario and the thing the course of events are Such that a no one does anything stupid.

851
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:30,270
Scott: and B. They don't need any contrivances whatsoever To say oh, why don't they just solve this problem by using their modern technology?

852
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:37,154
Scott: Because the problem is such that they do try to solve it using their body technology in the same reasonable ways Anyone else would.

853
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:40,223
Rym: and it doesn't matter character encounters something creepy.

854
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:42,590
Rym: They are reasonable adults and they're like, yeah, that's crazy.

855
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,444
Scott: No, there's no scene where it's like, oh man, no cell service.

856
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,030
Scott: I guess I can't call the police.

857
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:51,650
Scott: Yeah, there's no scene where it's like, you know, why didn't they just call it?

858
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,420
Scott: They literally just like call the police.

859
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:55,170
Scott: Yeah, and they called them that moment.

860
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,357
Rym: And again, we're not gonna spoil anything but the dead.

861
00:52:57,598 --> 00:53:01,550
Rym: the kids like why is there a family standing outside our house, right?

862
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,897
Rym: Dad's like there ain't no family standing.

863
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:05,361
Scott: Oh, there's no nonsense.

864
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:08,129
Scott: for like one character sees something that no one else see.

865
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:10,802
Rym: Everyone tells everyone everything they could.

866
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:12,088
Rym: the dad's like there's no families.

867
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:12,570
Rym: That's stupid.

868
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,557
Rym: Then he looks out the windows ago.

869
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,390
Scott: Everyone sees everything.

870
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:18,985
Rym: Everything is real family standing outside and he doesn't like.

871
00:53:19,306 --> 00:53:20,110
Rym: obviously that's creepy.

872
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:26,997
Rym: But if I everyone's working everyone's working together He goes He goes outside and he's like.

873
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:32,210
Rym: I will go deal with this because even though it's creepy The world is not filled with ghosts and monsters.

874
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,066
Scott: Right that we think might be a ghost or a monster who knows what?

875
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:38,929
Scott: because the horror movie.

876
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:42,921
Scott: and we hear Reasonable people in the real world these characters in this movie.

877
00:53:43,122 --> 00:53:45,150
Scott: They just go take a baseball bat and try to hit it.

878
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,917
Rym: Yeah, well first he goes outside like okay.

879
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,724
Scott: No tries to talk to it.

880
00:53:48,985 --> 00:53:50,290
Scott: Then he tries to hit it with a baseball.

881
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,364
Rym: Yeah, right everything for guys.

882
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:53,310
Rym: They come back and call the police.

883
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:53,993
Rym: They do everything.

884
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:57,149
Rym: everybody does everything reasonable at every point in this movie.

885
00:53:57,531 --> 00:54:03,010
Scott: And I think that is like the number one thing that this movie does better than any horror movie ever.

886
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:18,299
Rym: The number two thing that it does is it really sets up a mood and a place Like the atmosphere is set correctly and all the Chekhov's guns are lined up in a row But it escalates faster.

887
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,730
Rym: a lot of horror movies fail because they ramp up really slowly.

888
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:28,054
Rym: This movie hits a point pretty early on where it goes from like one mile an hour to 100 miles an hour.

889
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:28,918
Rym: pop up go go go.

890
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,007
Rym: Yeah, and it never slows down after that point.

891
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:32,298
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot It's true.

892
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:33,250
Scott: I didn't even think about that.

893
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:40,407
Scott: Is that you know, there's a lot of ones out there where it's like, okay Even the thing like the or you know alien like the two that I mentioned is being the best right?

894
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:47,014
Scott: It's like We're gonna be all crying and even after the thing bursts out of the chest and it's quiet This one's like.

895
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:55,181
Scott: no this does not follow the dread tower model of build suspense Collapse build suspense collapse when people die, right?

896
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:57,650
Scott: This is what's going on here.

897
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:04,464
Scott: They're clearly setting up spooky stuff right from the beginning you know and then the spooky stuff unleashes and it's crazy for the rest of the movie.

898
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:10,428
Rym: crazy crazy in your face and When characters get a rest constant chasing running fighting monsters.

899
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:12,936
Rym: Oh my god The tension still does ratchet down.

900
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:27,190
Rym: but unlike traditional like slasher movies where situation doesn't unfuck up Nope It's more like torchbearer Where you're still in the dungeon and you're just like getting an hour's respite before you continue to try to carry the tapestry out.

901
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:39,655
Rym: Yeah, like no one's fresh again at any point in this movie who listen to this understands that reference Tapestry carrying and It gets without spoiling anything at all.

902
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:48,590
Rym: it gets the appropriate amount of surreal and Weird at the end without going overboard and not making sense.

903
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:55,030
Scott: Yeah, the explanation of about what's really going on is similarly surreal to the explanation of what's really going on and get out.

904
00:55:55,250 --> 00:56:05,070
Rym: Yep, it also goes in on the social commentary, but it's a lot less than get out It's more like you can read like you can interpret a lot of very heavy.

905
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,101
Scott: It's like what are you?

906
00:56:07,122 --> 00:56:07,990
Scott: it's like we're American.

907
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:08,391
Rym: That's.

908
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:16,642
Rym: that scene is actually one of my favorite moments because it's such a weird answer that even the theater I like I wanted to laugh but it almost wasn't fun.

909
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:23,562
Scott: And then it makes sense when you In the scene it's like what.

910
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:27,660
Scott: and but it's like in the scene It seems like a social commentary but also like a what what.

911
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:36,663
Scott: but then when you zoom out and see the whole movie It's like oh Yeah, they are Americans, yeah, they are Americans but also they're Americans.

912
00:56:36,804 --> 00:56:38,750
Rym: yes, there's there are Americans.

913
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:40,985
Scott: Yep, that's what the movies trying to say, by the way.

914
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:46,192
Rym: Yeah But The shit.

915
00:56:46,232 --> 00:57:03,527
Rym: the other great part about this movie is that it lines up all the check kinds of Chekhov's guns that happen in horror movies and they do all fire but the results of them firing are Widely varied And I'm not even gonna hint at what I'm referring to.

916
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,973
Rym: to see the movie It's really good.

917
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:08,224
Scott: Like I I even though I did see this in the theater.

918
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:10,050
Scott: You are okay not see.

919
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,622
Scott: This is not a must see in theater.

920
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,981
Scott: It's okay to see in theater Yeah, but it's not a must.

921
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:14,244
Rym: see it.

922
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,281
Scott: the best part Thanks or a DVD or waste your money on Voorhe.

923
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:20,550
Rym: We saw it with our friend Judith who's on the podcast a while ago.

924
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:30,187
Rym: Just me Scott and Judith because uh other friends of ours didn't want to see it until we had seen it to tell them Cowards, yeah, but also because you know, they might have some specifically triggering things in it.

925
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:31,030
Scott: That's also a reason.

926
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:38,390
Rym: Yeah, Fred, if you're not okay with the Foley of someone getting stabbed like do not see this movie.

927
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,010
Scott: If you're not okay with like, you know people getting beat up with golf clubs or run over by cars.

928
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:47,809
Scott: You know, it's a horrifying horror movie with horror stuff in it.

929
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,245
Scott: Yeah, considering that I've seen like, you know, each of the killer and Ebola syndrome.

930
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:53,308
Scott: I can watch anything.

931
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:55,758
Scott: Yeah There's an ad.

932
00:57:55,819 --> 00:58:01,770
Scott: in fact, I would say, you know If you can deal with the alien coming out of the guy's stomach an alien then you can watch this whole movie.

933
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:02,956
Scott: There's nothing as bad as that.

934
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:05,710
Rym: but this one the three of us went to see in the theater like pretty recently.

935
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:08,890
Rym: That's why we're only reviewing it now like near the end of its run.

936
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:11,449
Rym: So there was like almost no one else in the theater with us.

937
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:20,637
Rym: Yeah there was a family like kind of behind us like to the right and there's a moment in the movie where something creepy happens to the Dad and the dad in

938
00:58:20,657 --> 00:58:21,902
Scott: the family just said

939
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:27,730
Rym: he basically just says oh hell no And we and everyone in the theater just started laughing.

940
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:32,630
Rym: It was real like you'll get that interaction if you see this in a movie theater.

941
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:37,148
Scott: It does have some comedy and it does, you know as a good horror movie shit.

942
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:49,330
Rym: Yes Good horror movies will jump-scare you also separately make you feel existential growing dread and Tension that does not get released until way after you wanted it to and will also make you laugh out loud.

943
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:52,705
Rym: That is like the mark of a truly great horror movie.

944
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:59,423
Rym: I Will watch this movie again someday Right now but I could watch it again.

945
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:00,610
Rym: I feel like I'd notice things.

946
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,950
Scott: I know it's not like a matrix situation where it's like if I turn it on you're stuck.

947
00:59:04,371 --> 00:59:09,070
Rym: But if you were a fan of scare spooky scary horror movies, this is a top tier.

948
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,870
Scott: What other horror movie you get in besides this recently?

949
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:16,110
Rym: Like I'm already reaching way back when I'm thinking about a whole like proper horror movies.

950
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:20,888
Rym: I in fact, most of the good horror I get is on pseudopod, which is written fiction.

951
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:21,450
Scott: Are you still listening?

952
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,954
Rym: Yeah, pseudopod is great.

953
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:27,008
Rym: Like pseudopod if you like horror just subscribe to the pseudopod podcast.

954
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:27,530
Rym: never look back.

955
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:29,612
Scott: I mean, you know when people talk, you know And people.

956
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:34,150
Scott: the only recent horror movies I hear about are ones like the one where everyone had to be quiet.

957
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:35,054
Scott: I didn't see.

958
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:35,737
Scott: I saw the trailer.

959
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:38,850
Scott: I did actually watch the movie and I heard bad things about it.

960
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,630
Scott: Yeah, and then there's the one that's not even new anymore.

961
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,301
Scott: It's actually kind of old by now, but it's newer than alien.

962
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:46,470
Scott: Yeah is what's that cabin in the woods one?

963
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,899
Scott: Yeah, and everyone loved that but I thought it was hella overrated in May.

964
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,962
Rym: Yeah, it was okay.

965
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:52,005
Scott: Yeah, I did not a fan.

966
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:55,499
Rym: Ah What's my favorite horror movie?

967
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,448
Rym: I'm trying to think like what's my top like two or three.

968
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,578
Rym: The problem is I like horror comedies.

969
00:59:59,618 --> 01:00:01,890
Scott: You just also big alien and thing and be smart like me.

970
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,640
Rym: Yeah, probably I gotta think on it.

971
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:05,250
Rym: I gotta think on it.

972
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:06,993
Rym: Us is up there.

973
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,979
Rym: us is very expertly crafted.

974
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,266
Scott: Yeah, it's not top ten, but it is good.

975
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:16,442
Rym: It's not it's top 50 Of course top 50 of all time horribly easily.

976
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:19,170
Rym: probably top 25 all time probably but I'm hedging here.

977
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:22,343
Rym: Yeah, I could have only only named 100 horror movies.

978
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:24,030
Scott: I mean the problem is, you know some you got it.

979
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,136
Scott: There's too much discussion.

980
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:32,120
Scott: We're not gonna have it now, but it's like, you know say You know old Dracula like nose for that count.

981
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,424
Scott: Is that a horror movie even?

982
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:36,274
Rym: Yeah, probably not Horror-efficient.

983
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,599
Scott: oughta go see Dracula.

984
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:38,644
Scott: Is that a horror movie?

985
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,230
Rym: Yeah, what about hocus-pocus?

986
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,450
Scott: Young Frankenstein, is that a horror movie?

987
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,691
Scott: Is it?

988
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:44,574
Scott: does it count?

989
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:49,550
Rym: No, that just definitely not count even though it has the proper noun tropes of horror.

990
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,895
Rym: That's its own subjoint.

991
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:54,590
Scott: So that's I'm saying that same sub-genre as the Munsters, right?

992
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,582
Scott: There's some kind of discussions you gotta have there before we can start making this list.

993
01:00:57,742 --> 01:01:04,363
Rym: Yeah, but go see right now I want to make the menu Not the list just like when else is on Netflix or whatever like.
