00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,534
Rym: It's Monday, December 17th, 2012.

2
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:16,195
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:17,117
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:18,279
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:22,931
Rym: Tonight we're talking about internet governance, which is not as boring as it should be.

6
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:28,244
Scott: That sums up the whole goddamn thing right there, isn't it?

7
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,180
Scott: I have not heard that summed up more eloquently.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,863
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:44,924
Rym: So it's been a long time since my job was to go into data centers and fuck with physical things.

10
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,070
Scott: Did you go to a data center?

11
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,634
Scott: No, no, no.

12
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,001
Scott: You went into your closet in your office?

13
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:57,814
Rym: So in every company, even if you have data centers with all your stuff hosted in cloud and whatever, you usually have a few servers in your local office.

14
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:03,479
Scott: Well, I mean, if you're a big enough company to have an office and everyone has a computer- You at least have a switch.

15
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:09,062
Scott: You at least have a big ass switch and you have a closet where Verizon runs in the tea, whatever you got.

16
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:09,142
Scott: Yep.

17
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:12,336
Rym: And then you probably have like- So that's already two boxes.

18
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:19,335
Rym: You probably have like a caching server for like private shares or DNS or whatever.

19
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:23,127
Rym: So you're going to have at least three or four servers in your local place.

20
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,055
Scott: You probably want a UPS in there too.

21
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:31,659
Rym: Now in New York City, unless you're in a nice building, usually buildings do not have really places for that.

22
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,684
Scott: No, it's an old building.

23
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,309
Scott: There's just a closet in your office.

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,433
Scott: that was a closet.

25
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:42,440
Rym: Other companies I've worked at, we at least had the blessing of the building, but our building kind of sucks.

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,006
Rym: And I hate where our building is.

27
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:50,448
Rym: But anyway, there's a closet and it was set up long before I got to the company and I kind of ignored it.

28
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,914
Rym: I'm not the system administrator.

29
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,942
Rym: I do different things.

30
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:55,327
Rym: So I just let it be.

31
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:56,109
Rym: I ignore it.

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,152
Scott: Until it stopped working.

33
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:01,892
Rym: So yeah, I had to deal with it because I came in one day and I'm like, "The fuck is that burning

34
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:02,194
Rym: smell?".

35
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:06,620
Rym: And I go in and the outlet that connects one of the air conditioning units in there is on fire.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:07,886
Scott: Literally a fire?

37
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,940
Scott: Did you need a fire extinguisher?

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,699
Rym: It was smoking and the fire had apparently happened and then gone out and ruined it.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,960
Rym: So I unplugged the thing with like a piece of metal, like knock it out of the wall.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,125
Scott: Well, you're an expert at that.

41
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,254
Scott: Yeah.

42
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,009
Rym: Someone can find the relevant GeekNights episode about that.

43
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,133
Rym: And then I'm like, "Oh

44
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:27,494
Rym: fuck.".

45
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,465
Rym: So we get the new air conditioning unit to stick in the room.

46
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:30,987
Rym: There were two.

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:37,080
Rym: And in the course of this, I kind of look around the room and I realized that whoever set it up had no idea what they were doing.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,621
Scott: Yeah.

49
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:40,388
Scott: Usually that's the way it goes.

50
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,718
Rym: Now I know HVAC okay as in.

51
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,591
Rym: I know like the high level stuff, but I don't know the exact details.

52
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,849
Rym: Like what pressure differential, all that kind of like low level stuff.

53
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:53,224
Rym: So I look at the room and I'm like, "Something's not right

54
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:53,485
Rym: here.".

55
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,957
Rym: So I do a little Google in to confirm my suspicions.

56
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:00,700
Rym: And sure enough, it's those standalone units, like what our friend Alex had in his apartment, right?

57
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,660
Rym: What you use to air condition a room that's basically sealed.

58
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,649
Scott: Did the hose not go outside the building?

59
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,056
Rym: So there are two kinds.

60
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,226
Rym: Well, no, and it still doesn't, but that's not.

61
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,295
Rym: So there's two different kinds of those.

62
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:16,774
Rym: There's kinds that basically intake air from the room and then exhaust hot air out.

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,740
Rym: They cause negative pressure.

64
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,546
Rym: They're basically terrible.

65
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,100
Rym: You should never use a unit like that unless you really know why.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,953
Scott: You want the kind that takes air in from the outside, cools it and blows it into the room.

67
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,120
Rym: No, you don't want that either.

68
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:35,480
Scott: All the heat from the cooling machine, the compressor goes outside the building.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,352
Rym: You don't want that either.

70
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:36,413
Rym: No?

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Rym: No.

72
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,280
Scott: Isn't that how a regular-ass air conditioner works?

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,605
Scott: No.

74
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:40,986
Scott: Wow.

75
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:41,749
Rym: I guess a lot of people.

76
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,099
Scott: So a regular-ass air conditioner, right?

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Scott: There's a compressor, just like your refrigerator.

78
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,641
Rym: Scott, the one that you put in your window when we lived in the geek house in Beacon, right?

79
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,464
Rym: Same one I had.

80
00:03:51,027 --> 00:04:01,159
Rym: The way it worked is it took air from in your room, circled it over a compressor, sorry, a condenser, and then circulated back into the room.

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,868
Scott: But all the heat goes out the outside.

82
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:13,038
Rym: Independently, it took air from the outside, ran it over the compressor where the hot side was, and then exhausted it back outside.

83
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,031
Rym: It used the outside air to just cool down the hot end of the heat pump.

84
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,664
Rym: So there's no actual air exchange with the outside.

85
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,999
Rym: For a small unit like that, that would actually be really inefficient.

86
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:24,622
Rym: Because think about it.

87
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:30,928
Rym: Either you're sucking hot air in, way hotter than the air already in your room, cooling it, and then pumping it in.

88
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,941
Rym: And if you do that, now you've got a positive pressure in your room.

89
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,606
Rym: So what are you going to do?

90
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,275
Rym: Pump your nicely new cold air back outside?

91
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,664
Rym: Pump it into the rest of the house?

92
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,071
Scott: I like it to be high pressure though.

93
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:45,284
Scott: Especially if it can like squish me against the floor.

94
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,330
Scott: Get the bends going in my room.

95
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,224
Rym: So independently, so there's all these different ways to do it.

96
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,470
Scott: Keep the dust out of my room too.

97
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:59,623
Rym: Basically, one of those units that you like put in a room that has the two hoses coming out of it, one of the hoses sucks air in, one sucks out.

98
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:04,360
Rym: It's basically as though where those two hoses go is the equivalent of outside.

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,192
Scott: Well, usually they have one hose that goes outside.

100
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,237
Rym: Usually they have two.

101
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:17,910
Rym: The ones that only have one hose either inside of that actually have two hoses or they're a negative pressure system, which has a whole different set of requirements.

102
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:36,576
Rym: So anyway, I knew all this already, but I did a little bit of Googling to confirm the best practices for air conditioning in a sealed room, which as I've mentioned on GeekNights, if you Google for that, you find pretty much nothing but idiots trying to grow marijuana in their houses, which is kind of funny.

103
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:47,736
Rym: But anyway, so I realized that what was going on, because the old SA left this node on the door that was basically like never closed the door to this room for any reason ever.

104
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:48,560
Scott: Did you close the door?

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,753
Rym: So one time an intern closed the door and the room got like a hundred degrees.

106
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:53,275
Rym: Awesome.

107
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,483
Rym: So I look, I'm like, wait a minute.

108
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,890
Rym: Why is that sign there?

109
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:01,188
Rym: Basically what they had done is they had taken two standalone air conditioners with the two hoses.

110
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:11,160
Rym: They had taken the hot end hoses and piped them into the ceiling, which is what's above the ceiling drop ceiling in a typical office building.

111
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,044
Scott: Where does that air go?

112
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,657
Scott: Once the area above the drop ceiling is filled with hot air.

113
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:15,280
Scott: Good question.

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,184
Rym: So we'll get back to that.

115
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:16,766
Rym: Okay.

116
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,212
Scott: Is there a vent up there?

117
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:19,618
Rym: So a good question.

118
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:20,481
Rym: We'll get back to that.

119
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:20,803
Scott: Okay.

120
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,614
Rym: So the intakes, there were no hoses connected.

121
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,561
Rym: They were drawing air from inside of the room.

122
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:31,584
Rym: So they were sucking air from the inside of the room over the condenser to cool it and then putting it back into the room.

123
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:39,395
Rym: They were simultaneously sucking air from the room to cool the hot end of the air conditioner and pushing it out into.

124
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,720
Rym: for now dev null.

125
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,764
Rym: Let's assume it's definitely no.

126
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,186
Scott: Okay.

127
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:49,067
Rym: This will cause a negative differential, which is why you had to keep the door open.

128
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,180
Rym: Cause otherwise basically the room would just get stagnant.

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,667
Rym: The air conditions wouldn't fucking work.

130
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,190
Scott: No.

131
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,758
Scott: So you needed air to come into the room.

132
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:54,939
Scott: Yes.

133
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,640
Rym: So, but at the same time he was sucking the cold air that he just made back out into dev null.

134
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,816
Rym: So I did a little bit of investigation and a little hint.

135
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:05,479
Rym: I'm going to move on.

136
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,193
Scott: I wanted this and go to be forever, but it worked as long as the door was open.

137
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:16,030
Rym: So I did some testing by taking a receipt because that's really light paper to figure out where the air differentials were by like holding it up to different cracks.

138
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,340
Rym: And I realized the ceiling was also just fucking open.

139
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,745
Rym: So I sealed the ceiling.

140
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:26,831
Rym: I cooked both tubes of the air conditioners from both units into the ceiling, which theoretically would be pressure neutral.

141
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,400
Rym: And then I closed the fucking door.

142
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,389
Rym: So theoretically the room would be pressure neutral.

143
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:44,740
Rym: The end result, the room is slightly pressure negative due to what appears to be a negative differential on the currently inactive air conditioning for the building that actually vents into the top of the room, which I'm not going to seal because that could cause chaos.

144
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,134
Rym: And there is a return for the air conditioners active in the ceiling.

145
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:59,309
Rym: And as far as I can tell, I have not significantly elevated the temperature in the ceiling by more than like five degrees and the air is going fucking somewhere.

146
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,017
Scott: is the, uh, is the room nice and chilly.

147
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:06,596
Rym: So now the room is nice and chilly and our air conditioners are not running 24 seven inefficiently.

148
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:10,553
Rym: I've probably saved someone a ridiculous amount of money on their electric bill.

149
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,140
Scott: What about fixing the fire?

150
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:19,190
Rym: I just took the unit that was on fire and threw it away and replaced it with the new unit that now won't catch fire because it's not a new one on Amazon.

151
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,239
Rym: It's not running horribly inefficiently.

152
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:22,323
Scott: Okay.

153
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,249
Scott: So that is my odyssey.

154
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:24,952
Rym: I did it.

155
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,584
Rym: I did the kind of thing that I used to do as a job, maybe 10 years ago.

156
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:29,407
Scott: All right.

157
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,033
Scott: I have a, I have a small tidbit here.

158
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,592
Scott: So you notice I'm wearing not jeans and a t-shirt because you're wearing khaki.

159
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,355
Rym: What the fuck?

160
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,777
Rym: Yeah.

161
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,707
Rym: The, uh, well you have your khaki killed, I guess.

162
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:44,520
Scott: So work, we were going to eat at a fancy restaurant for free.

163
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,860
Scott: So I'm not going to complain, but the restaurant had a sign that said, please dress appropriately.

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,229
Rym: You know, I'll just say this.

165
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:59,717
Rym: I have never been turned away from a restaurant for inappropriate attire, even though I have often been dressed directly against their posted rules.

166
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:04,037
Scott: This place is pretty crazy because we had a reservation for noon, which is when they opened.

167
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:05,302
Scott: We got there like 1150.

168
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:09,136
Scott: The door wasn't even open, but there are people waiting.

169
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:12,369
Scott: And then when the doors finally opened, it was like a lot of mob.

170
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:15,060
Scott: And then by the time we were done eating, the place is jam packed.

171
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:22,369
Scott: The other people at my table, my coworkers saw a famous person I never heard of and were like, Ooh, do you remember the guy's name?

172
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,616
Scott: It was some, it was some lady.

173
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,822
Rym: Do you remember the girl's name?

174
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,147
Scott: No, no idea whatsoever.

175
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:26,308
Scott: Okay.

176
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:26,970
Rym: I'm just curious.

177
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,320
Scott: A not important famous person.

178
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:36,770
Scott: But whatever the, uh, the important thing that I want to discuss here is that on the menu, I was looking at the non alcoholic beverages.

179
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,695
Scott: The, in fact, the waiters specifically mentioned in the giant book of beverages that there were non alcoholic beverages.

180
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:45,220
Scott: So besides water.

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:56,567
Scott: So I took a look and I went going down the list and it's like, Oh, you know, water, some kind of, you know, it's funny because we were just at that fancy Russian restaurant last night and they had the odd juices.

182
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,149
Scott: Yeah.

183
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,777
Scott: Well that was cucumber juice I had there.

184
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,728
Rym: Well they had the other juices too, but they were out of them.

185
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:00,989
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:04,808
Scott: But going down the list, it was like, you know, fancy, weird water.

187
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,853
Scott: They had, what's that?

188
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:08,826
Scott: The, the water that was at the Italian restaurants and Pellegrino.

189
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,027
Rym: Yeah.

190
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,896
Scott: They had San Pellegrino mixed with shit.

191
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:13,790
Rym: And they had, uh, it's just fucking seltzer mineral water.

192
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,594
Rym: It's not special.

193
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,016
Rym: Right.

194
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:21,287
Scott: And then they had, you know, all those things that you always mix with alcohol that aren't alcohol mixed together, like bitters and something else.

195
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,351
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:27,032
Rym: But then I get down to the bottom and it says you could, actually, yeah, I could make you a non alcoholic beverage.

197
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,742
Scott: I don't really want to drink any of that nasty.

198
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,264
Scott: It's awesome.

199
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,188
Rym: Bitters is not bitter.

200
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,352
Rym: It's delicious.

201
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:31,794
Scott: Whatever.

202
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:36,250
Scott: Anyway, going on the list and it just says fucking Gertschwemener juice.

203
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,618
Scott: And then it says Pinot Noir juice.

204
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,136
Scott: And I asked the guy and I'm like, is that actually just fucking wine grapes made into juice?

205
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:43,623
Scott: I didn't say fucking.

206
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,335
Scott: I was like, is that just wine grapes made into juice?

207
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:47,897
Scott: He's like, yeah.

208
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,443
Scott: I'm like, I want that right now.

209
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,647
Rym: I would drink that.

210
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,052
Scott: It was $9 a glass.

211
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,899
Scott: I know I wasn't paying for it.

212
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,350
Rym: You know, the last time I ordered wine at a restaurant, I paid $7 for my glass.

213
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,065
Rym: So it was $9 for a glass of Pinot Noir grape juice.

214
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:02,687
Rym: How was it?

215
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,664
Scott: It was freezing cold, like not ice, obviously, but like as cold as you can get.

216
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:12,844
Rym: I like how the colloquial freezing cold actually was really the wrong thing to say that it was.

217
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,332
Scott: It was basically as cold as ice water.

218
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,763
Rym: You could say it's freezing has not frozen yet.

219
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,489
Scott: It was as cold as ice water.

220
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,295
Scott: You see the bottle was condensing.

221
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:23,530
Scott: He poured it into the, you know, he treated it like it was wine.

222
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,058
Scott: He showed it to me, poured it in the glass.

223
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,765
Scott: I tasted it to make sure it wasn't ruined.

224
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:27,568
Scott: It wasn't.

225
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,281
Scott: It was pretty much the best grape juice I ever had ever.

226
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,634
Scott: So I bought a whole case of it, which is not expensive at all.

227
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:36,737
Scott: Basically.

228
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:40,328
Scott: I mean, it costs my company $9 for the eight ounces.

229
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,693
Scott: They gave me 12, maybe.

230
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:42,395
Scott: Right.

231
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:55,600
Scott: If you buy a whole case of it from the exact same place against his Navarro, which is just some seems like basically the apple, uh, the sweet apple acres of California, basically, uh, and grapes instead of apples.

232
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,312
Scott: It was basically comes out to like eight, $9 a bottle.

233
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:00,877
Rym: So it's not bad.

234
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:10,091
Rym: Like I was saying over our Twitter before the, uh, my favorite wine that I purchase on a regular basis is between eight and $12 a bottle and much less if I buy it by the case.

235
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,039
Scott: So we'll see when it shows up.

236
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,685
Scott: Apparently come, here's the thing.

237
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,376
Scott: It comes with, you know, it comes with 12 bottles.

238
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:20,776
Scott: I think five of which are the white grapes and six of which are the red grapes.

239
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:21,941
Scott: Or maybe it's the other way around.

240
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:38,635
Scott: And then they give you one bottle of verjuice or V E R J U S, which are probably pronouncing incorrectly, which is they take the unripe grapes and they squeeze them mad early and they make sort of like this really, you know, sour kind of thing.

241
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:44,014
Scott: And what you can use it for is you don't just drink that because why the fuck would you drink that?

242
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:51,201
Scott: What you do is you can use it a instead of lemon juice in pretty much anything that requires lemon juice, including lemonade.

243
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:53,046
Scott: So you can make verjuice aid.

244
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:58,843
Scott: You can also use it instead of vinegar and say something like salad dressing.

245
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,974
Scott: So, and then they had a PDF on there.

246
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,102
Rym: Use that with some salad dressing instead of vinegar.

247
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:09,320
Rym: And I put some like, ah, let's see some oranges and apples and walnuts and go cheese.

248
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:09,882
Scott: Oh yeah.

249
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:16,787
Scott: That kind of, well, I can do is I can go get that exact salad from the salad fresh coat near my work and say no dressing, bro.

250
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:18,993
Scott: I got my own.

251
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:27,142
Rym: And then, uh, they got to have walnuts and feta on their website, like a goat cheese with like a little bit of lavender in it on their website.

252
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:31,878
Scott: They have a PDF of recipes where you can use verjuice as the ingredient.

253
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:32,761
Scott: It's like the very juice.

254
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,011
Scott: like PDF has a ton of fucking recipes to a lot of them.

255
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,864
Scott: So, uh, I'm a big fan of this, a fancy juice.

256
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:49,496
Scott: And I think I'm going to start, maybe I'm going to try to find or maybe start my own juice from the fancy bottles on poison.

257
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:54,095
Rym: You're going to get to hear the things I've had to hear from you for the last like 10 years about my wine.

258
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,059
Scott: You know what I mean?

259
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,687
Rym: You're spending $9 a bottle in grape juice.

260
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,212
Rym: Ketim's a dollar 50.

261
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,038
Scott: Ketim doesn't taste very good.

262
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,981
Rym: Oh, oh.

263
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,310
Rym: So you're saying that the more expensive one tastes better.

264
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,193
Scott: No, it's.

265
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:09,751
Scott: it's that these are the reason it's expensive is not because it's better.

266
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:18,883
Scott: It is because they could have turned these grapes into wine and at least wine that I only pay $8 a bottle for instead of the $9 a bottle you're paying for this juice.

267
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,874
Scott: Uh, well, no, their wine is $20 a bottle.

268
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:26,906
Rym: So they could, they could have, I can get higher rated wine for less money.

269
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,692
Scott: They could have doubled the value.

270
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:31,762
Scott: That's the exact wine.

271
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,167
Rym: The Wilm one is the one I drink.

272
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,476
Rym: I bought it for as low as $7 a bottle.

273
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:35,938
Rym: Yeah.

274
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,511
Scott: But this, they sell it for 20 so they could double.

275
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:45,220
Scott: from their perspective, regardless of if you're getting better wine than they make and who knows how good theirs is because I haven't tasted it.

276
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,022
Scott: Right.

277
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:52,265
Scott: Uh, they could double the value of those grapes by letting them sit around and turn into wine, but they choose not to.

278
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:53,891
Scott: So there you go.

279
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,453
Scott: Not bad.

280
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:57,082
Scott: Which benefits me not wanting to drink poison.

281
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:57,905
Rym: So it's Monday.

282
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:58,748
Rym: It's not the lounge.

283
00:14:58,768 --> 00:14:59,491
Rym: You got any news?

284
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:00,917
Scott: Do I have a news?

285
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:01,640
Scott: I do indeed.

286
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:41,101
Scott: I've been working, I guess, you know, one of my many half actually way less than 1% finished projects is sort of the ultimate backup, save your ass thing where basically you'll set up like get input from Twitter, get input from flicker backup to S3, backup to my hard drive, you know, basically something that will download and rescue all your files and wherever cloud services or local sources they may be on and then back them up and whatever places they need to back up to synchronize your blog posts, tweets, photos, videos, all your data's documents in all the places.

287
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,205
Scott: So you can't be fucked.

288
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:48,548
Scott: Uh, so Twitter, the problem with them is that, yeah, you can sort of back up your tweets for a while.

289
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:53,809
Scott: I was using this one website that would read your tweets every day and then sort of put them in, you know, files.

290
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:59,388
Scott: Um, but that sort of needed to be constantly running and reading your tweets all the time.

291
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:07,055
Scott: Twitter is finally coming out with something delicious has had for a long time, which is download all your tweets ever.

292
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:17,111
Rym: Now this is actually kind of interesting because Twitter has been in pissing matches with pretty much everyone over their APIs and data access and agreements.

293
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:21,046
Scott: Well, Twitter doesn't want to let people access every tweet ever, right?

294
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,617
Scott: Is this is all about you access your own exactly.

295
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:37,508
Rym: But for example, like recently they got into a thing where they, they won't let you have like an embedded link anymore with Instagram because they don't want people to, you know, Instagram shows not to do that because Facebook bought Instagram.

296
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:40,899
Scott: So that's one of those, he said, she said battles.

297
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,726
Scott: We don't know who's good, who's bad.

298
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:50,011
Rym: The gist of it is that basically all these services like this that are not federated are trying to monetize.

299
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:54,928
Rym: And the only way they can monetize is to make sure that people have to use them and their stuff.

300
00:16:55,169 --> 00:17:00,404
Rym: They can't just go to like Tumblr, but also see everyone's tweets, which fuck them.

301
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:02,150
Rym: But that's a separate show for a separate day.

302
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:04,963
Scott: Yeah.

303
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,945
Scott: But this is really interesting because I actually seem to have a really good interface for looking at all your tweets.

304
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:13,325
Scott: And it's also going to be really interesting once people have access to their own old tweets.

305
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:19,303
Scott: If anyone like voluntarily combines their tweets together for data purposes.

306
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:25,424
Scott: or be what kind of interesting things people discover from analyzing their own past tweets.

307
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:30,830
Rym: You know, I'm going to try to, we should come up with a program that makes it very easy for you to download your archive and then say, boop.

308
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,295
Rym: And now it's all public again.

309
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:37,114
Rym: Someone else can aggregate it and recreate effectively all of Twitter.

310
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,585
Scott: We can make a website like upload your Twitter archive here.

311
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:44,126
Scott: Uh, but no, I'm going to try to make something that does really simple stuff that will be entertaining.

312
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:49,811
Scott: Like count the number of times you said, fuck, count the number of times you added who's, who did you at the most?

313
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,578
Scott: count the number of times I did that.

314
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,064
Scott: There's that retweet the most.

315
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:56,297
Rym: There's that one nice, uh, website, not the scammy one.

316
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,968
Rym: That'll do it like the pseudo analysis of your Twitter feed.

317
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:06,884
Scott: This is going to do just, you know, that kind of boring non-scientific stuff like count the number of times, you know, which word did you tweet the most often?

318
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,853
Scott: And you know, this thing is things like that.

319
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,309
Scott: They don't mean anything, but they're really kind of interesting and people love that shit.

320
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:21,632
Scott: So being able to download all your tweets, you know, drag them into this program, click a button and get that information, get a JPEG or something that you can just put on a website somewhere.

321
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,220
Rym: So, you know, somewhat related to that.

322
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:26,112
Rym: There is a, an article on slash dot right now.

323
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:30,267
Rym: that is, I kind of want to talk about this as a show, so we'll go briefly.

324
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:32,313
Rym: It's called the web we lost.

325
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:33,015
Scott: Okay.

326
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:34,821
Scott: I did see links to this article everywhere.

327
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:48,659
Rym: In the early days of, you know, web 2.0 back when there was 2.0, not so early days when there was a web 2.0 as in there was an internet of web rings and static content.

328
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,391
Rym: And then the idea of, you know, modern interactivity appeared.

329
00:18:53,033 --> 00:19:00,120
Rym: People were, you know, sharing things between websites and embedding data in websites and the first social networks were arising.

330
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,671
Rym: And that was a really open world in terms of data.

331
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,316
Rym: The data was accepted.

332
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:12,422
Rym: You're basically every website wanted to make your data as open and accessible as possible and shared as much as possible.

333
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,874
Scott: Cause that was the hot was how you got popular, right?

334
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,160
Scott: How did Twitter become popular?

335
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,260
Scott: in?

336
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:16,944
Scott: oh seven?

337
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:21,885
Scott: by having an API where you could do whatever the fuck you wanted with tweets or posting to tweets.

338
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,897
Rym: But now, so web 2.0 evolved and evolved and evolved.

339
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:28,593
Rym: And now there's the big debate over what and when and where the web 3.0 will be.

340
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:36,738
Rym: And you know, but basically argues that everything we gained in web 2.0 is it's not gone yet, but it's rapidly disappearing.

341
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,024
Scott: Everyone's locking down their APIs.

342
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:49,396
Rym: We went from a federated model back to a sole provider walled garden model with all these pissing matches between the few people who provide this stuff.

343
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:55,120
Rym: So instead of every website having its own little like federated, follow me back, yo, Tumblr has its one thing.

344
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,425
Rym: Twitter has its other thing.

345
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,717
Rym: Everyone fights to monetize and won't let you connect.

346
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,228
Rym: And he's basically saying that we need to stop this.

347
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:02,876
Scott: It'll happen eventually.

348
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,041
Scott: This is what always happens, right?

349
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:08,997
Scott: Is that every, you know, anything that's low and not strong goes open.

350
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:13,980
Scott: and by going open, they become strong, but because they're open, they can't make any goddamn money.

351
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,371
Scott: Except with advertising, but, uh, right.

352
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,320
Scott: It's cause it's too free and too open.

353
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,645
Scott: They can't make any money.

354
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:24,954
Scott: And even if they put ads in the, if the ads get too bad, everyone will just bail with their data and go somewhere else.

355
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,040
Scott: It's open and has no ads.

356
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,531
Scott: And they'll keep moving to the no ad place over and over.

357
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:28,711
Scott: Right?

358
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:30,339
Scott: So what do they do?

359
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,077
Scott: They start to lock down and people will tolerate it cause you gradually do it.

360
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,583
Scott: If you did it all at once, people like, fuck that.

361
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:44,171
Scott: But they do it gradually and slowly closing it up, closing it up, no systems slip through their fingers.

362
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:47,705
Rym: And then it does this back in the day, let's talk nineties.

363
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:53,333
Scott: in the nineties when things like the CDT, I mean, do you want to talk about the original burners leeway?

364
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,600
Scott: Every page is Wikipedia.

365
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:56,124
Rym: No, I do.

366
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,168
Rym: But now right now, okay.

367
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:18,455
Rym: So I remember in the nineties when I really got into encryption and you know, things like, you know, before waste even like using PGP and PGP phone and, you know, tempest and protection and all that crazy bullshit was because back then really like the main operating systems you have had access to were pretty locked down.

368
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:28,855
Rym: And there was a fear, especially with CDB TPA type type stuff coming down the pipe that the governments of the world might actually crack down on computers and get to the middle earlier.

369
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:30,903
Rym: So nerd people were like, Oh fuck.

370
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:36,809
Rym: And there was a big explosion of interest in Linux and encryption and all this stuff that drove a lot of cool things later on down the road.

371
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,320
Rym: And now, I mean, I use windows for everything.

372
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,933
Rym: I've gone back to all those worlds because things are pretty safe.

373
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:46,888
Rym: But on the far off horizon now, we're seeing the slow lockdown happen again.

374
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:55,383
Rym: And I think it'll hit a crisis point where the nerds like us are already looking ahead toward the federated models to replace Twitter when Twitter finally fucks.

375
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,046
Scott: Well, we did that.

376
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,277
Scott: People saw that immediately with the Konica.

377
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,964
Scott: They just did a shitty ass job.

378
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:03,697
Rym: But I think there is a place for a federated replacement to Twitter.

379
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:12,809
Rym: And I think if they keep cracking down on their APIs and they keep locking themselves up, nerds are going to move on to something new like nerds always do.

380
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:18,171
Scott: I mean, Google plus isn't really failing, but it's not really taking off and not yet killing the world either.

381
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,743
Scott: But then again, I see Google plus right now.

382
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:22,634
Scott: I'm not saying this is a locked in prediction.

383
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:34,936
Scott: I don't have a lot of confidence in this, but it sort of feels, you know, Google plus right now feels the way Google chat did early on where a few peep cool people are using that instead of, say, aim.

384
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,561
Rym: I'm trying to use it more and more.

385
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:37,204
Scott: Right.

386
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:41,237
Scott: And but everyone else is still using aim and MSN and Yahoo.

387
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,903
Scott: But a few cool people are using Google plus.

388
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:51,432
Scott: But meanwhile, nowadays, Google chat went from being that sort of other instant messaging thing that only a few people use to being the one.

389
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:54,784
Scott: And aim is dead and ICQ is dead and MSN is dead.

390
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:55,466
Scott: And then Yahoo's.

391
00:22:55,486 --> 00:23:02,213
Scott: So maybe Google plus will follow the same path and kill Twitter and Facebook, possibly not saying it's for sure.

392
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:08,220
Scott: I'm just saying that's what it feels like, because I have the same feels using Google plus that I had using Google chat in the early days.

393
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,661
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:12,898
Rym: But so talking about free stuff and ads, I don't want to talk about this.

395
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,043
Rym: There's an article that's pretty awesome.

396
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:20,454
Rym: Basically, everyone's rumbling about our ad blocking things going to be made illegal and or will there be lawsuits again?

397
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:24,468
Rym: You're going to the main bit again, which is going to be relevant to the main bit.

398
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:31,113
Rym: But I just want to point out this is this issue was an issue in the nineties and it disappeared.

399
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:33,843
Rym: All the nerds was like, yeah, I just block every ad no matter what.

400
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:34,546
Rym: Fuck you guys.

401
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:34,989
Rym: That's right.

402
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,702
Rym: And normal people are slowly learning to block ads, but it wasn't.

403
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:38,988
Rym: It's not enough for majority of matter.

404
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,887
Rym: But now suddenly there's rumblings of the ethical question and the legal question.

405
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:47,320
Scott: Again, we already had this discussion the first time.

406
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,505
Rym: So we had this discussion.

407
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:49,269
Rym: It was done.

408
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,148
Rym: The answer was if data's on the internet, I can do whatever I want with it.

409
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,200
Rym: I'm the one who controls the display side.

410
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,766
Scott: My computer sent you some bits.

411
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,336
Scott: Your computer willingly sent me some bits.

412
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,269
Scott: I can do what my computer does with those bits is up to me.

413
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,194
Rym: Now, the reason the argument is going to be different this time is because phones are pretty locked down.

414
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,220
Rym: They are and much harder are going to be.

415
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,822
Rym: I mean, already I can't block ads, at least the kinds of ads they're slipping into the stream on my phone.

416
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:21,240
Rym: And as a result, I'm using my phone for fewer and fewer things where an ad could appear.

417
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,291
Scott: Well, this is, you know, this is the free software, you know, like the, you know, the Richard Stallman situation, right?

418
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,175
Scott: I have a computer.

419
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,120
Scott: It's my phone.

420
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,774
Scott: It does things with bits that I did not tell it to do.

421
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:38,591
Scott: I wanted to do something with those bits, but I can't make it do that because it's all closed.

422
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,542
Scott: Therefore, it shows me ads when I don't want to see him.

423
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:46,948
Rym: So we won't have that argument, but just remember this is, this is burning on the horizon and it's going to come.

424
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:47,954
Rym: And you know what's going to happen?

425
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,809
Rym: The same thing that happened before nerds will block ads.

426
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,984
Rym: No one else will be able to, and eventually the nerds will make it easy for normal people.

427
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,830
Rym: And then the cycle will repeat.

428
00:24:56,172 --> 00:25:04,518
Rym: The question is, will the advertising industry as a whole collapse before this next round or not, which I'm, I give it a 30% shot.

429
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:12,199
Scott: So I think, you know, we just, as the fundamental problem of the world has discussions, right?

430
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,548
Scott: It's like someone was just born just now.

431
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,175
Scott: They haven't seen the Godfather.

432
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:18,504
Scott: They also have never had an argument about copyright.

433
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:23,006
Rym: They've also never seen a world where the TSA doesn't touch my genitalia to let me get on a plane.

434
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:23,268
Scott: Right.

435
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:29,158
Scott: But that discussion of copyright for that new person will happen again, just like they will see the Godfather having never seen it.

436
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:31,065
Scott: They will have that discussion having never had it.

437
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:44,133
Scott: And every discussion that we, that we don't solve once and for all, such that there is no one complaining about it, will repeat the same points over and over again with no new points discovered, except for science.

438
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,886
Rym: Jon Stewart made a really funny science.

439
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:48,131
Scott: There'll be nothing new to say.

440
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:53,780
Rym: There's a recent daily show where he was like, you talked about the fact that the SCOTUS is taking up the two gay rights cases on marriage.

441
00:25:54,362 --> 00:26:00,183
Rym: And he's like, finally, the Supreme court is going to answer whether or not gays getting married is a fundamental right.

442
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:04,174
Rym: Because when they ruled on abortion, that ended the argument.

443
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:12,936
Scott: No argument doesn't end when the Supreme court says it, it ends when you know, old people die.

444
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:13,438
Scott: Yes.

445
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:13,759
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:22,716
Rym: So to, to segue into the main bit that someone proposed a pretty interesting answer to this whole thing, the ad thing, uh, basically everything we just talked about.

447
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:23,157
Rym: Okay.

448
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,732
Rym: The question is, is the flicker API, a national treasure?

449
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:29,899
Scott: What, what is the language?

450
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,385
Scott: I mean, do you want to talk legally here?

451
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:36,024
Scott: Or do you want to talk ethically, morally, uh, open API, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

452
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,603
Rym: Worried that the possibility of Yahoo might do the same thing with flipper API's.

453
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:45,304
Scott: Some guy named Dave Weiner just launched a, Dave Weiner is the guy who invented a podcast.

454
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:48,254
Rym: Basically he launched one of those petitions to Obama.

455
00:26:48,595 --> 00:27:01,320
Rym: He's asking that the federal government through the national historic landmark act declared the API to flicker as it currently exists, a national historic landmark, meaning it cannot be fucked with by anyone, even flicker.

456
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,203
Rym: And they have to maintain it.

457
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,999
Scott: That is a really liquor goes out of business.

458
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:11,340
Rym: If I was government would get control of it and have to maintain it with tax money.

459
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,273
Scott: If I was Yahoo, I'd be like, fine, take it.

460
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:15,177
Scott: We don't have to pay for it anymore.

461
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:15,298
Scott: Woo.

462
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,381
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,447
Scott: There goes all our costs.

464
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:18,009
Rym: But you know what?

465
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:29,026
Rym: At the same time, think about if the guy, think about the idea that data that is out there on the internet can be a landmark, just like some crappy old farmhouse can be a landmark.

466
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:37,165
Scott: Well then maybe we should have the language of the law.

467
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:40,120
Scott: What does the thing have to be to be a landmark?

468
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,767
Rym: Do you really think I know that?

469
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,860
Scott: Does it say in the article that you're reading?

470
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,187
Scott: Then you're not being very helpful.

471
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:49,028
Rym: Do you want me to be a journalist or you want me to read this whole thing?

472
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,420
Rym: Uh, it's gonna take too long.

473
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,929
Rym: So let's just move right on to things of the day.

474
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,340
Rym: A friend of mine, a coworker showed me this.

475
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,366
Rym: It was pretty hilarious.

476
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,580
Rym: I promised him I would make it a thing of the day on GeekNights.

477
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,966
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

478
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:18,180
Rym: I'm, I am 50 50 on whether or not it is a legit thing that happened or if it is a stage thing from some sort of like comedy skit show.

479
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,180
Scott: I did see the same video and I wasn't totally sure what was going on.

480
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:32,560
Rym: It's hard now because in the modern era, like especially in Brazil, security cameras are HD, so it's not that far out of the realm that the video quality would be this high.

481
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:36,880
Rym: But I was in Sao Paulo not that long ago and yeah, crime is off the hook.

482
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,927
Rym: This is a video of a dude who allegedly parks his car and breaks into a clinic to steal some drugs while he's robbing the clinic.

483
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,197
Rym: Someone steals his car while he's outgoing.

484
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:47,162
Rym: What the fuck happened to my car?

485
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:48,832
Rym: Someone else mugs him and steals the drugs.

486
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,080
Scott: Well, it doesn't really mug him.

487
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,689
Scott: They just sort of grab the drugs and run.

488
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,560
Rym: basically purse snatches the guy's drugs.

489
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,004
Rym: Yeah, it is.

490
00:28:55,485 --> 00:29:01,143
Rym: If this is true, this is one of the funniest pieces of poetic justice the world has ever seen.

491
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:07,792
Rym: And if it's not true, it's actually still pretty funny just because the look in the guy's face at the end, he's like, what the fuck?

492
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,177
Scott: He got what he deserves.

493
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:12,688
Scott: He can't feel bad for him, but it's like, eh, anyway.

494
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:19,171
Scott: So, you know, a lot of times when you cook something, you got to separate the egg yolk and the cooking by the book.

495
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:19,674
Scott: All right.

496
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:24,374
Scott: You take, you open up an egg and out comes a yolk and a white crack, crack, crack the egg into the baby.

497
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:25,237
Scott: Just right.

498
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:30,161
Scott: If you, and usually the way I separate the egg and the white is usually the way I see people on cooking shows do it.

499
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:31,446
Rym: I hit X, X, X.

500
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:34,819
Scott: Now you pour the yolk back and forth between the two egg shells.

501
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,963
Rym: You never played Parappa the Rapper?

502
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,087
Scott: I know about it.

503
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:37,468
Scott: Okay.

504
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:44,215
Scott: So you, uh, you pour the egg yolk back and forth between the two shells while the white part does not pour back.

505
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:45,280
Rym: You mean like Spike Spiegel does?

506
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,761
Scott: Yes.

507
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:50,984
Scott: And the white part just sort of droops down into the bowl until only you have left in the shell is the yolk.

508
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:52,912
Scott: And then you can do it with either part.

509
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:53,454
Scott: what you like.

510
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:54,599
Scott: That is the method.

511
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,104
Scott: I see most people do that.

512
00:29:56,144 --> 00:30:03,664
Scott: I also do in this video, some awesome Australian dude shows you a far superior method.

513
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:10,282
Scott: What he does is watch the video and find out, Holy shit, I got to do this for now on.

514
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:16,546
Rym: I think a better thing to do is to make a device that purports to do this and sell it for 20 bucks as seen on TV.

515
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,390
Scott: You'd make at least 1 million.

516
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,635
Scott: Does it patent that shit?

517
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:28,283
Scott: So in the moment this video count as prior art, if I patented that, uh, they'd have to find it as prior art.

518
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:29,849
Scott: Uh, maybe, I don't know.

519
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:38,601
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book, which we're not going to get to until sometime quarter one next year is the great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald famous book.

520
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:39,264
Rym: I've never read it.

521
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:42,216
Rym: I feel dumb and lacking for having not read it.

522
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:45,168
Rym: It's like a big gaping hole in my list of famous books.

523
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,115
Rym: I have plenty of other famous books.

524
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,982
Scott: You have never named another famous book.

525
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:49,705
Scott: I haven't read that.

526
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,150
Scott: You've never read, never read.

527
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,053
Rym: Okay.

528
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,542
Rym: Mr's never read or seen Macbeth.

529
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,492
Scott: Have you read a tree grows in Brooklyn?

530
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,218
Rym: Uh, actually, no, I haven't.

531
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,523
Scott: Well, there's a famous book you haven't read.

532
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,587
Scott: That was easy.

533
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:02,150
Scott: First one.

534
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,596
Rym: I think that's worse than Macbeth.

535
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:04,460
Scott: I don't know.

536
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,187
Scott: I'm not saying it is, or is it?

537
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,572
Scott: I'm saying it's eat.

538
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,038
Scott: There are lots of famous books.

539
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:15,502
Scott: I don't think there's anyone on earth who's read all the Epic famous classic books because there are just so many.

540
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:27,914
Rym: So anyway, a kinetic con, the everything convention that we, uh, run the panels and workshops and special events department for, and I have for many years in Connecticut, Hartford in July is a long way out, but it's a long way away.

541
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:29,020
Scott: Why are we talking about it now?

542
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:38,075
Rym: Well, Scott, because panel submissions, lecture submissions, workshop submissions are open and we're going to start scheduling shit and the next month.

543
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,887
Rym: So if you want to do something, submit your shit now.

544
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,371
Scott: Ooh, yeah.

545
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:48,655
Rym: We're so far ahead of the game that I'm assuming something horrible is going to happen to ruin all of this for us.

546
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:54,740
Scott: The only other convention we need to talk about is the one that is impending quickly less than a month away.

547
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:04,798
Scott: The weekend after new year's magfest 11 balls, balls, balls, balls of steel.

548
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:13,460
Scott: This is for nonstop days of gaming, gaming, gaming concerts, concerts, concerts related to gaming.

549
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:17,571
Scott: The lineup of musical acts is unbelievable.

550
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:19,556
Scott: Last year, no boo.

551
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:20,639
Scott: How could you top that?

552
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:20,920
Scott: Right?

553
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,209
Scott: Some of the best video game musics there ever was.

554
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:31,098
Rym: Even if a lot of the final fantasy games are boring, I have a video upload of no boo doing the Colossus for our back to the audience.

555
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,648
Scott: The music has never been bad in any final fantasy that I know of.

556
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:40,666
Scott: So how could they top that with also the best video game music ever?

557
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:44,661
Scott: I don't remember the guy's name, the guy who did the streets of rage music.

558
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,964
Scott: Oh my God.

559
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,086
Scott: Oh my God.

560
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:53,179
Scott: Not to mention every nerd chord chip tune video game metal band.

561
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:56,747
Scott: Never ever heard of or cared about.

562
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:05,891
Rym: Nevermind the football field of arcade machines open 24 seven ridiculous just land party of counter-strike all night.

563
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:08,860
Scott: You want to play initial D at 4 a.m.

564
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,662
Rym: Well, you can't because there's two guys are going to sit at that machine Thursday morning through Sunday night.

565
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:16,815
Scott: But if you want to play dig dug at 4 a.m, it's game on.

566
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:22,834
Rym: We are going to be there doing three panels all on Friday, all in a row on fly Friday.

567
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:36,034
Scott: And we're going to spend Saturday, Saturday night, Thursday, Thursday night, late Friday, Friday night, and Sunday until we leave playing games, games, games, games, games, maybe a concert.

568
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:36,937
Scott: games, games, games.

569
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:46,380
Rym: If you want to meet Rym, having just played a five hour game of eclipse and then drunk himself into a stupor, wondering around another five hour game of eclipse, wandering around and playing dig dug.

570
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:47,785
Rym: That is your chance.

571
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,615
Scott: Also playing net runner like 20 times in a row.

572
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:51,278
Rym: Oh my God.

573
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:51,840
Rym: And infiltration.

574
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,663
Rym: I'm bringing that shit.

575
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:53,830
Scott: Oh, we're bringing all the shit.

576
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,097
Scott: I got two new games too.

577
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:55,700
Rym: We got it.

578
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,365
Rym: We got a rash castles of burgundy.

579
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,628
Scott: I got dominant species.

580
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:03,142
Scott: So two top tier board game geek list games.

581
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:04,045
Scott: I never played before.

582
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:05,350
Scott: I just bought them big sale.

583
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,475
Scott: All right.

584
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:12,583
Scott: And you should go on the internet and find us in all the places we live on the internet and follow us and subscribe and newsletter.

585
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:17,420
Rym: I'm going to send out maybe we, uh, we have more episodes of GeekNights presents.

586
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,074
Rym: However, uh, due to a hardware failure, we might have to rerecord one of them.

587
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:21,897
Scott: Oh no.

588
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:23,141
Rym: So I gotta, I gotta do some.

589
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:23,523
Rym: look in that.

590
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:30,956
Rym: But if you want us to release GeekNights presents faster, share that shit around, unless it gets tens of thousands of views.

591
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:31,438
Rym: I'm doing it.

592
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,532
Rym: And Scott's doing it as we damn well feel like.

593
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:34,732
Rym: Yeah.

594
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:41,405
Scott: I mean, in general, we have this YouTube, we've been trying to break into the world of video cause podcasts, not so hot videos, pretty hot right now.

595
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:44,620
Scott: We're not that good at it, but we're practicing and getting better.

596
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,731
Rym: So if you like our video stuff, share it because unless it starts getting a lot of views, we're not going to speed up the release cycle.

597
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:51,132
Rym: Yeah.

598
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:55,092
Scott: It's like, if you want us to do more, you got to watch it and get other people to watch it.

599
00:34:55,172 --> 00:35:00,960
Scott: And we got to see the numbers go up and then we will have an incentive to make more and see if the numbers go up.

600
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,720
Rym: So yo dogs post that shit on Reddit because I can't cause I'll get downvoted for self-promotion.

601
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:06,201
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:08,166
Rym: All right.

603
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:08,688
Rym: All right.

604
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:20,710
Rym: So internet governance don't want to talk about the details of the votes that just happened and all that complicated bullshit because the general question is actually something that there isn't a good answer for.

605
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,920
Rym: So the general case is worth discussing.

606
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,786
Scott: Who's the governor of the internet.

607
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:24,986
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:36,726
Rym: Who will, who decides who gets what IP address, who decides where the routers go, who pays for the transatlantic cable between like Australia and New Zealand?

609
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,516
Scott: Those are all different questions with different answers.

610
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,782
Scott: Why don't we stick with one at a time?

611
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:40,525
Scott: All right.

612
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,451
Rym: So don't DNS.

613
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:43,595
Rym: who controls that?

614
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,924
Rym: What if one country wants to do something different?

615
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,860
Rym: What if Venezuela is mad about their TLD and they want a different one?

616
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,944
Rym: Who do they complain to?

617
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:53,072
Scott: Well, here's the way it works right now, right?

618
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:59,758
Scott: Is anyone who owns a computer or hardware device can do whatever they wish with that device, right?

619
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:05,442
Scott: So if I'm some country, you know, and, uh, there's some internet, so I have to be connected to other countries.

620
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:10,224
Scott: Otherwise it's just going to be a big land and not an internet or it'll be on internet, but not the internet.

621
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:11,930
Scott: And it's just in my country.

622
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,809
Scott: I want some other country too, because you know, right now the world is governed by countries.

623
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,992
Scott: So their law still stands for a lot of things, especially physical devices and physical locations.

624
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,960
Scott: who owns them, who is allowed to do things with them.

625
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,126
Scott: It's property law, right?

626
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:26,230
Scott: I own this computer.

627
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,383
Scott: I can make it do with bits, whatever I want it to do.

628
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:32,213
Scott: That's legal, you know, in this country to do with it.

629
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:35,885
Scott: So, but my country wants to connect with another country.

630
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:47,633
Rym: So we need some sort of agreement between us to have this cable go and maybe that agreement often will be between, for example, two private entities that are high level to like, you know, high tier service providers.

631
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:47,794
Rym: Yeah.

632
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:59,555
Scott: And it's, you know, a lot of the same laws that are involved with say importer exporter will be involved in the cable going from chips us to exactly with the cable going from us to Canada.

633
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:04,052
Scott: You know, let's say it goes from sprint to Canadian phone company.

634
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:05,799
Scott: I don't know the name of right.

635
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,546
Scott: You know, those companies work it out.

636
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,726
Scott: There's some laws involving, you know, who's defending the cable in times of war, I guess.

637
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:12,107
Scott: I don't know.

638
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,719
Scott: And they set it up and now they're sending bits.

639
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:31,817
Scott: Well, what if Canada decides to make a law that they're going to do bits different, like reverse bits, the U S side either has to also do reverse bits or say flip, reverse all the bits going to Canada or coming from Canada or just say, fuck you Canada.

640
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:34,450
Scott: You're not doing things the way we do them and the way everyone else does them.

641
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,866
Scott: So we're just going to cut your ass off and we're not going to accept your bits anymore.

642
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:42,684
Rym: Now, the reality is that the United States basically invented the internet.

643
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:45,539
Rym: It's like the last great thing we as a country spent tax dollars on.

644
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,850
Scott: And we say the way the bits are going to go.

645
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,571
Scott: And if someone doesn't make their bits go the way our bids go, they just don't have any working internet.

646
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:57,830
Rym: Basically right now, the U S department of effectively has control over the internet.

647
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:01,122
Rym: And while a lot of other countries might say they can control.

648
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:09,822
Rym: like China kind of has walled themselves off from the internet, a lot of other restrictive and or horrible countries have walled themselves off or attempted to wall themselves off.

649
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:20,820
Rym: North Korea doesn't really appear to have an internet, but the fact remains that the vast majority of pretty much everything is in the sphere of influence of the United States.

650
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,140
Rym: And we have hitherto basically told the entire rest of the world to go fuck themselves.

651
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,680
Scott: Good.

652
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:30,998
Scott: Now at the same time, not really good because, you know, even though I'm a U?

653
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,926
Scott: S person, I live here, I was born here.

654
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:33,448
Scott: I've been here.

655
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:37,726
Scott: the over and over 99% of my life has been spent in this country, right?

656
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,156
Scott: I'm not always the biggest fan of this country.

657
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,482
Scott: We complain about it all the time.

658
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:45,421
Scott: Every country has a lot of bad shit and ours notwithstanding, we get a lot of bad shit here.

659
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:51,603
Rym: So we just had a huge mass shooting and the country flipped out about how we shouldn't talk about it.

660
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:51,964
Scott: Yeah.

661
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:57,287
Scott: Anyway, well, we've got a situation where, you know, should we really be in charge of this internet?

662
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,400
Rym: Our Congress can't figure out if they're going to pay back money.

663
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,666
Rym: They already borrowed, right?

664
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:09,343
Scott: This internet is something that is important to the whole world, even though we invented it, or at least most of it, it is not something that really belongs to us entirely.

665
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:12,514
Scott: It's something that the entire world has a huge stake in.

666
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:18,899
Scott: So for one country to control it and do things in its own interest, you can see how that's not exactly fair or right.

667
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,133
Scott: We could fuck over all these other countries and be evil in many ways.

668
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,182
Scott: And I, we recognize that that is not cool.

669
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:24,463
Rym: Yes.

670
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:32,676
Rym: Now at the same time, and this is why, you know, when it comes to politics, I take very nuanced and sometimes complicated positions and shows it.

671
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:46,895
Rym: So does Scott on most issues, but people would consider me perhaps left wing, liberal, radical, you know, but, uh, I'm actually very effectively right wing on the issue of internet governance.

672
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:56,434
Rym: I'm of the mind that the United States government should maintain its effective control over internet governance and furthermore should defend that if necessary with military force.

673
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:57,036
Scott: Yeah.

674
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:59,024
Scott: And because basically here's the situation, right?

675
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:07,198
Scott: It would be nice as I just said, if the whole world could come together to govern the internet in unison, the United nations, why don't we have them?

676
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:17,016
Scott: And we could work together for everyone's interest in the internet and not just have the internet be serving of the U S and basically all these other countries while dependent on the internets.

677
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:29,841
Scott: Um, basically under our foot and basically needing, you know, us so badly because we run the show, it's not fair to them to not be able to have any control or say in this thing that is so important to them.

678
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:42,782
Scott: It's because up until now, if you look at reality, anything, the other countries of the world have wanted to do with the internet, if they had the power to do so are stupid things that they shouldn't do.

679
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:53,160
Rym: It basically is true that with a few exceptions, despite all the bullshit that goes on in the U S our freedom of speech is one of the few things that we really have going for us.

680
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:02,749
Rym: And unless copyright is involved, you can basically post anything, but the vast majority of the rest of the world would rather that not be the case.

681
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:19,661
Rym: And if we let the United nations control the internet to the degree that many of its members now would like the people who are pushing for that, the more the most seem to be the countries that actually want to straight up restrict the thing the internet is the best at, which is sharing information in an unfettered manner.

682
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:26,042
Scott: The other thing is that a lot of these countries, you know, they view the internet as the web.

683
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:28,394
Scott: They don't have a technological view of it, right?

684
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:32,091
Scott: They're viewing like this surface level crap because they don't have a technological understanding.

685
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,145
Scott: They're politicians and diplomats and those sorts of people.

686
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:38,561
Scott: They don't, you know, most, almost all of them do not understand technology.

687
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:47,865
Scott: So the things they want to do for purposes of censorship or spying or commerce or whatever they're, you know, all tear.

688
00:41:47,945 --> 00:42:00,883
Scott: your old world motives are most likely most of those things will ruin the internet technologically and bit wise and performance wise and reliability wise and security wise.

689
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:05,296
Scott: And we cannot let any of those things happen for those reasons.

690
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:13,570
Scott: And you know, if there was some sort of elite panel of, you know, amazing technology, people who are going to run the internet, that would be totally chill.

691
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:21,863
Rym: But now we've got a bunch of countries who want to basically make it illegal to blaspheme on the internet or to restrict things like Australia or Britain does.

692
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:25,737
Rym: And we just, the one thing we've got going for us is free speech.

693
00:42:26,058 --> 00:42:29,190
Rym: And the other thing is that we've actually managed the internet pretty well.

694
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,853
Rym: Yeah.

695
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:46,548
Scott: I mean, if you look, even though the US has done many things wrong up until now, at least, and so far no evidence of badness in the future, the things the US government has wanted and declared for the internet to do have mostly been good and the right thing to do.

696
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:51,865
Scott: And mostly in good, been better than anything any other country would have done if they were in charge.

697
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,313
Scott: So not going to complain yet.

698
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:58,829
Scott: If it has to be one country, this one has done a good job so far.

699
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:03,344
Scott: Let's stick with it until we can't stick with it anymore and then figure something else out.

700
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:08,622
Rym: So very recently is kind of an example of how this is making it to the news.

701
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:16,716
Rym: And it's interesting because most of the news coverage around this doesn't really even explain what, because journalists don't know anything about technology either.

702
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:25,470
Rym: So the ITU is a part of the United Nations that manages things like telecommunications between countries, like long distance phone calls and all that stuff.

703
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:25,691
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,800
Scott: It's a very old organization.

705
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,850
Scott: And for things like phone calls, it worked pretty well.

706
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:38,920
Rym: So the United States, there was a treaty that was put forth that would expand part of the ITU's purview to cover some internet things.

707
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:45,939
Rym: And US ambassador Terry Kramer basically told everyone, yeah, we're not signing it.

708
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,828
Rym: And he gave a really good speech as to why.

709
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,637
Rym: And I want to read the relevant quote here.

710
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:58,349
Rym: Quote, "The internet has given the world unimaginable economic and social benefits during these past 24 years, all without UN regulation.

711
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:04,371
Rym: We candidly cannot support an ITU treaty that is inconsistent with a multi-stakeholder model of internet governance.

712
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:13,474
Rym: These past two weeks, we have of course made good progress and shown willingness to negotiate on a variety of telecommunications policy issues, such as roaming and settlement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

713
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:18,260
Rym: But the United States continues to believe that internet policy must be multi-stakeholder driven.

714
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:25,125
Rym: Internet policy should not be determined by member states, but by citizens, communities, and the broader society.

715
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:29,081
Rym: And that consultation from the private sector and civil society is paramount.

716
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:30,605
Rym: It has not happened

717
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:31,067
Rym: here.".

718
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:32,811
Rym: Referring to the ITU treaty.

719
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:41,237
Rym: And he basically goes on to say that the people involved in making these treaties that we're currently refusing to sign.

720
00:44:41,257 --> 00:44:42,743
Rym: Oh, there's a great quote here.

721
00:44:43,044 --> 00:44:51,716
Rym: He warned, or another guy warned, "The US should immediately prepare for an even more treacherous ITU treaty negotiation that's going to take place in 2014 in

722
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:51,937
Rym: Korea.".

723
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,694
Rym: So the UN, different groups of countries keep getting together and trying to put forth resolutions, giving themselves more control over the internet.

724
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:04,264
Rym: And every time the US just says, "Well, you know what?

725
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:04,545
Rym: No.".

726
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,294
Scott: Well, I mean, think about it this way, right?

727
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:10,188
Scott: If you consider the internet as almost like a country, right?

728
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,091
Scott: It's that important.

729
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:15,385
Scott: And its citizens are all sorts of people all over the world.

730
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:22,855
Scott: So this is like, you know, in the olden days of the US, only the white dudes who owned land and had penises could vote.

731
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:29,419
Scott: Well, this is like, well, this is internet and we're all live in it, but only the people who run countries can vote.

732
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,449
Scott: It's like, no, that's not how it's got to work.

733
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:31,629
Scott: Yeah.

734
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,769
Rym: I mean, the people who run Libya really don't want the people in Libya having access to the internet.

735
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,859
Scott: The people who run China really don't want people.

736
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,315
Rym: the people in China running it really don't want the people living in it.

737
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:47,820
Scott: Even in a situation like this is like corporations really depend on the internet to live all around the world.

738
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:52,698
Scott: And they don't even have a say in this ITU shit other than paying the government, right?

739
00:45:52,758 --> 00:46:06,384
Scott: So governance, you know, people who own, you know, govern large pieces of land, you know, even if they represent their people should, you know, on paper should not be the ones to determine the policy of the internet.

740
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:16,101
Scott: It is, you know, we should instead imagine it as a separate country and anyone who uses or depends on the internet is a citizen of it and has an equal say to everyone else.

741
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:21,641
Rym: My fantasy depends on my fantasy that I know is not relevant for at least for the next day.

742
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:24,031
Scott: The internet is its own country.

743
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:33,943
Rym: My fantasy of the next few decades is that the internet is recognized by the United nations, probably out of necessity as a sovereign nation and has delegates

744
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:40,309
Scott: and the people who are in charge of the internet and are elected and in charge of it or whatever are really smart technological people.

745
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:45,331
Scott: And suddenly they person who's the head of that is more important than the president of the United States.

746
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:53,428
Rym: I have a feeling that that can only come to pass if the, if the people who consider themselves citizens of the internet, I mean, I consider myself personally, if they

747
00:46:53,468 --> 00:46:55,376
Scott: had us, if they had New York city

748
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:56,380
Rym: and of the internet,

749
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,724
Scott: if they had legit internet passports, like you could go to a country and say, you know, I'm from internet.

750
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,768
Scott: That is my country.

751
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,815
Scott: I would switch and get one.

752
00:47:04,836 --> 00:47:08,696
Rym: I would say that internet would be, well, then again, what if you have to be super legit though?

753
00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:15,986
Scott: It couldn't be like green card to live in the U S unless you were a dual citizen, but it would have to be super legit, not sea land legit, right?

754
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,977
Scott: So it would have to be as legit as a French pass.

755
00:47:18,017 --> 00:47:19,042
Rym: It would have to be dual citizens.

756
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:24,590
Rym: just because as cool as this fantasy is, the fact remains that the one thing the internet does not have is sovereign land.

757
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:27,485
Rym: So even if you're a citizen of the internet, you got to live in some other country.

758
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,815
Rym: Do you really want to have a green card to live here?

759
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:45,346
Scott: If it was, if the passport and the, you know, the citizenship was as legit as current citizenship is and not some sea land joke, like I said, I would do whatever I had to do to be that even if it meant green cards or whatever.

760
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:45,808
Rym: Is that?

761
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:53,499
Rym: the only way for the internet to have a legitimate sort of citizenship or recognition would be if it had the sort of independent ability to defend itself.

762
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,880
Rym: Now you can imagine what that might entail.

763
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:01,003
Scott: Well, yeah.

764
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,265
Scott: I mean, you know, like you said before, we should use military force to defend the internets if necessary.

765
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:17,441
Rym: I have a feeling that if you know, the CBD TPA was basically fought off by the citizens of the internet from the era because normal people had no idea that that was happening.

766
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:24,005
Rym: I know I bring that up a lot lately, but those kinds of laws keep trying to come back and we keep fighting them off.

767
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:26,736
Rym: But non nerds still have no idea this stuff happens.

768
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:35,532
Rym: If it, if it ever got to the point where stuff like that was about to pass, I think nerds would start doing the kinds of things that they were planning for in the nineties.

769
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:41,051
Rym: They'd start using PGP phone equivalents again and crazy encryption and dark nets.

770
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:44,602
Scott: There's only so much we can do along those lines.

771
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:48,317
Scott: And we could be pushed to the point of using all of those tools, right.

772
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:52,351
Scott: And you know, doing lots and lots of, you know, internet side damage.

773
00:48:52,432 --> 00:49:02,449
Scott: Basically, it's sort of like, uh, you know, if there is a war on the internet for the internet, it's going to look a lot like Russia retreating away from Napoleon and or Hitler.

774
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:13,458
Scott: We're basically burning down the internet, uh, to damage those who were trying to harm the internet, to make them suffer in the land of the bad internet while simultaneously rotting around for ourselves who know better.

775
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:13,840
Scott: Yes.

776
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:18,978
Scott: But in the end, the internet really does need physical defenses.

777
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,632
Scott: I mean, it needs, the internet needs a Navy at the least to defend the undersea cables.

778
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:27,187
Scott: It needs some sort of space to put up and fix it.

779
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:28,151
Rym: Talk about this.

780
00:49:28,272 --> 00:49:32,952
Rym: One thing that I could have, I wrote in high school, a short science fiction story that I can't find about.

781
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:41,599
Rym: And the idea was that the internet was recognized in some year, 20 X DX after a global act of pseudo terror to bay.

782
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:52,900
Rym: It was basically a threat from some form of anonymous to tell the world that they could, in fact, you know, people who are citizens of the internet in quotes had basically pervaded all levels of society.

783
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,384
Rym: So you couldn't know who was or wasn't thanks to encrypted keys and anonymous stuff and all those sorts of things.

784
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,840
Rym: And I think that's, you know, my idea about the milk crates.

785
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:15,202
Rym: It's the idea that in every intersection of every major city in the world, citizens of the internet shoved shopping carts filled with gallons of milk into the intersection to stop all street traffic in every country in the world for one afternoon during rush hour to prove that it had the power to act if it needed to.

786
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:20,475
Rym: Hoping that that threat happens in that anime.

787
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:28,094
Scott: The one with the girl with the yellow door, a little bit of that action going on a little bit.

788
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:29,297
Rym: We'll see.

789
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:35,161
Rym: I think things like that will happen in our lifetime, but I think we're already too old to be on the forefront of that.

790
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:41,968
Scott: shopping carts aren't going to fix some someone cutting all the undersea cables either, which are surprisingly easy to cut.

791
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:43,414
Scott: They're cut all the time by accident.

792
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:43,775
Scott: Yeah.

793
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:50,421
Rym: But at the same time on the land and where you can have retransmitters, you can still keep the signals.

794
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:51,706
Scott: Well, that's another thing, right?

795
00:50:51,867 --> 00:51:08,407
Scott: If there is sufficient technological innovation to where everything can be wireless and fast and affordable and et cetera, you have to get to the point to where a government cannot stop the internet without stopping all communication or this can't period.

796
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:08,567
Scott: Right.

797
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:14,470
Rym: What if we reach a time where there is, it's always easier to disrupt a signal than it is to read it.

798
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,172
Scott: That is true.

799
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:22,662
Scott: But what if there is, we can reach a point in time where we have technology such that, you know, we can, everyone just has their own power sources.

800
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:24,207
Scott: So it doesn't even matter if they cut the power.

801
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:25,412
Scott: Right.

802
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:38,222
Scott: And B everyone just wirelessly sending their own data and we can just, you know, use it every hell frequencies and shit we want, you know, crazy jamming, crazy noise, but that would require such an immense, well, no, that's what I'm saying.

803
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:39,991
Rym: It doesn't matter the resources it takes.

804
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:46,636
Rym: The idea is that you have to make the internet so integral to the real world in the day to day interactions of everything.

805
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:56,351
Rym: And at the same time, make it so resilient that the only way to stop, uh, the nerds who run the internet shadow, whatever, is to stop the entire internet.

806
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:57,516
Rym: That is all or nothing.

807
00:51:57,536 --> 00:52:04,564
Rym: Because then basically it'd be like the equivalent of the only way to save New York city from the invasion is to nuke New York city.

808
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:06,051
Scott: Then they won't want it anymore.

809
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:08,986
Scott: And they'll realize how important New York was and why they shouldn't have fucked with it.

810
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:13,228
Scott: And then we, cause we're New Yorkers, we can put it back together once they get the hell out of here.

811
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:16,462
Rym: That's basically the only way the internet could be a sovereign power.

812
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:16,964
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:20,052
Scott: Well, maybe in our lives, maybe in the next lives.

814
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:26,095
Rym: We'll see what decade in terms of internet governance and we'll see what happens.

815
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:28,586
Scott: The fundamental point, at least for the short term is that the U?

816
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,495
Rym: S topic should be really boring.

817
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:34,955
Rym: It should be nerds just talking about, well, how do we allocate IP addresses in this country?

818
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:39,558
Rym: But instead we have countries like Korea being like, well, we don't want porn IP addresses and Germany.

819
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:41,367
Scott: Like we don't want any Nazi and Britain's

820
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,497
Rym: like, we want defamation laws like crazy

821
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:52,700
Scott: and people and other countries are like, well, you shouldn't be able to see anything that we don't like anywhere, or you should have to prove beyond any doubt that you're 18 plus in order to see any of this stuff.

822
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,892
Scott: And it's like every computer must send bits.

823
00:52:56,992 --> 00:53:01,209
Scott: It is asked to say, and if it wants to in any computer, then that is the problem.

824
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:02,577
Scott: We can't be looking at anyone's bits.

825
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:03,743
Scott: You can be blocking any internet.

826
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,069
Rym: Government should be boring.

827
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:09,104
Rym: It's not because people are stupid, greedy, drama filled and fearful.

828
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:12,353
Scott: It should just be as boring as, you know, here are computers.

829
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:16,225
Scott: They are not working.

830
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:17,269
Scott: Let us make them work.

831
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:17,772
Scott: Okay.

832
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:18,836
Scott: They are now working.

833
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:24,780
Rym: So guys, do we add one bit or two bit to the new address scheme for IP 47?

834
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:34,605
Scott: Uh, well it seems like we never thought we would need all the IP addresses of IPV six until every nanobot had an IP address.

835
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:38,800
Rym: And we made the nanobots should we use for the deep space network?

836
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:43,533
Scott: Think about farthest into the future as possible, right?

837
00:53:43,694 --> 00:53:46,603
Scott: The smallest computer we can make will be half a quark.

838
00:53:46,985 --> 00:53:52,486
Scott: If we computers are half a quark, we'll need this many bits to have an IP address for every half a quark computer.

839
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:54,815
Scott: Let's add two more bits to that.

840
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,260
Scott: So it will be super future.

841
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,337
Rym: So everyone who isn't the U S you can help us administer the internet.

842
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:08,730
Rym: If we can get it to the point to where those kinds of discussions are literally the only discussions that happen in relation to the administration of the internet.

843
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,082
Scott: Or if the U S starts fucking it up, which they haven't yet.

844
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,749
Rym: If the U S starts fucking it up, take it from us.

845
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:13,653
Scott: That's right.

846
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:15,120
Scott: Please.

847
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:24,983
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

848
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,619
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and brand.

849
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:28,980
Rym: Okay.

850
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,864
Rym: For the logos.

851
00:54:30,065 --> 00:54:35,124
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

852
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:38,035
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

853
00:54:38,156 --> 00:54:42,797
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.
