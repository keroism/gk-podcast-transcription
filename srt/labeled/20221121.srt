1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,978
Rym: It's Monday, November 21st, 2022.

2
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:09,159
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:12,866
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,554
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:19,530
Rym: Tonight we're talking about Federation and federated architecture, and not the Star Trek kind.

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:22,708
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:29,650
Rym: So, uh, a little parable that is relevant to the conversation Scott and I had right before the show.

8
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,069
Rym: That's my opening bit today.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,270
Rym: It's short, but there's an old parable that's called various names, but it's roughly the man and the hunting dog.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:46,050
Rym: So, a man says he's gonna go hunt, and the hunting dog is like, "Okay, uh, Master, I'm your hunting dog, I'm ready to hunt.

11
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,486
Rym: I'm gonna go hang out by the door, and we'll go as soon as you're

12
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:48,667
Rym: ready.".

13
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:52,290
Rym: And then the man goes and cooks some breakfast, and the hunting dog is waiting.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,170
Rym: And then the man goes and looks for his shoes, and the hunting dog is waiting, and now the hunting dog is bored.

15
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:02,530
Rym: And the man forgets that he didn't make his gunpowder, didn't put his shot in his gun.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,770
Rym: So the hunting dog gets bored, and the hunting dog wanders off to have a drink of water.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:14,230
Rym: In the moment the hunting dog is gone, the man comes to the front door and starts angrily shouting, "Where is my hunting dog?

18
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:15,563
Rym: Why is he always late for

19
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:16,028
Rym: everything?".

20
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:26,090
Rym: And that is what happened right before we did the show, but more importantly, it got really cold really quick in New York.

21
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,170
Rym: There was no falling.

22
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:28,729
Scott: We had to turn the heat on.

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,471
Rym: Yep.

24
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:38,326
Rym: It went from like, "I'm still comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt, and like, I'm running outside," to, "I had to wear my ski base layers running that half-marathon race over the

25
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:38,667
Rym: weekend.".

26
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:39,976
Scott: It's cold.

27
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:41,369
Scott: Yep, we turned the heaters on.

28
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:48,450
Scott: This year, though, however, taking a much more disciplined approach to reduce heating costs.

29
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,294
Rym: That's not an option for us.

30
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:55,090
Rym: Even if we set the heaters at the lowest possible setting, it gets warm in the apartment.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,650
Rym: In fact, if we turn the heaters off, all the ambient heat in the room actually keeps the apartment scarily warm.

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,289
Scott: No, what I'm saying is, like, you know, the heaters, right, it's like, we got three of them.

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,750
Scott: So it's like, at night, turn two of them off that we're not using.

34
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,350
Scott: That kind of situation, right?

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:19,130
Scott: It's like, don't turn the bedroom one on during the day, just close that door, make that a cold room, and then just, you know, turn it on when it's time to go to bed.

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,110
Rym: So the one in the computer room basically never turns on anyway because of all the equipment in here.

37
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,142
Rym: And the bunny room, we can't, like, get cold because the bunny's in there.

38
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,230
Rym: We don't have as many options.

39
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:30,833
Scott: Yeah.

40
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:40,070
Scott: But yeah, the internet says that to be the most energy efficient, I guess, you know, obviously the most energy efficient would be to freeze.

41
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:50,672
Scott: But, you know, it says that you should keep your heaters at your thermostat during the day when people are actually using the rooms at 68.

42
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:56,610
Scott: And then, at night, you should lower it to 60 because you're under a bunch of blankets, right?

43
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:07,568
Scott: And that every degree that you go up from that, not only are you spending a lot of energy, right, but you are costing yourself 3% more money per degree.

44
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,510
Scott: So if you set it at the very nice 60...

45
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:17,070
Rym: Well, with a lot of caveats, like, in an apartment building where you don't pay for heat and it's just a boiler that's running whether you use it or not.

46
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:18,794
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

47
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:22,869
Scott: Obviously, we're talking about where you control the heat in your living space by a degree.

48
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:23,810
Rym: Yeah, like, mostly if you have a house.

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:24,991
Scott: Right, you know.

50
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,019
Scott: But yeah, like, if you can set it, then it's like, think about it.

51
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,445
Scott: If you're setting it to 70, it's like, what's 3% times 0.3 again, right?

52
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,635
Scott: Another compounded another 3% on top of that.

53
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,939
Scott: It's like, that's your heating bill right there.

54
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,313
Scott: It's like, you know, I've always complained, you know, there are people who are real misers who, like, you know, always, everyone's cold.

55
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,379
Scott: It's like, it shouldn't be cold, right?

56
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,966
Scott: But, you know, it's like, I'm wearing a hoodie inside, right?

57
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,810
Scott: It's like, it's fine, you know.

58
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,010
Rym: Honestly, though, our apartment gets so warm, even if the heat's not off in the winter, just, you know, nature in New York City and, like, this particular apartment.

59
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,250
Rym: I'm often wearing, like, shorts and nothing and it's still warm and even sometimes I just have to open the windows in the winter.

60
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:13,129
Scott: You know, there's a lot of factors that go into it, but, you know.

61
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,289
Rym: Or RIT, where we had to keep the windows open so it didn't get dank.

62
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:25,110
Scott: Right, so, you know, saying for the sake of your wallet and also the climate change, right, don't just suddenly crank up the heat because it's cold.

63
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:25,871
Rym: Yup.

64
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:29,797
Rym: So, in the news, you might have seen this.

65
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:37,750
Rym: The FCC has a new, more accurate broadband map of where there is broadband, how much of it in America.

66
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,550
Rym: And you can zoom in to pretty shockingly specific detail now in a way that you couldn't before.

67
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:52,970
Scott: Yup, so the reason that the FCC collects this data and produces this map is that they can, you know, they've got a lot of, there's a lot of reasons, right?

68
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,310
Scott: So, first is that, you know, people, you know, people who live in the United States can see what internet is available where, right?

69
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,269
Scott: Just a consumer public good information, right?

70
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,171
Scott: Yup.

71
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,190
Scott: Businesses would also be looking at that, right?

72
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,230
Scott: But also the FCC is regulating these broadband providers.

73
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:20,090
Scott: So, when they make certain promises like, ah, we'll provide, we'll increase, you know, broadband coverage in rural areas or we'll promise these speeds in these places.

74
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,438
Scott: It's like, well, let's see what you actually delivered, right?

75
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,881
Scott: You came to us and said you did it.

76
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,750
Scott: Let's see what you actually did and let's look at the, you know, the reports, right?

77
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:28,860
Scott: Yeah.

78
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,840
Scott: So, it's taken a long time to update the map.

79
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:36,330
Scott: The previous map was very old, out of date, inaccurate.

80
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,415
Rym: And it was not granular enough.

81
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:43,050
Rym: It was on the level of a census block, which is really big.

82
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:55,210
Scott: The new map, you can look at like, you know, a single address and it'll tell you like which providers are there at the address, how fast their services and how much they charge for it.

83
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,350
Scott: And it's like pretty much the whole country is covered.

84
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:05,870
Scott: So, this is going to be really useful for, you know, it's going to do a lot to put pressure on the internet service providers, right?

85
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,570
Scott: People can look at, you know, all sorts of shenanigans can now be uncovered, right?

86
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,710
Scott: Journalists can look and see if like there's price gouging going on in certain areas, right?

87
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:24,830
Scott: Towns who are, you know, doing, you know, zoning and all that kind of stuff can be like, hey, you know, Verizon, you want to wire up our town?

88
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,529
Scott: Well, look at here, it says you're not doing it, right?

89
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:39,090
Scott: All kinds of stuff like that is going to go down and this should result in improved, you know, broadband coverage for, you know, anyone who wants it.

90
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:48,430
Scott: The question is, you know, it's like there are still people who want it, plenty of them, but I think the number of people that want broadband is actually going down.

91
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,733
Rym: I've definitely seen that.

92
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:56,790
Rym: A lot of people I know professionally, like not our close friends in nerd circles, they don't have any wired internet of any kind.

93
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,530
Rym: They just use the cellular networks or WiMAX or like something like that.

94
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,212
Scott: Right.

95
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:05,810
Scott: I feel like some people, you know, a lot of people just get a Wi-Fi in their house and that's it, right?

96
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,870
Scott: You know, maybe, but that counts as broadband, but a lot of people aren't doing that.

97
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,710
Scott: They're just phones and tablets are connected to, you know, cell towers if they're in the area.

98
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:15,571
Scott: Right.

99
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,150
Scott: And they don't have Wi-Fi in their house even, some people.

100
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,690
Rym: People have 5G hotspots and that is literally their broadband.

101
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:23,833
Scott: Yep.

102
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:24,830
Scott: Some people.

103
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:34,250
Scott: It's like, yeah, if you live in an area that has wireless coverage, you know, and you don't have computers, you just have a tablet and or phone.

104
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,469
Scott: It's like, okay.

105
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,490
Rym: This is going to be, I think in the long term, this is going to be an interesting new digital divide.

106
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,550
Scott: Of course, the rural areas that don't have broadband don't have wireless either.

107
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,237
Scott: Exactly.

108
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:44,909
Rym: They just got nothing.

109
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:58,670
Rym: But this will really help people who say want to move where, you know, you look at a house or you look at an apartment somewhere and pretty much anyone involved in that transaction is going to lie to you about your internet options because they just want you to buy the house.

110
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,127
Rym: You really need to be able to see.

111
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:06,927
Scott: You could look and see like, hey, wait a minute, there's a house that's like, you know, the apartment building next door has files.

112
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,010
Scott: How come this one doesn't?

113
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,060
Scott: Ravel, ravel, ravel.

114
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:09,344
Scott: Right.

115
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:09,608
Scott: You know.

116
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,638
Rym: So this is going to.

117
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,270
Rym: this is actually still a pretty big deal.

118
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,995
Rym: And this is coming partly because the U.S.

119
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:23,170
Rym: government and the FCC has actually done a pretty good job at regulating like Internet access compared to other countries.

120
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:26,860
Rym: Look at what Internet's like in Canada, like Canada's got a lot of advantages over the

121
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,241
Rym: U.S.,

122
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:30,250
Rym: but Internet access in Canada is the worst.

123
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,400
Scott: It's bad.

124
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:32,966
Scott: It's bad.

125
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,950
Rym: It's like it is worse than most other countries.

126
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,230
Rym: Honestly, it is terrible.

127
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:46,730
Rym: Every Canadian I know, they have like metered bandwidth with really, really low limits and they're paying like double what we pay.

128
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,230
Rym: So in some other news, this is a huge deal.

129
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:58,569
Rym: You might remember a while ago there was big talk of a rail union strike, as in choo choo trains in the U.S We're talking about freight trains mostly.

130
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,373
Rym: Yep.

131
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:01,629
Scott: So not so much the passenger trains in the U.S.

132
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:11,889
Rym: That strike was averted because a number of the large unions had voted to ratify a labor deal that had been reached with the U.S.

133
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:12,570
Rym: federal government.

134
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:17,270
Rym: These workers are kind of special in that they can't just strike.

135
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,230
Rym: There's consequences and nonsense that I don't want to get into because there's a broader picture I want to talk about here.

136
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,190
Rym: But think about like air traffic controllers now, like they're not allowed to strike.

137
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,570
Rym: There's all sorts of weird situations.

138
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,890
Rym: But these unions, they were going to strike.

139
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,310
Rym: The deal happened with some of the unions.

140
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,770
Rym: Now, and this is news from basically today, late last night this started to break.

141
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:47,190
Rym: A bunch of the unions who hadn't signed the deal have now said, no, we won't do it.

142
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,629
Rym: In fact, we're still going to strike.

143
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,690
Rym: The strike will start on December 9th if a deal isn't reached, apparently.

144
00:09:53,371 --> 00:10:00,770
Rym: And all the unions who signed the deal basically said, yeah, if any union strikes, we all strike because these working conditions are intolerable.

145
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,490
Rym: And of course, union solidarity.

146
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:03,551
Scott: Right.

147
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:09,910
Scott: So if you don't know what the deal is, just to briefly and perhaps inaccurately summarize the situation.

148
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:12,368
Rym: It's so much worse than you think it is out there.

149
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:14,398
Scott: There are freight trains in the

150
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:14,880
Scott: U.S.,

151
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,030
Scott: even though there's, you know, you think that we wouldn't.

152
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,155
Scott: The trains in the U.S.

153
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,329
Scott: have really declined over the past century or two.

154
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,170
Scott: But freight trains still carry a lot of goods from here to there in the United States.

155
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,870
Scott: Amazon Prime packages.

156
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,571
Scott: Right.

157
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:33,410
Scott: There's a freight train that's going to bring them from some port to the middle of the fucking country.

158
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:44,770
Rym: One estimate is that the freight rail network in America constitutes two to three billion dollars worth of economic activity generation per day.

159
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:45,831
Scott: Yep.

160
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,090
Scott: So a lot of stuff is on freight trains.

161
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:57,130
Scott: Now, the problem is that not enough people are in the profession of engineering a freight train.

162
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:57,631
Scott: Right.

163
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:09,890
Scott: So it's like we need a certain number of cars, train cars of goods to move a certain distance per day for everything to get where it's going on time, especially perishable things.

164
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:10,533
Scott: Right.

165
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:13,130
Scott: You know, but also nonperishable things.

166
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:13,471
Scott: Right.

167
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:24,348
Scott: So that means you need a certain number of train engines that can pull those cars operating and moving a certain number of hours at a certain speed per day.

168
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,275
Scott: Which means you need engineers.

169
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,357
Scott: They don't drive themselves.

170
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:28,979
Scott: Right.

171
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,550
Scott: So there has to be a certain number of engineers working at any given moment.

172
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:34,291
Scott: Right.

173
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:38,630
Scott: Piloting driving trains all the time, 24/7.

174
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:46,490
Scott: And if the number of engineers that are driving trains goes too low, shit starts not showing up on time, et cetera, et cetera.

175
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:56,430
Scott: So what's happened is there aren't enough people in that profession who have the training, who have the skill, who are willing to do the job, who haven't quit or whatever.

176
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:56,891
Scott: Right.

177
00:11:56,911 --> 00:12:02,349
Scott: Who are alive and able to do the job and legally allowed to do the job, et cetera.

178
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,092
Scott: Right.

179
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:04,570
Scott: Who can do it safely and properly.

180
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:10,990
Scott: So many things have been done to sort of get around that labor shortage.

181
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,518
Scott: Number one, they're overworking those people.

182
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:17,510
Scott: Obviously, that's the first go to move of the capitalist overwork the labor.

183
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:22,450
Scott: Number two, they are making them drive longer trains.

184
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,550
Scott: It's like, well, if I can't drive two normal size trains, I'll have one guy pull an unsafely long train.

185
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,835
Scott: It's like three miles long.

186
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,950
Scott: The person doesn't even know what's going on at the back of the train.

187
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,968
Scott: They'd have to walk three miles to see what's going on back there.

188
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:36,792
Scott: Right.

189
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,525
Scott: And it's unsafe and dangerous and, you know, all these sorts.

190
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,070
Scott: We won't let them have sick days.

191
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,177
Rym: That's pretty much the big thing.

192
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,250
Rym: They are not even asking for more money.

193
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:56,090
Rym: These workers, despite generating what, two billion dollars of economic activity a day, they are not asking for more money.

194
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:01,870
Rym: All they're asking for is the ability to take sick days off and have a few vacation days like they're not.

195
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,313
Scott: Right.

196
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:16,730
Scott: And I'm sure if there were enough train engineers, right, to get all the boxes, you know, the train cars to where they're going on time, that even the evil capitalists who run the train companies would be like, OK, all right.

197
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,910
Scott: The reason they're not letting them have sick days and overworking them is because there aren't enough of them.

198
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,130
Scott: If they let them have the sick days, then they probably won't be able to get all the boxes where they need to go.

199
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:34,230
Rym: But the union has made a very strong case that the reason they can't hire anyone is because no matter what the pay is, the pay is actually pretty good.

200
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:41,210
Rym: In a lot of cases, the working conditions are so intolerable that no rational person would take this job unless they're forced to.

201
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,037
Rym: This is like this destroys your life.

202
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:46,102
Rym: You literally cannot take days off.

203
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,687
Rym: You're on call.

204
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:48,910
Rym: You're working long shifts.

205
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:52,950
Rym: If you get sick, you have to come to work or you are punished or fired.

206
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,050
Scott: So what do you do, though?

207
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:08,030
Scott: It's like if you make the working conditions right, you sort of get when that when the labor shortage gets to a certain point, you get into this difficult situation where it's like, well, if you don't overwork the people you have, you fall below the threshold and you're in big trouble.

208
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,431
Scott: Right.

209
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:10,858
Scott: So you have to overwork the people you have.

210
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:15,010
Scott: But overworking the people you have makes it impossible to attract new people.

211
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:15,652
Scott: Right.

212
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,447
Scott: And then you can't escape the pit that you're in.

213
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:19,070
Scott: Right.

214
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,497
Scott: And I'm seeing this happen not just in trains.

215
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,850
Scott: I'm seeing a lot of people I know in a lot of different professions and fields.

216
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:26,531
Scott: Right.

217
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,597
Scott: In similar situations where there is understaffing.

218
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:30,319
Scott: Right.

219
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:35,730
Scott: Because there isn't enough supply of people who can and will do that job.

220
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:44,830
Scott: You know, we saw the story where there was a hospital and the emergency room was like way out of control in terms of patients versus staff.

221
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,276
Scott: And they called not that's the nurses called 911.

222
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:56,910
Scott: The fire department who has EMTs could at least do something to help staff them up a little bit temporarily, which as that's good.

223
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,776
Scott: We could talk about that situation.

224
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:05,810
Rym: So many of these teachers, they get paid so little that like a lot of people would be really good at being teachers.

225
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:13,010
Rym: We wouldn't have a shortage of people who could be good teachers, but we don't pay teachers any money and we make them work in an extremely dangerous environment.

226
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:14,331
Scott: Yep.

227
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:18,619
Scott: So it's like, you know, even if we increase the pay.

228
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,440
Scott: Right.

229
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:24,930
Scott: And improve the conditions, it's like that might solve some of these cases of labor shortage.

230
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,551
Scott: Right.

231
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:40,070
Scott: But as a whole, it's like, are there enough people who are ready, willing and able to do necessary work in, you know, distributed geographically in all the places where we need the work to be done?

232
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:51,230
Scott: And the answer may in some cases be like, no, it's like, no matter what we do, there just aren't enough people to provide service to the rest of the people in our society.

233
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,399
Scott: And the consequence of that, I think, is that, you know, obviously economic decline.

234
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:04,050
Scott: But the reality that you'll face as a normal person is that the level of service will decline.

235
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,551
Scott: Right.

236
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:11,843
Scott: It's like you won't, you know, stores that will have less hours or goods that you used to be able to get easily.

237
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,710
Scott: You can't get those goods anymore because they're not shipping them to, you know, to your area.

238
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,616
Scott: You'll have to suffer with whatever goods are, you know, made closer.

239
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:27,830
Scott: I guess, you know, it's like this, you know, the emergency room, they, you know, it's like it might be further away to go to the emergency room.

240
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,554
Rym: Now, it's probably for most sectors.

241
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:33,578
Rym: Medicine is a complicated one where there's a lot more going on.

242
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:41,550
Rym: But in a lot of sectors, there is almost definitely enough of a workforce to do this work for a reasonable wage and reasonable working conditions.

243
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,598
Rym: But one, we would need as a society to pay for training.

244
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:58,550
Rym: And when I say training, I mean like people have to be able to, without already having a job to support themselves, go somewhere or do something to learn these skills and learn these crafts.

245
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,154
Rym: We need to pay people to do that.

246
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:08,650
Rym: Like not everyone can afford to go to college and not have a job for a while or work a job and take care of family and go to college.

247
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,511
Scott: Right.

248
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,573
Scott: It's so backwards, right?

249
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,438
Scott: It's like we as a society, we need more doctors, right?

250
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,762
Scott: Or we need more trained engineers.

251
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,544
Scott: And then we say, and someone says, I'll do it.

252
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,290
Scott: I will be, I'll work and I will serve, I will serve the public good.

253
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,675
Scott: I'm a, you know, giving generous person.

254
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:31,329
Scott: I will dedicate my life to making everyone else's life better by becoming a doctor or train engineer or whatever it is.

255
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,950
Scott: Right.

256
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:36,560
Scott: And then they'll say, okay, if you want to learn that skill, come take the training class.

257
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,943
Scott: It costs this much money.

258
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:38,685
Scott: But wait, what?

259
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:41,070
Scott: You said you needed people to do the job.

260
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:44,803
Scott: Why do I have to pay you to learn to do the job?

261
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:46,370
Scott: You are the one who needs.

262
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,517
Rym: It's that dog comic.

263
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,869
Rym: No take, only throw.

264
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,217
Scott: That's right.

265
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:50,849
Scott: It's like, what?

266
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,482
Rym: But it gets even worse because we also, let's assume we solve that problem.

267
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:59,670
Rym: Like the labor supply is not the problem.

268
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:07,284
Scott: We could be in a situation where even if we solve that, right, there's a timing issue where it's like, okay, we'll train you.

269
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,110
Scott: We'll pay for you to learn how to drive a train.

270
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,038
Scott: It will take five years training.

271
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,263
Scott: It's like, we don't have five years.

272
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:14,749
Scott: That's too late.

273
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:19,664
Scott: And we, but if we let you do it any sooner, you won't be trained enough and you'll fuck up and derail a train.

274
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,490
Scott: So what are we going to do?

275
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:34,370
Rym: But it gets even worse because even if we solve that problem, a broader fundamental problem, and again, it comes back to capitalism and our society, is that the rail trains are a public good.

276
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,735
Rym: Just like mass transit is a public good.

277
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,822
Rym: They cause economic activity to happen.

278
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:41,687
Rym: They make the world work.

279
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:42,790
Rym: They make lives better.

280
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:56,110
Rym: And yet as a society, we demand that these things generate a profit for someone instead of paying for them and investing in them so that the output is not profit, but the thing existing in the first place.

281
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,471
Scott: Right.

282
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:02,441
Scott: It's like the, even if the train company itself comes at a loss, right?

283
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:06,770
Scott: It's like, yes, but all the businesses that use the train, right?

284
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:10,596
Scott: If the train moves faster and nicer and better, right?

285
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:18,210
Scott: The profits of all those companies will increase and sort of collectively cancel out the loss on the train.

286
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,814
Rym: Case in point, the internet.

287
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:24,870
Rym: The internet was built by the government and then given to the private sector to do whatever the fuck they wanted with.

288
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,269
Rym: And now what percentage of our entire global economy just runs on this internet that the government built for us?

289
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:32,352
Scott: Yep.

290
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:40,810
Scott: It's like, and the thing is we have other parts of, you know, our society that we don't, you know, demand profit from like roads, right?

291
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,870
Scott: This is why we have a car problem, which we demand.

292
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:53,350
Rym: We demand profit from like a subway that would get cars off the street, but we subsidize the roads that are causing a scarily high percentage of society's problems.

293
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,230
Scott: With free parking for everybody.

294
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:55,791
Rym: Yep.

295
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:06,150
Rym: So the last thing that you should internalize is, I did pull up the stat, 40% of all long distance trade in America runs on these trains.

296
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,910
Scott: If there is a strike, 40% of the shit that's on the shelf in your stores would just be gone.

297
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:22,989
Rym: This strike idling 7,000 trains would trigger immediate long-term retail product shortages and widespread manufacturing shutdowns.

298
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,730
Rym: But now no one who does that job deserves to take a day off if they have COVID.

299
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,190
Rym: So you wonder why I'm a communist.

300
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,230
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

301
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:54,629
Rym: So what if I told you that Maxis not only intended to release, but had a demo-able version of SimCopter that would run on the N64?

302
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:05,770
Scott: Right, now I remember SimCopter, I remember seeing it in the game store on the shelf, and I remember hearing that like, yeah, you could fly a helicopter around your SimCity 2000 cities, and I was like, oh, that's cool.

303
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:12,550
Scott: But like, it didn't seem like, like even at that time, when it was brand new, it didn't appeal to me as something that was worth spending money on.

304
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,630
Scott: Like I imagined myself flying around my city and looking at it and being like, that's cool.

305
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:23,290
Scott: And then playing a little game that it's like, I guess it's a game like you can rescue people with the helicopter or something.

306
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:27,950
Rym: Yeah, and like break up traffic jams and like, if the SimCity has a fire, go fight the fire, that kind of stuff.

307
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,169
Scott: Sure, but it's like, I'd rather just play, I don't know, fucking...

308
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:39,130
Rym: I mean, 1990, mid to later 90s, I'd be playing, what, TIE Fighter, X-Wing, Quake, like I had played 8 games today.

309
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,526
Scott: Yeah, right?

310
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:41,990
Scott: Sif 2.

311
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,210
Scott: Yeah, it's like, MechWarrior 2, it's like, in 1997, this was not a hot game.

312
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,450
Scott: But I didn't realize until Rym just said so, this game, I thought it was a PC only game.

313
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,150
Rym: Yeah, I didn't realize until I saw this article on the Video Game History Foundation, which I'm just going to read the tagline.

314
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:01,528
Rym: In 1997, Maxis revealed a new version of SimCopter for the N64.

315
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,220
Rym: Two years later, it disappeared.

316
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,870
Rym: We found out why.

317
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:14,790
Rym: And what follows is a shockingly detailed, extremely well researched, long and fascinating article.

318
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:19,630
Rym: This is a wild ride that is worth reading all the way to the end.

319
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,855
Rym: Good lord, is this fascinating.

320
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:28,430
Rym: This is the kind of primary journalism and historic, basically like video game archaeology that the world needs.

321
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,980
Rym: My hat is off to you.

322
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,290
Rym: This article is fantastic.

323
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:39,029
Rym: And at the bottom, tons and tons and tons of sources, including interviews with Shigeru Miyamoto about this.

324
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,569
Scott: So, in a, also video game preservation story...

325
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,607
Rym: Ooh, an unintended theme!

326
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,470
Scott: Perhaps a less positive one, but not entirely negative, right?

327
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,830
Scott: There was, you know, a game called Ridge Racer.

328
00:22:56,593 --> 00:22:56,928
Rym: Ridge Racer!

329
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:04,950
Scott: Which, you know, but people, we joke about the Ridge Racer guy, right, hyping up whatever, I think it was a PSP Ridge Racer, I think.

330
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,667
Scott: I forget what it was.

331
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,757
Rym: But Ridge Racer won.

332
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,269
Rym: There weren't really games like that before Ridge Racer won.

333
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:20,050
Scott: The original, this article will tell you the history of Ridge Racer, but it was originally, you know, a sort of top of the line driving sim for the day.

334
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:29,368
Scott: And that technology went on to be used in the original Ridge Racer, which had versions of which had like three monitors, right?

335
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,170
Scott: Three CRTs.

336
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:33,365
Scott: And was like, you know, pretty high quality deal.

337
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:34,450
Scott: Ridge Racer was a big deal.

338
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:51,390
Scott: And apparently, I didn't know, there was a game called Ridge Racer Full Scale, which was basically Ridge Racer, but you sat in a full size car, well full size in quotes because it was a Mazda MX-5, which is like the tiniest car.

339
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,870
Scott: But it was still a car, right?

340
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:58,010
Scott: Obviously, it was just like the body in the seats with the engine, I don't think.

341
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:04,850
Rym: If I still didn't think that cars were a literal existential threat to humanity, an MX-5 is actually the kind of car I'd probably have.

342
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:12,970
Scott: The point is, is that they put this car, right, and they wired up the pedals and the wheel and the buttons in the car to an arcade machine.

343
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,290
Scott: Some arcade boards, I think like three or four boards, right, for the arcade machine.

344
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:24,510
Scott: And then for monitors, they had three giant CRT projectors, right, that were just taking up your full field of view.

345
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,370
Scott: So it was like you're playing Ridge Racer, but like in a full size car, which is why it was called Ridge Racer Full Scale.

346
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:35,610
Scott: And to set one of these up was a lot of money and not many of them were set up in the world.

347
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:39,205
Rym: I mean, in the space of this thing, you could put like 12 crane games.

348
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,433
Scott: Exactly.

349
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,710
Scott: So the question is, is like, hey, are there any of these left?

350
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,366
Scott: And there was one left in the UK and it was in some sort of one of those arcades.

351
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:50,630
Scott: that's like in a warehouse somewhere.

352
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:57,110
Scott: But if you read the article, basically I'll summarize it so you don't have to read it if you don't want to.

353
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:05,030
Scott: Is that somebody went there and played it and it wasn't in great shape, but they got it barely working and they broke a bunch of records on it.

354
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:14,770
Scott: Like the best Ridge Racer racer went there to go and set all these records and record them and, you know, get speed runs or whatever.

355
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,715
Rym: Talk about a world record.

356
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,150
Rym: no one's going to beat on real hardware ever again.

357
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,312
Scott: Exactly.

358
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:24,970
Scott: And then, you know, it fell into more disrepair and someone got it out of the warehouse.

359
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:33,050
Scott: But then it was like, oh no, there were like photos of it, like out, like outside in pieces, rotting, not doing great.

360
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,217
Scott: Whoever had it wasn't taking good care of it.

361
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:38,088
Scott: You know, everyone was worried, something, something.

362
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:38,590
Scott: Right.

363
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:56,124
Scott: And then more recently, I don't know exactly when this article is from, but I guess more recently than that, somebody was like, hey, I bought this house and all this stuff was left over and they suspect it may have been the original, the person who had it sort of getting their shit together and tried to not

364
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:57,490
Rym: act like they were the person.

365
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,770
Rym: The comments on this article are from yesterday and today, so I think this article is very new.

366
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,481
Scott: They're trying to act like they weren't the person who let it rot outside.

367
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,690
Scott: They were a person who bought a house and discovered it, right?

368
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,733
Scott: So they don't know.

369
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:10,755
Scott: It doesn't matter.

370
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:18,997
Scott: The point is there were, they had some of the game, you know, ripped from the roms, but there were some graphics chips, right?

371
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:22,830
Scott: They're like these empty graphics in the game because that were special for this version.

372
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:27,398
Scott: But those seem to be, are now being recovered, right?

373
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:33,030
Scott: So good news for Ridge Racer full scale, bad news for Ridge Racer full scale.

374
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,490
Scott: I don't think it's going to be a lot of work to set up the hardware.

375
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,189
Scott: We'll see if that ever happens.

376
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:46,930
Rym: I feel like the best bet would be for someone to emulate or make an equivalent similar experience with a car as like a thing.

377
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,390
Rym: That's the kind of thing some nerd would just like roll into magfest one day with.

378
00:26:52,750 --> 00:27:03,284
Scott: Yeah, I think, you know, that would be cool is like somebody else, you don't have, you know, it's like, it would be cool to get actual Ridge Racer full scale, but it's like, just make a similar setup, get a car, right?

379
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,050
Scott: Take all the shit out besides the steering wheel.

380
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,825
Rym: You can get a car that doesn't really work for negative dollars.

381
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,150
Rym: People will pay you to take that car.

382
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,973
Scott: Right.

383
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,036
Scott: Put it down, right?

384
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,490
Scott: Set up the wheel and the pedals so that they are a controller, right?

385
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,478
Scott: Use a tiny circuit board in there, right?

386
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,250
Scott: And then get a computer.

387
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,970
Rym: Get a new enough car to have electronic throttle and stuff so you can hook into that instead of having to like build components.

388
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,197
Scott: Projectors that are low latency enough, right?

389
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:40,050
Scott: And hook everything up to a computer and write a piece of driving simulating software that displays on three projectors.

390
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:47,450
Scott: And then if you want, you could run Ridge Racer full scale in MAME on that computer.

391
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:50,488
Rym: Do it with Hachiroku, make an initial D.

392
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:52,090
Scott: Sure, go ahead.

393
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:57,950
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is Alif the Unseen.

394
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,190
Scott: I read a chapter.

395
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,390
Rym: I read one and a half chapters.

396
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:04,432
Rym: Ooh.

397
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,538
Rym: Alif the Unseen is a masterful- Are you counting chapter zero?

398
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,810
Scott: The chapter I read was chapter zero.

399
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:10,160
Rym: I also counted chapter zero.

400
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:11,410
Rym: Full disclosure.

401
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,011
Rym: Alif.

402
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:18,050
Rym: the Unseen is a masterful debut novel, an enchanting, incredibly timely adventure worthy of Neil Gaiman.

403
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:28,050
Rym: In an unnamed Middle Eastern security state, a young Arab Indian hacker protects watch groups from surveillance and tries to stay out of trouble until he falls in love with the wrong woman.

404
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,280
Scott: So I'm wondering, right?

405
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,370
Scott: So here's the question, Rym, right?

406
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:40,270
Scott: So chapter zero is a lot like say like Princess Bride where it's like, you know, the grandpa and the son, right?

407
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:47,250
Scott: But it's also, the way it's written, it might not be an outside situation, right?

408
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,490
Rym: It might be that chapter zero is inside the same universe as- I am predicting now, I am confident- Chapter one.

409
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,570
Rym: I am confident, and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, that chapter zero is within the story itself directly.

410
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,593
Rym: I am very sure- I'm 50/50.

411
00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:07,731
Scott: Chapter zero could either be Grandpa Princess reading Princess Bride or chapter zero could be in the universe 50/50.

412
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,020
Scott: And I kind of like that.

413
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,047
Scott: it's constructed that way.

414
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:10,510
Scott: That's clever.

415
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:10,991
Rym: Yeah.

416
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:19,687
Rym: Otherwise, PAX Unplugged 2022. on Sunday, December 4th at 1130 AM Eastern Time in the Crab God Theater, also known as Room 113B.

417
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:26,008
Rym: We will be there with "Why is this game taking four hours to

418
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:26,530
Rym: play?"

419
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:32,850
Rym: With significantly less dunking on Everdell and more talk about things like Marvel Snap.

420
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,950
Rym: Because I think I, in the original version of that panel, I spent way too much time talking about Everdell.

421
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:42,609
Rym: That game, however, does take way too fucking long for how good it is.

422
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,210
Scott: Well, because when Sutton gets on your- Gets caught in your craw.

423
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,310
Scott: Yeah, it's like when Rym gets a thing caught in his craw, he just can't stop himself from talking about it way too much.

424
00:29:52,610 --> 00:30:00,190
Rym: Well, it was partly because that was the first game, like, playing Everdell once was actually the impetus for the original "This game takes too long" panel.

425
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:07,946
Rym: Because I remember I was playing it, and there was one card, exactly one card, that has a weird, like, political- See what I mean?

426
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,189
Scott: See exactly what I mean.

427
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,316
Rym: Yeah, but I saw that card, I was like, "Wait a minute.

428
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:14,789
Rym: That card is literally the reason this game takes so

429
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:15,010
Rym: long.".

430
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:15,874
Rym: WTF.

431
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:19,622
Scott: My process for writing a panel is, I got something.

432
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:21,570
Scott: I gotta say, let's go find supporting evidence.

433
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,590
Scott: Rym's process for writing a panel is, run a comb through his craw, and let's see what lands on the table.

434
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,210
Rym: What was I mad about over the last few months?

435
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,210
Rym: Ooh, here's a panel on why competitive and casual can't coexist.

436
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:36,410
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

437
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:45,050
Rym: Otherwise, of course, Twitter is just dying, like, find us in other places, stay tuned, just go wherever.

438
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:49,169
Rym: We don't know where everyone's gonna be, but we're gonna try to just put our stuff everywhere.

439
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:57,950
Scott: Do you think you have something so important to say that, like, I need to hear it, like, you really, like, need to interfere in my life and get information to me?

440
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,050
Scott: Well, you know what, if you wanna do that, you can send me an email.

441
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:02,730
Scott: Yeah, worst case- My email's not hard to figure out.

442
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,190
Rym: Worst case will block you if it's bad, and you can't email me anymore.

443
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,088
Scott: Our website is frontrowcrew.com, and you can find us on the internet so easily, right?

444
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,053
Rym: But I wanna point something out.

445
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:20,730
Rym: The GeekNights Forum has been, or like, the entire forum, the old forum and the new forum, are online still.

446
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,746
Rym: Like, we archived the original GeekNights Forum, it is there.

447
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:24,530
Rym: It is online.

448
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:31,350
Scott: I was just going through yesterday looking at the bill for the hosting, and I'm like, man, we're paying five bucks a month just for the old forum.

449
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,430
Scott: I don't think there's any way that I can fix that and make it cost less.

450
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:42,490
Rym: There might, I think there could be a way, but it would cost us so much effort that the five bucks is worth it.

451
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,830
Rym: I can start paying for the five bucks if you want, but anyway, that's- There's some other costs I can reduce on hosting other things.

452
00:31:49,330 --> 00:32:01,090
Rym: Yeah, but I just wanna point out, the collective GeekNights Forum, it existed well before Twitter existed in a meaningful way, and I suspect it will now officially and formally outlast Twitter.

453
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:06,675
Scott: So, if you are- GeekNights existed pre-Twitter, and it will exist post-Twitter.

454
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:14,090
Scott: I think, you know, as long as we live, you know, and nothing else ridiculous happens.

455
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,230
Rym: I hope that in the retirement home, we're still doing GeekNights at least, like, once a month.

456
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,849
Scott: Yeah, I think we could easily beat Facebook, right?

457
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,570
Scott: But my advice to you youngins- Free spec does predate us, though, so.

458
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:38,370
Rym: Yeah, but my advice to you young- I mean, Facebook appeared while we were in college or leaving college, but my advice to you, if you're younger than us, this might feel existential, and you're looking for a new platform to go to.

459
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,058
Rym: That is not the way to look at it.

460
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:42,050
Rym: Every platform fails.

461
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,723
Scott: We've seen platforms come and go several times.

462
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:46,788
Scott: It's just been a while, so.

463
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,783
Rym: I've seen Facebook's collapse off the shoulder of a riot, like you.

464
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,370
Rym: I have used so many fucking platforms.

465
00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:00,990
Scott: Or Cuts and Friendsters and MySpaces and Napsters and- LiveJournal, DeadJournal, like- LiveJournal still exists, kinda.

466
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,930
Scott: There was a forum- You can make one if you want.

467
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:16,490
Rym: I found an inside of Prodigy that I roleplayed as an elven wizard extensively for years, and I didn't know what to do when Prodigy went down.

468
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:25,445
Scott: I think, theoretically, if I still had- I think it might still be possible to play Gemstone with my- Ooh.

469
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:33,310
Rym: I found a speedrun of Mad Maze, so I actually watched what I missed because my 2400 bond modem could not save Mad Maze.

470
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,549
Scott: Ooh, I should watch that.

471
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,249
Rym: Yeah, I'll make that my Thing of the Day.

472
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,993
Rym: Alright, let's get into it.

473
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:53,510
Rym: So, one of the reasons we're doing this show is, Monday shows are hard to come up with, but two, a lot of people are trying to find an alternative to Twitter, and a lot of people are telling those people that Mastodon is that alternative.

474
00:33:54,031 --> 00:34:03,810
Rym: However, very few people understand what the deal is with Mastodon, and Mastodon's architecture is confusing to people who don't understand the concept of Federation.

475
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:11,310
Scott: Right, so we're gonna talk mostly about Federation, and then at the end we'll complain about the specifics of Mastodon.

476
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:18,929
Scott: So, the idea with Federation is basically, that's the way internet applications are supposed to work, right?

477
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:26,690
Scott: All the early internet applications, and the ones that still underpin, you know, what we use on the internet today, are federated protocols, right?

478
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,889
Scott: HTTP, right, with web, right, is federated, right?

479
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,034
Scott: Email is federated.

480
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:36,043
Scott: There was a thing called XMPP that still exists.

481
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,090
Scott: that's federated instant messaging.

482
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,971
Rym: Well, think about DNS.

483
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:40,734
Rym: We did a show on DNS a long time ago.

484
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:48,565
Rym: DNS federates down till it points you eventually at the small, little, private, fully-owned empire.

485
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:50,949
Rym: that'll answer your question of what IP address you're looking for.

486
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,150
Scott: Right.

487
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:58,779
Scott: So, what Federation just means generally is that, as opposed to, say, centralization, right?

488
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:26,330
Scott: It's not just one computer, but it's owned by one company, and one organization, and one set of, you know, technological people have access to it, and they are centrally orchestrating all of those computers in concert, right?

489
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:27,615
Scott: And that's it.

490
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,909
Scott: There's no, like, other Twitters or anything like that, right?

491
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,576
Scott: So, a federated model is decentralized, right?

492
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:38,299
Scott: It's like, anybody can have a Twitter.

493
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,260
Scott: I made a Twitter.

494
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,342
Scott: It's called ScottTwitter.

495
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:41,403
Scott: Rymd made one called Rymd.

496
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:46,790
Scott: We can all make Twitter servers that are stand-alone and completely independent of each other.

497
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:52,096
Scott: Imagine if the web, right, HTTP, never became popular, right?

498
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:56,981
Scott: Like, no one else used it, but you could still make one web server.

499
00:35:57,081 --> 00:36:03,227
Scott: That's the only web server, and if someone had a web browser, they could visit it, and it would work.

500
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:05,670
Scott: It just wouldn't be any other websites, right?

501
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:07,432
Scott: That's the one.

502
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:14,900
Scott: But then, someone else could set up a second website, and it's like, do those websites have anything to do with each other?

503
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:14,960
Scott: No.

504
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:18,744
Scott: They're two completely independent things, right?

505
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:21,828
Scott: It's just, they're both speaking the same language.

506
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,850
Scott: HTTP is the language they speak.

507
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:30,659
Scott: So, if your web browser speaks HTTP, you can visit these different web servers, right?

508
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,185
Scott: If you have an email server, it's like, I can just start an email server.

509
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:36,367
Scott: No one can stop me, right?

510
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,029
Scott: You don't need a license for that or anything.

511
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:38,750
Scott: There's no law.

512
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,858
Scott: You could just start trying to send emails and saying, hey, if anyone wants to send me emails, send them here, right?

513
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:47,720
Scott: And just start getting and sending emails.

514
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,726
Scott: People might block the hell out of your emails because they're spam, but you can try, right?

515
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,468
Scott: You just start up your own email server.

516
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,809
Scott: What's anyone going to do about it?

517
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,011
Rym: Exactly.

518
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:01,396
Scott: And this is how the internet should work, right?

519
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:05,221
Scott: Because it's like, A, resiliency, right?

520
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,884
Scott: You can't take email down.

521
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:11,110
Scott: Gmail might be down, but email can't go down.

522
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,014
Rym: B, this way you can have a separation of concerns.

523
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:22,704
Rym: Someone can run the web server that does X completely independent of any dependencies on the person who runs the web server.

524
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:27,890
Rym: that does Y. I don't need to coordinate with Scott if I'm going to make a website or do anything.

525
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,010
Scott: Yep.

526
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:32,153
Scott: You don't need anyone's permission to get in on the game, right?

527
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:38,860
Scott: You could even, if you want to, you know, this is going to be a guide for how the language is spoken, right?

528
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,003
Scott: And you could divert from that guide.

529
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,484
Scott: No one's going to stop you, right?

530
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:49,770
Scott: But your shit might break if someone else tries to speak to you in the standard dialect and you have a weird dialect.

531
00:37:49,910 --> 00:38:05,150
Scott: But maybe you get other people to agree with you and start speaking your weird dialect and you could add more features that other websites don't have or other emails don't have or, you know, it's like you can do stuff like that because everyone does what they want.

532
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,233
Scott: Everyone's in charge of their own computers.

533
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:12,180
Scott: They use their own computer to do their own thing, but all the computers speak the same language.

534
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:19,590
Scott: And when you have a lot of computers independently governed but speak in the same language, powerful things start to happen.

535
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:20,391
Scott: Right.

536
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,493
Scott: Like you can start sending emails to people.

537
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,357
Scott: And as long as everyone's, you know, cool with it, it's going to work.

538
00:38:26,897 --> 00:38:30,181
Scott: It's like, you know, it's kind of weird when you think about it.

539
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:39,490
Scott: It's like, you know, I have a computer at Google and I tell that computer at Google, Hey, Google computer, send an email over there to Microsoft computer and the Microsoft computer.

540
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:47,420
Scott: So some bits are coming in on that Microsoft computer and the Microsoft computer agrees to look at those bits.

541
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:48,983
Scott: Like you could just send any old bits.

542
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:49,383
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:54,530
Scott: And it's gonna and it's and it's gonna actually agree to look at those bits for free.

544
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:06,489
Rym: One of those things I could from a Linux command line right now, I could cat dev you random into and pipe that straight into a TCP connection to Scott's IP address if I wanted to.

545
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:12,120
Scott: Yeah, you could just start sending random bits to Microsoft's email server on the SMP port.

546
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,822
Scott: Yeah.

547
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:17,130
Scott: And it would look at those bits and it would look at them and say, that's not an email garbage.

548
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,392
Scott: But you can do it.

549
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:31,940
Scott: And it's like their computer will look at bits for free, but their computer is programmed such that if the bits that come in, look a certain way and it looks at those bits and it says, that looks like an email.

550
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,742
Scott: It's from someone at Gmail.

551
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,763
Scott: Does everything look right here?

552
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:37,424
Scott: Yep.

553
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:41,646
Scott: This actually came from Gmail and it's for someone at Outlook.

554
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:42,767
Scott: You know what?

555
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:47,030
Scott: I'm going to actually pay attention to these bits that just arrived from the internet.

556
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,490
Scott: Yep.

557
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:51,153
Scott: And I'm going to do what they say and put an email in someone's inbox.

558
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:51,894
Scott: Right.

559
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:52,994
Scott: And it's not spam, right?

560
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:54,556
Scott: Doesn't say Viagra in that email.

561
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:55,636
Scott: Okay, let's do it.

562
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:56,117
Scott: Let's do it.

563
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:56,737
Scott: We're going to do it.

564
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:14,070
Scott: So it's like these companies and different people who have completely separate unrelated computers, right, are agreeing to like send bits to each other, look at whatever bits show up and behave in a certain way when those bits show up and they actually do it.

565
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,833
Rym: Like you're used to email addresses, something at something dot something like that.

566
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:20,634
Rym: You just think about that.

567
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,015
Rym: What does that mean?

568
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:28,179
Rym: That is the result of a nest of federated services using other federated services.

569
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,762
Rym: In the old days, if you were on Prodigy, you had a Prodigy username.

570
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:35,384
Rym: You want to message another Prodigy user, you just type their name.

571
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:42,409
Rym: Just like in an old phone network, you would just dial like the four local digits and that would connect you to someone on the local switch.

572
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:42,890
Rym: And that was it.

573
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,933
Rym: So that at sign was sort of an invention.

574
00:40:46,974 --> 00:40:50,016
Rym: that was an appropriation of a sign that was used for another purpose.

575
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:53,459
Rym: You're literally saying I want Scott at a pressure on that.

576
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,561
Rym: I want to talk to the user, Scott.

577
00:40:55,822 --> 00:41:01,827
Rym: And the at sign is saying and I'm telling you that I know Scott lives at a pressure net, wherever the fuck that is.

578
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:02,428
Rym: I don't know.

579
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,990
Rym: I don't care, but that's the address I'm putting on the envelope.

580
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:11,619
Scott: And all the computers involved, even though they're all owned by separate people, right?

581
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:18,610
Scott: All those computers have been configured to speak the same language and follow roughly the same rules.

582
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:23,054
Rym: Just like the Global Postal Service works, fill out an envelope.

583
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:29,021
Rym: Anyway, any human in the world will read that and eventually that envelope is going to get to the country you send it to.

584
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,505
Rym: That country has its own postal service, its own laws, its own nonsense.

585
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:36,910
Rym: But unless it's North Korea, they're very likely going to deliver that envelope where you want it to go.

586
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:43,616
Scott: They're willing to accept and look at bits that come, you know, electric signals that come from it pretty much fucking anywhere.

587
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:50,863
Scott: And as long as those bits, the data lines up, they're willing to obey and do what the bits say.

588
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:51,584
Scott: Right.

589
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,847
Scott: It's like even if you just visit a website, it's like you go.

590
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:57,730
Scott: you create a TCP IP connection with a Google server.

591
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:04,378
Scott: Google will just allow anyone who has a computer to make a TCP IP connection with their servers just for free.

592
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:13,370
Scott: And then you send over the wire the bits of like, you know, the letters get forward slash and they'll send you no money.

593
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:20,059
Scott: The HTML, JavaScript, JPEGs, whatever that constitute the Google homepage, they'll just send it to you.

594
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,440
Scott: Here it is.

595
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,161
Scott: You want it.

596
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:21,662
Scott: Here you go.

597
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:22,042
Scott: Right.

598
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:27,250
Scott: It's like these people just set up computers that will talk to the public according to rules for free.

599
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:38,578
Rym: Now, I think part of what happened with people who don't go to tech school, like learn this stuff, learn Internet history, learn architecture, learn to code is that most people go to only a few websites and don't think about this that much.

600
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:47,744
Rym: So they don't quite realize that almost everything on the Internet is federated, even if you end up going to the same website 90 percent of the time you go online and

601
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:48,685
Scott: you're effectively

602
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:56,450
Rym: living within one sort of non-federated system like Twitter or a specific social media network like Facebook.

603
00:42:56,791 --> 00:43:05,590
Rym: Facebook interfaces with the rest of the world via a lot of protocols, but Facebook itself is a proprietary, non-federated platform that does its own shit.

604
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,914
Scott: Well, this is what happened in the 90s.

605
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:14,150
Scott: A lot of people who had Internet in the 90s had AOL specifically, but also CompuServe Prodigies.

606
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,552
Rym: Oh, yeah.

607
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:16,210
Rym: We're going to talk about XMPP or Jabber.

608
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:19,536
Scott: I'm sure other countries had them also, right?

609
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,644
Scott: You know, different services and those services were, you know, not federated, right?

610
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:26,470
Scott: AOL was just there was one AOL and that was it.

611
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:26,868
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,409
Scott: You had to pay to get in there.

613
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,218
Rym: ICQ, you had a unique number, whole world.

614
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,485
Rym: There was no my name at something.

615
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:37,151
Rym: I was 15036112.

616
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:37,311
Scott: Yep.

617
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:44,950
Scott: But, you know, what happened is those things died and the federated services, the Web just beat them all.

618
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,271
Scott: Right.

619
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:49,450
Scott: A lot of people were just dialing into AOL, minimizing it and opening up Netscape Navigator.

620
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,172
Scott: Oh, my God.

621
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:54,890
Rym: I googled for my ICQ number and I found it in my profile on the Oticon forum.

622
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,067
Scott: OK.

623
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:57,108
Rym: And nowhere else.

624
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,630
Scott: I'll do that later.

625
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:05,209
Scott: But the point is, what's it called?

626
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,211
Rym: Yeah.

627
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:09,970
Scott: So, you know, after right after that went on for a while.

628
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:10,491
Scott: Right.

629
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:11,615
Scott: You know, there's this old.

630
00:44:11,655 --> 00:44:15,870
Scott: this is saying people like to use lately, which is like there used to be more Web sites.

631
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:16,272
Scott: Right.

632
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:18,262
Scott: It's like, well, actually, there's more Web sites than ever.

633
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,809
Scott: It's like you're just not seeing all of them.

634
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:20,293
Scott: Right.

635
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,363
Scott: Because you're not going to them.

636
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:21,989
Scott: They're out there.

637
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:22,411
Scott: Right.

638
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,277
Scott: It's just you're not going to them.

639
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:27,870
Scott: It's like most people are just going to a few Web sites.

640
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:28,691
Scott: Right.

641
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:36,550
Scott: Your Facebook, your Twitter, your whatever, your ticktocks, your Googles, Amazon, eBay, you know, whatever.

642
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:43,030
Scott: And those Web sites are basically embedding or including or linking to all the other content.

643
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:43,611
Scott: Right.

644
00:44:43,692 --> 00:44:50,530
Scott: And people are just doing everything through, you know, these single services that are, you know, it's like they are Web sites.

645
00:44:50,831 --> 00:44:57,910
Scott: So the Web is federated, but the single Web site on its own, it's like the only one that's providing that particular service.

646
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:58,755
Scott: Right.

647
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,229
Scott: As a solitary thing.

648
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:12,910
Rym: So a lot of you, a lot of people like I. actually there's an article in WAPO talking about how much of a problem the fall of Twitter is going to be, because so many governments like use it to make official note of it.

649
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,470
Rym: Like there's a lot going on there, but a lot of people consume the news by looking at Twitter.

650
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,786
Rym: They get a whole feed of just links to Web sites and embedded nonsense from Twitter.

651
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:22,850
Rym: Twitter's where they get everything.

652
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:30,230
Rym: Not like the old days with RSS, where you would have an RSS reader that was hitting 100 different RSS feeds all over the Internet.

653
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:35,210
Rym: You have all of that collapsing into one proprietary platform, into one proprietary feed.

654
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:36,531
Scott: Yep.

655
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:44,670
Scott: So, yeah, so some of the other federated things that people don't know about.

656
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:46,295
Scott: We mentioned XMPP.

657
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:51,250
Scott: So XMPP was basically in the days of AIM, AOL Instant Messenger.

658
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,570
Scott: There was also MSN and Yahoo Messenger.

659
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:54,869
Rym: And ICQ was still around.

660
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:56,533
Scott: Yeah, ICQ.

661
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,987
Scott: But all those messengers were individually centralized.

662
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,189
Scott: It's like you couldn't message someone on MSN from AOL.

663
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:11,529
Rym: So on your desktop, you had an MSN client and ICQ client and an AOL client always running all the time.

664
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:12,534
Scott: Yep.

665
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:15,190
Scott: Or just one of them and didn't talk to people on the other services.

666
00:46:16,392 --> 00:46:19,430
Scott: But there was a thing called XMPP, also known as Jabber.

667
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,810
Scott: And Jabber was basically federated instant messaging.

668
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,330
Scott: I mean, it still exists, but it's just not heavily widely used.

669
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,333
Rym: Yeah, the protocol.

670
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:31,130
Rym: This is important to what we're going to say in about eight minutes.

671
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:37,710
Rym: The XMPP protocol that came out of Jabber outlasted Jabber itself and is now a critical part of the Internet.

672
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:43,626
Scott: Yes, XMPP is still around, but not a lot of people use, you know, some people.

673
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:44,709
Scott: I'm sure nerds aren't, right?

674
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:52,389
Scott: But the way it worked is like, you know, AOL and Google actually both at points in time supported XMPP.

675
00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:00,690
Scott: And what you could do is, I actually did this, is I had my own XMPP server that I ran at my own domain, right?

676
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,974
Scott: Like, was it at Front Row Crew or at whatever?

677
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:16,150
Scott: And people on AOL and people on Google Hangouts could message me and I could message them all with my one instant messaging account.

678
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:19,999
Scott: And it's like, all these things are talking to each other.

679
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,770
Scott: But then AOL and Google both pulled the plug on that, right?

680
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,490
Scott: Now, why were they federating their instant messages and then unfederating them?

681
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:29,592
Scott: Well, the reason is pretty.

682
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:44,510
Scott: from a capitalist perspective is pretty clear is that if the service you are providing, right, becomes federated, then you yourself become basically a commodity.

683
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,810
Scott: Just a dumb pipe?

684
00:47:47,070 --> 00:48:03,470
Rym: I was about to say a dumb pipe, which if you look at pure technology, the dumb pipe architecture, meaning the things that just connect information sources and destinations like sources and things together, those have to be as stupid and simple and reliable as possible.

685
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,234
Rym: You don't want to put all your logic in there.

686
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:06,457
Rym: You put the logic at the endpoints.

687
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:11,330
Rym: That is almost universally a superior architecture to smart pipes.

688
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,956
Rym: Pretty much categorically, the exceptions are so rare we don't need to really talk about it.

689
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:25,770
Rym: But you can't make money being a dumb pipe, so unless someone's willing to run a dumb pipe as a commodity service, dumb pipes really won't exist.

690
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:28,590
Rym: The Internet is one of the last dumb pipes.

691
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:30,613
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you think.

692
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:35,223
Scott: if you just provide an email server, it's like, well, those are just free and open source.

693
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:38,230
Scott: It's like anyone could just speak email, right?

694
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:50,910
Scott: It's like the only way you make money on email, I don't even know if they do make money, is Google, they get you to use their email by providing a superior user interface and spam filtering and all these other things on top of the email, right?

695
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,973
Scott: It's not the emailing.

696
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,221
Scott: All they did was do the emailing.

697
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:56,167
Scott: It's like that's federated.

698
00:48:56,187 --> 00:48:57,050
Scott: You don't need them for that.

699
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:03,822
Scott: It's like, you know, they provide all these other benefits on top of it, right?

700
00:49:04,303 --> 00:49:08,130
Scott: And then that's what allows them to put ads or charge money for the service.

701
00:49:09,411 --> 00:49:19,207
Scott: But if you're just like Twitter, well, if anyone could just start run their own Twitter, it's like Twitter doesn't really provide anything beyond filling up your feed with the right messages.

702
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:21,310
Scott: In fact, they don't even do a great job of it.

703
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,959
Rym: They provide racism, they provide ads, they provide spam.

704
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:39,589
Scott: But like if Twitter was federated and I could run my own Twitter and it was literally Twitter, but it was my server, it's like Twitter would just go out of business immediately because everyone would just run their own, the end.

705
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:42,858
Scott: With their own rules and they wouldn't, right?

706
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:44,843
Scott: Twitter wouldn't be able to collect anyone's data.

707
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:47,430
Scott: They wouldn't be able to send ads to anyone, right?

708
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:54,246
Scott: All they would be doing is running computers that send, you know, tweets back and forth so that they get to the right places and that would be it.

709
00:49:54,627 --> 00:49:55,950
Scott: It's like that doesn't get you anything.

710
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,495
Scott: It's like, does Twitter have the best Twitter client?

711
00:49:58,535 --> 00:49:58,675
Scott: No.

712
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:00,860
Scott: Gmail has the best email client.

713
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:04,830
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like there's nothing they can do about that, right?

714
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:11,269
Scott: So that's why people don't want to make open federated protocols because there's no money in it.

715
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,254
Rym: Even though the architecture is generally superior.

716
00:50:15,914 --> 00:50:19,238
Rym: And thus we get to, what's the deal with Mastodon?

717
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:28,690
Rym: Mastodon is basically just an implementation of a way to use a protocol called ActivityPub to do something like what Twitter does.

718
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:31,894
Rym: That's pretty much the most succinct way to put it.

719
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,179
Rym: So I, you know, I bought a new domain.

720
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,010
Rym: I bought Rym.social because I don't trust platforms and Twitter dying was a big wake up call.

721
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:43,337
Rym: I let my guard down for a second, a second, more than a decade.

722
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:47,263
Rym: I heavily, I used Twitter heavily.

723
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:48,665
Rym: I lived in that ecosystem.

724
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:51,470
Rym: I didn't really like have alternatives to it.

725
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,353
Rym: And now I got to abandon it.

726
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:54,455
Rym: So I got Rym.social.

727
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:57,020
Rym: I have a domain to do whatever I'm going to do in the future.

728
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,870
Rym: So if I want to be on Mastodon, I could run a Mastodon instance on my domain Rym.social.

729
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,978
Rym: And then my address on Mastodon would be Rym@Rym.social.

730
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:14,830
Rym: And I can subscribe to anyone else using Mastodon anywhere in the world unless they block me.

731
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:19,139
Rym: They can subscribe to me and the ActivityPub protocol kind of just makes it work.

732
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:24,030
Rym: That's basically what Mastodon is, a single implementation of this protocol.

733
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:30,422
Rym: And there's a whole bunch of other very similar things like PeerTube or there's one for podcasts.

734
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:31,264
Rym: There's a million of them.

735
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,930
Rym: They're probably all going to fail over time, but they're all out there.

736
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,693
Scott: So you could go and read it.

737
00:51:35,894 --> 00:51:39,300
Scott: Actually, it's a W3C protocol, the ActivityPub protocol.

738
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,282
Scott: You can go read about it.

739
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:44,050
Scott: You can implement it yourself or you can get some libraries.

740
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:53,223
Scott: Mastodon is just currently a popular program that uses that protocol to do basically what Twitter does.

741
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,867
Scott: But you could do other things with the protocol.

742
00:51:55,887 --> 00:51:56,909
Scott: You don't have to make a Twitter.

743
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:57,610
Scott: You could do other stuff.

744
00:51:58,271 --> 00:52:06,168
Scott: The point is, is that Mastodon's specific implementation of this protocol doesn't seem to be that great.

745
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:06,990
Scott: It's got a lot of issues.

746
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:16,590
Rym: Which we won't really get into in this show, but having read the documentation for the server itself, it would be a pain in the ass to run.

747
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:29,810
Rym: In the old days, before modern Steam, if you wanted to run your own Counter-Strike server on your own bare metal, it's one step less pain in the ass than that was.

748
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:31,972
Rym: That's about what it feels like.

749
00:52:32,032 --> 00:52:33,554
Rym: It's not that well documented.

750
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:34,775
Rym: There's weird options.

751
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:45,130
Rym: It does mostly just work if you get it going, but the way the servers implement Federation and the way they actually do it lead to a lot of unintended consequences.

752
00:52:47,251 --> 00:53:00,370
Rym: So I don't think Mastodon is going to be the thing in the end, but I do think some evolved form of activity pub and some federated world is going to be the future of Twitter-like social media.

753
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:11,666
Rym: The danger is, if that doesn't come to pass, it's because capitalism has drawn people to invest big money and build even more non-federated proprietary platforms and prop them up.

754
00:53:12,026 --> 00:53:14,730
Rym: Like pushing people into TikTok and that kind of service.

755
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:30,510
Scott: So if you're looking historically, what I predict will happen is you look at other federated things and it's like, well, there was email before Gmail, but email before Gmail had a lot of problems, spam and all kinds of issues.

756
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,150
Rym: Remember trying to run Squirrel Mail for our own purposes?

757
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:33,731
Scott: Exactly.

758
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:39,258
Scott: Bad user interfaces, all kinds of issues, but email didn't fail over time.

759
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:43,164
Scott: Now there's several current email choices that are just fine now.

760
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:47,570
Scott: I use Gmail because that's what I happened to use back in the day and it's hard to move.

761
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,373
Scott: It's not what I would use if I had to use email today.

762
00:53:53,196 --> 00:54:00,846
Scott: The point is that what was originally looked at as like the winner, the protocol of email lived the whole time.

763
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:03,570
Scott: Some before I was born, even all the way till now.

764
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:08,675
Scott: But the winner and the email field kept changing, right?

765
00:54:09,136 --> 00:54:10,657
Scott: And probably will continue to change.

766
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:22,930
Scott: So we're only sort of still getting started with the ActivityPub federated protocol and the current winner of Mastodon, I think is just going to be like the first one and it'll fade.

767
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:30,121
Scott: And the other ones will come along and those will be more, they won't last forever, but there'll be more long term winners.

768
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,868
Scott: You look at things like the Apache web server, which felt like the only web for a long time.

769
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:35,990
Scott: That was the web server.

770
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:38,195
Scott: It's like, but now not so much.

771
00:54:38,315 --> 00:54:40,741
Scott: Now people use Nginx and all sorts of other web servers.

772
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:44,149
Scott: Apache is not as popular for new projects anymore, really at all.

773
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:54,426
Scott: Just any protocol you think of, that's still around and you can see like, ah, there was an old winner in that field, right?

774
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:56,210
Scott: It's like, and now there's a new one.

775
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,772
Rym: So what does it mean for you?

776
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:17,510
Rym: Do not assume that whatever platform you move to in this space will continue to exist or be the winner and expect that the sort of Twitter Pax Romana, like this weirdly long period where Twitter was just dominant in this space, that was an aberration.

777
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:30,490
Rym: You're going to see over the next decade, probably the fairly rapid rise and fall of several Twitter like and Twitter adjacent implementations using activity pub or similar protocols.

778
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:35,294
Scott: I think also is just, you know, understand, right?

779
00:55:35,354 --> 00:55:38,216
Scott: What it means when something's federated, right?

780
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:54,670
Scott: And that much like with email, it only works right when you behave according to the rules, you understand the architecture and whatever instance is like your home instance or instances right in the world, right?

781
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:00,889
Scott: A federation of all the servers that are out there has good governance that you agree with.

782
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:11,949
Rym: And be wary, the larger and more powerful any particular implementation gets, the more they will be able to break the rules and force everyone else to deal with it.

783
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:20,823
Scott: So, you know, you think about like, you know, the way that Gmail can force, you know, can change the terms of how email works, right?

784
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:23,587
Scott: It's like, if Gmail blocks your email, it's like, guess what?

785
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:25,250
Scott: Your email server, no one's going to use it.

786
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:31,746
Scott: Because people need to email people who are using Gmail because they got a lot of users and they won't use your email if it doesn't do that.

787
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:33,250
Scott: If Gmail, you know.

788
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:43,270
Rym: You might join a Mastodon instance and find out that half the people you want to follow, you can't follow because the instance you happen to join, everybody else blocked for some reason.

789
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,275
Scott: I think that, you know, we could talk for a while about.

790
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:54,750
Scott: I think Mastodon, one of its big mistakes is it seems to me like when you start an instance, all other instances are unblocked by default.

791
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,875
Scott: I feel like it should be the opposite.

792
00:56:56,956 --> 00:57:01,090
Scott: that like if you start a Mastodon instance, everything else should be blocked by default.

793
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:06,929
Rym: Yeah, but then, because the whole idea is that it's like email, anyone can subscribe to you.

794
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,094
Scott: Right, but email only works, right?

795
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:17,610
Scott: Because like you said, you have to, everyone's obeying the rules, but there's a mega, mega spam filter.

796
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:22,510
Rym: 99.9999% of all email is blocked by machine learning algorithms.

797
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:23,682
Scott: Yep.

798
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,277
Rym: That's the only reason email exists.

799
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,930
Rym: Why do we get so much spam, phone call spam?

800
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,844
Scott: Apparently, according to a quick Google search, 36% of email is spam.

801
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:34,931
Rym: Whoa!

802
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:42,510
Scott: I wonder if that's because so many- Their estimate's as high as 73, but no one says 99.

803
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:54,790
Rym: I wonder if what happened over time, I'm just thinking about this now, if basically bad actors who exist and try to spam like just get dev nulled everywhere, like they just go to black holes everywhere in the world.

804
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:07,470
Scott: Regardless, whether it's 36 or 73 or 99 or even two, right, it's like without spam filtering, right, people are focused a lot on like, you know, abuse and, you know, harassment and all these things.

805
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,117
Scott: And they should be, you know, with very good reason.

806
00:58:10,618 --> 00:58:15,250
Scott: But, you know, spam is the first and the biggest enemy, right?

807
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,556
Scott: It's like people complain about freedom of speech.

808
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:22,810
Scott: It's like, oh, freedom of speech people, even they aren't defending spam, even though spam is freedom of speech, right?

809
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:26,743
Rym: Of course, I very strongly believe that commercial speech is not free.

810
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:29,070
Rym: Speech is free, commercial speech is not.

811
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:39,990
Scott: The point is, is that whatever, if you're doing federation, it's not centralized, that means everyone needs to spam filter, right, on their own.

812
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,033
Rym: And guess what?

813
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:44,049
Rym: That is really hard to do on your own.

814
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:53,210
Scott: Yep, which is why a lot of the centralized thing, one of the reasons the centralized things became dominant, right, was that they weren't spamming.

815
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,719
Scott: You know, Twitter only succeeded because it solved its spam problem, right?

816
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:02,690
Scott: But now, oh, look, as Twitter is failing, spam starts coming through.

817
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:08,450
Rym: I closed my DMs on Twitter a couple days ago because suddenly I started getting a whole bunch of spam DMs out of nowhere.

818
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:13,010
Rym: That had never happened to me in the history of Twitter until this last week.

819
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,934
Scott: It's like as soon as spam comes through, everyone abandons ship, right?

820
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:31,570
Scott: So if you federate, spam, each instance in a federated system is on its own to protect itself, right, from anyone coming along with messages or requests or speaking the language of the federated protocol.

821
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:39,490
Scott: People are going to try, can come to your instance and speak whatever they want to speak and you have to be ready to handle that properly.

822
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:55,550
Rym: Now, one fear I actually have is that because federated modern solutions are going to come and go and there's going to be almost like this warring states period of sort of chaos and like Macedon will probably die and something else will replace it.

823
00:59:56,211 --> 01:00:05,190
Rym: I worry that the vast majority of people are going to see that as confusing and annoying and just go to a completely proprietary platform like TikTok and never leave.

824
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:06,649
Scott: That's fine.

825
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:12,769
Rym: Yeah, I mean, people who will do that, I don't really have any interest in communicating with or subscribing to, so that'll be fine for me.

826
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:17,950
Rym: But that will not be great for the public discourse and public interactions.

827
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:20,573
Scott: Well, I mean, for discourse, it'll be fine.

828
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:37,590
Scott: But I think the problem will be for commerce, right, is that people who are dependent on these sorts of systems for their commercial interest, right, whether it's email newsletters or post about my products I'm selling on Instagram, whatever.

829
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:48,410
Scott: It's like, you know, those people have become beholden to these systems in the way that, you know, someone making Photoshop plugins is beholden to Adobe.

830
01:00:49,090 --> 01:01:03,630
Rym: But it's even worse because anyone who uses platforms to reach audiences other than people who already know about them and follow them, that starts to overlap with spam in that it's not content that everyone necessarily wants to see in their feed.

831
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,578
Scott: It's just a real.

832
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:08,028
Scott: it's a real tough world out there.

833
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:08,640
Rym: Yeah.

834
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,370
Scott: So but anyway.

835
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,167
Rym: And it's about to get tougher like this.

836
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:15,870
Rym: There is no quick and easy answer to the fall of Twitter.

837
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:23,430
Scott: Just, you know, I guess the point is understand, you know, Federation, how it works, right?

838
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:31,370
Scott: Independent computers talking to each other versus one person runs all the computers, the end, and understand what that means for you.

839
01:01:32,553 --> 01:01:33,648
Scott: And it's the way to go.

840
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,150
Scott: But you had to be prepared for it to make it work in your favor.

841
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,980
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

842
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:50,120
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

843
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,520
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

844
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:58,440
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

845
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,660
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

846
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,716
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

847
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,959
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

848
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,140
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

849
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:24,580
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, a happy communist, a bunch of people who rarely don't want me to say their names.

850
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:34,400
Rym: Case Cair makes music, Chris Haddad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horl.

851
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,823
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

852
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:42,680
Rym: and several people who are correctly giving like a dollar or something instead of the five dollars to get me to say their names.

853
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:43,984
Rym: I'm real hungry.

854
01:02:44,004 --> 01:02:47,540
Rym: I'm just going to leave you very simply with something you really should have seen coming.

855
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,220
Rym: If you can guess what the title is going to be by the way this game will actually start.

856
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:56,480
Scott: As a matter of fact this screen also brings back memories for me as well.

857
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:02,320
Scott: I'm sure it does for some of you and I'm sure you're dating yourself by saying that you remember.

858
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,720
Scott: I don't know if you remember this particular opening.

859
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,600
Rym: This was actually on the original PlayStation game as well when it was loading the game.

860
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,899
Rym: Of course I'm not a very good player even there.

861
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,105
Rym: Game is powered by Namco.

862
01:03:15,506 --> 01:03:16,469
Rym: It's Ridge Racer.

863
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:19,138
Rym: Ridge Racer!

864
01:03:19,218 --> 01:03:19,840
Rym: Remember that one?
