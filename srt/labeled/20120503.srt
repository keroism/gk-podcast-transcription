1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,257
Scott: It's Thursday, May 3rd.

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:12,900
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:14,039
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,458
Scott: And this is TechGeeknight.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,899
Rym: Talking slow for some reason.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,620
Scott: Tonight, giving gifts to nerdy people.

7
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:25,298
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,709
Scott: So last night, we had a little game night.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,289
Scott: Played some Zendo, which apparently Natalie is the master of.

10
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:43,150
Rym: Well, the guy who wrote the game said in his blog that girls, in his opinion, many years of running this game for people are way better at Zendo than guys.

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,270
Rym: Pretty much universally.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,570
Scott: I'm just saying, Judith and Emily were not nearly as good as Natalie.

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,569
Scott: Natalie is like the queen of Zendo.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,288
Rym: Well, for now.

15
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:54,510
Scott: She exhibited the Buddha nature very extremely frequently.

16
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,870
Rym: Ah, but she did it in the Scott- The overwhelming majority of the time.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,890
Rym: I point out that she did it in the Scott Johnson fashion of sit there for 20 minutes not moving and then suddenly say the answer.

18
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:05,690
Scott: Anyway.

19
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:12,090
Scott: So I'm going home and I already knew in advance that I was missing the hockey game for game night.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,290
Scott: Which is okay because it's not like it's the finals yet, right?

21
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:16,490
Rym: I mean, it was an important game.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,889
Rym: I really wanted the Rangers to win.

23
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:23,955
Scott: So I get home and I go to ESPN.com and it says OT1, tied 1-1.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,669
Scott: And I'm like, oh shit, son.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,809
Scott: So I bring up my illegal stream on the HTPC.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,570
Scott: And basically it was in between the first and second overtimes.

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,115
Scott: Tied 1-1.

28
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,610
Rym: Now, if you're not familiar with hockey.

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,130
Scott: Well, here's the rules of hockey, right?

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,930
Scott: So in the regular season of the NHL under the current rules, which changed only a few years ago.

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:49,590
Scott: If there's a tie at the end of the third period, you go to the first overtime, which is a short overtime.

32
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,749
Scott: That's only four on four.

33
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:56,830
Scott: If there is a tie at the end of that short overtime, you then do the shootout, right?

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,850
Scott: I'm not going to go through all the shootout rules.

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,690
Rym: Yeah, when I was a kid, I was a big fan of the shootout.

36
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,908
Scott: Now I don't like the shootout.

37
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:07,229
Rym: I'm less of a fan of it, but I like it better than doing the, well, we're tied because I hate that.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,269
Rym: I hate ties.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,970
Scott: But in the playoffs, the way it works is the awesomest.

40
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:13,969
Scott: Oh, it's a tie game.

41
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,670
Scott: We play a full another 20 minute period, right?

42
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,250
Scott: And if anyone scores, they win immediately, golden goal.

43
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:29,288
Scott: And if that overtime ends and nobody has won with their golden goal, we play another 20 minute overtime period.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,010
Scott: And they just keep playing hockey, period after period, until somebody scores.

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,328
Scott: You could theoretically play forever, right?

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,250
Scott: Because you must win.

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,039
Scott: It's a playoff game.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,809
Scott: Someone must win.

49
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,370
Scott: This game went to three overtimes.

50
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,190
Rym: That is crazy.

51
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,710
Scott: And the Rangers didn't score until they were only like five minutes left.

52
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:55,389
Scott: And they were so tired and everyone was like, but then when you win that kind of game, it's the best because they won it away.

53
00:02:56,152 --> 00:03:03,250
Scott: So all the Capitals fans, when they scored that goal, were just like, oh, it was so good.

54
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:12,330
Rym: And the thing is, I didn't notice because after the game, I noticed the whole pack selling out in a very short amount of time thing.

55
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,950
Rym: So I was dealing with that and people are emailing me and I'm poking around and everything.

56
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,390
Rym: And then I see Scott's tweet.

57
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,602
Rym: He's like, OT3?

58
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:18,986
Rym: And I'm like, what?

59
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,570
Scott: If it was OT4, I was going to be like, but it was already.

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,170
Rym: There are very few OT4s in the history of hockey.

61
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,826
Scott: The game ended at midnight 30 Eastern.

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,250
Rym: I mean, I saw a Red Wings game when, oh my God, when was it?

63
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,779
Rym: It was, I don't know.

64
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,908
Rym: I saw Red Wings game a long time ago.

65
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,930
Scott: I think it was a seven o'clock game, maybe.

66
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,710
Rym: So you know what the record is for the longest overtime ever in NHL hockey?

67
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,270
Scott: What is it?

68
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,309
Rym: It was the Red Wings versus the Montreal Maroons.

69
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,630
Scott: Not the Canadians.

70
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,210
Rym: Nope.

71
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,170
Scott: This is way back in the day.

72
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,210
Rym: Montreal Maroons in 1936.

73
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,129
Scott: Yeah, so pre-NHL.

74
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:56,929
Rym: How many overtimes do you think it was?

75
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,850
Scott: I'm going to guess it's either, it's got to be a ridiculous number.

76
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,729
Scott: Ten overtimes.

77
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,950
Rym: Six, actually.

78
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,244
Rym: Okay.

79
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,409
Rym: There have only been two games ever that went to six.

80
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:05,857
Rym: Whoa.

81
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:12,909
Rym: 116 minutes and 30 seconds of overtime play and the final score...

82
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,650
Scott: Plus the 60, that doesn't count the 60 minutes of regular play?

83
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:15,846
Scott: Nope.

84
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,165
Rym: And the final score of the entire game was 1-0 Wings.

85
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,470
Rym: That, think about how long that would have gone.

86
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,749
Rym: Think about that.

87
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:26,789
Rym: Oh my gosh.

88
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,930
Scott: I don't think there were that many spectators in the days of the Montreal Maroons.

89
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:30,869
Scott: I could be wrong.

90
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,730
Rym: I've never, you know, I'm a big fan of hockey.

91
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,750
Rym: I've never heard of the Montreal Maroons.

92
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,990
Scott: Uh, you know, this was pre-Original Six.

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,590
Rym: They were the last non-Original Six team to win the Stanley Cup until the expansion.

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,091
Rym: Until the Flyers won as an expansion team in 1974.

95
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:53,322
Scott: Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:54,468
Rym: Wow.

97
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,450
Rym: You realize if I just have Wikipedia in front of me and I don't, you know, let on and I don't know stuff?

98
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,790
Rym: I sound like I know stuff.

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,670
Scott: This is why, uh, let me reveal the secret which I've revealed many times.

100
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,123
Rym: Oh, wait.

101
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,169
Rym: Is this the secret of the world or just the secret of being a tech guy?

102
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,190
Scott: The long-revealed secret.

103
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,967
Scott: The curtain has been away, you know, from covering this man behind it for years.

104
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,310
Scott: But we are only smart because we read internets.

105
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,670
Scott: We actually don't know shit.

106
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,208
Rym: Well, no, no, no.

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,730
Rym: We're smart.

108
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,690
Rym: We're not knowledgeable.

109
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,189
Scott: There's a big difference.

110
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,530
Scott: All we do is read internets.

111
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,370
Scott: That's how the source of all our knowledge.

112
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:40,009
Scott: If you also read internets as much as we do and stay connected to it constantly and have the instinct to, whenever you have any question whatsoever, to use the Google, you will be as smart or even likely smarter than we are.

113
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,410
Scott: And more knowledgeable.

114
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,787
Scott: So do that.

115
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,650
Scott: Don't listen to us because you're getting fifth-hand knowledge.

116
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,709
Rym: So it's Thursday.

117
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,230
Rym: It's the lounge on GeekNights.

118
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,250
Rym: Though I do want to say it's kind of an aside.

119
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,650
Scott: There's no lounge singers in this lounge.

120
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:03,129
Rym: The only podcasts or radio shows or anything that I listen to are... Well, I was listening to Norman Centuries, but it kind of just stopped.

121
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,210
Scott: I actually only listen to half of it.

122
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,809
Rym: I listen to every episode that's out, but it just stopped like a long time ago.

123
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,349
Rym: So I don't know what's up with that.

124
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:14,329
Rym: I listen to This American Life, but I'm going through the archives right now.

125
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,590
Rym: I listen to It's All Politics from NPR News, which is my favorite political podcast.

126
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,110
Rym: My favorite political anything.

127
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,370
Rym: And I listen to Anime World Order.

128
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:28,730
Rym: And I listen to Dave and Joel's Fast Crowded for the Gentlemen, which is the funniest thing I listen to on the internet.

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,570
Scott: I listen to Anime World Order.

130
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:38,130
Scott: I listen to ESPN, pardon the interruption because I don't have cable, so I can't watch it and listening to it is just as good and doesn't have as many commercials.

131
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,450
Scott: I listen to Judge John Hodgman.

132
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:41,949
Rym: Oh yeah, Judge John Hodgman.

133
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,750
Scott: He delivers the justice swiftly.

134
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:52,450
Scott: I listen to a few episodes of Comic Geek Speak now and then, usually the ones where they go over what's in the big, ugly catalog and what to buy.

135
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:57,403
Scott: And I listen to Atomic Tribute War 9000, which I am on sometimes.

136
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:08,990
Rym: But a fortuitous moment happened because I happened to be listening to a podcast and this great This American Life on conventions ended and it was great.

137
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,849
Scott: Was it about nerdy conventions?

138
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,230
Rym: All kinds of conventions.

139
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,569
Rym: Scott, do you know what This American Life is?

140
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:16,809
Scott: Some NPR show.

141
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:17,889
Rym: Have you ever listened to it?

142
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:20,810
Rym: Anyway, you should.

143
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,208
Rym: So it ends and Google Play or listen or whatever just picks another thing.

144
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:31,881
Rym: that's in my queue and I hear us and I'm like, "What?

145
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,226
Rym: I don't subscribe to my own

146
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:33,828
Rym: podcast.".

147
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,230
Rym: I only subscribe to like six podcasts.

148
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,830
Scott: Why would I listen to this piece of shit?

149
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:39,105
Rym: I only subscribe to like six podcasts.

150
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:39,690
Rym: How is this?

151
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,369
Rym: So then I realize...

152
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,170
Scott: I do subscribe to our show but I just delete every episode before it downloads from iTunes.

153
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,389
Scott: I just need to make sure it's working.

154
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,550
Scott: That's how I monitor.

155
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,909
Rym: So a long time ago, like many years ago, not the last Otakon we went to.

156
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:03,490
Rym: We used to have a tradition that died where we would get guest hosts to do GeekNights in our format, like straight up, like news, things of the day.

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,769
Scott: You mean we did it like a handful of times and that was it?

158
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,989
Rym: We did it a bunch of times because we did it every year.

159
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,150
Rym: See, I'm remembering this because we said these words on that show.

160
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,590
Rym: We did it every year for several years when Otakon was happening.

161
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:19,070
Scott: One year we got a whole bunch of episodes but we didn't really carry through with it that much.

162
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,350
Rym: Yeah, years before we did it but we did like one.

163
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:33,789
Rym: One year we got one but then we were in Wildwood and it didn't appear correctly and we couldn't get to any PC to re-upload it because there was no internet back then at the beach like we have now.

164
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:42,929
Rym: But anyway, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, Dave and Joel, did a Fast Karate for the GeekNights on MD Guys 2, The Death Force.

165
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,910
Rym: And I'd forgotten that this happened.

166
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,308
Rym: Like we put it in our feed and we forgot about it.

167
00:08:47,910 --> 00:09:00,549
Rym: So they put it in their feed as filler and what's really funny is that the intro is us saying, "Hey, this is guest hosts, not us, and this is

168
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:00,830
Rym: funny.".

169
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,390
Rym: And you and I are legit cracking up while we're talking about this episode of Fast Karate for the GeekNights.

170
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,248
Rym: Like you said something like, "This is one of the funniest things I've ever

171
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:10,430
Rym: heard.".

172
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,970
Rym: And you're like laughing, like actually laughing, not fake laughing.

173
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,058
Rym: So I listened to it.

174
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:16,850
Rym: God damn is it funny.

175
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,807
Scott: Even though it's so old.

176
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,490
Rym: Well because one, Dave Riley does, like Joel didn't really like know what was going on.

177
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,368
Rym: and Dave goes through our format in this very literal way.

178
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:30,380
Rym: so he's like, "So I guess now we gotta talk about, you know, just stuff.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,829
Rym: It's like the free forum opening part before we talk about the main

180
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:32,990
Rym: stuff.".

181
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:37,850
Rym: So I was doing laundry and he launches into this like mundane anecdote about laundry.

182
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,888
Scott: That's our show.

183
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:47,170
Rym: And it turns out that that anecdote is in fact wonderful and involves a human tooth and it is just off the hook from that point onward.

184
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,809
Rym: So I think it is proof that our format is good and also proof that you should listen to Fast Karate if you don't.

185
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:54,949
Rym: Because it's great.

186
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,949
Scott: Actually I used to listen to it all the time and I did not not enjoy it.

187
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,350
Rym: You should not pick it up again.

188
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,190
Scott: But I have not listened to it in a long time.

189
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,930
Rym: Listen to the most recent episode, Driving While Minota.

190
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,884
Scott: I have not listened to it since the 24 era.

191
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,396
Rym: You know how?

192
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:09,303
Rym: Driving While Black?

193
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,310
Rym: Well, Driving While Minota.

194
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:10,984
Rym: Okay.

195
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,827
Rym: So it's pretty good.

196
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,630
Scott: Do you drive in a labyrinth?

197
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:23,010
Rym: Remember in like 2005 when people would do like promos for other shows on their podcast because podcasting was a thing?

198
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,170
Rym: There was a podcasting community.

199
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,110
Scott: There are still people who are podcast listeners but they pretty much go hand in hand with radio listeners.

200
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,050
Rym: Yeah, podcasting is just a medium now.

201
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,482
Rym: But back then it was a thing.

202
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:34,350
Rym: Like there was a club.

203
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,210
Rym: Like we knew a lot of the podcasters out there and everybody had this like incestuous weird community.

204
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:40,808
Scott: Whatever.

205
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:41,349
Rym: Yeah.

206
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:42,781
Rym: Those were weird days.

207
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,709
Rym: I think back on that.

208
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,330
Rym: I mean remember we were trying to help that real radio station start a podcast?

209
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:48,818
Scott: Yeah.

210
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:49,379
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:49,970
Scott: Anyway.

212
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,608
Rym: Those were weird times.

213
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,310
Scott: So was that supposed to be your news?

214
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,721
Rym: No, that was just some stuff.

215
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,245
Rym: It's Thursday.

216
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:55,810
Rym: It's the lounge.

217
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,429
Rym: Talk about whatever I want.

218
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,290
Scott: You and your lounge.

219
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,110
Rym: You got a news?

220
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,961
Scott: I have sort of news.

221
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:01,750
Scott: It's not really news.

222
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:04,249
Scott: I think I might have mentioned this in the show before.

223
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,690
Scott: And this isn't advertising because no one paid me to do this directly.

224
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,050
Scott: But there's this website called TaskRabbit, right?

225
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,290
Scott: TaskRabbit.com.

226
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,550
Scott: And it is the awesomest website.

227
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,150
Scott: Well it's not the awesomest ever but it's really awesome.

228
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,088
Scott: The way it works is this.

229
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,229
Scott: You need somebody to do something for you.

230
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,310
Rym: Scott, that Detroit, sorry, that Red Wings game that was the longest ever was the Stanley Cup playoff game.

231
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:28,530
Scott: Oh my god.

232
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,183
Rym: Anyway.

233
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,643
Scott: Oh my god.

234
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,010
Scott: Anyway.

235
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:37,729
Scott: So let's say you need somebody to go to help you drive something home from the Ikea.

236
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,890
Scott: Or maybe you need somebody to do your laundry or clean your dishes.

237
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:50,309
Scott: Or maybe you need someone to fix something that broke in your house and you don't know how to fix it.

238
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:52,889
Scott: Or something like that.

239
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:54,909
Scott: And you don't know anyone.

240
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,627
Scott: And you don't want to pay a professional and start looking through the Yellow Pages.

241
00:11:58,668 --> 00:11:59,130
Scott: That's awful.

242
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,870
Scott: You go to TaskRabbit and you put in a task.

243
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,470
Scott: So what I needed was I needed someone to take my shit to Goodwill to donate it.

244
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,490
Scott: I had a bunch of old ass clothes I hadn't worn in years.

245
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,269
Scott: They were in my house taking up space which I don't have a lot of.

246
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,948
Scott: And I said, "Get these the fuck out of

247
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:12,070
Scott: here.".

248
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,230
Scott: But I couldn't take them out myself because there was no donation box nearby.

249
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:17,869
Scott: I no longer have a car.

250
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,093
Scott: And whatever.

251
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,390
Scott: So it was a pain in the ass to get all these things out of my house.

252
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,750
Scott: So I went and there was actually an item for donation pickup.

253
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,556
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh.

254
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:26,423
Scott: How about that?

255
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,069
Scott: I will use

256
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:27,190
Scott: that.".

257
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:30,027
Scott: So you go in and what I did is I said, "Donation

258
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:30,370
Scott: pickup.".

259
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:31,747
Scott: And they said, "Describe what you

260
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:31,970
Scott: want.".

261
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,004
Scott: I'm like, "I got two trash bags full of donation stuff.

262
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,109
Scott: Just get them out of

263
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:36,330
Scott: here.".

264
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,313
Scott: You know.

265
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,825
Scott: And take them away.

266
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:39,490
Scott: That's all I want.

267
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,820
Scott: And then it's like, "Okay.

268
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,747
Scott: How much are you willing to

269
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,050
Scott: pay?".

270
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,895
Scott: And I was like, "Man.

271
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:46,329
Scott: I would pay 40 bucks to get this shit out of

272
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,430
Scott: here.".

273
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,849
Scott: And it gives you a little graph showing you what other people have paid for the same thing.

274
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,649
Scott: So you don't have to pick some random number and don't know what to do.

275
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,501
Scott: Then it says, "Okay.

276
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,250
Scott: You have three choices.

277
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:58,088
Scott: Choice number one, we'll pick somebody for

278
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:58,229
Scott: you.".

279
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,610
Scott: And that's the recommended option.

280
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,110
Scott: Choice number two, we show you all the offers people have made and you pick one.

281
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,969
Scott: And I forget choice number three.

282
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,174
Scott: I said, "All right.

283
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,098
Rym: I'll trust you guys.

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,463
Scott: Recommended option.

285
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:10,527
Scott: You pick something for

286
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:10,628
Scott: me.".

287
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,610
Scott: So like an hour later, it texts me and it's this nice lady.

288
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,597
Scott: And she's just like, "Hey.

289
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:17,524
Scott: I'll do it.

290
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:17,665
Scott: 22

291
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:17,806
Scott: bucks.".

292
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:19,818
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh.

293
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:21,065
Scott: Okay.".

294
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,709
Scott: And then she texted me whatever and emailed.

295
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,296
Scott: And she's like, "All right.

296
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,564
Scott: I'll come over tomorrow at

297
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,370
Scott: 6.30.".

298
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,919
Scott: I'm like, "All

299
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:29,122
Scott: right.".

300
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,609
Scott: She showed up at 6.30, this nice friendly lady with a little car.

301
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,941
Scott: I brought the stuff downstairs, put it in her car.

302
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,585
Scott: She was friendly.

303
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,270
Scott: She took it away.

304
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:40,850
Scott: And then I went online and I just said I had to click a button that says she did it.

305
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:44,430
Scott: And then I typed in a number of dollars for a tip and then I pushed okay.

306
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,067
Scott: And that was that.

307
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,289
Scott: And it was totally awesome.

308
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:57,587
Scott: So if you got stuff that you need doing, maybe you have to do something like a big cleaning and you need someone to come help you.

309
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:04,370
Scott: Or maybe just something that's small, something that you need a small repair.

310
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,281
Scott: The carpenter is not going to come and do that.

311
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,609
Scott: It's too small a job for him.

312
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,108
Scott: These kinds of things.

313
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,809
Scott: Help carrying something to the dump because it's too heavy and you're all alone.

314
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,440
Scott: You know, this kind of thing.

315
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:16,890
Scott: Use this website.

316
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:25,750
Scott: And the link I'm going to give you, and this is the part where I make money, because I use them, they said, "Scott R. is using TaskRabbit to get all kinds of tasks done.

317
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,975
Scott: We think you'll like it too.

318
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,643
Scott: Use my promo code,

319
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,508
Scott: P-A-L-2-8-3.".

320
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,870
Rym: Wait a minute, Captain Advertising.

321
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,490
Scott: Oh, 106.

322
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,133
Rym: Wait a minute.

323
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,530
Rym: Wait one fucking minute, Captain.

324
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,650
Rym: Captain, there will never be ads on the show.

325
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,189
Rym: It's not an ad because they didn't call me and ask for it.

326
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,475
Scott: It is from me, so it is not paid by them.

327
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,675
Scott: It was only an ad.

328
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,790
Scott: if they call up and buy the ad specifically.

329
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,349
Scott: Anyway, the point is, if you use the promo code or the link...

330
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,950
Rym: You've given me shit for less.

331
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,693
Scott: Maybe.

332
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:57,400
Scott: It's buzz.

333
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,329
Scott: marketing is what it is.

334
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:03,070
Scott: You get 10 bucks and I also get 10 bucks.

335
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,809
Scott: Hey, that's not bad.

336
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:21,530
Rym: So, actually, that is a pretty good segue because what I want to talk about a little bit is this Australian startup that straight up pays you if you will tweet and/or astroturf to your close personal friends' products.

337
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,270
Scott: That's bullshit.

338
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,182
Rym: So, what do you mean?

339
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:23,470
Scott: it's bullshit?

340
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,850
Scott: If you sign up for that, I would kick you in the junk.

341
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,210
Rym: So, here's what's interesting.

342
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:29,789
Scott: How do they prove that you did it?

343
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:38,350
Rym: So, they pay you based on how well you do it, like how many of your friends follow through and all sorts of stuff.

344
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:44,870
Rym: And I didn't read all the details of it, but what I'm more interested in is not this, because astroturfing, not a new thing.

345
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:45,588
Scott: No kidding.

346
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,789
Rym: Not a new debate, not a new topic.

347
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,060
Scott: But astroturfing to your closest friends is like, "You're not even a friend anymore.

348
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:51,908
Scott: Just get the fuck

349
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:52,089
Scott: out.".

350
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,605
Rym: Yeah, so what's interesting is the first comment on.

351
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:58,390
Rym: Slashdot says, and I quote, "This should be considered illegal.

352
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,739
Rym: This is advertising.

353
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,850
Rym: It is also a lie.

354
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,287
Rym: That's fraud, plain and simple, and it is modded up plus five

355
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:04,710
Rym: insightful.".

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,106
Rym: You know what?

357
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,143
Rym: It should not be illegal for me.

358
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:08,423
Scott: That wasn't a lie.

359
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,449
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess he... I don't know.

360
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,830
Rym: Basically, most of the comments about this...

361
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,510
Scott: The point is if you treat your friends like that, if you try to exploit your friends for money, you're not a friend.

362
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,468
Rym: You're front-running me.

363
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,390
Rym: What I noticed in all the discussions about this is that people are really mad that this exists.

364
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,990
Rym: Now, I'm not mad that it exists at all, because this stuff has existed forever.

365
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,268
Rym: This is nothing new.

366
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,550
Rym: What I'm amazed at is how mad other people are about it, and I wonder why.

367
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:45,389
Rym: Does this mean that people have friends who they think will actually do this to them, and that they would still want to continue to be friends with them?

368
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,510
Scott: We have seen very many instances of people with shitty friends and family.

369
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,730
Rym: I mean, I had a friend, quote, "friend" in high school, and he was an okay guy.

370
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,449
Rym: He had a ferret who was smarter than he was, but I digress.

371
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,830
Rym: And he got into that Amway scam.

372
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:02,509
Rym: Big scam.

373
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:11,008
Rym: And the day he brought that up and tried to sell stuff to me, I was basically like, "Yeah, if you bring that up again ever, I'm pretty much not going to talk to you ever

374
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:11,269
Rym: again.".

375
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,470
Rym: And I never really talked to him ever again, because he tried to turn that into a career.

376
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:16,669
Scott: All righty.

377
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,410
Rym: Along with his brother.

378
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,188
Scott: Yep.

379
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:18,936
Rym: Yeah.

380
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,240
Rym: But the anger at this.

381
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,645
Rym: People were like, "You should block all the URLs.

382
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,387
Rym: You should do everything.

383
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,365
Rym: You should ban these people if you're an

384
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:29,768
Rym: ISP.".

385
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:36,830
Rym: People are really pissed about this, and I really don't understand why, because we already have ad block.

386
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:44,110
Rym: Are there so many people who have such caustic social relationships to where this is actually a concern?

387
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,690
Scott: Yes.

388
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:45,885
Rym: Yeah.

389
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:48,430
Rym: It's not a big question.

390
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,670
Rym: It's just a question, and the answer is yes.

391
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,930
Scott: Is this why so many people need to watch ponies?

392
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:02,870
Rym: If you're mad about this, it's because either ... It's kind of like the people who get mad about seeing an ad as opposed to just blocking it.

393
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:08,129
Rym: These are the people who need to block spam because they know they'll buy stuff from spam if they see it.

394
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,990
Rym: And I find that whole side conversation hilarious, so I wanted to bring it to light.

395
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,728
Rym: That's all I had to say.

396
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,230
Rym: Okay.

397
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,640
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

398
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:25,499
Rym: Our friend Chase found this.

399
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,819
Rym: I'm going to give credit where credit is due, and he showed it to us.

400
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,763
Rym: We were having a night of, oh my God, internet clips, and ...

401
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:33,439
Scott: You mean that every night?

402
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,639
Rym: You mean the thing we need to turn into a legitimate game, because it's basically just an internet dick-waving contest.

403
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,700
Scott: It's a difficult technological problem.

404
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Rym: Yeah, I know.

405
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,780
Rym: It's also a difficult game to play, because most of the people who try to play this ...

406
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,059
Scott: Are not as connected to the internet and have less ammo than we do.

407
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:59,220
Rym: Or it's not just a matter of knowing funny things on the internet, because a video that's funny about Patrick Stewart will win for me, but won't win for Scott.

408
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,159
Rym: You've got to have something that will win for the majority of the audience, or you lose.

409
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:14,859
Rym: So we were playing this, and I brought out some old gems, like those Russian pranks, or the rogue trumpeter, which, you know, those are my go-tos, because I know people haven't seen them.

410
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:22,440
Rym: And Chase won the game by bringing out what I can only describe as an act of genius.

411
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,976
Rym: This is someone who has taken a bunch of scenes from Star Wars, and nothing has changed.

412
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:39,920
Rym: Is played by Arnold, as in characters that Arnold played in other movies.

413
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:40,662
Scott: Right.

414
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:44,200
Scott: It's not a guy reading Darth Vader's lines in an Arnold voice.

415
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,360
Scott: It is ...

416
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,690
Rym: Welcome to the party, Richter.

417
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,020
Rym: See you at the party, Richter.

418
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,741
Scott: Right.

419
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:56,516
Scott: They took audio clips from Arnold movies and replaced Vader's dialogue with dialogue.

420
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,340
Scott: that sort of makes sense.

421
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:00,761
Rym: No, what's funny is ...

422
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:03,500
Scott: But everyone else is still saying their original Star Wars lines.

423
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:10,780
Rym: This shows a sort of phenomenon that I've noticed from a long time ago, because I was really into audio and audio visualizations.

424
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,420
Rym: I promise this will link back up, when I was in high school.

425
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,220
Rym: So I would use different visualizers, and I'd listen to a song while watching a visualization of that song.

426
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:24,100
Rym: And I would notice very strong correlations.

427
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:35,440
Rym: And I found a visualizer that claimed that it would analyze the audio and do visualizations that were relevant to what was going on in the audio on a high level.

428
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,548
Rym: So yeah, it was open source.

429
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,300
Rym: I looked at the code, and it was random bullshit.

430
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:44,060
Rym: But if I showed it to other people, they would still see these strong correlations.

431
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:52,620
Rym: I bring that up, because if you watch this, and it's just Star Wars, Darth Vader's body language is very menacing.

432
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:01,420
Rym: If you watch this with Arnold doing the lines, the body language still seems to match up with the lines, and it's hilarious instead.

433
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,076
Scott: That's right.

434
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,680
Rym: So, you never notice ...

435
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,180
Scott: Your brain does things, we know this.

436
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,540
Rym: You never notice in Star Wars how much Darth Vader's kinda just shuffling his shoulders back and forth.

437
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:16,520
Rym: But when it's Arnold, suddenly he's just like ... And it's brilliant.

438
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,418
Rym: That cape.

439
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,540
Rym: It also made me realize that I have a scarily encyclopedic knowledge of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.

440
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,100
Rym: Who doesn't?

441
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,787
Rym: I mean, I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "True lies.

442
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:27,489
Rym: True lies.

443
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,612
Rym: Kindergarten cop.

444
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,554
Rym: Commando.

445
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,076
Rym: True

446
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:30,477
Rym: lies.".

447
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,312
Rym: Anyway, this is great.

448
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:36,780
Scott: My thing is not nearly as great.

449
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,355
Scott: There's this guy on the internet, his name is Dr.

450
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:40,040
Scott: Nerdlove.

451
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,720
Scott: I don't know how much he can help you with, you know, love.

452
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,220
Scott: But anyway, he's got a thousand likes on Facebook, so he's kinda popular, right?

453
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:49,706
Scott: He wrote this article.

454
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,660
Scott: that's actually a really good article.

455
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,330
Scott: That is, "Learn from this.

456
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:54,417
Scott: Scott Pilgrim vs.

457
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:54,517
Scott: the

458
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:54,799
Scott: World."

459
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,860
Scott: And he goes with the in-depth analysis on the romantic tangles and exploits of Scott Pilgrim.

460
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,599
Rym: I wonder if it agrees with what I think.

461
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:07,796
Scott: He's basically teaching you all sorts of lessons, like, "Don't date a girl named

462
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:08,378
Scott: Knives."

463
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:11,569
Scott: "Nobody likes the

464
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:12,417
Scott: man-child."

465
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:13,728
Scott: "You are not the center of the

466
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:14,273
Scott: universe."

467
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:15,656
Scott: Et cetera.

468
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:16,171
Rym: But I am.

469
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,620
Scott: And, you know, he's not focusing on the manga or the movie.

470
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,446
Scott: Manga.

471
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:21,459
Scott: The book or the movie.

472
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,420
Scott: He sorta, you know, mixes it all up all over the place, right?

473
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Scott: You know, just taking in everything.

474
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:32,440
Scott: And, you know, true or not, you know, correct or not, whatever.

475
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:37,018
Scott: It's a lot of fun to read this, and it was a good read, so read it.

476
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:52,120
Rym: So, in the meta moment, we will be at, not this weekend, but next weekend, May 12th only, though the convention is the 11th and the 12th, Zenkai Con 2012 at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center at Oaks, Pennsylvania.

477
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,278
Scott: We're doing two- You better have breakfast past 11 AM, bitches.

478
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:58,140
Rym: That's not gonna happen.

479
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,179
Rym: We are doing two lectures there.

480
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,020
Scott: We are- They're sucked.

481
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,160
Rym: I forget which ones we're doing.

482
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:12,480
Rym: One of them involves Dude Bro, "My shit is fucked up, so I have to shoot/slice you two at straight-up dog time," and My Little Pony.

483
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:14,620
Rym: I think that'll actually be a pretty good one.

484
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,580
Rym: The other one's either Diamonds in the Raw for anime you should see, or maybe it's motivational anime, I forget.

485
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:19,976
Rym: Whatever.

486
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:21,439
Rym: But anyway, it'll be fun.

487
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,780
Rym: It's a smaller con, but it's pretty big, actually.

488
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,840
Scott: And the tabletop gaming is not half bad.

489
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,087
Rym: Yep.

490
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,039
Rym: Some of our friends run it, and our big staff at it.

491
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,100
Rym: So if you want to hang out with us at a con, and in an area, this is one of the best cons to do it, because we're not busy.

492
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,079
Rym: We have two events to run.

493
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,400
Rym: We're not staff.

494
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,400
Rym: We have zero responsibilities.

495
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,340
Scott: And there aren't a lot of other events that we're gonna try to go to.

496
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,940
Scott: It's not like PAX, where it's like, "Sorry, can't hang out," going to the keynote.

497
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,896
Scott: "Sorry, can't hang

498
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:49,080
Scott: out."

499
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,354
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,360
Rym: And it's not like Kinetic Con, where if a panelist catches fire, we have to deal with that shit.

501
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:58,500
Rym: If the convention catches fire, we will not do shit.

502
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:00,779
Rym: Other than continue to hang out.

503
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,500
Rym: And maybe, you know, we can go out and get some dinner, hang out.

504
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,777
Rym: We'll see.

505
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,839
Rym: Let us know if you're gonna be there.

506
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:06,094
Rym: Don't be shy.

507
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,238
Scott: Anything else?

508
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,835
Rym: So not too long after that, July 13th through 15th.

509
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:12,399
Scott: Too soon.

510
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,159
Rym: Kinetic Con.

511
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,760
Rym: We are responsible for all the panels, workshops, and lectures at that convention.

512
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:21,960
Rym: We're gonna be there, doing some of our own panels, lectures, and workshops.

513
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,260
Rym: It's a pretty fun con.

514
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:28,180
Rym: It's pretty big, relative to most cons, but it's not a-- The tabletop gaming is excellent.

515
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Scott: And in fact, the tabletop gaming library is the best.

516
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,139
Scott: Better than PAX, East, West--.

517
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:38,560
Rym: Kinetic Con's tabletop is better than MagFest, PAX, any con I've been to.

518
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:45,940
Scott: To make it even better, if you play games in the Kinetic Con tabletop, this is a little-known fact, you earn tickets just by playing, right?

519
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:48,660
Rym: And with those tickets-- You can get, like, Dominion.

520
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:58,320
Scott: You can get real, expensive, brand-new board games, but with those tickets the same way that you get chintzy plastic frogs at the arcade with tickets from the, you know, skeeball.

521
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,120
Scott: And it doesn't take that many tickets.

522
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,814
Scott: Like, ten tickets, you can get, like, a $40 game.

523
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:13,438
Scott: If you love tabletop games of the awesome kind, just go to Kinetic Con, and if you do nothing else, even though there is plenty other things to do, like Super Art Fight-- Aw, shit.

524
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:24,656
Scott: You can just play tabletop games the whole time and go home with a whole bunch of free tabletop games, and it'll only cost you the price of admission, and if you even take home one game, that's like getting free admission, right?

525
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,579
Scott: I mean, what does it cost to get in there, 50, 60 bucks, something like that, for three days?

526
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:30,200
Scott: Uh, I don't remember.

527
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,120
Scott: So if you win a $40 game, it's like, well, it's like you're paying you with board games to play board games.

528
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:37,119
Scott: It doesn't get better than that.

529
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,560
Rym: Yeah, and we have some really good panel content, so, uh, yeah.

530
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,113
Scott: Yeah, and the book club book is 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami.

531
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,179
Scott: It's really popular and shit, that's why we're reading it.

532
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:54,700
Rym: Also, Otakon, we submitted a bunch of lectures, so if you want us to be there, tell them.

533
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,953
Rym: If we're not there, it's all them, not us.

534
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,270
Rym: PAX Prime is sold out.

535
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:01,580
Rym: I hope you got a ticket.

536
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:04,720
Rym: They sold out in a couple hours.

537
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,478
Scott: Like we told you.

538
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,925
Rym: We'll probably be there.

539
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,340
Rym: We've got some panels, some lectures in the works.

540
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:18,868
Rym: Brand new stuff, looking pretty good, I think, and I did confirm, just for anyone who's interested, PAX Dev is happening.

541
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:24,839
Rym: They just haven't announced all the details yet, but absolutely confirmed there will be a PAX Dev before PAX Prime this year.

542
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:28,180
Rym: I think I'm going to attend, even if I'm not lecturing.

543
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:28,857
Scott: I may or may not.

544
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,220
Rym: Because I'm kind of the boss now, like I can take time off work without it being a big deal.

545
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:39,320
Rym: So I'm going to go because, one, I can hang out in Seattle for a few extra days.

546
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:53,300
Rym: Two, if any indication from last year is true, the people I know who went to PAX Dev said that it was pretty good, but they really wanted to play games afterward, because there's a lot of downtime in the evening.

547
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:59,740
Rym: And there were not enough hardcore board gamers, but there is a small contingent of hardcore board gamers there.

548
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,158
Rym: And I think that is when I can play Eclipse in Puerto Rico and T&E.

549
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,119
Scott: So anyway, I just want to add one more thing about the book club, right?

550
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,880
Scott: I've been using various different logical ways to choose my next book choice, right?

551
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:20,680
Scott: And even though Rym has the next choice, I'm going to tell you right now I have decided on only one method of book choosing for the foreseeable future.

552
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:21,736
Scott: Uh-huh.

553
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,898
Scott: You know what that method is?

554
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:23,480
Rym: Random?

555
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:24,117
Scott: No.

556
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,220
Rym: The top hundred whatever books of all time?

557
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:27,576
Rym: No.

558
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:29,085
Rym: Anything?

559
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,350
Rym: I don't know.

560
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:29,920
Rym: What are you going to do?

561
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,700
Scott: Book I already own and have not read.

562
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:32,802
Rym: Oh.

563
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:36,160
Rym: That's a good philosophy.

564
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,655
Scott: That's what I'm doing from now on.

565
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,219
Rym: Uh, I think I'm doing the same.

566
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:41,818
Scott: Right.

567
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,840
Rym: That's uh, you're a genius, Scott.

568
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,208
Scott: Yup.

569
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,960
Scott: So this episode is about geek gifting, right?

570
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,200
Scott: So I had this idea and this idea came to me because my birthday was recent, carousel time.

571
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,699
Scott: I'm already dead, if you didn't know.

572
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,385
Scott: Oh my.

573
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:58,399
Rym: Oh, she did.

574
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:03,640
Scott: Uh, and you know, my mom thought she was cute and she sent me a birthday card.

575
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,399
Scott: Just sort of generic and I shoved it in with all the other cards in the box.

576
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,740
Scott: Uh, but in that card, there was some pony stickers because my mom is like that.

577
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,480
Rym: You know what's interesting?

578
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,776
Rym: Just because you bring that up.

579
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:26,740
Rym: Pretty much every card, gift, anything I've gotten since My Little Pony became a thing and it was obvious that I was a big fan of it, has had a pony thing in it, so.

580
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,780
Scott: Now, you know, I appreciate this gift of pony stickers, right?

581
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:38,660
Scott: Because number one, it shows that my mom is not, you know, a stupid mom or I don't have bad parents like I see on the internet, people complaining about so often.

582
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,123
Rym: What do you know?

583
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:40,760
Rym: You see that through Daryl Surratt's Twitter.

584
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,580
Scott: I'm just saying, there's a lot of them out there.

585
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:50,560
Scott: I see a lot of stories like parents thinking their kids are gay because they're watching ponies or you know, all kinds of bad stuff, right?

586
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,140
Rym: You saw the Daryl Surratt ad, he doubled down, now it's fuck you grandma.

587
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,439
Scott: I know, but to have parents who not only are like okay with, you know, watching ponies, but are like we'll send you pony stickers and be like lolz.

588
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,439
Rym: Dude, your mom watched Radio Free Equestria.

589
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,580
Scott: Yeah, that is some good parents right there.

590
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,140
Scott: So anyway, but the thing is, they were the wrong ponies.

591
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,560
Scott: They were third gen pony stickers.

592
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,219
Rym: Wait, oh, you know what that's like?

593
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:32,839
Rym: So let's say that I am going, I am, you know, a knight and I'm an emissary of some fantasy empire and I'm going to some other fantasy empire in a Forgotten Islands kind of world and I bring diamonds as a gift, but diamonds are bad in that place because diamonds are what the evil god,

594
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:33,160
Scott: you know.

595
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,739
Rym: Nerds care about that.

596
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,280
Scott: And you know, this reminded me of another similar incident, you know, to get again to show how my mom is cool, right?

597
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Scott: When I was a kid, I would buy the comic books at the comic book store when comic books only cost $1.25 and there were only two comic books that I read in the 90s, Adjectiveless X-Men and Spider-Man 2099. and my mom, she, you know, and my mom is somewhat nerdy, right?

598
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Scott: She likes the old horror stuff, she likes James Bond, she likes Zatoichi, you know, she's kind of nerdy.

599
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:12,560
Scott: But she thought, hey, you know, she must have been in the mall or something and went to the comic book store and she knew that I read Spider-Man 2099, she knew that much, right?

600
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:14,959
Scott: And she bought the issue that was there.

601
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,700
Scott: I think it was issue 10, but I already had issue 10.

602
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,579
Scott: I needed issue 11, which is not out yet.

603
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:28,440
Rym: My parents actually had a lot better luck in that front because they, one, I mean, my mom, like, they made me watch Vampire Hunter D. Yeah, that's true.

604
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:29,320
Rym: So they got me into anime.

605
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,858
Scott: That's true.

606
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,059
Rym: So then they'd be like, let's buy some anime.

607
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,140
Scott: I mean, it was easy to get me gifts.

608
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,240
Scott: We do not take our geekery supporting parents for granted.

609
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:37,475
Scott: No.

610
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,140
Scott: Yet, at the same time, even geekery supporting parents will get it wrong.

611
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Scott: I guess they couldn't get it wrong with Magic Cards, right?

612
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:49,140
Scott: You can't go wrong there, if that's what you want.

613
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:50,459
Scott: But the point is this.

614
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:01,115
Scott: It is really, if you are not a nerd who is very, very close to the other nerd that you are gifting for, it is next to impossible to get them a gift.

615
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:02,460
Scott: that is correct.

616
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:11,060
Scott: Unless it is incredibly expensive or they themselves lack money and cannot buy nerdy things for themselves.

617
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,340
Rym: So let's take the example of the nerd first.

618
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,180
Rym: Like the guy who was hardcore about one thing.

619
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,660
Scott: So he's a Trekkie.

620
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,498
Scott: We'll go with the Trekkie.

621
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,339
Rym: That's the easiest example.

622
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,260
Rym: Alright, so one.

623
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,813
Rym: Are you also a Trekkie or Trekker?

624
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,920
Rym: Do you even realize that they care about the difference?

625
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,860
Scott: I do know they care about the difference, but I admit I do not know the difference.

626
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,740
Scott: I do know there are two words and they mean different things.

627
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,100
Rym: So I'll say this.

628
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Rym: If you're not on the same level of them, you're already ten years too early.

629
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:39,980
Scott: Right.

630
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,120
Scott: And it's like, okay, I know that that guy likes Star Trek.

631
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:53,780
Rym: Alright, so what are you going to possibly know about and find that he doesn't already own or chooses not to own because it's a bad thing like a G3 pony?

632
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,720
Scott: Exactly, right.

633
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,656
Scott: I could go and get something like, you know, I don't...

634
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,340
Rym: Oh great, a bust of Picard.

635
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,831
Rym: I'll put it next to my other bust of Picard.

636
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,520
Rym: that's signed by Patrick Stewart.

637
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:02,877
Rym: Right.

638
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Scott: It's like, I don't know much about Star Trek, but I am nerdy, so I know some things about it.

639
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,760
Scott: And it's like, what could I think of to get someone who likes Star Trek?

640
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,460
Scott: I could get you like, you know, the Enterprise Technical Manual.

641
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,319
Rym: He's got that.

642
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:14,999
Scott: He's got that.

643
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,920
Scott: I could get you the box of Next Generation DVD, but that's just gotten Netflix and they got that.

644
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,979
Rym: I guess there's two directions of what you can get him, but they are highly dependent upon knowing what that thing is.

645
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:31,000
Scott: You have to know what the guy's got.

646
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,900
Scott: Maybe I'll get him like a model of the Voyager, but he hates Voyager.

647
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:38,120
Rym: My example is going to be, I was going to make it, I was going to double down.

648
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:38,896
Rym: So check this.

649
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:45,000
Rym: So one of the best things you can get, a nerd, is a thing that isn't commonly available.

650
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,140
Rym: Like, get something signed by someone that they're not likely to meet.

651
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,278
Scott: But even then, they might not like that person.

652
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,880
Rym: So I come with a poster of the Voyager cast signed by whoever played Janeway.

653
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:02,059
Rym: And they burn it, you know, after I leave because they hate Janeway and they're a Kirk fan or whatever.

654
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,700
Scott: Nerds, it's because someone is a geek, that means that they have a particular taste.

655
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:12,880
Scott: And if they have money, that means that they are already indulging in this thing that they like so much.

656
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,260
Scott: So to find the thing that they want, right?

657
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:27,500
Scott: You have to be incredibly intimate with the person so much that you know what they've already got, what they want, the specific details of their likes and dislikes of that thing.

658
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:34,480
Scott: And in that case, it's very likely that the things that they do not have that they want are very, very expensive.

659
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:39,420
Scott: Like, I know some gifts I could get for some people, but it's like, yeah, that dude collects Avengers.

660
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,300
Scott: He's missing issues two and three.

661
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,200
Rym: Let's see Scott Chase.

662
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,658
Scott: Avengers two and three, what the fuck am I gonna buy?

663
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,800
Rym: Scott, our friend Chase Gordon, I'd get him a bunch of red cameras.

664
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,991
Scott: Yeah, sure, right?

665
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:51,180
Scott: But you can't afford that.

666
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,895
Scott: You know, it's like, so what are you gonna get him that he would like?

667
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:56,000
Scott: that doesn't cost a lot of money?

668
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,658
Scott: It's incredibly difficult to do.

669
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:05,660
Rym: Well, let's cover it because I guess a good example of this, you know, we're talking in terms of stereotypical nerderies and geekeries, Star Trek and whatever.

670
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,100
Rym: A wine aficionado is a good example because many of you probably don't know a lot about wine.

671
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:11,780
Rym: I know a pretty good amount about wine.

672
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:21,659
Rym: I have some co-workers, we were at a fancy wine tasting some time ago, and one of my co-workers, you know, the sommelier brings out a wine and starts explaining it.

673
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:28,588
Rym: And one of my co-workers says, I've actually been to that vineyard and he knew the guy who runs it and his family knows them and he's toured.

674
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,455
Rym: He knew a lot.

675
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,619
Scott: Was he pretending to know?

676
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,239
Rym: No, he really knew.

677
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,280
Scott: Using the Rym trick?

678
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:35,898
Rym: No, he really knew.

679
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:49,820
Rym: So, what could I, I like wine, I know a little bit about wine, but my knowledge of wine compared to him is like Scott's knowledge of Star Trek compared to a Star Trek guy.

680
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,280
Rym: That's right.

681
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:59,960
Rym: So, what wine related gift could I possibly, possibly get him that I would even know to get?

682
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,280
Scott: Alright, you could get, A, one of the world's premier wines, right?

683
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,440
Scott: Or like some incredibly famous epic wine for a zillion dollars.

684
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Rym: Okay, so now, one, I have to research heavily.

685
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,480
Scott: Well, if you read volume three of Drops of God, you would know like the five premier number one A+ wines of France to get.

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,059
Rym: It's just like saying, oh, if a guy has a car.

687
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,879
Scott: Get him a Ferrari.

688
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,746
Rym: Get him a Ferrari.

689
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,140
Rym: That's exactly what I was going to say.

690
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,380
Rym: So, that implies a wealth disparity where you, the gift giver, have more money than the other person.

691
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,348
Rym: And even then, you have to know their taste.

692
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:34,299
Rym: So, you get a Ferrari for someone who's legless.

693
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:34,720
Rym: Great.

694
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,060
Scott: Maybe he wants Lamborghini, he hates Ferrari.

695
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:45,620
Rym: I get like the rarest, most famous red wine for a guy who actually hates red wine or hates that particular vineyard or already has that wine.

696
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,119
Scott: Yep.

697
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,320
Rym: Or, someone who's really into wine but doesn't collect wine.

698
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:56,040
Rym: So, I get him a fancy wine that he can't drink because it's rare and he can't store it because he doesn't have a wine cellar.

699
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,613
Scott: Yep.

700
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,050
Rym: Well, he's just going to resell it.

701
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,039
Rym: I might as well get him cash.

702
00:35:59,660 --> 00:35:59,741
Scott: Yeah.

703
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,700
Scott: It is incredibly difficult.

704
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:09,140
Scott: So, what do you actually do when you are in a situation where you must get a gift for a nerdy person?

705
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,640
Scott: Well, one, you could, like we said, have enough knowledge that you could get them a gift.

706
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,283
Rym: Well, let's cover all those cases first.

707
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:25,840
Rym: Let's assume that you're giving a gift to someone who has equal knowledge of the thing and you know each other well enough to know what the person already has.

708
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,060
Scott: Oh, then it's really easy to get them something because you probably know the exact thing that's missing in their collection.

709
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:38,120
Scott: Or, you know, you don't actually get them, you know, it's harder when you have to get a gift for a particular time, like a birthday or a wedding.

710
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:43,997
Scott: It's easier if it's just like you're walking around town, you happen to see something and you're like, "Oh my God, that would be great for

711
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:44,539
Scott: so-and-so.".

712
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,546
Rym: Ah, so let's up the difficulty.

713
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:53,060
Rym: They are a person who has money similar to the amount of money you have.

714
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,300
Rym: Meaning, sure, you can identify a ton of things they don't have, but because they have money and you have money, they're like us.

715
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,210
Rym: Let's say they buy everything they want.

716
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,357
Rym: That isn't ludicrous.

717
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:06,340
Rym: Now what?

718
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,769
Rym: They own everything you could possibly think of.

719
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,640
Rym: that is in any way like purchasable on Amazon.

720
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:19,800
Scott: You would have to go outside the box, but it would take a great deal of time and effort and you may not even be able to come up with something.

721
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,609
Rym: That's where you've got to get like the custom thing.

722
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,520
Rym: Like, for example, My Little Pony, right?

723
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:25,560
Rym: So if someone's really into My Little Pony...

724
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,340
Scott: You can get someone to commission something on DeviantArt.

725
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,722
Rym: Exactly.

726
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:31,220
Rym: They've already got all the shitty toys that Hasbro allowed.

727
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,320
Rym: You've got to commission like the real toys made by hand by someone that no one else can get.

728
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,267
Scott: Or, of course, make it yourself, right?

729
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:41,820
Scott: Like the best gift I ever probably got was the hockey thing from Rowe.

730
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,060
Scott: That is a pretty good thing.

731
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,720
Scott: It's like that is not something that I knew I wanted, could have bought on Amazon, or could have imagined.

732
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,309
Rym: Ah, you've hit on the rub, the important part.

733
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,940
Rym: The something I knew I wanted.

734
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,340
Rym: Because a nerd who is committed and has enough money...

735
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,139
Scott: Knows what they want.

736
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,439
Rym: And they buy everything they want, or they at least know it.

737
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:11,779
Rym: If you can give someone a gift, who is a nerd, that is related to their nerdery, but is tangential in the sense that it's not something that existed or they would ever have considered getting.

738
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,259
Rym: Like they would never even think to get the thing.

739
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,360
Rym: That is pretty much the best possible gift, short of something that is that that you made yourself.

740
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:22,728
Scott: Right, so for the Star Trek person, right?

741
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,956
Scott: Try to think of some other hobby they have.

742
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,180
Scott: Maybe they like to swim.

743
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,348
Scott: Get them like a Star Trek bathing suit.

744
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,616
Scott: They would never think of that in a million years, right?

745
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,760
Scott: But it probably exists.

746
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:37,175
Scott: Or like a floating enterprise raft for the pool.

747
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:38,600
Scott: That probably exists.

748
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:43,253
Rym: Or a fan mashup of all of them like getting ready to swim.

749
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,100
Rym: Maybe they're into like ancient ships.

750
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,520
Rym: Or like, you know, so it's a bunch of like Star Trek characters rowing a trireme.

751
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:52,418
Scott: Yeah, or maybe make a model enterprise and put it in a bottle.

752
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,760
Rym: Ah, not bad.

753
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,286
Scott: Yeah, like that.

754
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:56,219
Scott: How about that?

755
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,280
Rym: Alright, so what if you don't know shit about their hobby?

756
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,719
Scott: You don't know shit at all?

757
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,940
Rym: Like you're trying to get a gift for someone where they're super into something.

758
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,499
Scott: And you don't know anything about it.

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,370
Rym: Well, they're a nerd.

760
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,160
Rym: So you know that this is their primary thing.

761
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,315
Scott: So I know that they like Star Trek, but that's it.

762
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:15,860
Scott: That's all I know.

763
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,859
Scott: That's all you know about them.

764
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,197
Rym: They're the kind of person who is identified.

765
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:20,697
Scott: So let's switch it to...

766
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,551
Rym: Their identity is defined by that.

767
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,880
Rym: Because I'm starting to lean toward that as a nerd.

768
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,260
Rym: A nerd is someone for whom their public identity is defined by their likes.

769
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,660
Scott: So let's switch it to like Buffy the Vampire Slayer because I don't actually know anything about it other than there's vampires and there's a girl who fights them.

770
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,440
Rym: And Joss Whedon.

771
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,531
Scott: And Joss Whedon wrote it.

772
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:39,099
Scott: That's all I know.

773
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:44,360
Scott: So I know that someone, their favorite thing in the world is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but that's all I know about it.

774
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,839
Rym: So you're probably going to end up doing what your mom did where, "Oh, I'll get him this Buffy board game that I

775
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:51,200
Rym: found.".

776
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,054
Rym: He hates board games and that game sucks and it's not the right Buffy.

777
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,140
Rym: It's from the show, not the movie.

778
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,791
Rym: He actually only cares about the movie.

779
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:57,839
Rym: But you don't know that.

780
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,231
Rym: So that fail.

781
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:01,177
Rym: That's G3 ponies.

782
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,885
Scott: You have to get something.

783
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,680
Scott: They have to like something else in their life, right?

784
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,300
Scott: There has to be something else that you can get them outside of that department without going to the gift card route.

785
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,666
Rym: I think this lends itself to a secondary problem.

786
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:22,076
Rym: There is a situation where there are people you know, you're obligated to give a gift to, you know they're nerdy because almost everyone's nerdy about something.

787
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:22,880
Rym: It might be football.

788
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,779
Rym: But you don't know enough about the thing and because of the nature of your relationship, you only know them as a fan of that thing.

789
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,246
Rym: Like buying a gift for coworkers.

790
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:35,931
Rym: They're into football.

791
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,117
Rym: I'll get a football thing.

792
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:38,478
Scott: Sportsball.

793
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:45,900
Scott: You know, regardless of geekery, a general gift giving strategy is to get a thing that anyone could like.

794
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,423
Scott: Spot it.

795
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,591
Scott: Just get spotted for anybody.

796
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:51,157
Scott: It doesn't matter.

797
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:51,940
Scott: Get them a spot it.

798
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Rym: I remember way back at IBM we had this gift giving thing and I went super generic and got a really nice bottle of wine that was like generic.

799
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,347
Rym: Like easy drinking wine.

800
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:02,593
Rym: Like easy listening music.

801
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,140
Rym: Like something that everyone will kind of like.

802
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:14,259
Rym: And meanwhile, the Eunuch Santa who worked there, who's an awesome dude, got the Star Wars Christmas special on VHS.

803
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,368
Rym: And the thing is, most of the people there, it was like a reverse.

804
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:23,120
Rym: It was like if you're a nerd getting a gift for non-nerds.

805
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,795
Rym: Like going deep in and bringing a thing out where you know the danger and some other people will know the danger.

806
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,440
Rym: but not everyone knows the danger.

807
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:38,159
Rym: Like imagine if you give the Star Wars Christmas special to someone who has no idea in a room where half the people know what it is.

808
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:41,268
Rym: That whole scene as it plays out.

809
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,956
Scott: The whole room though will probably explode.

810
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:43,579
Scott: Like whoa!

811
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:44,302
Rym: Whoa!

812
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:45,206
Rym: That's danger there.

813
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:46,130
Scott: You're in a danger zone.

814
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,360
Rym: Some kind of zone in which there is danger.

815
00:41:50,562 --> 00:41:52,834
Rym: I think I almost enjoy the reverse case more.

816
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:53,497
Rym: You know, we're nerds.

817
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:53,960
Rym: We're geeks.

818
00:41:54,921 --> 00:42:03,580
Rym: When you're giving gifts to people who aren't nerds or geeks, find something that is way inside baseball but also has some either appeal.

819
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,295
Scott: Right, because Star Wars Christmas special, right?

820
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:07,040
Scott: It's like okay.

821
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,820
Scott: It's dangerous.

822
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,590
Scott: People know Star Wars even if they're not nerds and there's a thing, right?

823
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,860
Scott: So it would be sort of like this clever thing that anyone could understand almost.

824
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,260
Rym: But people, the average person.

825
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,640
Scott: Even if they don't fully understand.

826
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,560
Rym: The average person is actually not likely to know about the Star Wars Christmas special.

827
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,109
Rym: So they'd be like, "What do you mean?

828
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:25,895
Rym: There's more Star

829
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:26,218
Rym: Wars?".

830
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:28,015
Rym: And you're like, "Yeah, watch

831
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:28,258
Rym: this.".

832
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,826
Scott: This is official.

833
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,619
Scott: This is the real deal.

834
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,960
Rym: You gotta give them something either that will get them into your geekery or give them something dangerous because that's hilarious.

835
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:38,359
Rym: It's basically a poison pill.

836
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,559
Scott: You could also give things that are just sort of like generally good but people don't know.

837
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:52,100
Scott: So usually it's hard to buy someone a comic book or a video game because they'll have a library of them, right?

838
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,840
Scott: But people tend not to have too many gadgets.

839
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,490
Scott: So it's like I know he doesn't have an e-reader.

840
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,500
Scott: I know he doesn't have a digital camera.

841
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,824
Rym: Ah, technology enabling.

842
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,912
Rym: But then you're getting into the realm of expensive.

843
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:05,040
Rym: If they wanted one they would have already bought it.

844
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,495
Scott: What you can't do is you can't try to buy a computer nerd a computer because it's like, "What are you going to do?

845
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:13,139
Scott: Go and buy me a new

846
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:13,500
Scott: desktop?".

847
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:14,919
Scott: It's like it's not going to be right.

848
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:22,358
Rym: So you buy an enablement gadget like someone who's really into novels but isn't technological and doesn't own an e-reader because they wouldn't even think to.

849
00:43:22,378 --> 00:43:23,300
Rym: so you buy them an e-reader.

850
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:25,400
Rym: But you don't buy them a novel.

851
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:26,045
Scott: No.

852
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:27,119
Scott: Can't do that.

853
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:29,420
Rym: Unless you find an original printing of something.

854
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:29,780
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,367
Scott: You can always get a gift card.

856
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:35,081
Scott: but I recommend if you have to get a gift card for somebody... No.

857
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:36,206
Scott: Get a gift card.

858
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:39,298
Scott: that is specific to a thing you know, right?

859
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,360
Scott: So it's like the Amazon gift card is pretty good.

860
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:43,440
Rym: It's just cash though.

861
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,558
Scott: That's what I get for people.

862
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,054
Scott: But what you can do is you can get, for example, StarWarsShop.com gift cards.

863
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:52,856
Scott: So it's like, "Alright.

864
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,219
Scott: You're getting a Star Wars

865
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,560
Scott: thing.".

866
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,871
Rym: I've always been a fan of getting... If you're going to get someone a gift card, because that's crass.

867
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,877
Rym: That's one step above, "Here's some

868
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:00,439
Rym: cash.".

869
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,218
Rym: That's what I do.

870
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,542
Rym: But not enough cash.

871
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:03,164
Rym: Because here's the thing.

872
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:06,030
Rym: If you give someone a lot of cash, that's kind of an awesome gift.

873
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,253
Rym: Like, "Hey dude.

874
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:08,175
Rym: We're really good friends.

875
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:09,177
Rym: It's your wedding.

876
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:09,658
Rym: Here's five

877
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:10,059
Rym: grand.".

878
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,726
Scott: Yeah, but that's the other thing, right?

879
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,071
Scott: So if you couldn't buy me a computer, right?

880
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:18,600
Scott: But if you had five grand, you could not buy a bad computer.

881
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:27,871
Rym: Or if you're buying a gift for a nerd and you have more money than them, the best gift you could give them in that regard is to go to them and say, "Look.

882
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:32,056
Rym: I don't know a lot about Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

883
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,197
Rym: But what will $5,000

884
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:33,438
Rym: buy?".

885
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,641
Scott: Yeah.

886
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:38,267
Scott: Asking if no nerd will actually complain.

887
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,128
Scott: if you ask, right?

888
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:42,335
Scott: I would be like, "Death Star Lego.

889
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:43,518
Scott: Lego Death Star.

890
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:43,939
Scott: Can't go

891
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:44,260
Scott: wrong.".

892
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:44,658
Scott: Yup.

893
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,844
Scott: I'll take it.

894
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,000
Scott: I got nowhere to put it, but I'll take it.

895
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,404
Rym: But I'm a big fan if you're going to do the gift card.

896
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:54,913
Rym: Get a gift card to a store the person would never go to normally.

897
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,255
Rym: Like, never even think to go to.

898
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:58,820
Rym: Or like a restaurant that they would never think to go to.

899
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,247
Rym: And it has to be for a kind of thing that there is no possible way they could use that money for anything practical.

900
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,270
Rym: That way, it's just something frivolous.

901
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,812
Rym: Like, go to the crazy steakhouse.

902
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:16,720
Rym: Or go to, like, I'm trying to think of a store that sells something weird that isn't like the Jellybean store.

903
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:18,159
Rym: The candle store.

904
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:20,232
Rym: I don't really want a fucking candle.

905
00:45:20,273 --> 00:45:21,200
Rym: No one wants a candle.

906
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:23,344
Scott: I saw today- You know what?

907
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:24,280
Rym: Skydiving lesson.

908
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,140
Scott: That's a good one.

909
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,680
Rym: Like, something crazy like that that they would never think to do.

910
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:28,158
Scott: Good one.

911
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,414
Rym: My mom got me that a long time ago, actually.

912
00:45:30,434 --> 00:45:30,940
Rym: It was really awesome.

913
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,565
Scott: There's a- I saw today on Voing.

914
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:35,489
Scott: Voing, a candle that is made of chocolate.

915
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,700
Scott: You put it in a little cake and you light it and then it melts the chocolate and it becomes a fondant.

916
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,081
Rym: Brilliant.

917
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:41,247
Rym: Brilliant.

918
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,760
Rym: That's a good gift for a fat person.

919
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,400
Scott: Chocolate lover.

920
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,169
Scott: Yeah, you can't really go wrong with food, right?

921
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,100
Scott: Even if it's not a funeral, I'll take a fruit basket.

922
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,916
Rym: So, Scott.

923
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:53,660
Scott: Gift basket.

924
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:54,710
Rym: What about our case?

925
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,620
Rym: You and me, specifically.

926
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:58,562
Scott: If you want to get me something- What do you buy for us?

927
00:45:58,642 --> 00:46:11,135
Rym: Because we're, you know, not to brag, but we buy literally everything I want, I either already bought or it's so expensive that- Unless you're a millionaire who wants to like, you know, be the guy who's like, "Yo, dude.

928
00:46:11,316 --> 00:46:11,697
Rym: Here's 10

929
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:12,038
Rym: grand.".

930
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:15,015
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, you can get me the Lego Death Star.

931
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:15,880
Scott: I will not complain.

932
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,150
Scott: Huh?

933
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,840
Rym: Lego Superstar and Story, I'll take it.

934
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:20,294
Scott: You can get me a bigger apartment.

935
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:20,860
Rym: I will not complain.

936
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:23,320
Scott: Air hockey table, I will not complain.

937
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,073
Rym: I have this extra trouble of, I live in the city.

938
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,499
Scott: I don't have that much space.

939
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,660
Scott: A car with a parking lot, a parking spot, and/or garage?

940
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,400
Rym: Yeah, but see, Scott, you realize every gift you're suggesting is something that's ludicrous.

941
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,034
Scott: Yup.

942
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,260
Scott: So, what do you- Make me something that I didn't know I wanted.

943
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:43,279
Scott: Yeah, the best gifts I've gotten are- We already discussed that, but yeah, it's pretty much your only option.

944
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,620
Rym: Like, Nuri got me a fantastic scarf.

945
00:46:46,461 --> 00:46:50,057
Rym: Ro got me, actually, a really good bottle of wine that we just drank the other night.

946
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:50,760
Rym: It was really good.

947
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,350
Rym: Emily gets me random stuff all the time.

948
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,394
Rym: that's just awesome.

949
00:46:56,434 --> 00:47:02,879
Rym: Stuff I would never- She gives me a gift, I'm like, "Wow, I never in a million years would have thought to get something like that on my

950
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,060
Rym: own.".

951
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,700
Scott: Another thing is, there might be something the person likes that's disposable, right?

952
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,540
Scott: And you can always get more, right?

953
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,780
Rym: Yo, dawg, here's a box of condoms.

954
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,617
Scott: I didn't mean it like that.

955
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,127
Rym: What do you mean?

956
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:19,638
Scott: That's exactly- That's not too bad, though, right?

957
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,600
Scott: Or it's something that you can never have enough of, right?

958
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:23,839
Scott: Here's some RAM.

959
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,380
Scott: Right, so before it was like, you know, Imagine the Gathering cards, right?

960
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,759
Scott: You can just buy someone a fucking box of them and it's like- Yeah, if someone's into collectible games, boosters will never, ever-.

961
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:36,390
Scott: You like miniatures?

962
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:37,780
Scott: Can't hurt to have more paint.

963
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:38,550
Rym: Yeah.

964
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:42,640
Rym: No, no, no, already you might buy the wrong kind of paint.

965
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,839
Rym: Because if you're painting Warhammer 40k and you get him the wrong paint, nope, nope.

966
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:49,189
Scott: But, you know, it couldn't hurt.

967
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:51,740
Scott: Here, here's a freaking, you know, here's a whole bunch of minis.

968
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,073
Rym: Oh, great, some Fallen Empires boosters.

969
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,640
Rym: Those aren't legal in any tournament.

970
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,417
Scott: I'm just saying.

971
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,848
Rym: And they're not valuable.

972
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:00,680
Rym: Because of my Fallen Empires.

973
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:01,660
Scott: It's better than nothing.

974
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,956
Rym: Oh, great, they're even in Italian because he didn't know better.

975
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:04,420
Rym: Thanks.

976
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:05,380
Scott: That's actually kind of cool.

977
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:06,138
Scott: Thanks, Grandma.

978
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,166
Scott: You couldn't do worse.

979
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,019
Scott: You could do worse, is what I'm- you know.

980
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,334
Rym: I think I want to say something.

981
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,247
Scott: You have to avoid- Or like, you know, it's like Lego.

982
00:48:13,468 --> 00:48:15,336
Scott: Just buy him a whole fucking bucket of Lego.

983
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:16,100
Scott: More Lego.

984
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,289
Rym: This is getting back to the early.

985
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,760
Rym: But, uh, you have to avoid traps.

986
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,280
Rym: If you're buying something for someone, like, gaming is a great example.

987
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,438
Rym: How many of you- Can't have more dice.

988
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:35,760
Rym: How many of you have Grandma bought you a Game Boy Advance game and it's like- Yeah, right?

989
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:40,820
Scott: Like, I mean, how many kids, you know- Because they went to Gamestop and took the advice of the Gamestop employee.

990
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,380
Rym: Yeah, the Gamestop guys, like, you know, they heard of Nintendogs.

991
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,038
Scott: My grandma bought me Ninja Turtles 2 Arcade Edition for NES.

992
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:58,619
Rym: But I'm saying, there was a whole industry around things that are traps for nerd- for people who are buying gifts for people who are into a thing who don't know about that thing.

993
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:02,880
Rym: And that is exemplified by the Petz series, because that existed.

994
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:09,138
Rym: Dogs was nothing more than to trick grandmas who didn't realize that Nintendogs- Was sold out.

995
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,880
Rym: Was the name of the game.

996
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:13,934
Rym: So they go to the store and say, "I need that dog game for the

997
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:14,597
Rym: Nintendo.".

998
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:20,860
Rym: And the canny employee of Gamestop says, "Here is the high margin dogs game.

999
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:23,014
Rym: It is the Nintendo dogs

1000
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:23,437
Rym: game.".

1001
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:24,119
Rym: Yep.

1002
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,060
Rym: Because it is the dogs game on Nintendo.

1003
00:49:26,301 --> 00:49:26,840
Scott: It is a dog game.

1004
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,774
Rym: And the kid opens it and says, "Thanks,

1005
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:29,258
Rym: Grandma.".

1006
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:31,274
Rym: And then tweets, "Fuck you,

1007
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:31,738
Rym: Grandma.".

1008
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,596
Scott: And Daryl Swart retweets it.

1009
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:36,180
Rym: And then the circle of life is complete.

1010
00:49:36,361 --> 00:49:36,678
Rym: That's right.

1011
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:50,679
Rym: So if you're buying a gift for someone who is a nerd and you don't know about it- Be very, very wary of things that are traps- That are literally trying to steal money from people who are exactly like you.

1012
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,674
Rym: When in doubt, find another nerd of that thing and be like, "Is this a

1013
00:49:54,714 --> 00:49:54,996
Rym: trap?"

1014
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:56,426
Rym: "Is this an

1015
00:49:56,587 --> 00:49:57,072
Rym: Akbar?"

1016
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:58,920
Rym: In the vernacular.

1017
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,090
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1018
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:12,210
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1019
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,630
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1020
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,550
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1021
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,310
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1022
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,826
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1023
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,070
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1024
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,250
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
