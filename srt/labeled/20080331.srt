1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,326
Scott: It's Monday March 31st.

2
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:12,268
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,014
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:17,360
Scott: more on programming languages.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:31,827
Scott: Let's do this This weekend.

6
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:35,200
Rym: well this past weekend was the night of iron.

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,547
Scott: It's really more like the nothing weekend.

8
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,276
Rym: Yeah, but it was the weekend that also included the night of iron.

9
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:46,160
Rym: well Saturday night We had nothing better to do and we had free time and all our work was done.

10
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:55,340
Rym: So uh we had the night of iron And it was indeed a night of much metal, and it was a very good kind of metal notice.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,466
Rym: I'm not saying what it was.

12
00:00:56,527 --> 00:01:02,160
Rym: that's because I kind of want to keep you all in suspense Because nothing called night of iron could not be awesome.

13
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:08,318
Scott: Yeah, we sort of just we didn't plan the night of iron and just sort of we were like hey Why don't we do this and like hey?

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,507
Scott: That's that would be the night of iron wouldn't it?

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,276
Rym: and the of course then we had no choice.

16
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:14,907
Rym: the path before us had been Prepared.

17
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:17,246
Rym: yeah, yeah That's all I got.

18
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,451
Rym: the weekend was relaxing.

19
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,400
Rym: I went to work today.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,065
Scott: Yeah, oh, I remember.

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:22,908
Scott: I have an opening bit.

22
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,559
Rym: I remember what it was like five minutes before the show going on.

23
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,979
Rym: man I wanted to say something, but I forgot it as screw it and now you remember it.

24
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:31,722
Scott: now I remember it.

25
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:35,180
Scott: I knew I would remember it real soon that I did all right.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,700
Scott: So what do you got so when I worked in the city the last time which is the first job?

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,783
Scott: I got out of college.

28
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,909
Scott: that wasn't a co-op right.

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,149
Scott: I worked over near where Emily and Alex work now right and that building Had a scaffold on it.

30
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,059
Rym: is that scaffold finally gone?

31
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,029
Scott: well No, that's scaffold while I was still working there.

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,336
Scott: They removed it right at some point.

33
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:55,998
Rym: is it back?

34
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,827
Rym: no Did it fall on someone now?

35
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:05,944
Scott: then I that same company moved me to the middle of nowhere And then I quit that company and I came to work for the company I'm working at now.

36
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,139
Scott: the building that I'm working at now had a scaffold on it.

37
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,371
Scott: Until today they removed the scaffold.

38
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,980
Rym: I think that means that you're gonna get a new job.

39
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:22,039
Scott: I know I think it means that I I will only be hired by companies in New York that have scaffolds around the building.

40
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,871
Scott: Well, you know eventually that scaffold to be removed for the building.

41
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,804
Rym: by that logic because I have a similar logic every time I get a job.

42
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:39,468
Rym: I walk from Yonkers station up to Well from Yonkers station up to kind of the northern part of Yonkers Uh-huh, and then I take the number six bus.

43
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,591
Scott: All right.

44
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:42,598
Rym: So yeah call Randy, okay.

45
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:45,331
Rym: So yeah, that's all we got.

46
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:48,104
Scott: That's it Scaffolds on buildings.

47
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:55,574
Scott: It's pretty freaky when they take them off cuz that scaffold must have been there so long Cuz all the stores they don't have big signs saying what they are.

48
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,060
Scott: This is this big flat area.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,560
Scott: So all those stores are probably gonna be calling up the sign makers.

50
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,785
Rym: Well, actually funnily enough.

51
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,720
Rym: I went to dinner a ramen joint with Emily on Friday just kind of out of the blue.

52
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:05,608
Rym: Okay, I want to go to dinner.

53
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,204
Rym: Yeah, so we went out and I did.

54
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:12,679
Rym: we just we're walking through asked like near Astor place because there's an awesome video game store there.

55
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:27,508
Rym: Yeah, and then she says hey, look where we are Remember this and I'm like I look around and I don't recognize anything like I look and it's like wow I probably never been on the street before and it turns out no It was that she used to live on that street.

56
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,953
Rym: The scaffold was just gone.

57
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,540
Rym: It looked like a different Street.

58
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,924
Rym: Yep, but that reminded me of something that happened Before I met her.

59
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:38,155
Rym: I got out of work I got killed by a scaffold.

60
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:38,537
Rym: Yes.

61
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,480
Rym: I'm in fact dead.

62
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,623
Scott: This is a computer-generated Rym and scaffold.

63
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:45,893
Rym: ate your mom much like how they finished that John Candy movie without John.

64
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,060
Scott: and I even seek you miss eek scaffold revenge.

65
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,120
Rym: Actually that that leads to even God talk about the non sequitur train going off to nowhere.

66
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,688
Rym: Well, actually no, it's the sequitur train.

67
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,373
Rym: It's not a non sequitur at all.

68
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,284
Rym: when John Candy died that When John came back

69
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,548
Scott: I was killed by a scaffold

70
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:16,116
Rym: and when princess died when both of them died were two instances Where I was able to prove to my parents Astoundingly that the internet was powerful because they never believed me and they always kind of scoffed at like whatever.

71
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:20,435
Rym: and then I remember one day I was like, hey John Candy's dead and they were like what.

72
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:21,019
Rym: that's BS.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,963
Rym: There's no way.

74
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:27,199
Scott: and then the next day the new there's no way that a big fat unhealthy guy died.

75
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,965
Rym: Okay It was there's no way.

76
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,531
Rym: how would you found out about that?

77
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:30,893
Rym: I was like.

78
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,319
Rym: the internet said so.

79
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:42,980
Rym: And then when princess died, I was in the realm playing and then someone named princess die was said out of the blue man I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this name.

80
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:45,927
Rym: He'd even called that for like two years.

81
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,677
Rym: Uh, and he I'm like what.

82
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:51,832
Rym: and he's like, uh, Well, and he says what happened.

83
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,544
Rym: and then we're all like, oh Yeah, that sucks.

84
00:04:55,227 --> 00:05:02,180
Scott: change your name dude, no, he was like level 80 you couldn't change your name, uh Yeah, what can you change your name in the World of Warcraft?

85
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,859
Rym: It's just make an alt and power level it.

86
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:09,935
Scott: I know but I mean like if I level up to like the highest level in World of Warcraft But my name suddenly becomes taboo.

87
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:10,499
Scott: Can I change it?

88
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,154
Rym: Yes by making an alt and power leveling it.

89
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,208
Rym: Yeah That's the thing all you kids now.

90
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:17,951
Rym: You're so lucky.

91
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,020
Rym: There was no such thing as power leveling in the realm.

92
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:24,945
Scott: Well, there was there every I think, you know back in the day there was power leveling But you know what they did.

93
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,420
Scott: they would fucking notice you doing it and kick your ass.

94
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:28,330
Scott: No, no.

95
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:34,540
Rym: back in the day Once you got a high enough level you get like one experience point for killing the biggest baddest thing in the land.

96
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,280
Rym: You'd have to go and kill it a thousand times to level up.

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,404
Rym: There was no way around that.

98
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,414
Rym: a higher level character couldn't get you more experience.

99
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:42,819
Scott: All right anyway.

100
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:50,810
Rym: Good move on to news and things of the day, but I didn't tell my story Because I don't worry I don't know I have a lot to say about my news.

101
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:59,120
Rym: so aside from John Candy dying I was waiting in the Starbucks duster place not the scary hobo Starbucks the other Starbucks the nice one.

102
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:00,239
Scott: Oh this story.

103
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:06,320
Rym: Okay, and this is just weird and funny and it's probably bad because I'm sure it stroked my ego just a little bit.

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,908
Rym: But at the same time it's kind of weird.

105
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:08,451
Rym: It's funny.

106
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:15,580
Scott: I think your ego It's kind of hard for anyone to stroke it because basically you have these auto Strokers that are covering every inch of it.

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,549
Scott: You know what and the surface area is.

108
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,240
Scott: even though the surface area is constantly increasing He does the auto strokers sort of spawn new strokers.

109
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,309
Rym: I think the real the real issue with my ego is that.

110
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,139
Rym: well actually it's much related to tomorrow's thing of the day anyway.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,273
Rym: Yeah, so I'm sitting in the Starbucks and Emily calls me.

112
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,960
Rym: She says she's gonna be a little bit late, and that's fine.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,820
Rym: I got my laptop I'm working on stuff, and I'm just chilling there and a few minutes later this cool this guy.

114
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,440
Rym: He's pretty cool-looking you know 20-something guy, and he he walks up behind me, and he says excuse me, sir.

115
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:49,834
Rym: And I'm like yes, I turn around are you a?

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,046
Rym: Long pregnant pause are you Rym from GeekNights, and I'm like yes Oh my god.

117
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,334
Rym: I can't believe it's you.

118
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,465
Rym: I heard your voice But I wasn't sure where.

119
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,116
Rym: I had to look a picture of you up online and make sure it was you.

120
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,339
Rym: oh my god My girlfriend's gonna be so jealous cuz she's not here, but oh my god.

121
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:18,974
Rym: And that the fact that I have been recognized by a fan Randomly in New York City as opposed to randomly at say an anime convention.

122
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:24,937
Rym: I've been to for the last five years is Somewhat startling and bad for my ego not getting any smaller.

123
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:31,690
Scott: well I mean on the one hand it's sort of likely I mean in a crowded city with a lot of people.

124
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:46,179
Scott: you know if you have a few thousand fans around the world You know and we Limit to the English-speaking world odds of fans being in New York City pretty good Odds of fans being in a part in New York City where people our age tend to be a little bit about.

125
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,143
Scott: you know It's really.

126
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:55,108
Scott: you met a fan in public in the one of the most likely places Most likely places that'd be like a GameStop.

127
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,774
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but you know what I'm saying.

128
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,500
Scott: It's like it's pretty close.

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,658
Scott: It's pretty high on the charts of likely place to meet a GeekNights fan in public.

130
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:07,500
Scott: yeah But even then I think it's not like you met a GeekNights fan on a cornfield in Kansas.

131
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:17,693
Rym: You know that might be more likely because odds are if I was going to a cornfield in Kansas on the show I'd be like I'm gonna be in this stupid cornfield next week if anyone lives there.

132
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,897
Rym: Please come say hi.

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:25,469
Scott: Please give me some gosh Much of glory.

134
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,698
Scott: I need more of everything else.

135
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,758
Rym: But no I think it illustrates something much more important.

136
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,828
Rym: People recognize us not by sight, but by sound.

137
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,120
Rym: now think of that sitting there doing your thing and Sony redo our website.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,440
Scott: We'll have we'll go get pictures taken of us, and we'll have pictures there.

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,734
Scott: So people will recognize us by sight and we'll also start doing videos or something.

140
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:51,900
Rym: the fact that you could be sitting somewhere And then you hear my voice, and it's like I don't know where that voice came from but I know what it was.

141
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,167
Rym: Yep, so yeah, dude.

142
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,656
Rym: I forget your name, but I think I saw that you emailed me.

143
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:57,720
Rym: You're totally cool.

144
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,748
Scott: I think his girlfriend emailed.

145
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:01,897
Rym: Oh he also emailed us like a little while ago.

146
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,600
Rym: I haven't read it yet.

147
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,278
Scott: Oh, okay, whatever cuz I'm doing this podcast thing instead.

148
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,194
Rym: Anyway, so I'm speaking of podcast.

149
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:08,979
Rym: What are you on the news?

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,202
Scott: okay, so Motorola.

151
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,564
Scott: Motorola is a company.

152
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:17,049
Scott: Motorola makes a lot more things than you realize they make.

153
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:22,051
Scott: I mean Before the max had like IBM power PCs in them.

154
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:25,020
Scott: now all the max had Motorola CPUs in them.

155
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,789
Scott: Motorola makes a lot of chips that make a lot of things.

156
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,080
Scott: in general you probably have Motorola products in your house.

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,665
Scott: You don't even know about The Motorola products in your house.

158
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:37,136
Scott: that you do know about though are usually probably cell phones and that sort of thing.

159
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:42,469
Scott: and you know for a long time Motorola actually was a pretty badass cell phone maker.

160
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,613
Scott: I mean that's star tech.

161
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,480
Scott: I had one that was one of the best phones.

162
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,711
Scott: It's like the first phone that was kind of thin you know.

163
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,687
Scott: and then they made the razor Which is like y'all.

164
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:51,512
Scott: it's a huge hit.

165
00:09:51,914 --> 00:10:01,819
Scott: right crazy huge but You don't really realize it these days, but Motorola is kinda in the shitter not doing so.

166
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:12,000
Scott: well yeah, they they've had a lot of trouble lately in the stocks and such and and and One of the things I realized you know from reading this and reading other things is that business wise?

167
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:18,268
Scott: Part of the reason they're doing bad is not only because they haven't come up with anything new But I'll get to that but because the razor right.

168
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,652
Scott: when the razor first came out.

169
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:23,180
Scott: It was like it was sort of like Apple's products.

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,440
Scott: It was a super sexy high-profile device that people desired because it was so ludicrously thin right.

171
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:37,700
Scott: But unlike Apple where Apple will up the marketing up the price and make it you know like oh, it is so great.

172
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,208
Scott: Motorola started out that way.

173
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,138
Scott: the razor was like 200 bucks and like this ultra fancy thing.

174
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:43,880
Scott: only for a minute.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,919
Scott: You know cool people.

176
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:50,434
Rym: But then now long later him Captain gets the cheapest crap cell phone that he can get free from.

177
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,832
Rym: whoever gets cell phones from Goes to get a cell phone, and they're like here's a razor.

178
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:55,153
Rym: Yeah, now.

179
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:56,980
Scott: I have it like every freaking color.

180
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,247
Scott: It's the free phone that you get it's like.

181
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,056
Scott: so it's really you know doing that.

182
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,098
Scott: on the one hand You know it's sort of like.

183
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:21,267
Scott: well You make a lot of money because now you sell a bajillion razors But on the other hand you don't make so much money and keep your company afloat because you don't have you're not the having the cool Awesome products, but now as for not coming up with anything else Some guy he's not just some guy.

184
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,112
Scott: actually he's new mayor for Oz.

185
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,455
Scott: I probably pronounced his name wrong.

186
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:32,087
Scott: Sorry new mayor for Oz He was the personal advisor To Jeffrey Frost.

187
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,400
Scott: Jeffrey Frost was Motorola's former CMO.

188
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:45,580
Scott: That's the guy who in pretty much invented the razor right and then worked on the rocker And he was pretty much the guy at Motorola who may and pretty much came up with all their shit.

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,563
Scott: That was worth a damn.

190
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:47,888
Scott: and without that guy.

191
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:48,450
Scott: They're fucked.

192
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:56,519
Scott: and well that guy died in 2005 and it's pretty sad Because I mean there's no evidence of this.

193
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:01,701
Scott: But if you read the story like if this was like a play on Broadway You it.

194
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,248
Scott: basically the guy was worked to death.

195
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:13,040
Scott: the company and all the executives pretty much work this guy To death having him come up with all the new stuff, but regardless that's a separate.

196
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,960
Rym: It's a separate issue though granted this obviously this guy had a high truck factor.

197
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:27,058
Scott: He had the highest truck factor because now without him Motorola's in the shitter and his personal advisor new mayor for Oz Wrote a letter to engage.

198
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:34,728
Scott: well He wrote a letter to Greg Brown and the rest of the executive team of Motorola pretty much Calling them out like well you guys suck.

199
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:41,209
Scott: You've ruined Motorola, which is a great company blah blah blah and This is really a fascinating read.

200
00:12:41,229 --> 00:13:02,220
Scott: because he sent the letter to Engadget to be posted on Engadget, which There's a guy Jason Calacanis who used to be in charge of weblogs incorporated which is a division of AOL which is which Engadget's a division of that and He's now doing something else, but on Twitter He talked about how the way Engadget is so awesome.

201
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:07,740
Scott: Is that all these people who work at these big tech companies are like friends with the Engadget guys?

202
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:22,886
Scott: And they'll use Engadget as a bludgeon against their own companies like so some guy working at a company Like say Apple right if Apple does something They don't like they'll leak it to Engadget and Engadget will say it and then force Apple You know to change its ways or whatever.

203
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:26,456
Rym: granted if I were Apple what I would do is internal to the company.

204
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:30,000
Scott: I'd Periodically I'll just block Engadget.com.

205
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:43,119
Rym: I'd make it appear that things were gonna happen to select groups of employees that weren't gonna happen But that were bad and see what got leaked and then and then of course I can look good by being no That's totally untrue and made up and discredit all these people.

206
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:48,616
Rym: But then I could slowly figure out who's leaking and either get rid of them or get rid of them.

207
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:52,880
Scott: the side effect of that Though is that all these really bad stories about your company will get out.

208
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:57,940
Rym: See, but then all those really bad stories immediately get refuted and never come to pass.

209
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,832
Scott: It doesn't help it doesn't you know that?

210
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,128
Scott: might you know, that's true But the mind share is still.

211
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,930
Rym: you're putting negative mind share even when if the reputation Short term if you do it once yes view it twice.

212
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,131
Rym: Yes, if you do it 40 times Then suddenly no one trusts any bad news about your company.

213
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:25,077
Rym: and then when it finds out that you're actually dumping radioactive waste inside of baby seals for fun No one cares cuz that's just fake like all those other fake stories.

214
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:34,674
Scott: anyway The point is is a really fascinating news story and it's it's kind of sad cuz like wow Motorola was you know They made good phones.

215
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,759
Scott: and now What's going on?

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:48,759
Scott: The company is splitting in half one half of the cut the phone part of the company is going one way and all the other Stuff that's actually profitable and still, you know business as usual chips and stuff is going to the other part of the company.

217
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:59,220
Rym: now I'm not allowed to really talk about my opinions on the future of Motorola But I think I can say it pretty obliquely by saying that I will probably never see in my hands a new Motorola cell phone.

218
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,507
Scott: No, it's pretty.

219
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,760
Scott: it's really fascinating reading all this stuff.

220
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:12,640
Scott: This guy says because he talks about how like why does Motorola Have like this fleet of private jets where other companies the same size maybe have one or two, you know?

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,440
Scott: And it's like why you know are the executives like don't even know how to use a computer?

222
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:30,255
Scott: he has you know emails printed out and put on his desk and He basically just bashes all the CEOs and boards and all the high-up executives in the company for being completely incompetent and not knowing anything.

223
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:36,540
Scott: and He talks about how there's the one the guy who died is pretty much the only reason that their phones ever successful.

224
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:48,179
Scott: and wow, it's a pretty sad story that it is general and It's really worth reading if you care about the insides of tech companies and how the tech industry works and whatnot.

225
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:55,320
Rym: So speaking of one person who's awesome I want to talk about this a little bit because it the story itself is not super important.

226
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,950
Rym: This is like news from nowhere that no one will really care about.

227
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,920
Rym: but the lessons learned from this are pretty Impressive and important to damage irreversible.

228
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:07,295
Rym: Man, that comic hasn't updated in like ever.

229
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,600
Scott: but those guys you still do stuff.

230
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,819
Scott: They did something for penny arcade recently, but they don't do anything for me now that out.

231
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,549
Scott: In fact, I imagine if you paid them they do something.

232
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:16,774
Rym: No, they didn't remember.

233
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:23,080
Rym: I ordered from them A big poster and for like five months it never came.

234
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:28,360
Rym: So finally I went to mocha and they were there and I was like I ordered a poster.

235
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:29,824
Rym: Where is it?

236
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,453
Rym: And they were like, ah, would you like one now?

237
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:34,058
Rym: Yeah, I was like, yes.

238
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:35,162
Rym: Yes I do.

239
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,875
Scott: if they're at mocha again, you can get on their case.

240
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:50,694
Rym: Ah Oh, well anyway, so, uh, basically the story here is that some school that had a computer network Was so Incompetently managed like pretty much every school I've ever seen is in terms of pretty

241
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:55,400
Scott: much every public school in the u.s And most of the private schools and pretty much most schools.

242
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:01,220
Scott: Yeah, but well, there's a town somewhere where the town has I like a team of like three IT guys who were super Linux.

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,446
Scott: Ease of the whole town is perfect.

244
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:05,579
Scott: But anyway anywhere else is probably terrible anyway.

245
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:14,434
Rym: So basically what happened is this 11 year old kid who knew a little bit more about computers than everyone else at this school Including the teachers.

246
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:18,720
Rym: everyone Basically said I'll fix it and now he's the network admin.

247
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,160
Scott: Well days after the IT guy just left, you know, basically was just like screw this school and he was a terrible IT guy.

248
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:32,587
Scott: Apparently, you know the the librarian who sort of you know, because the librarian has to deal with you know Like library computers and whatnots they.

249
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:40,239
Scott: I remember in elementary school our librarian was sort of more You know the computers than anyone else because he sort of forced to learn that sort of thing a little bit.

250
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:46,165
Scott: So his mom was librarian which is why you know, he sort of got into that You know gig there

251
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,210
Rym: now the kid didn't get

252
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,135
Scott: an inside the kid

253
00:17:48,155 --> 00:18:03,274
Rym: didn't do a perfect job but he proved something very important because Basically, all he did was the smart thing that anyone with even basic like technological computer literacy not straight-up computer literacy But like kind of power user computer literacy would do.

254
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,780
Rym: he support scan the network.

255
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:16,020
Rym: You know ping scan figured out what all the devices were Got rid of all the spyware and malware Put some antivirus and some you know gateways and things and basically just cleaned everything up and upgraded everything.

256
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,822
Scott: Yeah, it just you know went around doing Windows Update and all that He didn't.

257
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:39,695
Scott: actually he's not actually doing the good amazing job that someone like us would do But he's still what he's doing with basic knowledge of things that he's basically doing to every computer in the school What you should do to your computer in your house and it's making the school a thousand times better than every other school Even though it's still not good on the absolute Scott scale.

258
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:43,567
Rym: now this Speaks both of hope and of fear.

259
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:58,338
Rym: it speaks of hope because it is proving to me that yes the generations that are coming up Despite the fact that things are a lot easier for them than they were for us And then things are a lot easier for us than they were for the people before us There are still punk kids out there who know what they're doing.

260
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:08,340
Scott: Yep They're still learning the technology because I mean we you know, there are some people who have said that hey You know we because you weren't forced to use computers when computers were hard to use.

261
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:09,866
Scott: You don't actually learn anything.

262
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:10,970
Scott: and it sort of seemed that way.

263
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,800
Scott: it seemed like, you know people who were younger than us.

264
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,400
Scott: They knew how to use a computer for Facebook or whatever But they didn't really know because they didn't have to deal with installing PC games and DOS.

265
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,891
Scott: But then at the same time, you know writing in basic on it.

266
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:33,883
Rym: Yes a lot of people from that generation They only know how to use Facebook, but the similar percentage of people from the previous generation Couldn't have used a computer at all Even if they were like.

267
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:39,520
Rym: and this I think the same percentage of kids are awesome and techie regardless of how easy it is.

268
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:40,999
Scott: It's beginning to seem that way.

269
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:47,536
Rym: They have the benefit that they can stand on the shoulders of giants and skip all the.

270
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,120
Rym: they don't have to learn about IRQs.

271
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,276
Rym: They can jump straight into writing a Python program.

272
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:51,639
Rym: Yep.

273
00:19:53,061 --> 00:20:09,020
Rym: But it also speaks of fear because the fact that this school did not have any competent technological person at all Not a single person knew enough about computers to let to be able to do a better job than an 11 year old.

274
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,172
Scott: Yeah, I mean I would do it hire me, but they cry can't afford me.

275
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:13,754
Scott: So it's not gonna.

276
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:15,520
Rym: they're not gonna pay me six figures?

277
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:18,360
Scott: No, they're not which which is what it would take for me to be.

278
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,160
Scott: I would be the IT guy and the computer teacher at the high school for an entire school district.

279
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:29,934
Scott: You'd have to pay me $100,000 a year because I would be like, you know I'd probably be willing to do it for a lot less.

280
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:36,400
Scott: That'd be a great job But even then it would still be like 80,000 like they wouldn't pay me that I'd be getting more than any teacher.

281
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:41,360
Scott: Yeah, that's really the sad thing is really I'd be doing two jobs teacher job and IT guy job.

282
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,299
Scott: That's gonna take a lot of monies.

283
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,808
Rym: I think the real problem is just that there's.

284
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,720
Rym: there's no the way IT and CS and computer things work.

285
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:57,380
Rym: If you're competent at all You can always make a ton of money out in the real world and not working for schools.

286
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,370
Rym: Not just schools, but other things do I mean?

287
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,939
Rym: most hospitals have awful IT.

288
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,933
Rym: Part of the reason why I live a part of the reason why I left my previous company.

289
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:05,094
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:11,635
Scott: Yeah Yeah, IT is so bad that 11 year old kids can do a better job.

291
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:16,736
Scott: Even when the job they do is terrible It's still a better job than real people thing is those J.

292
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:17,740
Rym: He didn't do a terrible job.

293
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,466
Rym: He did probably the same job.

294
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,352
Rym: I would have done when I was 11.

295
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:24,021
Scott: I mean God when I was 11.

296
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:27,524
Rym: Well, you were 11 Scott when I was 11 They didn't have any windows.

297
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:35,619
Rym: but but even if they did when you think about what think about in middle school What you knew about computers you would you could do a middle school job, probably.

298
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:40,466
Scott: Yeah Realistically my school didn't really do such a bad job there They're only there.

299
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,676
Scott: the bad job they did was and you know There were a few sick obvious security problems, which I could have patched up that they didn't.

300
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:51,300
Scott: but other than that The main problem was their bad policy rather than their bad systems.

301
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,212
Rym: I remember when they caught me in hacking the computer.

302
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,960
Scott: hacking the computer was installing shockwave flash.

303
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,230
Rym: Not even that hacking the computer was.

304
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:11,458
Rym: I rebooted and then I held f5 So I was in DOS and then I was writing a program in cube basic to make sounds Bored and they accused me of hacking and I was like, can you even explain what I'm doing?

305
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,425
Rym: Mm-hmm, and they really couldn't.

306
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,340
Rym: and they were like if you weren't an honor student you would have been suspended.

307
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,748
Scott: Whatever.

308
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:28,718
Rym: yeah, okay But anyway things of the day.

309
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,762
Rym: I'll warn you.

310
00:22:30,063 --> 00:22:32,290
Rym: I think this thing of the day is awesome.

311
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,061
Rym: However, some of you might think that is boring.

312
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:41,064
Rym: what I have to say to you who think it is boring That is that I don't know I could make fun of you.

313
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:42,510
Rym: I don't know what I would say.

314
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:48,460
Rym: I'll just warn you that you might not find this terribly interesting But at the same time you might find this fascinating.

315
00:22:49,002 --> 00:23:10,109
Rym: This is a 20-minute explanation of how to manipulate three-dimensional and two-dimensional shapes in terms of inversion and That might sound weird but trust me if nothing else watch the first five minutes because they'll explain what they're talking about and Then they'll ask a question.

316
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:11,557
Rym: You'll get a couple of.

317
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:14,812
Rym: you'll think oh, I'll just do it this way and they'll say oh well Here's why that doesn't work.

318
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:21,010
Rym: and they show you with this little diagram and then they'll show you the answer and the answer is crazy.

319
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,418
Rym: Now if after seeing the answer

320
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:31,163
Scott: and someone's like Nobel Prize or not Nobel Prize level But that's like masters doctor thesis math answer there in terms

321
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:31,324
Rym: of

322
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,026
Scott: some guy figure

323
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:41,130
Rym: that out and describing kind of like Three-dimensional geometry and and math like just I'm trying to use words that will make this make sense.

324
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,180
Scott: It's the kind of stuff, but we don't even really understand.

325
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,969
Scott: so it's not easy to talk about it.

326
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:46,877
Rym: Well, I mean it.

327
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:53,737
Scott: I remember doing a lot of stuff with three-dimensional service and calculate I mean, I sort of I understand it on a surface level I could not reproduce.

328
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:55,505
Rym: was that it was that a joke or did?

329
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:56,570
Rym: was that just a mistake?

330
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,853
Scott: It was sort of a joke.

331
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:58,837
Scott: I could not.

332
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:02,430
Scott: I could not reproduce it nor could I explain it very well.

333
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:10,883
Rym: I mean the furthest I got was like alright calculate the The charge distribution on a three-dimensional surface.

334
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:16,341
Rym: and if that sounds scary It's even scarier when you find out that the answer is double integrals.

335
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:19,350
Rym: Yep, double integrals suck my balls.

336
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,900
Scott: Single integral sometimes like my balls.

337
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,250
Scott: So - she has more ball sucking.

338
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:28,626
Rym: The thing is a double integral sucks the whole set isn't even so simple as two integrals.

339
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:29,750
Rym: It's something far worse.

340
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:39,810
Rym: I know I know but anyway, this video is Amazing because this is this is the way to teach things like this because it's kind of a question and answer.

341
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:52,709
Rym: You've got the instructor who knows the answer asking the leading questions and the person who doesn't know the answer asking Questions and they're kind of being guided toward discovering the answer on their own without being given the.

342
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:59,024
Scott: yeah it's sort of like the very beginning of the video, which is all I've seen is Basically, anyone can understand what's going on.

343
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:05,896
Scott: It's very visual It's very obvious and it really if you're the kind of person who is a problem-solving thinking person You're gonna look at this.

344
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,490
Scott: you give like, huh?

345
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,444
Scott: Huh, and the guy is thinking the same thing.

346
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,390
Scott: You're thinking so, huh?

347
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,190
Rym: I showed Scott a little bit and he's like duh, I do this and then the video is like duh, I'll do this.

348
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:17,836
Rym: Oh, it didn't work shit.

349
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,081
Scott: And I'm like, no, it's bullshit.

350
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,126
Scott: It would have worked.

351
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,150
Scott: But I was wrong.

352
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,487
Rym: They're like, no, here's why I wouldn't work.

353
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:32,904
Scott: And then eventually like here's the right answer and the right answer is so crazy that you want to watch the rest Which is probably would have been boring on its own except it's explaining the thing.

354
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:34,550
Scott: That was so crazy that blew you away.

355
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,960
Rym: Yes, and seriously, it's worth watching just to see the crazy thing.

356
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,524
Rym: You'll know it when you see it.

357
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:46,010
Rym: It's crazy the answer It's like the answer is probably gonna imagine if there's like a simple math problem, right?

358
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,410
Scott: But you couldn't really figure out the answer, but it didn't seem too complicated.

359
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,295
Rym: It's like adding like they ask you questions like add a bunch of single-digit numbers together Like and you're like, huh?

360
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,629
Scott: And it's a little tricky maybe but you're sort of getting at it.

361
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,494
Rym: And then you're like what.

362
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:04,363
Scott: you have the ability to think about the problem But you can't arrive at the answer because every answer you come with is wrong.

363
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:07,570
Scott: and then you're just like, oh, yeah The answer is absolutely insane.

364
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,668
Rym: It's like add a bunch of single-digit numbers and then multiply it by like 1.1 and blah blah blah.

365
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,178
Rym: You're like, alright Alright, what's?

366
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:15,610
Rym: the answer is like 10 billion?

367
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,870
Rym: Like what 10 million?

368
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,218
Scott: Anyway, anyway This is super cool.

369
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:23,483
Scott: All right, so check out.

370
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:25,210
Scott: This is way cool, dude.

371
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:31,990
Scott: And he's doing some raps now usually raps about things that are you know, it's so often corny.

372
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,023
Scott: This one is a little bit corny, but this is terribly corny.

373
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:38,126
Scott: It's not terribly good.

374
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,230
Rym: It is terribly corny.

375
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,758
Scott: It's kind of corny, but it's terribly corny.

376
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:42,600
Scott: It's kind of corny.

377
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,286
Scott: This dude does a rap.

378
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:55,802
Scott: He's pretty good at the rapping I would say slightly above-average rapping skills but his rap is about web design and This guy really knows about web design.

379
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:03,593
Scott: and if you know about web design This rap will entertain you greatly because it's pretty much just inside Basically.

380
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:07,846
Rym: guide to web design don't get turned off by the very beginning.

381
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,350
Rym: It might be like, oh, this is gonna be lame.

382
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,319
Rym: He goes into some depth.

383
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,930
Scott: Yeah, it's like we're talking minutia.

384
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,230
Scott: We're you know, usually you hear one of these raps and it's like they sort of talk about something.

385
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:25,030
Scott: They'll discuss a topic, but obviously they only have some sort of surface layman's knowledge of the topic.

386
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,740
Rym: You know a lot of those like people who are.

387
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,540
Rym: they say they're nerdcore and they try to make some nerdcore But all they really do is say Dungeons & Dragons twice.

388
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,684
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

389
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,530
Scott: This guy really knows his shit.

390
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:42,324
Scott: I imagine he's a web designer and a rapper and If you are a web designer, you will find this very amusing.

391
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,996
Rym: and if you are a rapper I hope you find this amusing.

392
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:51,359
Scott: Yeah, if you're a rapper, you could probably find a better rap, but this rap is not bad You know, it's much better rap than expected.

393
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:54,210
Scott: You expect like a really bad rap for this kind of thing.

394
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,595
Scott: But no, it's an okay rap.

395
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,619
Scott: This guy gets mad points.

396
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:01,689
Rym: So moving right along, you know, we've been doing this Alternating ITCS thing for a while.

397
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:06,230
Rym: We're gonna do one more set of them and then we're gonna go back to kind of our normal Monday shows for a while.

398
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,275
Scott: Oh, wait, it's yesterday.

399
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:08,520
Rym: Yeah.

400
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,609
Rym: Oh wait, I guess I could talk about it.

401
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:17,295
Rym: Just kidding cuz I just dropped 50 grand on a stupid ticketing system and I got a flyaway for like a week to learn How to use it.

402
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:18,384
Scott: No, I'm just kidding.

403
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:19,070
Scott: I'm messing with you.

404
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:29,239
Scott: I was trying to be all like oh shit wait to make people, you know, I'd ruined it anyway Talk about some CSS today, I guess right?

405
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,922
Scott: Yeah.

406
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:30,544
Rym: No last week.

407
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:31,608
Rym: I think you talked about pro.

408
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,137
Scott: last week I did a terrible job.

409
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,667
Rym: Well last time not last week.

410
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,500
Rym: last time We realized that Scott and I are alternating.

411
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,062
Rym: the Mac is.

412
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,397
Rym: Scott did an awesome intro to IT And I was like CS CS.

413
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,981
Rym: Yes, and then it was like my turn to intro IT But I was hungry and we had bra.

414
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:53,330
Rym: so I was kind of like yeah It is everything and I was the end and then I did a really good one is in we're alternating here.

415
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,719
Rym: So it's Scott's turn to do an awesome one.

416
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,221
Scott: Yep.

417
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,610
Scott: All right, so I'm gonna try to do an awesome one.

418
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,350
Scott: I realized that it's sort of like trying to do these episodes.

419
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:07,271
Scott: I have to find a balance because on the one hand it's like I want to give all the information Like.

420
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:11,690
Scott: I want to give the whole thing from beginning to end not jumping over any steps.

421
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,010
Scott: So in the beginning there were only zeros.

422
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:23,830
Scott: I want to step on every single stone to get across the river But I realized some of those stones like the stone I did last time not so interesting and not so useful to the people.

423
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,643
Rym: Yeah, I mean think about it most of you even though it is an important thing to learn most of you out there.

424
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:31,599
Rym: a lot of the questions we're getting people are Like so what programming language does what?

425
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,445
Rym: which programming language that I weren't is Python?

426
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:33,626
Rym: cool.

427
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,228
Rym: What about Ruby?

428
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:39,345
Rym: and To answer that question Scott really had to talk about what is programming?

429
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,870
Rym: Yeah, but all those people were going.

430
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,524
Rym: Okay, but what about Ruby?

431
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:53,229
Scott: Yeah so I'm gonna have to find a way to strike a balance between the things you need to know and Also the things you want to know and being entertaining and I think I can do this, right?

432
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,009
Scott: So last time I talked about you know, what a language is.

433
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:03,234
Scott: now it's a set of rules for arranging an alphabet, you know in a way and You Know.

434
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:06,430
Scott: the thing is is you can make up any language you want, right?

435
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,844
Scott: so why do we have a whole bunch of different programming languages?

436
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:17,635
Scott: because Each language the set of rules you come up with is made in such a way So that you can match.

437
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:22,770
Scott: the goal is to match human thinking with the assembly language in the computer.

438
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,677
Rym: So the glad you didn't say computer thinking computer thinking.

439
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:34,910
Scott: you want to find a language because a programming language can't be a human Language because a digital non fuzzy logic computer cannot understand it.

440
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,038
Scott: Right if it could be a human language.

441
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:47,090
Rym: when we develop some amazing fuzzy when AI computer There will be a pearl compiler and then write me a pearl program and compile it in its exactly We won't need programmers anymore.

442
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:55,950
Scott: All you'll do is you'll tell your computer what you want to do and it since your computer is an AI that just happens To also be connected to some you know, really powerful processing

443
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:02,288
Rym: The same time connected to some sort of schoolgirl prosthetic, all right, you know what's gonna happen in the future.

444
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:05,830
Scott: Yep Then you won't need a programming language anymore.

445
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:20,208
Scott: But because we still need a programming language what we do is we come up with rules for arranging alphabets some grammars to design languages in such a way that a human can think in those languages and work with them the same way.

446
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:24,310
Scott: you think in English you can think in C or think in pearl or think in Python.

447
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:33,470
Scott: But also the computer can read those languages and actually do something based on those languages can divert them into computer instructions.

448
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:42,610
Scott: so the reason we have different languages and not just one language that's perfect is because What you're doing with a language is you're trying to solve a problem.

449
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:47,570
Scott: All right You might be trying to solve the problem of when people visit my website send them a page.

450
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,970
Scott: You might be trying to solve the problem of do complex math on a supercomputer.

451
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:58,710
Scott: You might be trying to solve the problem of make my calculator do normal math, you know, there's all these different problems.

452
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:04,030
Scott: And when there's different problems, it's easier to think about certain problems in certain ways.

453
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:10,369
Scott: And since you can't sort of write one language to rule them all Which I guess would be sort of crazy, right?

454
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:17,510
Scott: We create languages that are structured in different ways so that they are suited to solving certain kinds of problems.

455
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,037
Scott: For example list lisp as in.

456
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,801
Scott: I got lisp now not.

457
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:29,809
Rym: I would like to preface what Scott's about to say by saying that I Discovered that lisp is used a lot in terms of writing audio processing things.

458
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:34,565
Rym: Yes, so I started looking into lisp because it that I don't program much if ever.

459
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,167
Rym: Mm-hmm.

460
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:52,864
Scott: Good God Right, but lisp the word lisp the reason it's called lisp is because the list processing language you see and Basically I call them the parentheses languages because it's all parentheses all over the place Like you do a parentheses something comma something comma something.

461
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,070
Scott: you got a list, you know.

462
00:32:54,331 --> 00:33:01,464
Scott: Then you'll put like some name of a function, you know Like pop push I forget what the words are because I haven't used.

463
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:03,050
Scott: I use lisp once a long time.

464
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,058
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

465
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:07,900
Scott: I know about it on paper But I don't really know it because I don't use it.

466
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,261
Scott: for like.

467
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:09,145
Rym: audio is an example.

468
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:12,349
Rym: you because I was you know looking into This you want to say you want to process some audio?

469
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,093
Rym: So it's like.

470
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:17,310
Rym: you've got a list of different kind like different transformations.

471
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,363
Scott: It's like the sugar and the cutter.

472
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:20,450
Scott: there's something like that.

473
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,609
Rym: Well, you've got like a list of different attributes of audio and then you've got a list of different functions You want to apply based on different parameters?

474
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:34,890
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, the point is that lisp is a Language that is built around lists, right?

475
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,829
Scott: So if you're thinking of solving a problem that involves lots of lists of things, right?

476
00:33:41,451 --> 00:34:00,510
Scott: Lisp if you think about that problem in the lisp language or try to you know Solve that problem with the list programming language it that was sort of a ATM machine right there lisp programming language It'll probably be really easy and it probably won't take as many lines of code to do that to solve that problem.

477
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:06,010
Scott: You know, for example, well at least when I used AutoCAD way back in the day and like high school, right?

478
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,452
Scott: Like it must have been AutoCAD 2000 or I would think it was AutoCAD release 14 The.

479
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:12,534
Scott: you know AutoCAD.

480
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:16,790
Scott: you control it with the GUI clicking on buttons and then clicking on the screen to give the print.

481
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,016
Scott: You know.

482
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,850
Scott: But you can also do all of AutoCAD from this little command line and all the commands were very lisp-like.

483
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,799
Scott: I'm pretty sure it might have been lisp powering the AutoCAD in those days.

484
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,326
Scott: because think about what is AutoCAD when it's.

485
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,530
Scott: it's your you're creating.

486
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:34,870
Scott: You know architectural diagrams mechanical diagrams, you know blueprints that sort of thing.

487
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:40,889
Scott: It's lists of points lists of coordinates lists of vectors and that's all it is.

488
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,737
Scott: So lisp is the perfect language to do that sort of thing.

489
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:48,730
Scott: So people often ask you like, oh, what's what's the best language?

490
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:49,695
Scott: You know for learning?

491
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:51,184
Scott: or what's the best language for this?

492
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,130
Scott: and what's the you know?

493
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:54,438
Scott: Is this language better than that language?

494
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,170
Rym: And the answer is I want to use an analogy real quick Is a hammer better than a screwdriver?

495
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,664
Rym: Yeah, see each language, you know answers, of course.

496
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:04,026
Rym: Yes.

497
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:11,897
Scott: Well, actually There are some program, you know lisp is not the only Language of its kind.

498
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:14,750
Scott: there are other languages that are similar to lisp.

499
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:21,636
Scott: For example scheme is very similar to lisp right and so many people will argue that you know Scheme is better for learning than lisp.

500
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:25,246
Scott: and you know, there's different variations on the same theme.

501
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:28,162
Scott: and you know many times It won't matter which one you choose.

502
00:35:28,222 --> 00:35:32,570
Scott: or maybe one has a few Disadvantages and one has other advantages sort of like you go to the Home Depot, right?

503
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,842
Scott: It's a whole bunch of hammers, but this one's a ball peen hammer.

504
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:37,870
Rym: and this you just wanted to say ball peen.

505
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,230
Rym: You've been wanting to say it since I said the word hammer.

506
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,535
Rym: You've been obsessed with that word.

507
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:45,290
Scott: for the last or like you'll go and there'll be a Phillips screwdriver and a flathead screw.

508
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,992
Scott: Wait a minute.

509
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:46,574
Rym: Wait a minute.

510
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:49,101
Scott: They're both screwdrivers, but they're a little bit different.

511
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,585
Rym: What about tech hammers.

512
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:53,708
Scott: tech hammers are the best anyway.

513
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:01,810
Scott: So a programming language is much like that, but sometimes there is one that is just better than the other for example.

514
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:12,090
Rym: Actually, I can't think of a terrible language right now In terms of like doing something useful Q basic not so useful.

515
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,921
Scott: Yeah, you know that there are languages that are.

516
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:17,250
Scott: sometimes they're the same kind of language.

517
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:22,075
Scott: They're suited to solving the same kind of problem But one is just better than the other.

518
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:26,390
Scott: for example a plastic toy hammer a big metal hammer.

519
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,229
Scott: You know one is just better than the other.

520
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:31,526
Scott: boner.

521
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:34,919
Scott: yeah You can suck that.

522
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,070
Scott: he both solved the same kind of problem.

523
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,820
Scott: You know that one doesn't really do anything.

524
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,590
Scott: the other one doesn't do but one is just better at that.

525
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:51,894
Scott: So one of them is kind of useless, but you know when it comes to comparing something like C and something like Java They're not really Comparable.

526
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:58,479
Scott: I mean if you have a problem in mind like this is my problem Which language is best for solving this problem?

527
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:10,242
Scott: then then I can give you an answer because I can say well The this language the advantages of this language will mean you can solve that problem much easier or get these Advantages and such and such I can.

528
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:22,641
Rym: I can give one opinion though I think and for people who don't know more about this topic or kind of are listening to Scott to learn about CS But don't really code or just like you're new to all this I think I would in the end recommend Python.

529
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,770
Scott: well that see here's the thing right here.

530
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,679
Scott: I'll start talking about what certain languages are good for right.

531
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:31,189
Scott: We'll start with Python because it's a very popular recent choice, right?

532
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,501
Scott: Python is a language that is really.

533
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,469
Scott: it's an object-oriented language.

534
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,698
Scott: I don't know I'm not going to talk about.

535
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:39,929
Scott: maybe I'll talk about what that means.

536
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:49,916
Scott: It's an object-oriented language and pretty much for most modern programming for the web and for desktop applications Object-oriented, you know.

537
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:53,730
Scott: when it first came out, they thought it was a fad but no it's the real deal.

538
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:58,890
Scott: Object-oriented is pretty much is is the way a lot of programming is done these days.

539
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:11,885
Scott: Because thinking in an object-oriented manner seems to be very good for solving a great many common computer problems And even if it's not the optimal way of solving your particular, you know problem.

540
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:13,690
Scott: It's usually a very good way.

541
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:23,486
Rym: Yeah, I think the example I was given by a professor early on at RIT was he showed quake and He talked a little bit about programming languages while quake just played in the background.

542
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:24,410
Scott: I think I was there.

543
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,755
Rym: Yeah, you might have been.

544
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:35,010
Rym: and then he basically said all right now because you know We were all techie people a little bit like we were punk kids and most of us knew some procedural programming like basic or something.

545
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:38,769
Rym: and it was like how would you make quake in a procedural language?

546
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:44,470
Rym: and We were like, ah and he's like it's not impossible, but it's effectively impossible.

547
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:46,315
Scott: Yep, because a procedure.

548
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:56,045
Scott: I'll start talking about this then write a procedural language, right and in many ways all languages are sort of procedural or a procedural aspects of the better.

549
00:38:56,065 --> 00:39:10,870
Scott: procedural language is Pretty much sort of just easier assembly, you know assembly Says do this then do this then do this then go over here and do something different Then go back over here and do what you were doing again.

550
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:20,470
Scott: You know, it's here the order to do things and sometimes it can repeat things It does which it will often do if I go and do something else that it can go and do a bunch of times.

551
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,072
Rym: Go sub.

552
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:21,735
Scott: Yep.

553
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:22,859
Scott: It'll do also it.

554
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,890
Scott: basically it's programming by procedure.

555
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:28,970
Scott: It's like here are the things to do in order, you know.

556
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:37,090
Scott: If you want to build a house first pour the foundation then set up the frame then, you know put on the roof.

557
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,778
Scott: I don't know how to build a house obviously But then I mean there's some problems there.

558
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,310
Rym: and what if you want to build ten houses?

559
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,649
Scott: Yeah, well, it's not just do you want to build ten houses because building ten houses easy It's follow the instructions of building a house ten times.

560
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:57,970
Scott: Well, yeah, but what if you want to you know to have you know, red houses blue houses and green houses?

561
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,030
Scott: Well, we can still do that with the procedural language.

562
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,570
Rym: Yeah, but it gets more and more complicated on townhouses.

563
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:08,329
Scott: And then you want to build houses on different streets and you want to people in the houses furniture in the houses.

564
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:14,170
Scott: You're gonna build a lot of different a lot of people walking around the houses and you also want to program the construction workers.

565
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,915
Rym: different houses have Different attributes.

566
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:23,102
Rym: or you want the prices of the houses and like all the houses are different But they're all based on like a same basic house.

567
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:24,390
Rym: Just everyone wants some custom stuff.

568
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:35,790
Scott: This is where you get object oriented programming in which the the thinking behind object oriented programming is you define a bunch of classes Right in a class, you know an instance of a class is an object.

569
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:48,730
Scott: So I'll have the class house and one instance of the class house is an actual house and I can write the class House to sort of describe it sort of writing the class house is sort of like saying houses are like this

570
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:53,365
Rym: I have to interrupt you by people who live in class houses shouldn't throw it.

571
00:40:53,405 --> 00:40:54,107
Scott: That's bad.

572
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,017
Scott: That's bad I'm sorry, so I write.

573
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:59,610
Scott: I could also write a class car, you know.

574
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,909
Scott: And I basically when I write the class car in code I'm saying cars are like this.

575
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:08,102
Scott: They have these properties and cars can do these things.

576
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,125
Scott: a car has a color.

577
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,154
Scott: It has a horsepower It has a size and has a weight.

578
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:20,759
Scott: it can drive it can stop it can honk its horn, you know, I Define sort of what a car is like.

579
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,046
Scott: then I define specific cars.

580
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,333
Scott: I say new car Ferrari.

581
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,025
Scott: it's red it can as 400 horsepower.

582
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:31,719
Scott: It goes really fast It's horn sounds like this.

583
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:43,589
Scott: and then I say Ferrari go drive and then the Ferrari will drive and then I can be like new car new car new car drive drive drive stop You know and I can make all these cars start doing all these things.

584
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:54,838
Scott: They're just defining what a car is like then making cars and then make it, you know looking changing the properties of the cars and Invoking the things that the cars can do.

585
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,550
Scott: and it's a much, you know thinking about solving problems in that way.

586
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,603
Scott: You can solve a lot of problems that way.

587
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:06,349
Scott: I mean, let's try to think of a Real problem you would solve that way like a video game, right?

588
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,175
Scott: Enemy, I make the enemy class.

589
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:11,823
Scott: The enemy has these many hit points and he can.

590
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,970
Scott: these are his attacks, right?

591
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:16,461
Scott: The good guy he has these many hit points.

592
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,587
Scott: He does these many attacks.

593
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,228
Scott: the map The map is this long it has this many things in it.

594
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:27,150
Scott: Then I after I make all these classes I describe what enemies and good guys and maps are like.

595
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:39,326
Scott: I then just say new map put in the map ten enemies put in the map one instance of the good guy and Map go and then you have a game and like you just loop through and have them all like.

596
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:40,530
Rym: things will call thing.

597
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,029
Scott: You don't even need to loop through you just you know, say everything start and then the things will go.

598
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:52,363
Scott: Ah, yeah, but if you program properly with threads and in such odd I I'm not likely never be at the point.

599
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:53,528
Rym: Well, I will program with three.

600
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:54,150
Scott: It's not that hard.

601
00:42:55,131 --> 00:43:00,095
Rym: Anyway, I make a bunch of objects and then I loop through them calling some sort of timing thing that tells them all to do Their shit.

602
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:02,653
Scott: Yeah, see you take See, that's that's.

603
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:20,510
Scott: that's a very common way to program things is to use an object-oriented data model But to use an actual, you know procedure wrapped around that as opposed to just using you know, some sort of functional Non-object-oriented, you know data structures just like some list linked linked lists and some arrays

604
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:33,009
Rym: That the main reason like I do things like that and a lot of people do is because the object orientedness of setting it Up makes it very easy to put everything together and then coding the other part is very easy.

605
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:37,729
Rym: Yeah, so between the two it takes a lot less good programming practices.

606
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:37,974
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,115
Scott: So a programming language.

608
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:54,705
Scott: the reason we have so many of them is because each of them allows you to think in a different way to help you solve different kinds of problems and you really want to pick the language and Lets you think in a way that is conducive to solving the problem at hand.

609
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:56,050
Scott: Should I keep talking?

610
00:43:56,932 --> 00:43:57,274
Rym: I don't know.

611
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:58,400
Scott: I keep talking some.

612
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,150
Scott: so let's just go over.

613
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,350
Scott: I'm gonna be real brief and talk about like the most popular languages.

614
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:04,349
Rym: Yeah That's a good thing.

615
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:09,990
Rym: Not talking about some specific languages would be pretty sad and people would not be happy.

616
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,691
Rym: I think so.

617
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,074
Scott: see see is a pretty popular language.

618
00:44:13,495 --> 00:44:15,137
Scott: It's not object oriented.

619
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:27,491
Scott: It's it's a functional procedural language And it's mostly good for doing things like device drivers and You know programs that might have to like run on your microwave or stuff like that cuz.

620
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,136
Scott: but C is really good at is.

621
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:36,280
Scott: It's very close to assembly, you know, it does a compiler for C for pretty much any piece of hardware out there.

622
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:40,280
Scott: So you can do really low-level stuff, but you don't have to write assembly.

623
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,219
Scott: You can write C which is a little bit easier a lot easier, you know You can mix C and assembly together a lot, too.

624
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:52,117
Scott: So it really it makes writing that sort of close to the hardware program a lot easier now.

625
00:44:52,157 --> 00:45:02,428
Scott: before a long time ago C used to be it and for a lot of things C is still it because You know, even though it might be harder to write something big You know like a game like a big 3d game.

626
00:45:02,468 --> 00:45:09,400
Scott: and see if you do write it and see because you're so close to the hardware You can do lots of optimizations and get a really high performance.

627
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:12,939
Scott: So if you need high performance C is also a good way to go.

628
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:15,408
Scott: But there's also C plus plus.

629
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:22,191
Scott: C plus plus is pretty much a lot like C But it's got object-oriented action going on.

630
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,499
Scott: objective C is also similar to that.

631
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,137
Scott: The thing about C plus plus is that I really don't like the syntax.

632
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,000
Scott: It's pretty painful.

633
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:30,442
Scott: It's it's.

634
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:38,380
Scott: you know writing in C plus plus is not a joy But it has advantages in that like C you can compile it for anything.

635
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:43,020
Scott: You can actually still get really close to the hardware like in C, but it's object-oriented.

636
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:48,420
Scott: So you can actually think about a lot of problems in a more modern way, but also get high performance.

637
00:45:48,561 --> 00:46:00,595
Scott: And that's why a lot of games are written in C plus plus because they get the high performance But they can still think about the game in an object-oriented way And it won't be so hard to make a game as it would be to make the game in straight C Like they did in the olden days.

638
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,540
Scott: Let's see what else we got here here.

639
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,329
Scott: Visual basic right.

640
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:12,100
Scott: visual basic is a programming language But it comes with sort of like this GUI making thing for Microsoft.

641
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:20,467
Scott: You know the Visual Studio whatnots and pretty much what is good for is if you need a Windows only program Or want to run it in wine or something.

642
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:24,380
Scott: That's pretty simple, but it's mostly just a GUI.

643
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:30,140
Scott: You know a Windows GUI with buttons and labels and images and you know nothing nothing fancy.

644
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:33,360
Scott: You can whip it up in visual basic really quickly.

645
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,771
Scott: It's it's a visual basic.

646
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:36,233
Scott: You know it's.

647
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:37,860
Scott: you make a visual thing.

648
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,959
Scott: That's very basic and you can make it mostly by clicking on things without very little code at all.

649
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:44,947
Scott: That's the visual basic is all about.

650
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,613
Rym: but at the same time don't underestimate it.

651
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,360
Rym: visual basic and the related.

652
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:52,200
Rym: You know Microsoft II things are very powerful for doing certain things.

653
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:00,355
Scott: Yeah I mean if you want to make like a little GUI that helps people generate like spreadsheets in Excel in a little format Visual basic is where it's at.

654
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:03,124
Scott: yeah Let's see what else I can think of.

655
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:08,660
Scott: all right Java right Java is very object oriented like super object oriented.

656
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:15,540
Scott: Right, but the advantage of Java is that first of all there is Java libraries for pretty much everything in the universe.

657
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,540
Scott: So if you want to you know do like encryption you don't have to write a whole new encryption thing.

658
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:24,254
Scott: There's a Java encryption thing that you just use.

659
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:25,280
Scott: it's already there for you.

660
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,852
Scott: You can actually you know you can add some features to it if you need to.

661
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:31,249
Scott: if you want to do graphics There's already a Java graphics thing.

662
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:32,314
Scott: you just take it and use it.

663
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:33,480
Scott: You know they already wrote the classes.

664
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:35,569
Scott: You just got to use them in your program.

665
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,132
Scott: It's beautiful.

666
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:40,689
Scott: the thing about Java Is that you're not gonna get the highest performance.

667
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,002
Scott: Java's a lot better with performance than it used to be but it's not the highest Performance.

668
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:49,460
Scott: the advantage of Java is that Java runs in a virtual machine sort of like VMware, but not quite.

669
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:51,887
Scott: So you write a program in Java.

670
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:56,580
Scott: now that program runs on any machine that can run a Java virtual machine.

671
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,845
Scott: You write the program once.

672
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:01,700
Scott: you can put it on any machine that has Java from a cell phone to a supercomputer.

673
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,302
Scott: All right.

674
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:07,620
Scott: see you have to sort of rewrite your program for every different chip because you're writing so close to the hardware.

675
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:14,440
Scott: You know that you've got to recompile the program for different machines and sometimes you might have to change the code in addition to recompiling.

676
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,629
Scott: So that's the advantage of Java.

677
00:48:16,669 --> 00:48:24,200
Scott: Java is actually you know a lot of you put down Java applets You know and they should put down Java applets because that's really where flash is the winner.

678
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,606
Scott: But Java really is the way they go.

679
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:27,449
Scott: look at puzzle pirates.

680
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,935
Scott: puzzle pirates is written in Java.

681
00:48:29,236 --> 00:48:34,995
Scott: a lot of cell phone games are Written in Java yahoo games a lot of those are written in Java, and that's you know.

682
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,099
Scott: Java's really good at that.

683
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,695
Scott: It's also really good a lot of other things that you may not realize.

684
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:46,260
Scott: Java is being used Because a lot of people just sort of associated Java with Java applet, but you know a lot of web servers run Java.

685
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,224
Scott: You don't even realize.

686
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:58,760
Scott: it's also good for like enterprise database stuff because it's so you know robust You can just also, but just bump up new virtual machines all over the place You know you get the advantages of like a VMware without actually having to do a VMware.

687
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,049
Rym: Yeah, I mean a lot of like big e-commerce website thing.

688
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:06,160
Rym: solutions are using Java stuff integrated with some sort of crazy web sphere.

689
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,694
Scott: Yep, yeah, let's see what are the major languages all right?

690
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,742
Scott: I'll talk about PHP PHP.

691
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:13,626
Scott: I don't know.

692
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:30,060
Scott: I try to think of something to call it like piece of shit something but PHP started out way back in the day when people had like Geo cities right and they could only make HTML And that was it static HTML, but they wanted to put stuff on their websites like little counters and other dynamic things.

693
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:41,599
Scott: you know things on a web page that weren't static and Basically PHP started out is like hey put this little bit of code on your website And I'll put a counter there or but it's a little bit of code on your website and an animated thing will appear.

694
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:47,877
Scott: and People did that and it was like all men's and then PHP somehow expanded into being a full-on.

695
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:53,995
Scott: programming like PHP is kind of useful and that you can use it as like.

696
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:59,400
Scott: you know a Scripting language you know just like for doing normal like operating system stuff.

697
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:02,135
Scott: You can use it to sort of make really easy.

698
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,915
Scott: You know websites that are dynamic because you can mix it in with the HTML.

699
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:11,419
Scott: you can like write some HTML Then a bit of PHP then a bit HTML then a bit of PHP.

700
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,653
Scott: So you can sort of put dynamic things in the middle of the web page, so if you're good at HTML It's not that hard to do.

701
00:50:17,673 --> 00:50:19,363
Scott: PHP also You know and there's.

702
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,108
Scott: it's a. it's really.

703
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:29,053
Scott: you don't have to really program it even though if you want to You can take PHP and go full-on object oriented awesomeness all the way.

704
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:50,044
Scott: It's it's it's totally crazy like that But it's not so Advanced and it actually leaves you with a lot of trouble where if you actually try to make something big and crazy You'll often fall short with PHP You know run into a lot of problems and such and it's actually pretty tied to like the web server in many ways and it Can cause a lot of trouble there.

705
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:52,111
Rym: right talk a little bit about pearl.

706
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,900
Scott: I'll tell you a pearl pearl the philosophy.

707
00:50:55,162 --> 00:51:09,219
Scott: The other thing is that a lot of languages will be similar to each other But the philosophies will be different and pearl is the great example of you know a language where what it does is just fine But the philosophy is one that is basically the opposite of the Python philosophy, right?

708
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,340
Scott: Pearl and Python in terms of what you can do with them are pretty similar.

709
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:15,328
Scott: I mean you know you can both.

710
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:17,457
Scott: you know they they're both for web pages.

711
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:21,050
Scott: They can both You know make actual applications in them.

712
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:24,566
Scott: They're both sort of higher level Languages.

713
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:26,998
Scott: there's quite a bit of similarity going on.

714
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:34,764
Scott: My thing is the philosophy of pearl is that there's a million ways to do everything and there's all these sort of syntactical Shortcuts and things.

715
00:51:35,186 --> 00:51:38,700
Scott: so it's like you can write a verbal program, and I could write one.

716
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,762
Scott: They do the same exact thing, but yours looks nothing like mine You know.

717
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:45,858
Rym: yeah pearl is also the language where a lot of people learn what regular expressions are.

718
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:46,300
Scott: yep?

719
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:46,921
Scott: That does it.

720
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:48,870
Scott: pearl is very good at processing text.

721
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,180
Scott: you have some text and you want to do something with it.

722
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,191
Scott: You know you want to read it or you want to turn it into some other text.

723
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:58,219
Scott: pearl is awesome at that right because it's Very closely tied with the regular expressions.

724
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,777
Scott: Python is sort of does all the same stuff as pearl except Python.

725
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:06,968
Scott: Philosophy is.

726
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:08,439
Scott: there should only be one way to do it.

727
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,388
Scott: You know if I write a Python program to do X and you write a Python program to do X They should look exactly the same.

728
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,099
Scott: there shouldn't be another way to do it.

729
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:18,210
Scott: You know there's sort of a right answer or the.

730
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:22,379
Scott: you know a theoretical right answer like This is the way that this program should be written.

731
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:23,788
Rym: I thought I've just also.

732
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:25,620
Rym: I found Python to be very intuitive.

733
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:27,147
Scott: It is a lot of like.

734
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,760
Scott: the thing is you probably haven't used a lot of the other also intuitive.

735
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:37,551
Scott: No, I haven't, but I've used pearl and Python and I pearl isn't that intuitive But Ruby Ruby is just as intuitive as Python is.

736
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,720
Rym: I never actually tried to use Ruby.

737
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:43,080
Scott: Yeah, a lot of the things will look very similar to to Python.

738
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,909
Scott: You know just sort of variable equals this you know.

739
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:50,311
Scott: if this then that sort of you know the typical very easy to understand Sort of stuff.

740
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:53,028
Rym: yeah There's this brain fuck.

741
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,418
Scott: know about brain fuck.

742
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,340
Scott: Yeah See brain flick is just sort of a joke language.

743
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:04,865
Rym: It's not really useful for anything except teaching But at the same time you can learn a lot from it because if you are able to write something moderately complex in it You've learned a lot.

744
00:53:05,107 --> 00:53:05,349
Rym: Yeah.

745
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,859
Scott: Yeah, it's really you know.

746
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:12,130
Scott: Yeah, yeah There's a lot of languages out there that are sort of toy languages like.

747
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:19,172
Scott: they make them not for the purpose of actually doing Anything really useful for the real world even though you might be able to.

748
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:33,973
Scott: but sort of you know as Sort of like exercises like you look at the language And you think about it, and then you know your mind sort of expands thinking about that and now you're better at dealing with other Languages and such and brain fuck in white space, and

749
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:35,660
Rym: I was about to bring up white space.

750
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,220
Rym: They're all good examples of that because I just realized that the Wikipedia page on white space is fantastic.

751
00:53:40,642 --> 00:53:41,364
Scott: Here's the language.

752
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,710
Scott: you probably may not have heard of that.

753
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:50,071
Scott: I sort of learned once called prologue right in prologue as the name sort of implies is a very logical language.

754
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:53,944
Scott: you ever do those problems in the in the puzzle books that Are like you know.

755
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,140
Scott: there are five people and five items.

756
00:53:57,782 --> 00:54:00,110
Scott: Joe doesn't have the red item.

757
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:02,780
Scott: Mary has the blue item.

758
00:54:04,123 --> 00:54:07,539
Scott: You know he has the item that's darker than that one But lighter than the other one.

759
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:12,642
Scott: You know that sort of thing and you sort of put X's in the boxes to figure out who doesn't match and who doesn't match With what.

760
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:17,446
Scott: and see you figure out who has what item and who lives in what house and you know which item is in which house.

761
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:18,159
Scott: and all that business.

762
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,650
Scott: Prologue is a lot like that.

763
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,804
Scott: you sort of say okay There's this thing This thing.

764
00:54:24,825 --> 00:54:31,291
Scott: you sort of set up these these rules like you said at the circumstance like okay this can equal either this this or this.

765
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,159
Scott: this can never be equal to that.

766
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:39,820
Scott: and This is one of these three and then prologue just sort of sorts it out and arrives at an answer.

767
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:57,500
Scott: So it's very good at solving logic type problems where you have associations of things and some sort of set of logical rules and you want to see like this sort of the the set of all The possible answers like if you're doing some discrete maths Prologue is the way to go because it'll just be like oh, that's your situation.

768
00:54:57,581 --> 00:54:59,957
Scott: These are all the possible true things that will fit that.

769
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:02,966
Scott: you know I'm gonna wrap.

770
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:03,933
Scott: try to wrap it up here.

771
00:55:03,953 --> 00:55:09,800
Scott: We probably should yeah You guys pick a language that haven't talked about this probably pretty big I don't know.

772
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,710
Rym: I mean all I write it is pearl Python and bash.

773
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,480
Scott: I didn't actually talk about Python even though I've mentioned it a hundred times.

774
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,532
Scott: Python is basically the thing about Python.

775
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:20,155
Rym: talk about Python.

776
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:21,260
Scott: I sort of talked about it.

777
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,358
Scott: What else you gonna say the thing about Python the answer to know about is that first of all?

778
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:35,320
Scott: unlike a lot of other languages where indentation, you know Indentation is really sort of a thing to help you read like you can write and see and not indent and it won't care.

779
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,799
Scott: But you know you you're supposed to indent because it makes it easier to read and makes it easy to be able to understand.

780
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:45,100
Rym: by Indenting we mean like say I have a for loop or a while loop or something.

781
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:47,830
Rym: I indent everything underneath that in the loop.

782
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,520
Rym: So it kind of stands out as being grouped together under the loop.

783
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:51,887
Rym: Yeah, you're easier to read.

784
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:54,120
Scott: It makes it easier to read the program and figure out how it works.

785
00:55:54,568 --> 00:56:01,100
Scott: Python Forces you to indent like it actually looks at when the Python interpreter runs and looks at your code.

786
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:05,957
Scott: It looks at the indentations and it's like hey that indentation doesn't make sense.

787
00:56:06,117 --> 00:56:08,926
Scott: or okay That's indented one down from this.

788
00:56:09,247 --> 00:56:10,631
Scott: Therefore I should do this.

789
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,860
Scott: You know, it's indentation actually matters in Python.

790
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:18,720
Scott: But Python is a really useful language because on the one hand, right?

791
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:27,919
Scott: it's it's a very high level object oriented language with a lot of power and a lot of Shortcuts to make you know everyday, you know programs and scripts very easy.

792
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:35,988
Scott: It has an interpreter so you can just sort of type in Python code and it will happen Immediately to sort of test things out.

793
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:41,419
Scott: like you if you have a class you wrote you don't actually have to write some You know script to test the class out.

794
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:56,337
Scott: You just type Python you import the class and then you sort of make objects in the class and you can just sort of you Know you can be like I'll make a car and the car is made immediately and you'd be like, okay Drive car and you can watch the car drive and you can see if things are working and how they work.

795
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:59,020
Scott: and that's why It's very useful for learning and testing.

796
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:07,539
Scott: but Python also In is very strange in that you it sort of compiles into C sort of.

797
00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:17,160
Scott: So if you a lot of people nowadays like when they're writing games Like a big game that has to be like, you know, very high performance 3d game need a lot of frame rates, right?

798
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,100
Scott: They'll write it in Python because very easy easy to think about doesn't take very long.

799
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:28,890
Scott: But then they'll convert the parts that are low performance like oh this part's really slow here The part where renders the the bad guy.

800
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:33,879
Scott: so they'll convert it to C. They'll rewrite all that code to make it fast.

801
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:39,804
Scott: But the rest of the code is still Python, but it's all good because just import the C library into the Python It doesn't care.

802
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:59,220
Scott: There's a little Python wrapper around it or wherever you need to do and You can make really high-performance Applications without having to write everything in C. You can think about things in the Python way and only write that rewrite the slow parts in C. You think hey Python has a whole lot of other advantages besides that like, you know, a lot of frameworks.

803
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:04,420
Scott: There's modules for pretty much everything you could want, you know, like if you want to you know, do this.

804
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,290
Scott: Well, there's a Python, you know, it's sort of like Java.

805
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:08,280
Scott: Python also has a module for everything.

806
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,699
Scott: You just have to find that module and import it and read the documentation for how it works.

807
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:17,219
Scott: Yeah, it's it's generally pretty useful for a whole lot of things.

808
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,236
Scott: Yeah, I'll probably talk about more languages again later.

809
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:24,475
Scott: I gotta I gotta figure out what I'm gonna talk about next.

810
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:31,400
Rym: well pretty much I mean, I'm gonna do one more and then we're gonna go back for a little while Maybe a week or two a couple of weeks probably to normal Monday night show.

811
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,360
Scott: So I got like a month to figure out what I could talk about in the next one thing.

812
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,244
Rym: I'd like to end on those.

813
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:41,506
Rym: I think I was poking around the list on Esoteric or so Lang.

814
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:44,417
Rym: it's a wiki of esoteric programming languages.

815
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:50,214
Rym: That's the word And I think I discovered my favorite programming language ever.

816
00:58:50,234 --> 00:58:50,716
Scott: All right.

817
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,378
Scott: What is it Rym?

818
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,362
Rym: It is called IRP.

819
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:55,911
Rym: All right internet relay programming.

820
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:58,320
Rym: I will leave it to you to read how IRP works.

821
00:59:04,853 --> 00:59:07,442
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

822
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,590
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

823
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:21,490
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com Where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

824
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:27,710
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

825
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:30,442
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays.

826
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:32,250
Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

827
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:38,370
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

828
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:46,790
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at frontrowcrew.com Or you can send audio feedback via audio.

829
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:51,721
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website If you like what you hear.

830
00:59:51,802 --> 00:59:55,960
Rym: you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

831
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,310

Scott: don't make money and share it in kind.

836
01:00:13,232 --> 01:00:16,741
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

837
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:18,666
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

838
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:20,250
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
