1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,758
Scott: It's Thursday January 3rd.

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,680
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:17,404
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight epiphanies.

4
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,116
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,400
Scott: Woman.

6
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:32,466
Scott: it is cold.

7
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:33,509
Scott: It is.

8
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,234
Rym: I think today was the coldest day.

9
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:35,956
Rym: It's been all year.

10
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:36,959
Scott: It is the coldest.

11
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:38,766
Scott: It's definitely the coldest day.

12
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:39,570
Scott: It's been this year.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,599
Scott: Yeah, I do think so, but I think it's.

14
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:43,768
Scott: I think it's also the coldest.

15
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,480
Scott: It's colder than any day last year as well.

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,166
Rym: No, definitely not.

17
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:49,210
Rym: it didn't even get below zero.

18
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:51,443
Scott: No, it was.

19
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:59,475
Scott: there was just something about the way it felt you know because temperature feeling you know isn't really related that much to The absolute measured temperature.

20
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:04,834
Scott: by a thermometer I mean if you put your hand in some cold water And then put it in some warm water the warm water feels hot.

21
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:07,975
Scott: so there was just Something about the way the weather was today.

22
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,227
Scott: it felt Stupidly cold.

23
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:17,035
Rym: that's because it was stupidly cold 9 to 10 degrees this morning, and it got up to a record 15 16 by the midday.

24
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:31,079
Scott: Yeah, like every car was having the smoke come out the exhaust you know and the condensation and the man we my actually the Coldest part of the day surprisingly enough was indoors is.

25
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:36,120
Scott: My boss got back to work And he locks his office and his office is big windows.

26
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:42,315
Scott: So he got back to work and he opened his office and we went in there And it was so cold in that office colder than it was outside.

27
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,280
Scott: It was just crazy.

28
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:52,183
Rym: I think the worst thing is I get on the train right and The trains heater just messed up in the car and I went to another car was the same just couldn't keep up Really it.

29
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:56,220
Rym: I mean all the heat was on full blast, but it wasn't enough and the car was out of Chile.

30
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:06,159
Scott: I didn't have that problem, but sometimes like today both trains I took to work and home were nice and warm and toasty, but sometimes like I'll be on a train and beacon It's nice and warm.

31
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,080
Scott: But then as soon as it gets to Croton and switches to the electric the heat won't be so good anymore.

32
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:13,820
Scott: And I think that the diesel heat is superior to the electric heat.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,653
Rym: That's my theory about probably on the crappy old train cars.

34
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:17,954
Rym: Yep.

35
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,880
Rym: I wish they just build that third rail all the way here.

36
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,295
Scott: I wish they would too, but they need probably more power plant to do that or something.

37
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,340
Rym: well that the thing is that is in The plan, but it's not in the near-term plan.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,718
Scott: Yeah, couldn't they just build like a transfer station like in Cortland or something wouldn't that were?

39
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,943
Rym: I don't know What do you mean?

40
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:37,520
Scott: I don't know some sort of electric boosty machines.

41
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:43,980
Scott: You know if those big coily things on him and hot wires the reason they don't do it is because it's not cost-effective.

42
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:48,059
Rym: Yeah, probably there aren't enough terrains going to Poughkeepsie or beacon to justify it.

43
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:53,502
Scott: Oh funnily enough you know I've always kind of wondered like how close you have to get to the third rail for it to be Dangerous.

44
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,413
Scott: you know cuz I just stay clear away from it as far as I can.

45
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,585
Rym: but I think instruction guys like just jumping over It.

46
00:02:58,606 --> 00:02:59,602
Scott: yeah today I was just.

47
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:03,040
Scott: I saw some guys and they were standing like two feet away from it, and they were just fine.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,520
Scott: So I was like huh, okay that that little guard protect II thing on it must be pretty protect II.

49
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:14,870
Rym: Well the thing is it's not gonna arc over to you unless you are kick it or Provide some sort of very convenient path.

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,020
Scott: take a metal rod and stick it down into the tracks.

51
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,551
Rym: You don't want to pee on it either.

52
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:19,740
Scott: Yeah peeing on it's probably on.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,189
Rym: It's probably the last thing you want to do.

54
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,180
Scott: don't whiz on the electric fence.

55
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,220
Rym: Maybe we should do a show about Ren and Stimpy and how it was funny.

56
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,799
Scott: You want to tell we could do that today?

57
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,346
Scott: Kind of Wednesday show.

58
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:32,692
Rym: save it for Wednesday cuz there's two.

59
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,760
Rym: we could talk about two related things.

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,137
Rym: We would talk about utenna and red and Stimpy.

61
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:45,427
Rym: no because they're related in a very important way in that by taking a crazy person and then Limiting what they are allowed to do you can make great art.

62
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:46,830
Rym: Let's take that limit away.

63
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,507
Scott: You get crazy person you get.

64
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,900
Rym: you get that thing that they called Ren and Stimpy when it came back.

65
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:56,480
Scott: Yeah, that was all that other cable network where I only watched one episode.

66
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:57,303
Rym: It was all.

67
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:58,227
Rym: everything was like man.

68
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,793
Rym: was it spike TV or something.

69
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:00,496
Scott: I don't know.

70
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,440
Scott: I don't watch TV anymore.

71
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,078
Scott: That was years ago.

72
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:07,623
Rym: I just remember buzz about it and then a YouTube Ren and Stimpy and it was disgusting But it wasn't funny.

73
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:10,593
Rym: at least the old Ren and Stimpy was disgusting and funny.

74
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:17,694
Rym: Yep, usually usually All right, so, uh, I found this a while ago.

75
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:18,980
Rym: I've been waiting to talk about it.

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:29,190
Rym: It's definitely a Thursday thing But I saw a flurry of news articles about this pretty much from about a week and a half ago on Mm-hmm, and this.

77
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,299
Rym: I'm just linking to one of many.

78
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:39,272
Rym: I don't know if this is a marketing campaign or if it's just the time is right But I tell you tell me what it is and I'll tell you the thing is.

79
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:43,779
Rym: I feel as though it's about time Because I was way ahead of the curve on this one.

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,676
Rym: Prices fall as more people discover handles ease of use the doorknobs.

81
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,860
Rym: days are numbered.

82
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:51,985
Rym: You know this.

83
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,434
Rym: you find your hand clenching a doorknob and twisting it.

84
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,100
Rym: less often more people You know.

85
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,440
Rym: You just push down on a lever whether it's a simple 5-inch bar or a brass handle curved with the line of a dog's tail.

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,548
Rym: Mm-hmm, and there's this whole article about.

87
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:15,960
Rym: and there's a bunch of stuff why in the last several months suddenly Door handles are a lot cheaper than doorknobs and suddenly becoming very popular in new homes.

88
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:19,632
Scott: I can give you one reason that I just thought of cuz I'm so smart.

89
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,200
Rym: I have the biggest reason handicap accessible.

90
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,687
Rym: That's part of it.

91
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,552
Scott: But the thing is yeah smart I am.

92
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:29,639
Rym: yeah The thing is that that's been around for a long time and a lot of public buildings had to use that.

93
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:34,440
Rym: so If there's so much better, which they are I think doorknobs are just this obsolete horrible thing.

94
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,175
Scott: Yeah, they're the most think about it.

95
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:40,512
Scott: the friction I mean you pushing down a handle easy turning a knob you might slip.

96
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:44,610
Rym: not only that but all right Sam walking And I got a cup in each hand.

97
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,100
Rym: How the hell am I gonna turn a doorknob?

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,845
Scott: Exactly exactly.

99
00:05:48,086 --> 00:06:00,780
Rym: Well, I got some kind of maneuver, but you probably don't want to see it involving feet Involving something involving mouths and who knows what crotches Good God, well, it could be a pot of kiki Musume.

100
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:08,119
Scott: That is that isn't a pot of kiki Musume It's a greased up doorknob and you're holding two boiling hot cups of coffee.

101
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:18,250
Rym: But I did see actually someone on Farg pointed out the the one drawback of the door handle that door handles are Actually designed for one purpose and only one purpose.

102
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:24,094
Rym: if you're wearing a robe and you walk past one They will invariably catch in the sleeve of the robe and pull it off of you.

103
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,239
Scott: Isn't that a good thing?

104
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,123
Rym: Not if it's cold?

105
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:29,930
Scott: I guess not but I mean it's.

106
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,663
Scott: I would think of that as an extra utility not as a oh Crap, I forgot.

107
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:35,565
Rym: I was wearing this robe.

108
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:35,907
Rym: Good thing.

109
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:36,669
Rym: I'm naked now.

110
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,893
Rym: Thank you doorknob.

111
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,458
Rym: Well door handle.

112
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,282
Rym: Thank you Precisely.

113
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,346
Rym: if the doorknob did it.

114
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,330
Rym: I'd be a little scared.

115
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,274
Scott: cuz I mean think about it.

116
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:49,494
Scott: when if I'm wearing a robe When am I gonna pass by the door handle on the way out of the bathroom?

117
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:50,880
Scott: That's not really gonna happen.

118
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,820
Scott: It's gonna happen on the way into the bedroom Which is when I was gonna take the robe off anyway to put on normal clothes.

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,719
Rym: So what if you have a door handle on your exterior door?

120
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,411
Scott: Don't do that.

121
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,480
Rym: Well, you will eventually.

122
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:12,172
Rym: you know why the prices are going down suddenly because I actually for a long time and I remember this as a kid because you know We moved and basically for most of my life.

123
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:18,355
Rym: I had my brother and I had separate bedrooms and One day I was a little kid and I came home from school and I saw.

124
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,525
Rym: I almost said came home from work But I came home from school.

125
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,885
Rym: I saw you know, I saw the front door and I realized wait a minute how come?

126
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:31,583
Rym: the bathroom in the house has a lock and The front door has a lock but my bedroom doesn't have a lock Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,633
Rym: So I went to my mom and said I want a locking door.

128
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,040
Rym: My mom said what do you have to hide?

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,006
Rym: You're seven.

130
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:40,555
Rym: Yeah He just wants to play with the lag and I said there's none of your business.

131
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,299
Rym: I have my rights.

132
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,734
Rym: Yeah, actually they said alright fine you can have privacy.

133
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,870
Rym: my brother and I both got Doorknobs with locks.

134
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:51,596
Scott: They're like 30 bucks.

135
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:57,841
Rym: Well, the thing is we went to the store right and Home Depot doorknobs were between 15 and $40.

136
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:03,054
Rym: You could get a fancy one or a glass one or something But I'm like a brass one with a with a decent lock.

137
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,160
Scott: that was kind of expensive.

138
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:07,934
Rym: Well, the thing is most of them are just a bathroom style lock.

139
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:08,656
Rym: that is basically.

140
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:09,660
Scott: those are cheap.

141
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:15,420
Scott: I'm talking about ones that have an actual key and a lock that would require an average amount of picking to open.

142
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:22,120
Rym: But even then I mean the bathroom lock though those really only serve one purpose and to prevent accidentally seeing someone naked.

143
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,810
Rym: Yep, it doesn't stop you from opening the bathroom door.

144
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:27,440
Rym: Oh, it doesn't stop your mom from catching you masturbating.

145
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,620
Rym: All it does is give you precious time.

146
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,200
Scott: Well, I think that you should never have an actual locking bathroom door.

147
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,480
Scott: Cuz what it you know, the bathroom is someplace that someone is likely to have some sort of problem.

148
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,559
Rym: Oh, it's the most dangerous room in the house.

149
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,268
Scott: I mean, you know if someone they always say.

150
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,925
Scott: I think I've heard someone say this if someone's having a heart attack Don't let them go in the bathroom.

151
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:48,520
Scott: and you know, someone could be like having crazy diarrhea in there.

152
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,560
Scott: You know who someone could pass out in there.

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,150
Rym: You know if it's the crazy diarrhea and my choice is open the door and save them or just let it be well No, I mean like there's a.

154
00:08:57,431 --> 00:09:04,820
Scott: if someone in your house Right is in need of going to the hospital the room that they are most likely in is the bathroom.

155
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,960
Scott: Therefore if the bathroom is locked you're delaying them precious time in which they could be on the way to the hospital.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,833
Rym: I know you pause between the word precious and time and I also pause.

157
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,140
Rym: did you almost say ambergris?

158
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,458
Scott: No, cuz I almost said ambergris ambergris it is, okay.

159
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:23,920
Scott: But uh, I got you know, a normal if whales live in your house and vomit in the bathroom.

160
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,326
Rym: And then I realized that wait a minute I didn't think my clever plan through.

161
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,678
Rym: sure I can do whatever I thought I was gonna get away with.

162
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,400
Rym: my door will be locked.

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:41,967
Rym: Mostly was my brother can't get in but now I can't lock the door when I'm not in my room Mm-hmm, and if I do You can just open the door trivially.

164
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,532
Rym: so I demanded a better one.

165
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:44,194
Rym: Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,300
Rym: And then they said we'll buy it yourself.

167
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:49,418
Rym: So I saved up my money and I bought or I spent a lot of money.

168
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:55,980
Rym: as a kid I spent like 50 bucks on a handle instead of a knob and the handle had an actual lock.

169
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,906
Scott: We have key for the outside.

170
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:02,740
Scott: pretty much every handle I've ever seen has an actual serious, you know reliable lock.

171
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,043
Scott: It's not some master lock of doom But it's it's a.

172
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:14,688
Rym: it's a lock that no not no normal person could open, of course I know for a fact later that my parents did exactly what I would do if I was a. They copied the key before they installed it.

173
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:15,210
Scott: Of course.

174
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,933
Scott: Yeah, well, you can't.

175
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:23,832
Scott: you can't let your kid have a. What if your kid like, you know as a screaming in the night, you can't go in there and rescue them Whatever that you don't do that.

176
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,458
Rym: What about butters?

177
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,098
Scott: That's that's exactly why.

178
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:36,058
Scott: But and of course you remember the the most important thing about a lock for a kids room is you need to also be Able to lock your kid in there when they're bad.

179
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:42,820
Rym: You know, that was probably the best thing my parents could have done if they wanted to punish me.

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,167
Rym: I had a TV in my room.

181
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:45,413
Rym: I had the NES.

182
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:53,768
Rym: I was said yep Now if they locked me in the room and then cut off the circuit breaker to the room and I didn't have any batteries for The game gear then I was fucked.

183
00:10:54,009 --> 00:11:11,486
Scott: Well, even if you had batteries to the game gear you'd be fucked pretty soon Unless you went out the window to the to the convenience store, so The reason doorknob door handles are suddenly becoming popular is that the price has dropped crazily.

184
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:18,940
Rym: and the reason the price has dropped is because Basically people have had to put these in public buildings for a long time because of ADA requirements and whatever.

185
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:30,171
Rym: But as ADA requirements have gotten more and more strict they've had to make these things in more and more bulk as opposed to just for places of business.

186
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:39,880
Rym: and normally when a place of business buys it like if you buy a doorknob for a Public building it cost a hundred two hundred dollars sometimes because it has to be able to deal with the public.

187
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:49,259
Rym: Yeah, so the mechanisms in a lot of the lever handles and lever met things were Generally more robust and better and as a result cost a lot more money.

188
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:52,348
Scott: Mm-hmm people don't really understand how expensive doors are.

189
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,956
Scott: like a front door for your house is hundreds of dollars.

190
00:11:55,338 --> 00:12:08,226
Scott: if you go to like some Building and they have those doors were like on one side There's a bar and you sort of push the bar to open and the other side is like a. you know Pulling, you know thing and then there's the mechanism at the top with that You know that closes the door automatically.

191
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,917
Scott: those doors could be like almost $1,000 sometime.

192
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:16,160
Rym: Actually when I used to work at IBM, there was a really damn good pizza place right there.

193
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,933
Rym: we went there like every day and Every day for as long as I had ever gone there and I'm pretty sure it's still this case.

194
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:33,845
Rym: The front door was broken clearly broken barely a door and The only reason he didn't repair it was that it would cost $3,000 to repair it.

195
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,592
Rym: So instead he just kept the broken door.

196
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:37,815
Rym: It didn't even lock.

197
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,620
Rym: He figured no one's gonna steal the pizza.

198
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,992
Scott: Oh, no, someone stole my pizzas.

199
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,879
Scott: as long as they take the cash home at night I'm okay.

200
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:54,295
Rym: The funny thing was it was run by one guy and he was the biggest fattest Sweatiest most stereotypical pizza owned shop owner guy you've ever seen like on Futurama.

201
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:55,618
Rym: Yeah, exactly like that.

202
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:56,200
Scott: All right.

203
00:12:57,024 --> 00:13:05,540
Rym: but the other reason is that a lot of people are getting old and I mean, there's more old people now in the US than we've ever had and old people have.

204
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:15,700
Rym: So they've been buying Door handles and there's been a market now for cheap consumer grade meaning they break in ten years door handles.

205
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:22,880
Rym: So as a result levers The long standard in Europe apparently are now becoming viable in America.

206
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:29,626
Scott: Now if we can just get the Japanese toilets for set you think I can take the the door handles as like, you know For the interior doors.

207
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:34,930
Scott: I don't know if I like it for the exterior doors so much Why I'm more a fan of the the handle.

208
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:36,174
Scott: Well, not so much.

209
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,760
Scott: I guess not the rotating handles.

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,740
Scott: I like the straight on vertical handle with the button on top of it for the front doors.

211
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:45,072
Rym: Yeah, cuz I I had an old old house that had those in Detroit.

212
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:49,305
Rym: Well, I had it my mom had it but Those things I don't think.

213
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:53,540
Rym: I don't think a single handle like that has ever been functional.

214
00:13:54,842 --> 00:14:04,431
Scott: So the thing is believe it or not it the what I'm pretty sure install and broken the one that's true the one of my that we had in our house never worked.

215
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:06,198
Scott: and you know, that button doesn't do anything.

216
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,114
Scott: but My grandma when she lived in Queens it worked there.

217
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:11,762
Scott: that little button thing He worked.

218
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:19,995
Scott: you better go find that house in Queens and the house already sold for like a zillion dollars Probably because of that door handle, you know, she bought that house for like $50,000 a long time ago.

219
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,309
Scott: But then again a long time ago $50,000 was a lot more money.

220
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,091
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,180
Rym: Yeah funny how inflation kind of kicks that hole.

222
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,630
Rym: Yeah, real estate is the best investment you can make in the bud.

223
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:35,652
Scott: Well, it still beats inflation by a lot Yeah, but even a decent mutual.

224
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:36,436
Rym: I can't talk about that.

225
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:40,027
Rym: Anyway, yeah Anyway, that's enough about doors.

226
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,452
Scott: I gotta do knobs.

227
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,198
Scott: So I gotta do news I guess.

228
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,074
Scott: okay My news is sort of a pre news.

229
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,883
Scott: I'm not actually gonna do a news I'm gonna do.

230
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,719
Scott: the prequel to news is next week cuz pretty much next week.

231
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:56,498
Scott: almost every news I'm gonna do is gonna be something that came out of CES.

232
00:14:56,518 --> 00:15:08,200
Scott: cuz Next week, which is 7 the 7th 8th 9th and 10th of January in Las Vegas is the consumer electronic show And that's probably the main reason I'm waiting for a new laptop.

233
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:15,473
Scott: pretty much everything Important in nerd news is gonna happen there at least everything important like the next month.

234
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:16,676
Scott: We're talking video games.

235
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,080
Scott: We're talking computers.

236
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,106
Scott: We're talking audios.

237
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:27,572
Scott: We're talking, you know car GPS anything electronic Which is almost gadgets phones everything geeks care about.

238
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:31,647
Scott: we should go except for anime and comics Which is a separate show.

239
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,655
Scott: it's gonna go down at CES.

240
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:42,620
Scott: and if you listen to John Z Dvorak, there's no reason to go to CES because So many journalists go and talk about everything that happens there on their websites that you don't need to go.

241
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,042
Scott: You can get.

242
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:46,237
Rym: oh, I would go almost entirely to cause trouble exactly.

243
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:57,749
Scott: I would go to schmooze I go to the lobby, but Yeah, if you just reading gadget if you don't read and gadget any other time during the year reading gadget next week It's the only week you should read and gadget just every day.

244
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:06,291
Scott: go to in gadget and go through all the stories and See what went down because you're gonna see things and go And within a month or two you be able to buy those things.

245
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:06,612
Scott: maybe.

246
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:19,032
Rym: so if you're holding off on a laptop or you're thinking About buying a laptop anytime soon or phone or anything particularly laptop because stereo TV I'm buying a laptop in the next few months, and I'll do all your research for you.

247
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:22,502
Scott: monitor compute computer anything monitors Easy.

248
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,050
Rym: buy a Dell GPS.

249
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,860
Rym: buy a widescreen ultra sharp Dell.

250
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,594
Scott: They got new tells now though that are different.

251
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:28,279
Scott: so you got to wait and see.

252
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:33,238
Rym: Not really because well the thing is I know something good is gonna come out of Dell because they already did.

253
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:34,663
Scott: there's like this Clearish monitor.

254
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:35,526
Scott: that's very strange.

255
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:39,600
Rym: Well the prices of ultra sharps dropped by like two three hundred bucks recently.

256
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,020
Rym: Actually it was only ten dollars more to get the ultra sharp instead of the non ultra sharp of my monitor.

257
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:46,000
Scott: They got these new monitors.

258
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,896
Scott: It's like a piece of plastic and the monitors kind of behind it and the speaker.

259
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:49,560
Scott: you should see it.

260
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,828
Scott: It's pretty crazy, but yeah, this is the kind of stuff It's gonna happen next week.

261
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:58,560
Scott: so pay attention now And then maybe when I do news next week you can fast forward because you've already read it.

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,029
Rym: Yeah, especially when we start seeing the articles about the fancy new door handles.

263
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:13,828
Scott: Oh door handles electronic door handles fingerprint reading at all Things of the day.

264
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:15,720
Rym: so whatever I don't have a thing of the day.

265
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,798
Rym: I do what Scott does what every sane person in the world does I?

266
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,353
Rym: Look to Japanese television man.

267
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,900
Scott: We should just make a separate podcast.

268
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:28,419
Scott: That's like daily and it's like here is your funny Japanese television bit of the day.

269
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,195
Scott: of course There's a bunch of sites like that, and we just steal things from them.

270
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:32,000
Scott: ah the Internet's.

271
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,118
Rym: So uh you know those giant sticky men or those little sticky men at least not the giant ones.

272
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:42,789
Scott: the giant one I'm about to tell you about the ones like the hands on a string that you stretch And you fling them and they grab onto something there.

273
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,740
Rym: the similar idea kind of toy But the ones where it's like a little man, and he does back flips down a wall with little sticky pause.

274
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:49,523
Scott: Oh, I used to get.

275
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:50,608
Scott: I remember the first time.

276
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:51,351
Scott: I had one of those.

277
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:56,115
Scott: it was in a Captain Crunch And it was an octopus and you put it on the wall and the tentacles and sort of go.

278
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:57,060
Scott: ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket.

279
00:17:57,221 --> 00:18:08,666
Rym: Well, I remember we had something like that at Wildwood one year And I believe this is right after we'd gotten the multiple speeches from Scott Johnson's mom of don't make a mess Don't break anything.

280
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:10,354
Scott: I think that was a sticky hand in fact.

281
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,780
Rym: It was one of those sticky things.

282
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,879
Scott: they're all basically the same toy 25 cents from a vending machine at the biggest diner.

283
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:22,020
Rym: and So you know we get this whole speech about hey don't mess up the house Don't cause any damage seriously.

284
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:33,031
Rym: And there's fancy like the textured ceiling and the textured walls in the house, and I don't remember who did it, but pretty much Immediately after that speech it ended and the mom was gone.

285
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:39,039
Rym: one of those sticky men got thrown at the ceiling and I watched as it proceeded to not move.

286
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:44,719
Rym: And when it finally fell the next day there was a sticky hand shaped stain.

287
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,594
Scott: You know my grandparents the.

288
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:52,560
Scott: you know they when they were in Florida They were in one condo, and then they moved to another condo in the same sort of development, right?

289
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,315
Scott: But when they were in that first condo I used one of those sticky hands.

290
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,211
Scott: and in Florida You know it is really tall roof.

291
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:04,540
Scott: You know it's like way tall like Like the room itself was like two or three stories tall.

292
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:07,380
Scott: But you know you only were at the bottom, and there was nothing above you just air.

293
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,180
Scott: And then you know skylights, and I got a sticky hand stuck way up there, and it didn't come down anything for years.

294
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,017
Rym: But of course the Japanese decided that something had to be done with this idea.

295
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:26,839
Rym: so they They made a gigantic one and they put it on the side of a skyscraper, and that's all I need to say.

296
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,139
Rym: Amen it kind of works not really it works a little bit.

297
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,674
Scott: There's something about scale that makes things not work.

298
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:35,979
Scott: That's why we can't have giant ants.

299
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,285
Rym: That's probably a good thing.

300
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:42,680
Scott: I don't know I'd like to be a giant, and I'd rather be some kind of dinosaur.

301
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:45,926
Scott: No, no I think giant ants could beat dinosaurs.

302
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,676
Scott: cuz think about little ants can beat people.

303
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:51,046
Scott: so giant and Yeah, they can.

304
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,820
Rym: little ants can't beat people all right.

305
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,039
Scott: Then I'll go get one and you let it bite you and we'll see what happens.

306
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,605
Rym: See thing is I don't let it bite me.

307
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:57,508
Rym: I go squish.

308
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:06,680
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is that big ant sneaks upright on a dinosaur With his mandibles or it collapses under its exoskeleton mandibles.

309
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,771
Rym: Meanwhile the t-rex actually existed.

310
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,500
Scott: yeah, okay anyway.

311
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:19,706
Scott: So here's a video that's been going around the internet a lot lately, but it's from April 20th 2006 and I think it's some stoned guys.

312
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:29,577
Scott: cuz the subtitle on YouTube is how he passed the time dot dot dot on 420. oh great Some stoned guys, that's that's great right, but this video has been getting pretty popular on the net lately.

313
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:33,780
Scott: this guy basically He's way downtown in New York City like near the Brooklyn Bridge or whatever.

314
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:45,252
Scott: He throws a paper airplane out the window a paper airplane Just like the kind that I know how to make and you know how to make the normal kind and throws it out the window And it goes on quite a dramatic flight, and that's it.

315
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:47,380
Scott: It's a throws it from pretty high up.

316
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,884
Scott: So I he might.

317
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:57,413
Scott: I think there might be a way to win like the Guinness Book of World Records her longest paper airplane fight By making like a high quality specialized sky airplane.

318
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,136
Rym: that's been done.

319
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:03,979
Scott: the records are Well beyond, but whenever they make a new tall building you can beat the record.

320
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,440
Scott: So you someone could go like that building in Taipei.

321
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,654
Scott: That's like the biggest building and probably beat the record.

322
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:12,537
Rym: actually I think a lot of them They do the throwing from level ground instead.

323
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:17,580
Scott: See I would do like longest paper airplane flight period and I throw it out of it like a jet.

324
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:20,277
Rym: We used to do that a lot at my back of the jet.

325
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:24,157
Scott: so well I throw it out the side of the jet where it wouldn't get sucked into the jet engine.

326
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:26,660
Rym: basically a Lot of times we were bored in high school.

327
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,140
Rym: We go to the Arts Department and get big things a poster board and make gigantic paper airplanes, then throw them off the roof.

328
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,620
Scott: Yeah, that's always a good time.

329
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:40,326
Rym: They would pretty much always go off over the horizon and into the park and then disappear And we never found any of them.

330
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:44,199
Scott: the trick is I would always make paper airplanes with these secret paper clip weight.

331
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:45,884
Scott: Paper clip is where it's at.

332
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:51,240
Rym: paper clip weight is for people who are absolutely incompetent at simply doing proper folds.

333
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,193
Scott: No, no the paper clip weight.

334
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:57,054
Scott: you do the proper folds And you add the paper clip weight for the extra boost and also to do tricks.

335
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:58,607
Scott: you can put it on like one side Of the other.

336
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:02,551
Rym: you can do that By folding the paper airplane properly.

337
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,154
Scott: you want to make some.

338
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:03,375
Scott: right.

339
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:04,340
Scott: you got to make the rudders.

340
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:07,816
Scott: But if you make the rudders and stuff and the paper clip you double on.

341
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:08,619
Rym: you don't need that.

342
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,515
Rym: We have to have some sort of a paper airplane contest.

343
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:11,998
Scott: all right.

344
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:12,400
Scott: Let's cheat.

345
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,600
Scott: I'll go on the internet type in best paper airplane print it out and fold it now.

346
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:20,948
Rym: Actually the best paper airplane I've ever seen in person was was in the science Olympiad You know in middle school.

347
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:28,620
Rym: in high school one of the events was You had to make a paper airplane that would stay in the air the longest Mmm, and you know I made one that went okay.

348
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:40,440
Rym: It was actually kind of tubular spiral, and I threw it really high that it unfolded and kind of helicopter down Mmm, and it did pretty well, but I didn't get a medal because uh the one that won I'd have to show it to you.

349
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:57,940
Rym: It's kind of this weird long flat design, but he threw it up, and it went sideways about 40 feet And then it flipped over dropped a little bit and went sideways another 40 feet or so and then flipped over and it just went back And forth and back and forth and it was up in the air for a long freaking time.

350
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:02,440
Scott: My favorite paper airplanes now are like the ones that it's a circle and you go to and it goes.

351
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,707
Rym: Those are actually pretty easy to make.

352
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:08,200
Scott: yeah, I know and people there have been a lot of you know for a while now.

353
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:22,150
Scott: I don't think anything's ever gonna come of it, but like you know aerospace engineers have been trying for a long time I think to design actual flying vehicles that use these circular shape like that But obviously no one succeeded because you don't have giant circles flying around

354
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:30,431
Rym: Right Wrong Time for the main vid I guess.

355
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:31,539
Scott: I guess what was it again?

356
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,400
Rym: Well, we were gonna talk about something and we were planning it.

357
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,183
Rym: We're ready to go.

358
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:39,820
Rym: and then Emily being infinitely wiser than us pointed out that we've already done that exact show.

359
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:50,098
Scott: well the thing is I don't think we haven't repeated any shows, but a lot of times we have a show and Invariably you know we talked about a thing of the day or a news and we'll go on a tangent of some sort.

360
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:50,380
Scott: right

361
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:58,209
Rym: I'm pretty sure we did a show about how to do what we were gonna talk about which included every anecdote I had planned on bringing right,

362
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,904
Scott: but like we'll tell one anecdote here an anecdote there And I think

363
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:02,156
Rym: we told them all in one show in this

364
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:06,494
Scott: I know But I think eventually what happens is a lot of times as we think all right What do we do a show on?

365
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:06,860
Scott: hey?

366
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,944
Scott: How about we do a show on this?

367
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:13,411
Scott: and even though we didn't do a show on that it was we did like some of it in its part of a show.

368
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:20,280
Scott: so there'd be like a little overlap and I don't know if we should keep trying to avoid that or if we should just deal with it.

369
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,960
Scott: Or because I mean you know I don't many shows there's gonna be overlap.

370
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,382
Scott: We can't.

371
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:24,623
Rym: really.

372
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:32,460
Rym: it's going to be a problem as long as we don't do the exact same show Which we were about to do and we're gonna start spicing it up a lot with interviews.

373
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,980
Rym: We've got a fantastic interview lined up for next Tuesday.

374
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:41,034
Scott: I'm not air until the following Tuesday But we gotta do to a Tuesday show this weekend then to fill in.

375
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,320
Rym: probably all right.

376
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:46,219
Scott: Well, we can do a lot this weekend as soon as we should we reveal because I think this is pretty big.

377
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,607
Scott: no No, that's not okay.

378
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:48,815
Rym: I'm excited about this one.

379
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:49,480
Scott: actually we'll get buzz.

380
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,497
Rym: I'm even going to play the game this weekend to prepare.

381
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,452
Scott: oh, man Oh, they already know it's something about a game.

382
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:54,633
Scott: Well.

383
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:55,178
Scott: It's a Tuesday.

384
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,626
Scott: They might They definitely know it's about a game.

385
00:24:57,726 --> 00:25:01,520
Rym: I'm going to play this game my computer my ordinate.

386
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:03,467
Scott: Oh, they know it's a computer game.

387
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:03,788
Scott: Okay.

388
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:04,691
Rym: Maybe not.

389
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:05,594
Rym: maybe it's an NES game.

390
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:06,156
Rym: I have a ROM.

391
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:09,016
Scott: Oh could be okay Interviewing what's-his-name?

392
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,328
Scott: Good pay yeah, no or not.

393
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:11,810
Rym: I wish.

394
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,599
Scott: so what are we doing the show on today?

395
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,020
Rym: Well Emily after shooting down our aspirations actually had a pretty good idea because Scott's Scott fries the best of these.

396
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,909
Scott: But you know something my that one's the best.

397
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:31,944
Rym: that one is just very poignant and also very hilarious okay, but it's no fusiform gyrus, but it's But just.

398
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,229
Rym: you know we kind of realize that And I'm sure you do.

399
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:54,810
Rym: you think back through your life and there there are times in your life where much like in burning wheel where suddenly you have an epiphany and You get a stat or you go to the aristocracy or whatever and have the mad powers Or you're in the middle of something mundane and suddenly you just realize something so profound that it changes your life Forever mm-hmm, and I realized that being geeks.

400
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,218
Rym: We've had a lot of these many of them pertaining to things such as video games Mmm, so I figured that would be a good thing to talk about.

401
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,480
Scott: We could tell you want me to talk about the one that you're hyping up first.

402
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:08,018
Rym: I think so because I think this kind of gives you the idea of where we're going with this.

403
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:08,319
Scott: all right.

404
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:16,640
Scott: well I'm not sure how true This is you know because I'm basically telling a story of my memories from when I was like zero one two and three here.

405
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:19,640
Scott: So who knows how accurate they are to real life or anything?

406
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,996
Scott: But my memory of when I was that young is you know as everyone's memory when they're that young?

407
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:34,754
Scott: very you know Speckled and feel like I have memories when I was that young of like jumping down The entire flight of stairs in my house in a single leap and landing just fine.

408
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,190
Rym: I also remember that I don't think that that really happened Because I've seen other kids do that.

409
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:42,860
Scott: I've never seen a kid do that.

410
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:46,223
Rym: I jumped out my second story window once now But I like.

411
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:51,969
Scott: my memory of it is basically like you know like I was Superman basically And I remember it like it was real.

412
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:59,540
Rym: so either there was magic in the world when I was a kid Or the head injury caused you to remember something not quite like what really happened.

413
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:06,113
Scott: Oh, no, okay, but anyway when I was a kid I remember coloring books and such and coloring because that's what kids do.

414
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:10,190
Scott: and you know I can still kind of like coloring even though I can't really color very well at all.

415
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:32,877
Scott: and now that Photoshop exists There are people who can color better than people have ever colored in the history of coloring And I can't but I can take some crayons, and I can do a mean color by numbers, but anyway When I was a kid I remember coloring and I remember people telling me coloring the lines in the lines Because that's what adults say to kids who are coloring that aren't coloring.

416
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,199
Rym: You know kids Just what la and they just keep scribbling.

417
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:46,739
Scott: yeah I just I remember being a kid and coloring and I remember people saying color in the lines And I remember not really understanding what they were saying, but that's all they said.

418
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,498
Scott: and Then I also remember that basically you know this.

419
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:57,580
Scott: I have a. there's a lot of people in your life And my mom has some like one of her friends from like high school like ancient times.

420
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,988
Scott: You know it's like still a friend.

421
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,486
Rym: You don't want your mom to hear you say that no You know ancient time.

422
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:06,485
Scott: it's one of those people like you call aunt and uncle, but they're not your aunt and uncle They're just you know friends.

423
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:07,531
Scott: They're not ancient.

424
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,100
Scott: They're just been friends for like a zillion years.

425
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,793
Scott: You know since my mom was like in high schools.

426
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:15,514
Scott: It's like 30 Something years long time you know and they they had kids.

427
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:25,177
Scott: cuz you know they're whatever and you know I'd go when I was young we I was much closer to that family, but you know I was over there I think for one of the birthday parties or something when I was maybe three something like that.

428
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:25,639
Scott: I don't remember.

429
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:38,810
Scott: and there's coloring going on everyone's coloring and I remember someone said color in the lines like they always did and for some reason at At that time or at least I remember that.

430
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,095
Scott: I remember coloring.

431
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:41,540
Scott: I remember coloring there.

432
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:58,838
Scott: I remember someone saying it there, and I remember going oh in the law And on that day Scott Reuben gained sentience, I think maybe yes or at least English language skills.

433
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:01,024
Scott: I Think I could talk.

434
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:02,372
Scott: I must have been able to talk by then.

435
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:02,735
Scott: I don't know.

436
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:10,978
Rym: you know it's weird I it's very hard for me to place temporarily a lot of the memories from pretty much middle school and earlier.

437
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,286
Scott: I can do the middle schools.

438
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:16,880
Scott: elementary school gets a little faded towards earlier elementary schools.

439
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:23,347
Scott: I mean, I can't remember any of my problem right as I remember School has this delineation of grades.

440
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:28,223
Scott: so like the memories that are associated with school and stuff I can attach to the grades Yeah, but not the things.

441
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:32,840
Rym: they have to count backward to figure out what you think that happened in the summer or outside of school.

442
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,295
Scott: I can't match up with the year because I don't have the school to go by.

443
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:42,200
Rym: I mean I remember I went on this Gigantic road trip with my whole family and my grandma's conversion van.

444
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:48,134
Rym: We went all the way down the coast of Florida and up throughout And it's like all over the whole like eastern half of the country.

445
00:29:48,174 --> 00:29:51,992
Rym: we went to space stuff And we did everything yeah for the life of me.

446
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,700
Rym: I have no idea when that happened.

447
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,148
Scott: Yeah, like I remember going to Disney World one or two times.

448
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,540
Scott: Don't ask me what years those were I have no clue.

449
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,039
Scott: Anyway got it got an epiphany that you want to share.

450
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,480
Rym: well I think the mo one of the more important ones in my life is that you know I?

451
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:21,035
Rym: Really cared about school when I was really young like you know kindergarten elementary school I was pretty much I'd never gotten a grade that wasn't an a and I always did my homework And I tried really hard and I was like grades mattered and you know everyone said I fell for that.

452
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:23,894
Rym: live for every long Like I'd sit there like I can't

453
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,543
Scott: hold no better They ever exist

454
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:36,739
Rym: so hard and like if I were thought that I was gonna get a beer something I'd worry about it like oh, no And I'd never cheat on homework and other people would cheat and I was horrified at this prospect.

455
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:43,900
Rym: and then Right around the I think was the last month of my sophomore year of high school.

456
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:50,428
Rym: The sophomore year of high school was when I that was probably the most difficult academic Period in my entire life.

457
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,514
Scott: those around the same time.

458
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:56,515
Rym: I figured it out, too But that might be a common thread, but for some reason I had like I was.

459
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:57,238
Rym: basically.

460
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,940
Rym: you know now I had my blog post about maximal output.

461
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:06,820
Rym: I think I was at the maximal academic output of a person of my intelligence who was in the 10th grade at that point.

462
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:08,680
Rym: Yes, I had no less.

463
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:19,545
Rym: I had no lunch and only one band class and the other seven classes were all like AP classes and like craziness like a full crazy stupid school schedule and Four nights a week.

464
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:23,779
Rym: I went to local community college to take chemistry and to be in their jazz band Mm-hmm.

465
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:28,116
Rym: I was like it was like I was doing everything I possibly could and I was getting all A's and I did.

466
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:36,199
Rym: all my time was spent working on homework and doing all this crap and and then right around the end of that year, I looked back and thought wait a minute.

467
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:38,767
Rym: and Forsona what prompted it to this day?

468
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:41,860
Rym: I have no idea what prompted it, but I remember very clearly.

469
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:56,961
Rym: I was walking down the hallway in the science wing of the high school Toward the advanced placement room where I guess they let the smart kids have this room instead of dealing with lockers where we could just keep Our stuff away from the general rabble and it was nominally a study room, but we just played poker in there Usually.

470
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:07,179
Rym: yeah good time and I saw all the other kids playing poker as they want to do and I suddenly realized wait a minute None of this matters and I skipped class for like the next three days.

471
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:10,959
Rym: Yeah, and I pretty much didn't really go to class again until my senior year.

472
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:21,288
Scott: Yeah, I mean when I you know, I got to high school I was still falling for the old lie like your grades in high school matter, you know in middle school They said your grades matter so much.

473
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:29,440
Scott: if you don't get good grades here you in high school You won't get to take honors or AP classes and then you'll be a homeless bum and you never be able to go to college.

474
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:31,679
Scott: Your grades matter so much.

475
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:36,458
Rym: I remember the worst thing was the the lies they were telling me when I was a junior and a senior.

476
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:38,228
Rym: and they're like To get into college.

477
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,245
Rym: you have to do all these things and all that You won't get into college.

478
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:45,404
Scott: and they yep, and then I got to high school and in freshman year of high school I got the best grades.

479
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,971
Scott: I probably ever got actually at RIT.

480
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:47,695
Scott: I got the best grades.

481
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,820
Scott: They ever got at RIT my fresh.

482
00:32:49,724 --> 00:32:53,300
Rym: I mean you do have to be relatively smart and do things to get into a college.

483
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:57,895
Rym: Yes, but the things they were telling they basically actually like.

484
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:01,580
Scott: if you didn't do well enough to get Into Harvard you weren't good enough to get to anywhere.

485
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:08,690
Rym: Well, the worst thing is that they kind of they always like you have to have extracurricular activities and they tried to sell kit like out.

486
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,922
Rym: so many people were members of the National Honor Society or Sad.

487
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:13,605
Rym: sad is like.

488
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:25,837
Rym: that was like the saddest thing in my high school because sad was consistent Nothing, the only people in it were goody two-shoes kids who didn't have any other extracurricular activity or anything to make them stand out for college.

489
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,166
Rym: So they all joined.

490
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:30,220
Rym: sad because the school said you have to join a club or they won't let you into a college.

491
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:32,973
Rym: Yeah, and sad was sad.

492
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:48,497
Rym: and the National Honor Society I think what I really clinked clinched it for me was you had to do community service in order to get the honor society thing and independent of that the school was saying if you don't do community service, no college will let you in.

493
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,380
Rym: and Every one of my high school is doing crazy community service.

494
00:33:51,420 --> 00:34:00,995
Rym: and I did a bunch of park cleanups because that was the only thing I was interested was going to the park and Basically getting yelled at by the city for doing something we shouldn't have done.

495
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:02,320
Rym: but that's a story for another time.

496
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:19,899
Rym: We basically spent two days pulling About in the end probably several many hundred pounds of trash and like old barbed wire and just rotted out cars and debris out of the woods and The city didn't want to pay to dispose of it.

497
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:20,684
Rym: so it left.

498
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:26,300
Rym: it was left there in a pile in the park for Months and they threatened to sue the school because the school let us do it.

499
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,456
Rym: But the school's defense was you sent them to clean up the park and they clean up the park.

500
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:31,320
Rym: you agreed to pick it up.

501
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:31,943
Rym: There it is.

502
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:39,239
Rym: And yeah, all sorts of fun happen, but right around my junior senior year I realized that you can get away with ever you want in high school.

503
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:47,409
Rym: So I I just lied about all my community service and no one ever even questioned No one even considered the possibility that I didn't do it.

504
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:51,503
Rym: Yeah, and that's right around when I also stopped doing homework Mm-hmm.

505
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,592
Scott: Yeah about that time.

506
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:57,840
Scott: I just realized hey, wait a minute Grades don't really matter that much.

507
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:06,750
Scott: I mean, you know There are people who are like doing better than anyone else in this world and they like dropped out of school Granted as much as pendulum likes to say.

508
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,773
Rym: Yeah, just for.

509
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,197
Scott: so I'm not talking about pendulum.

510
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:20,957
Rym: talking like Bill Gates He loves his pendulum is always talks about oh, yeah I quit school and I was stupid and I'm rich and famous and he always forgets to mention the Hundreds of thousands of equally stupid people who don't go anywhere.

511
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:28,620
Scott: Yeah But you know, I figured hey if those guys dropped out of school Right and they made it and now they're the richest guy in the world or whatever.

512
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:33,717
Scott: If I just go to school, I'm like, you know a 4.0 gets me into Harvard.

513
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:34,600
Scott: I'm getting into somewhere.

514
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,328
Scott: You know, I don't need to get all A's.

515
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,920
Scott: I can still have fun now and now the more out.

516
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:42,180
Rym: The moral is not, you know, totally slack off in school.

517
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,286
Rym: It's because then you get all laughs.

518
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,880
Scott: you really if you get all laughs you really won't go anywhere.

519
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:54,470
Rym: It's more subtle than that because remember Scott and I and a lot of these people what we did is we thought it mattered and We tried hard up until 10th grade.

520
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:56,136
Scott: The lesson is don't try though.

521
00:35:56,276 --> 00:36:01,850
Rym: The lesson is Basically do all the work up front when you get to your high school.

522
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,277
Rym: be that smart kid your freshman year.

523
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:05,440
Rym: get all A's.

524
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,846
Rym: It's not you pretty much.

525
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,514
Rym: if you want all A's in high school.

526
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:09,700
Rym: You can get all A's.

527
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:13,447
Rym: So Most people.

528
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:14,529
Rym: so get all A's.

529
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,471
Rym: try really hard.

530
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:19,120
Rym: be a model student for your freshman year and most of your sophomore year.

531
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:26,128
Rym: You will now be as far as the administration and the teachers everyone and the faculty are concerned One of the good kids.

532
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:36,479
Rym: and I'm making fruit like little quotation marks Because in high school I learned time and time again that if the school thought you were good you were good Regardless of what you did.

533
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:46,460
Rym: I mean I remember when Brian Smith and I had both skipped the same amount of class Throughout the year our sophomore or junior year and we got called down to the vice principal's office.

534
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,200
Rym: You always know you're in deep shit when the vice principal calls you down as opposed to the real principal.

535
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:54,320
Scott: Yeah, the real principal is only there for good things and the vice principal is there for bad things.

536
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:58,535
Scott: Yep They should just call him the good principal and the bad principal instead of the principal and the vice principal.

537
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:03,113
Rym: and I listened as they threatened to expel him and not let him graduate for skipping all this class.

538
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:07,569
Rym: and then they brought me in who would skip the Same amount of class and asked me about that one time.

539
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:11,982
Rym: I didn't show up to the class that I obviously had a doctor's note for Uh-huh.

540
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,860
Rym: Yeah, you can get away with anything if you're a quote-unquote good thing in high school.

541
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,440
Rym: You'll never need a hall pass.

542
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:23,989
Rym: If you don't if you write a crappy essay, you'll still get an A because the teacher knows you're smart Yep, or at least thinks you're smart.

543
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:26,320
Scott: Remember the teacher teachers in school.

544
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:27,304
Scott: There's someone.

545
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:30,677
Scott: there are people who are our age who are teachers in high school, right?

546
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:31,400
Scott: They know.

547
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:34,252
Scott: Imagine if I could be your teacher.

548
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:42,880
Scott: I could be your teacher I think is a teacher Do you think that I would actually read all those goddamn essays or do you think I would just give grades after looking at the?

549
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,967
Scott: Name, what do you think I would do?

550
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:45,076
Scott: What would I do?

551
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,427
Rym: See, I would read it but there was definitely cuz.

552
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:57,400
Rym: I remember there was one particular moment in my senior year because you know Basically all the quote-unquote smart kids were in one group for this project.

553
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:06,168
Rym: The project was this huge like month-long thing that involved Hamlet and all this Shakespeare stuff and Basically, we totally dropped the ball.

554
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:11,783
Rym: did jack all we wrote cobble together the crappiest essay you would ever Imagine.

555
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:28,580
Rym: and then for the like the main presentation we poorly and somewhat inaccurately acted out a short scene from Hamlet and we got A's and People who were maybe not necessarily as known to be good students who basically worked their asses off.

556
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,900
Rym: It did a much better job than us got lower grades.

557
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:32,348
Rym: I'm not saying it should be that way.

558
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:34,380
Rym: I'm saying it is that way and you got to take advantage of it.

559
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,790
Scott: All right, let's move on to some other epiphany before this becomes.

560
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:37,956
Scott: the grades don't matter show.

561
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:38,980
Rym: Okay grades don't matter.

562
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:43,567
Scott: Okay, I had an epiphany with Computer programming stuff one time.

563
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,760
Scott: No, actually it was sort of I don't know if it was one big one.

564
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,688
Scott: Well, there was sort of a big one and a bunch of little ones.

565
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:50,958
Rym: I had one really little one with the T command.

566
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:14,265
Scott: Okay, but anyway, you know, like I learned computer stuff gradually from the time, you know And I was in kindergarten to the time now and still into the future, you know I don't know everything there is to know but there was some point in like maybe 10th 11th grade, you know I was doing some C++ kind of action, you know stuff like that and I You know, I was basically I had this book

567
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:14,767
Rym: about

568
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:36,979
Scott: object-oriented programming and I didn't really get it because I had been taught procedural Programming up until that point, you know and there was sort of I don't remember exactly when it was or what happened, but it was sort of like oh Objects oh And then I didn't need to pay attention in CS 1 2 & 3 when I got to college because I already knew you know

569
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,180
Rym: I had a similar but opposite epiphany when I was reading it a long article about aspect oriented programming and I didn't quite get it.

570
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:51,636
Rym: And then after reading the article again, I suddenly realized oh It's just bullshit It's not too bad.

571
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:52,601
Rym: It's not too bad.

572
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:53,365
Rym: It's guys.

573
00:39:53,446 --> 00:40:01,970
Scott: It's one of those things That's a good subject for academic papers and inquiry, but you're not gonna write something that's practical for real world.

574
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,255
Scott: You know production use.

575
00:40:03,315 --> 00:40:07,670
Scott: it's sort of like one of those ideas that people play with it in academic arenas.

576
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:13,470
Rym: Yeah I mean the only real epiphany I had regarding computers was when I had a computer finally in my house.

577
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:16,666
Rym: And what something went wrong, you know, eventually it's a computer.

578
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,180
Rym: something goes wrong Especially if you don't know what you're doing is running Windows 3 1.

579
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,050
Rym: Yeah, and I remember thinking what do I do?

580
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:23,712
Rym: What do I do?

581
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:24,316
Rym: What do I do?

582
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:24,859
Rym: What do I do?

583
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,081
Rym: And then I realized wait a minute No one can help me and there's no way to look it up.

584
00:40:29,202 --> 00:40:33,710
Rym: I just have to figure it out on my own And I think everyone needs to have that epiphany.

585
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:36,159
Rym: You can figure it out on your own.

586
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,910
Rym: the computer tells you what's broken and tells you how to fix it.

587
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:50,338
Scott: For me because basically when I got that IBM whatever in the house, you know I mean like I knew how to use apples and stuff at that point and this thing had OS 2 on it and I was I was lost right, but I knew how.

588
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:51,283
Scott: to you know work.

589
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:56,209
Scott: it could based on what the screen said but I didn't know how the inside of it worked or anything yet really.

590
00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:01,670
Scott: and You know, I'd be calling their support whenever I screwed it up and stuff like that.

591
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,201
Scott: And you know, I understood how to do some things but not really.

592
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:08,956
Scott: and eventually like I got a copy of Windows 95 My dad brought home from work.

593
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:09,960
Scott: I want to put it on there.

594
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:11,850
Scott: So I called their support, right?

595
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,989
Scott: And you know, they wouldn't really help me without me paying the money.

596
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:24,144
Scott: But the guy I happened to get was not a dumb guy and he sort of like gave me hints But without, you know getting in trouble from you know being recorded or whatever.

597
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:28,678
Scott: and he was actually, you know It ain't an English guy, you know from the u.s.

598
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:36,664
Scott: Spoke English and an English guy from the u.s Right, right As in not not from some other country where there might be customers.

599
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,430
Rym: it's not like pip pip Cheerio and all that.

600
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,598
Scott: No, not that either not from Albion.

601
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,570
Rym: I don't know what this England is you speak of right anyway.

602
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:57,589
Scott: So basically with this guy's hinting like vague hinting and me sitting there tooling around I suddenly understood all there was to know about F disk and formatting and dual booting and that whole thing.

603
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:00,970
Scott: and Then when I got a computer out, well, you know, I finally built one.

604
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,160
Scott: I had the whole business already laid out and that's I discovered.

605
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:15,158
Scott: aha and I suddenly I went from basically the personal computer knowing how to work it with the mouse and keyboard to knowing it fully in like Less than a year like BAM.

606
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:15,740
Scott: I get it.

607
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,042
Scott: Now.

608
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:20,873
Scott: The PC is mine, bitch That was a good time Actually, all right.

609
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:28,226
Rym: I got a good one here because it's actually scum in the forums a lot when the old men have been very Pessimistic as to our attitudes on life.

610
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:34,110
Rym: Oh He's gonna attack the old man, they always seem to wonder how we can be so optimistic.

611
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:39,270
Rym: Maybe me more so than Scott because Scott is is the most cynically optimistic person I've ever met.

612
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:41,104
Rym: I think that's the only way to describe it.

613
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:51,249
Rym: Whatever But it's often been said about me that I tend to take everything in stride and it's very difficult to actually get me angry.

614
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:57,364
Rym: and Pretty much there's there's glad Rym and sad Rym.

615
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:57,886
Scott: Is it?

616
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,370
Scott: are you much like Batman?

617
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,356
Rym: However, Batman did not have glad.

618
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:09,342
Rym: he only had sad and mad and every time glad came It was immediately taken away by a gang-up of mad sad bad.

619
00:43:09,362 --> 00:43:12,150
Rym: Yep, or the phantasm whatever.

620
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:30,633
Rym: but I mean I can't really I'd take too long to explain I guess the fullness of this but I Really it's really not that difficult to avoid Having life get you down because when you think about it the worst thing that could possibly happen to you The worst thing that could

621
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:31,436
Scott: ever be

622
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:37,608
Rym: is that you no longer exist that you don't exist that nothing exists And you know what you do exist.

623
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,901
Rym: so you're already better than that and you're on your way to something better.

624
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:46,490
Rym: most likely and the worst thing anyone can ever do to You is kill you and everyone dies eventually.

625
00:43:46,811 --> 00:43:48,737
Rym: So there's really no reason being afraid of that either.

626
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:58,066
Rym: and after you're not afraid of not existing and you're not afraid of dying There's not much else in the world to be afraid of and then there's really nothing worth being angry over.

627
00:43:58,086 --> 00:44:03,970
Scott: Yeah, I Mean, sorry, you're gonna tell the anecdote of how you came to this biffany or not.

628
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:06,610
Rym: I'm not really sure how I came to that epiphany.

629
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:11,830
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've thought of it before and I thought of several times where oh it was then or oh it was then.

630
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,510
Rym: But in the end I've pretty much always been this way except for I guess when I was very very young

631
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:17,673
Scott: Yeah,

632
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:27,555
Rym: and I cared about things a lot more and I was afraid of things I was and then I just stopped being afraid of things and stopped caring and stopped being angry and just never really Nothing ever bothered me.

633
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:28,298
Rym: Yeah.

634
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:43,171
Scott: Well, I mean, you know when I was a kid, you know, like most kids So it's weird because you know We sort of have this idea that the world is full of like, you know bullies and then kids who get picked on but really Everyone sort of seems to remember getting picked on Like

635
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:44,054
Rym: funny that.

636
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:48,510
Scott: yeah, it's like you read these like there's a book right now called the diary of a wimpy kid.

637
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:51,910
Scott: It's actually a kid's book, but I think it's good for all ages and it's selling.

638
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,796
Scott: It's a comic actually But I think it's actually it.

639
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:59,883
Scott: you should you get it at Borders or whatever and I think it's like the best-selling Kids book in the country.

640
00:44:59,903 --> 00:45:03,225
Scott: is that's ridiculous But it's like diary of a wimpy kid and you relate.

641
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:06,767
Scott: the only way to you know I guess enjoy that book is if you relate to being picked on if it's selling.

642
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:09,870
Rym: so well Well, if you're listening to GeekNights, right?

643
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:20,470
Scott: But anyway, you know like like every kid whatever and you know all you know I'd complain about it and I'd always say oh you teachers and your parents and your people you're always.

644
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:28,247
Scott: You know this kid picks on me or whatever like he took my hat or you know He said I was stupid and then I beat him up and then I get in trouble.

645
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:28,870
Scott: What's up with that?

646
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,838
Scott: You know that he's the one making the trouble.

647
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:35,442
Scott: if you just punish him or kick him out of school or something Then there'd be no problems here.

648
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:35,926
Scott: I'm smart.

649
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:42,429
Scott: They're stupid You know, I'm beating them up because they started it and I was right and they did start it and you know, whatever.

650
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:47,930
Scott: and Adults said no, you just got to ignore them and I was like you're just being lazy.

651
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:48,537
Rym: No, it's funny

652
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:49,609
Scott: how lazy and you suck

653
00:45:49,793 --> 00:46:02,030
Rym: I think as kids I mean every kid gets told when they're picked on just ignore them and it's very difficult advice - I mean It's very easy advice to give Especially for someone who's older and went through all that as a kid and then it's like oh just ignore him.

654
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:07,137
Rym: Being a kid and being in that situation That's like tell that be.

655
00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:10,407
Rym: it's like hearing someone tell you when you're in a wheelchair.

656
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,334
Rym: Just get up and walk Just just start walking.

657
00:46:12,656 --> 00:46:13,580
Rym: Why are you sitting there?

658
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,050
Rym: It's it's it's not the easiest advice to follow.

659
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:16,613
Scott: No, it's.

660
00:46:16,653 --> 00:46:17,940
Rym: but then you get older and you go.

661
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:18,624
Rym: Oh, man.

662
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:21,057
Rym: Ah I could have just not.

663
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:22,144
Rym: I could have just ignored him.

664
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:23,130
Scott: You could have just ignored him.

665
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:33,019
Scott: Hey, basically what happened is, you know people picked on me You know bothered me less and less or whatever and you know less beating people up and less You know fighting and less such over the years.

666
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:40,725
Scott: Yeah, you know, but eventually, you know, I just sort of like And in high school, I think I was in some class.

667
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:44,002
Scott: It was a geometry class Maybe I don't remember but it was like.

668
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:49,648
Scott: it was some class Where I it was for something was geometry because no one in the class is in my grades.

669
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:54,150
Scott: like all these people I didn't know right so they didn't know me that I was a complete stranger.

670
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:01,383
Scott: I just sat there quietly doing my maths, you know, whatever and You know, they didn't have any reason to pick on me or anything.

671
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,789
Scott: they didn't care about me they didn't know me.

672
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,217
Scott: But you know, they would come mr.

673
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:08,952
Scott: Bean and I guess you know, if you seen a picture of me and you see a picture Of mr.

674
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:10,287
Scott: Bean, I guess I kind of look like mr.

675
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:10,489
Scott: Bean.

676
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:12,517
Rym: I mean if you squint you're from a distance.

677
00:47:12,658 --> 00:47:17,918
Rym: or if you're you know a kid and you're looking for something to pick out a Kid for all right, so they just be like mr.

678
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:18,560
Scott: Bean.

679
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,890
Rym: I mean someone we know has a big head big head.

680
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,557
Scott: So at first I was like, okay.

681
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:22,798
Scott: Mr.

682
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,385
Scott: Bean sounds like kind of like a weird name.

683
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,530
Scott: It's probably something stupid.

684
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:30,179
Scott: But I know they're picking on me, but I didn't know mr Bean was at all at the time.

685
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:41,129
Scott: so and now I still I've really only seen a few things at mr Bean like the that what you know the thing where he pretends to play the drums and the the turkey in the oven thing But whatever I didn't know who he was.

686
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:46,250
Scott: So like the fact that they were calling mr Bean didn't bother me because I didn't understand what they were saying.

687
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,934
Scott: It wasn't like they were saying, you know, you're retarded or something because I would I would understand I didn't understand what they were saying.

688
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:53,302
Scott: So it's like huh you kiki booba.

689
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:55,510
Scott: Yeah, I was like what I didn't get.

690
00:47:56,316 --> 00:48:03,179
Scott: So it didn't bother me even though someone's making fun of me and Then eventually got to the point where they'd be like mr.

691
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,424
Scott: Bean and I'd be like, what's up?

692
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:05,689
Scott: and they'd be like, what's up?

693
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,474
Scott: And I was like, huh?

694
00:48:07,494 --> 00:48:11,144
Scott: They're like all acting like a bully, you know, like they're mean.

695
00:48:11,685 --> 00:48:14,983
Scott: but if I just say what's up They're all what's up.

696
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:15,467
Scott: It's all.

697
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:19,850
Rym: and Well, there's definitely the the aspect of stolen Thunder.

698
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:31,130
Rym: I mean it is very easy if someone in any situation is giving you grief and you steal their Thunder by not caring That that usually they don't know how to react to that, you know.

699
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:46,220
Scott: But really like these people just by I mean I could have done the same thing that most nerdy kids do when you pick on them which is go start crying or start fighting or yelling or or Yelling trying to come up with comebacks that are not witty or making yourself look like a moron

700
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:47,164
Rym: The stairway.

701
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:51,020
Rym: come back you come up with something like after fourth period but it's too late.

702
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,680
Scott: It's too late, right, you know.

703
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,999
Scott: and and then if you try to do that people just make fun of you for that because you're being stupid and crazy.

704
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:08,480
Scott: and Well, I realized as soon as I stopped doing that a lot of those people who I thought you know We're making fun of me or didn't like me or hated me if I just had this different attitude.

705
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:16,960
Scott: They you know, they didn't become like my close friends or anything, but they were just like, you know Hey, what's up in the hallways as opposed to knocking your books down on the floor?

706
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:30,980
Rym: Well, I mean actually most alive the the classic the book job I think it is called most of life just comes down to attitude because generally if you're confident and you look confident Most people will get out of your way and give you pretty much anything you want.

707
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:36,858
Scott: Yeah, and from that point on it pretty much became impossible to pick on me.

708
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:50,000
Scott: pretty much I mean, even if someone hits me, I'm like, all right You can hit me one more time before I start hitting you and I'm like a warning them Whereas before like if someone touched me, I'd be like trip over smash their face in the ground or try to anyway.

709
00:49:51,265 --> 00:49:52,177
Scott: I was like in middle school.

710
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,960
Rym: I can never get the situation where someone's holding you by the forehead at arm's length while you're windmilling.

711
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,150
Rym: No I don't think that everybody middle school.

712
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,860
Scott: one time this kid like took my Mechanical pencil and he broke it and then I tried to choke him and then I got suspended.

713
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,974
Rym: Well, I had a similar situation.

714
00:50:05,994 --> 00:50:06,900
Rym: I think was in sixth grade.

715
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,765
Rym: I was sitting on the bus.

716
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:09,074
Rym: that was like the only year of my life.

717
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:13,673
Rym: I wrote a bus to school And this kid just grabbed my headphones and broke him.

718
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:17,365
Rym: just broke him into oh man I'm like what the hell.

719
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:18,609
Rym: and he yelled something.

720
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:25,667
Rym: and then I just jumped on him much like in a Christmas story when he jumps on that bully and basically Destroys him.

721
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:26,900
Scott: Yeah, that's that's how it went.

722
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,252
Scott: But as we both got suspended as soon as you just sort of take it differently It really is more you than it is.

723
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:43,839
Scott: I mean because think about if everyone is having remembering experience of being picked on right, you know No one remembers like being a bully when they were a kid.

724
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:46,979
Scott: I mean, have you ever met anyone who says hey, I was a bully when I was a kid?

725
00:50:48,122 --> 00:50:48,644
Scott: Not really.

726
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:50,995
Scott: So it's really just.

727
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:52,582
Rym: that might just be the circles We keep.

728
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:52,904
Rym: it

729
00:50:52,924 --> 00:51:01,819
Scott: could be but I've never met anyone like that and I really think that More so than what I mean everyone sort of treats everyone that way when their kids really

730
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,347
Rym: well kids are vicious little bastards a lot of the day

731
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:16,821
Scott: are pretty much all kids are vicious little bastards to all to everyone and the happier kids are the one you know, the sooner you just Act differently and don't get all crazy about it and just be cool You

732
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,207
Rym: know not is not the more

733
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,011
Scott: happy you're gonna be.

734
00:51:19,211 --> 00:51:21,140
Rym: not to espouse religion or anything like that.

735
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:29,480
Scott: But in the end the Gandhi Jesus way, yeah I mean like think of even nowadays right go to anime con right and I see a scary fanboy.

736
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:31,987
Scott: If I go to that scary fanboy I go.

737
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:44,677
Scott: man you were the scariest fanboy you smell bad you like the hentai's you're terrible right, and so most of those fanboys freak out because they still haven't learned this lesson and though that's why I Kind of keep making fun of them for being scary fanboys.

738
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:52,220
Scott: Yeah Right, but yet again There are other people who are big who are exactly the same as those fanboys in every way.

739
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,548
Rym: Like what's in that Ramu guy in the forum who came in?

740
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:58,280
Rym: He's like, I like hentai and people like yeah, you're creepy.

741
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,253
Rym: He's like, I'm creepy and I like hentai.

742
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:01,119
Rym: What you gonna do about it?

743
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:13,347
Scott: And there's there's no more thunder left and making fun of someone if they don't care Yeah, and it's just basically they're you know, and it their attitude sorta, you know determines whether they get respect or not Even though they particularly like.

744
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,109
Scott: I could have some.

745
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:23,519
Scott: I could have a friend who's like a hentai nut and I can have someone That I bash and trash who's a hentai nut for being a hentai nut and have a hentai nut friend at the same time.

746
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:26,590
Scott: Right and it's it somehow works.

747
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:35,120
Scott: just because of the way the person carries themselves Determines their level of respect more than what they're actually getting the risk to make it feel more noble than just like bully.

748
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:36,277
Rym: Whatever think of it this way.

749
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:44,742
Rym: Imagine that you are the a great general in the Roman army and you're going off to face against Hannibal somewhere Right now.

750
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,145
Scott: obviously the cannibal.

751
00:52:46,726 --> 00:52:49,031
Rym: Uh, no, no not Hannibal the cannibal.

752
00:52:49,091 --> 00:52:57,746
Rym: No, there's there's a No, I Think Hannibal works the best.

753
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:58,731
Scott: Genghis Khan.

754
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:00,579
Rym: Nah Genghis Khan not so much.

755
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:08,628
Rym: I'm talking about, you know, the kind of honorable fight between two Generally urban civilized civilizations.

756
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:16,899
Rym: All right, not so much hordes of horsemen coming in saying give us all your stuff And we'll come back fine heavier way.

757
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,671
Rym: But all right, so you're marching out right now.

758
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,900
Rym: you disagree with Hannibal.

759
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:29,351
Rym: In fact, you might say that were you two to have to deal with each other in person There might a fight might break out might draw sword.

760
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:42,018
Rym: Someone might get hurt, you know, those things are dangerous and Obviously you're gonna come to some sort of disagreement and Hannibal is of course Trash-talking you back in Carthage and you have no kind things to say about him now.

761
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,900
Rym: The Romans kind of sucked around when Hannibal came in.

762
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,819
Rym: So the Romans were effectively being bullied and there's nothing they can do about it.

763
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:51,992
Rym: But they got to go fight him and Hannibal's.

764
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:53,320
Rym: All right, I'm just gonna kick their asses.

765
00:53:54,020 --> 00:54:22,300
Rym: But even though the Roman army basically hid in the hills and did jack all and just took it they held their heads high the whole time and as a result Hannibal came to very much respect the Roman army and even fear them because even though there were no match for him and He could just come and kick their asses anytime he wanted There was kind of this mutual respect among enemies and if you can get a bully to respect you even if they don't like you They'll leave you alone because they're easier pickings, of course Hannibal did not go get easier pickings.

766
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,120
Rym: He stuck around and eventually got his ass kicked.

767
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,397
Scott: Well, that's because the other thing is you don't you know Rome had giant piles of gold that he wanted.

768
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:28,980
Scott: No, they didn't.

769
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,563
Rym: No, they didn't.

770
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:32,750
Rym: this was way before the Rome.

771
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:39,239
Rym: Most people know about Hannibal was way early and Rome was a much Funnier and not so powerful place.

772
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:48,047
Scott: Even so the only reason I could see for someone to continue going after a prize that's much more difficult to get Would be if the prize is bigger.

773
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:49,070
Rym: Well, yes, and you know what?

774
00:54:49,091 --> 00:54:51,098
Rym: Here's another epiphany most analogy.

775
00:54:51,118 --> 00:54:57,517
Rym: In fact all Analogies break down because if it break if it doesn't break down, it's not an analogy.

776
00:54:57,617 --> 00:54:58,220
Rym: It's the thing.

777
00:54:58,481 --> 00:54:59,424
Rym: Yeah, they're identical.

778
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:00,788
Rym: It's not an analogy.

779
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:04,520
Scott: Yes, people only use analogies to help explain something.

780
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,122
Scott: That's not.

781
00:55:05,323 --> 00:55:07,391
Scott: if you can't if someone makes an analogy.

782
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:09,560
Scott: They're trying to help you understand what they're saying.

783
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:12,989
Rym: Much better developed fusiform gyrus.

784
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:13,390
Scott: Yes.

785
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:19,040
Scott: They're not tried, you know, if you destroy their analogy That doesn't mean that the thing they're actually saying is wrong.

786
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,980
Scott: You have to destroy the thing they're actually saying but just think of it this way.

787
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,563
Rym: It's kind of the.

788
00:55:23,845 --> 00:55:32,949
Rym: you know, two people can be enemies or disagree on Fundamental principles and yet still have the respect, you know The two generals meet and have the respectful like.

789
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:34,795
Rym: I am going to destroy you.

790
00:55:34,895 --> 00:55:38,325
Rym: Well, you can try ha ha ha See you on the battlefield tomorrow.

791
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:38,726
Scott: Yep.

792
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:43,020
Scott: And as soon as I figure that out life was a much better.

793
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:45,370
Rym: Yes now there's one more.

794
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,780
Rym: that's probably the most important epiphany you can have.

795
00:55:48,681 --> 00:56:02,220
Rym: Um, if you still play the doorknob safety game and you listen to the previous half of this episode You might be able to put two and two together and realize that you're heading very quickly toward dangerous territory.

796
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:11,240
Rym: There will be a time if you continue this game where someone will say doorknob and you will realize there is no longer a doorknob In this continent and you sir are fucked.

797
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:13,736
Scott: Don't stop playing the doorknob safety game.

798
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:17,364
Scott: I'm trying to stop playing.

799
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:18,508
Rym: I stopped.

800
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:19,812
Rym: You know what way back.

801
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:21,277
Rym: It's actually been almost a year.

802
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:22,120
Rym: I gave it up.

803
00:56:22,622 --> 00:56:40,858
Rym: I was sitting there one day and I farted straight up not not like pizza somewhat epic eruption overnight at the New Year's party, but I Was sitting there and Scott and I were playing like Mario Tennis or soccer or something and I farted and it was.

804
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:49,020
Rym: it was loud Resounded in the in the video rocker pretty pretty soundly and he looks at me Because it's kind of you don't see the honor among enemies.

805
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:49,884
Rym: It's kind of like.

806
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:52,639
Rym: he knows I'm going to say safety and he's going to let me say it.

807
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:58,328
Rym: he just give the pause to let me know that he could have said doorknob and All I said was I'm not saying it.

808
00:56:58,408 --> 00:57:01,040
Rym: I'm done with that and I haven't done it since.

809
00:57:02,012 --> 00:57:06,741
Scott: Yeah I've been trying not to say Comes out every now and then.

810
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:07,742
