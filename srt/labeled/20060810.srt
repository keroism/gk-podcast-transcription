00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,230
Rym: It's Thursday August 10th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:17,238
Rym: It is actually a GeekNights special meaning that me and Scott are not here.

3
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:21,338
Scott: We fought away Very very far.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,530
Rym: so of course we've said this all week But if this is the first GeekNights you've ever heard by all means listen.

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,059
Rym: But this is not what GeekNights is.

6
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:33,868
Rym: this is a GeekNights special meaning We're not in town, and we've recorded this only to fill in the feed until we get back.

7
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:38,850
Scott: So enjoy the very few minutes of podcast you're about to listen to now.

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,750
Rym: This is a tale of misery and woe but also of triumph and then final utter defeat.

9
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:51,870
Rym: This is the tale of the 1974 color RCA television that has served us so well and is finally being put out to pasture.

10
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,147
Scott: Well, this is Rym's television in the beginning.

11
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:59,803
Rym: well Yes to start the tail actually it was my parents color RCA television.

12
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,210
Rym: We had this back when we lived in Detroit.

13
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,437
Rym: It was huge.

14
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:04,623
Rym: It's not really that big.

15
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:08,058
Rym: It's like a 20-something inch yeah, but when I was a little kid this thing was huge.

16
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:23,810
Rym: this thing was a massive massive awesome TV and It probably worked function wonderfully for a number of years, but as time went on it didn't function so well I mean it was perfectly serviceable, and it had a minimal set of inputs in the back of it.

17
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:28,988
Scott: And it had a remote control, and that's crazy for the time because it's a late 70s model.

18
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:30,956
Rym: Yeah, and that was really it.

19
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,643
Rym: I mean it was wood paneled it.

20
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,390
Rym: the screen was super super curved.

21
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:38,348
Rym: It had this ass little speaker in the front of it that barely worked.

22
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,038
Rym: now I needed a TV at RIT.

23
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:49,710
Rym: When we got an apartment our sophomore year Scott and I and of course we were poor college students I mean we were so poor we didn't have anything.

24
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,528
Rym: We had a bunch of furniture that my dad gave me and my mom gave me this TV.

25
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:58,870
Scott: Yeah, freshman year all I had was a little tiny TV that belonged to my roommate and had a VCR in it.

26
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:07,530
Rym: so So we lugged this thing into the apartment And it we plugged it in and we used it for a number of years in fact for all of our time at RIT.

27
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:08,734
Scott: This was the TV.

28
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,142
Rym: We had now this TV one.

29
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:13,670
Rym: it made this high-pitched wine.

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,130
Scott: always You could hit it and sometimes make the wine go away, but it really wouldn't go away.

31
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,709
Scott: It just become quieter than the volume of the television.

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,768
Rym: now We're not talking about that high-pitched wine that all CRT CRT based televisions make.

33
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:28,250
Scott: we're talking.

34
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:35,149
Rym: It was loud and annoying and we would walk and we learned the specific place to hit it to make that wine go away.

35
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:41,735
Rym: Sometimes sometimes we would bang on that thing as hard as we could Not as hard as he could.

36
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:44,005
Scott: that would have breaking it that possum broken broken it.

37
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:45,009
Scott: good game good game.

38
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:54,964
Rym: Also, it had a nice tendency to if it ever lost power if the power ever went out or anything it would make an Unearthly racket like it was exploding for a second.

39
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,829
Rym: It would just go like BAM.

40
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,477
Rym: I've no idea why it did that.

41
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,490
Scott: all I know is I think it was capacitors discharging or something.

42
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:10,390
Rym: yeah, all I know is many a time it saved me like if the power was out or something even back when I was a kid and The power went out in the middle of the night, right?

43
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:15,570
Rym: I'd have no way to wake up in the morning, but the TV would make such a loud noise It would wake me up and then I'd know that the power was out.

44
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,582
Scott: Also, supposedly Rym is told tales tall tales.

45
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,750
Scott: Yes of the TV making ball lightning.

46
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:32,449
Rym: There was one time I was in eighth grade and I was lying in bed and this TV was in my room Scary so I wouldn't sleep with that thing in the room.

47
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,910
Rym: Well, I wasn't afraid of the TV or anything should be because we had a better.

48
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:37,530
Rym: Actually, maybe was nice.

49
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:44,148
Rym: I forget exactly when it was but I remember I was laying in bed and The TV was in my room because my parents had gotten a far superior TV.

50
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:47,710
Rym: Finally We'd gotten it in fact to watch the Stanley Cup playoffs of all things.

51
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,790
Rym: But anyway, we the TV was in my room and I was using it.

52
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,530
Rym: I think earlier in that day I'd watch the lost boys on it unrelated note.

53
00:03:56,252 --> 00:04:02,750
Rym: and I'm sleeping and I'm woken up by this humming noise and I look and there's this glow emanating from the top of the TV.

54
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,965
Rym: and Now if I had been anyone else I probably thought oh my god a ghost.

55
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:07,407
Scott: Oh my god.

56
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,318
Scott: Oh my god Aliens, oh my god.

57
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:09,861
Rym: Yeah instead.

58
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:12,275
Rym: I thought holy shit What the fuck is that?

59
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:14,828
Rym: and I get up and I walk over to it.

60
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:17,369
Rym: I don't I couldn't tell what it was.

61
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:30,268
Rym: It kind of freaked me out and then I went back into my bed and I laid there staring at it for a while and I figured whatever it was It was either a figment of my imagination or something and I would just go back to sleep and whatever.

62
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:37,079
Rym: and I went back to Sleep because good idea I mean I was afraid to poke at it because I wasn't sure What it was.

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,020
Rym: and if it was some sort of electrical thing I didn't want to hurt myself and it seemed like it.

64
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,529
Rym: I really couldn't tell it was this bluish greenish light.

65
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:50,405
Rym: So I go back to sleep and in the morning I'm like, hey mom a TV made a light and my mom's like, oh, it's done that before.

66
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,890
Rym: I think it's ball lightning.

67
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,108
Rym: Yeah, and I was like what?

68
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,395
Rym: And then I looked online.

69
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:05,669
Rym: I read all about ball lightning which may or may not actually exist in the form that is described but Supposedly is very dangerous.

70
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:07,521
Scott: All lightning is there.

71
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,024
Scott: Yes.

72
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:13,828
Rym: Yes Well in magic the gathering even ball lightning is hella dangerous super but only once only once.

73
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,825
Scott: yes Oh, I guess he only happened once.

74
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,272
Rym: it's okay now the TV also.

75
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:34,069
Rym: once I had put a glass on top of the TV with water in it while I was drinking and then I walked away for a while and the glass I didn't realize had a crack in the bottom and The water slowly over the course of a day drained out of the glass Down the front of the TV and into the electronics of the TV.

76
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:34,973
Scott: Awesome.

77
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:38,450
Rym: now when I came back the glass was empty.

78
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:39,976
Rym: So I didn't even.

79
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:43,550
Rym: I just left the glass there because I didn't even notice that yeah leaving glasses all around the house.

80
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:44,110
Scott: What's wrong with you?

81
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:52,240
Rym: I didn't even imagine that water had leaked out and into the TV, but for another for the next week or so The TV wasn't working so well.

82
00:05:52,281 --> 00:06:05,395
Rym: like the remote control when I change channels it would change randomly and every none than the volume which go up and down kind of randomly and Noises would come out of the speakers, but it still kind of worked yeah, and eventually I Had another.

83
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,709
Rym: I had the same glass and I was drinking and I set it down on the table next to me.

84
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,669
Rym: Then I look and water is slowly leaking out of it.

85
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,645
Rym: And then I look at the TV, and I see the residue of all the water that had leaked in.

86
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:19,700
Scott: and oh It's all coming together now.

87
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,289
Scott: yes, I see what you did there.

88
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,279
Rym: So of course eventually we moved out of that apartment to where we are now and the TV is also Somewhat heavy and more than heavy.

89
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,248
Rym: It's very bulky and hard to move.

90
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:35,522
Scott: yeah I mean, it's a TV so the total weight of it probably isn't.

91
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,947
Scott: maybe between 50 and 100 pounds.

92
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,470
Scott: Yeah, I'm like that But all the weight is the big piece of glass in the front of it.

93
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:53,106
Rym: So it's really hard to carry it when all the heaviness is on one side Especially up and down stairs because we lived in a tri-level apartment style so we had a stairwell to go down to get into our apartment mm-hmm.

94
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:57,570
Rym: and When we finally moved actually we were debating and how we gonna get this into the house.

95
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,203
Rym: It's such a pain in the ass and our friend Pete who was helping us move Just picked it up by himself carried it and set it down.

96
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,361
Rym: Hooray yes Now we use the TV for a little while.

97
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,990
Rym: then we realized this TV sucks.

98
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:10,171
Rym: Now.

99
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:17,670
Rym: one of the reasons it sucked aside from everything we have just mentioned was that the whatever it used to control the stream of electrons.

100
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,027
Scott: Magnets yes, I don't mean the cathode rays.

101
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:27,257
Rym: yes I don't know what kinds of magnets they were or how they were oriented But they were failing.

102
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:35,608
Rym: and the TV was this picture would bow in More and more as time went on like it was an hourglass and sometimes it would unbow.

103
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,034
Rym: sometimes It would do it doubly.

104
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:40,129
Rym: so hitting the TV seemed to affect this but not every time.

105
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:44,249
Scott: Sometimes you put other magnets near the TV to see if you could fix it.

106
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:52,290
Rym: Yeah, it was the worst when we were playing games because whenever something fast and bright happened It would just screw itself up and go crazy for a few seconds.

107
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:57,329
Scott: The TV was no good, but we were poor college students, and we lived with it.

108
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:01,910
Rym: Yeah We had an RF modulator that was then plugged into like the antenna thing on the back of it.

109
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:09,030
Rym: And then plugged into that were other things like the VCR and any many RF modulators in a row and RF switches.

110
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:14,525
Rym: We had so many things plugged into it that they formed an antenna And we could get all the local TV stations without having one.

111
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:15,189
Scott: yep.

112
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:21,570
Rym: So we eventually decided to get rid of the TV, so we bought a new TV with Scott's awesome Sony discount.

113
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,742
Scott: Whatever evil Sony we have an evil Sony TV.

114
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:26,690
Rym: Yeah, Sony makes okay TVs.

115
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:27,996
Scott: It was cheap.

116
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:31,952
Scott: It was a hundred bucks for a 27 inch Glass.

117
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,660
Scott: well CRT, but the glass is flat TV.

118
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:35,544
Rym: real nice TV.

119
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,149
Rym: all things considered it works for us.

120
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,534
Rym: Yep, so we TV.

121
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:43,174
Rym: so we stuck the old RCA in the closet, and we forgot about it A few days ago.

122
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:43,856
Rym: Well a week ago.

123
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,160
Rym: We decided all right.

124
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:46,865
Rym: Let's throw this thing away now.

125
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:54,093
Rym: where I grew up Garbage collection was municipal and no matter what you put on the curb they would take it away.

126
00:08:54,495 --> 00:09:00,402
Rym: you could put a whole couch and a TV and like a refrigerator out there and Garbage day they just take it all.

127
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,210
Rym: it would all disappear.

128
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:10,086
Scott: That was not the case where I lived and I knew that you had to call a junk guy to take away the junk or Drive it to the dump yourself or illegally dump it.

129
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:10,770
Rym: now.

130
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,145
Rym: We weren't exactly sure where we live currently what to do, so I decided all right.

131
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:18,750
Rym: I knew I'll try something We'll take it out to the curb, and they didn't take it great.

132
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:27,030
Rym: so then we start trying to call dumps to get rid of this TV or Scrap people or whatever and no one can actually take the TV from us.

133
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,310
Scott: Well, I mean they can but they want to charge a lot of money, or they can't come to our house when we're home.

134
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,354
Rym: Yeah, what's the deal?

135
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:33,997
Rym: the first guy?

136
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,690
Rym: I called was like he wanted 50 bucks like whatever.

137
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:43,390
Rym: Can you just come and get rid of this thing and apparently he'll only come Monday through Thursday between noon and 4.

138
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,771
Scott: Nobody's.

139
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:49,070
Rym: oh, there is not a chance that anyone will ever be in our house on those times ever and wait.

140
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,399
Scott: Don't say that cuz someone might come and rob us.

141
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,117
Scott: not yet on Monday through Thursday between noon and 4.

142
00:09:55,117 --> 00:10:01,407
Rym: Well, we got the security system And we got the old lady in the other house right like you know downstairs.

143
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:01,949
Scott: that might help.

144
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:08,250
Rym: But anyway not only that but the guy even suggested well Why don't you just take a day off work, and I said what for that?

145
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:15,623
Rym: I'm not gonna lose a half a day's pay, which is like 500 bucks and give you 50 bucks I'm just gonna dump it illegally.

146
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:18,981
Scott: for all that Exactly what's the fine for illegal dumping?

147
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,569
Scott: depending on I guess it depends where you dump it?

148
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,736
Rym: You know what the fine for illegal dumping is probably far less than the amount of money I'd lose by skipping a half a day of work.

149
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:33,070
Scott: You know what if we just kind of sneakily put it somewhere Like what if we go to a Best Buy and just kind of dump it in their dumpster?

150
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:39,017
Rym: why don't we just go to Best Buy and act like we want to return it and have some receipt and Make a big fuss like what do you mean?

151
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:39,721
Rym: We can't return it.

152
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:40,405
Rym: What do you mean?

153
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:41,370
Rym: blah fine?

154
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,704
Rym: Screw you guys and just walk out and leave it sitting on their desk.

155
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:44,710
Scott: or I get a better idea.

156
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,456
Scott: Let's bring it to like a Best Buy.

157
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:50,430
Scott: right and we'll just go around behind the Best Buy and just put it on the ground.

158
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:51,956
Rym: That is illegal.

159
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:52,520
Rym: They could get us.

160
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,837
Rym: a lot of people have TV Cameras watching their dumpsters and such.

161
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:04,188
Scott: we look around for cameras and we find there's got to be someplace around Or we can just kind of put it like at night and no one will know.

162
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:12,120
Rym: well we were gonna donate it to goodwill because it still works, but Goodwill is kind of far away and every time we decided to do it.

163
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:15,070
Rym: We didn't feel like hauling that thing down into Scott's car.

164
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,179
Scott: Yeah, I mean now it's been sitting outside.

165
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,705
Scott: I don't think it works anymore, but it might.

166
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,513
Scott: it's had water in it before I'm cure.

167
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:21,238
Rym: I'm kind of curious.

168
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,169
Rym: I kind of want to plug it in and see if it still works.

169
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,093
Scott: now It's all you cuz.

170
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:24,796
Scott: it might explode.

171
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:25,559
Rym: it might explode.

172
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:25,880
Rym: It's been.

173
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,708
Rym: it's been in like two rainstorms already.

174
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:35,764
Rym: Yeah Now currently I think the plan is we're gonna dump it in the dumpster of the plumber who lives next to us who seems Okay with us using his dumpster.

175
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:38,488
Scott: Yeah We'll see if they actually take the TV.

176
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:51,529
Rym: the moral is a Township or a town should never make it difficult to throw garbage away Because if it takes more money and effort to properly get rid of garbage then it would take to illegally dump it.

177
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,689
Rym: A lot of people less moral than us would probably just dump it in the woods and that would be the end of it.

178
00:11:57,171 --> 00:12:06,390
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I don't see a problem with having private waste disposal But waste disposal has to be cheaper than the fine for illegal dumping.

179
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:12,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean unless you know You don't care about you might as well not have illegal dumping if you make it hard to dump.

180
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,519
Scott: In fact, you should pay people to dump legally.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,446
Scott: then no one would illegally dump ever.

182
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:22,710
Rym: Yeah, that's why I guess I really like the system where I grew up where they take everything that way.

183
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:34,370
Rym: I mean it cost the city more overall But because of economies of scale it costs less than if there are individual people doing it and as a result illegal dumping is not A problem at all except for like, you know toxic waste, but that's an industrial problem.

184
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,821
Scott: I blame NIMBYs for not wanting there to be more dumps.

185
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:37,966
Scott: You need to have dumps.

186
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:38,850
Scott: Everyone's got shit.

187
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,117
Scott: It's gotta be dumped somewhere.

188
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,290
Rym: The NIMBYs also fight against recycling plants.

189
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:50,314
Rym: Yeah, there should be dumps and recycling plants in every town or at least ways that make it easy to properly dispose of Garbage.

190
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,763
Scott: and you need a tire fire also Escalator to nowhere.

191
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:58,563
Rym: Yes Once again, this is the end of the GeekNights specials.

192
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:11,170

Scott: I gotta say I mean you have to be listen to the show.

195

196
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:27,665
Rym: In addition, it's a tech day where we won't have really any easy excuse to talk about Otakon.

197
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:29,430
Rym: Nope, not at all.
