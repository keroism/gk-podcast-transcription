1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,072
Rym: It's Tuesday February 8th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:12,473
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,135
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:14,660
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,319
Rym: Tonight our PAX East 2011 pregame show.

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:24,787
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,650
Scott: So, uh, who is the sheriff?

8
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,176
Scott: Scott is the sheriff.

9
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:38,854
Rym: I would like to note this is the first time ever that Scott has been the sheriff.

10
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,118
Scott: It doesn't matter when.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,430
Scott: It doesn't matter how many times or for how long.

12
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:44,636
Scott: It matters now, right?

13
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:45,380
Rym: It matters now.

14
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,072
Scott: Packers won the most recent Super Bowl.

15
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,980
Scott: Steelers have won more Super Bowls.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,088
Rym: So the Steelers are clearly a better team.

17
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,300
Scott: Right now Packers are on top and the Steelers not so much.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,489
Rym: I would say the team that has more Super Bowls is the better team.

19
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,174
Scott: I am the sheriff right now.

20
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,860
Scott: Therefore, I am the sheriff.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
Rym: However, you are the sheriff right now, but I note some- He admits that I am the sheriff right now.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,326
Scott: I note- Gettin' the pokey.

23
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:11,638
Rym: Many an embarrassing non-sheriff day for Scott.

24
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,105
Rym: Many a multiple shot loss.

25
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,032
Scott: Yeah, keep your mouth shut pokey.

26
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,340
Scott: I'll poke you with a stick through the bars.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,016
Rym: So Cold Guy, I think we mentioned this in the MagFest show, gave us an Atari 2600 with RCA and S-Video out.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,805
Scott: We had an Atari 7800.

29
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:30,779
Rym: Yep, we still have the Atari 7800, but it's a giant pain in the ass to make it work on the 52-inch LCD.

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,148
Scott: Yeah, you need a bunch of weird cables and it's a little bit flaky.

31
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,246
Scott: This 2600 is modified to have regular video outputs to a regular old television.

32
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,836
Rym: You wouldn't think this would be such a big deal.

33
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,000
Rym: I was like, yeah, this is cool.

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,166
Rym: We'll play it every now and then.

35
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,320
Rym: I play that goddamn thing every day.

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,024
Scott: Well, really?

37
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,760
Scott: Basically, we'd be like the number one game.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,085
Scott: You see, a lot of the Atari games.

39
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,480
Scott: just they don't really hold up a lot of water at all.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,024
Scott: They're tiny.

41
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:56,320
Scott: They're like cups, not even buckets.

42
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,740
Scott: Well, I mean- But one game above all the others is actually way awesome and in desperate need of a remake and that game is Outlaw.

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,844
Rym: Outlaw.

44
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:09,820
Rym: Now, it depends on whether or not you're playing with invincible or invincible cacti.

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,480
Scott: Well, it has so many modes is sort of what gives it all this replay value.

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,340
Scott: It has modifier of- It's got cactus, wagon, and wall.

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,446
Rym: Yeah, it has moving wagon.

48
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,579
Scott: Invincible and invincible, so that's already six.

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,715
Scott: Ammo and not ammo, so that's six to 18 modes.

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,160
Rym: There's moving and non-moving wagon, there's moving and non-moving wall, and there's also target mode.

51
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:33,100
Scott: There's like at least like 30-something modes.

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,205
Rym: I do love these old Atari games where on the cartridge.

53
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:46,300
Rym: it'll be like 148 modes and usually the modes are like drive during the day, drive during the day slightly faster, drive during the day slightly faster with more obstacles.

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,360
Scott: Oh, and then there's also the hard mode, right, where your bullet disappears if you die.

55
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,280
Rym: I know, when we turn that mode on, I would win with scores of like 10 to 1.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Scott: We only turn that mode on once ever.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,059
Rym: You want to turn it back on?

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,655
Scott: I think we're going to have to play with that mode on.

59
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:03,020
Rym: Maybe we should film- I got a new HD camera, maybe we can record some matches.

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,660
Scott: Maybe we should, but the thing is, Outlaw is such a pure and awesome game.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,080
Scott: Two cowboys, you shoot a gun at the other cowboy and try to hit him and you can only shoot straight up or down and it bounces off the top and bottom walls.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,256
Rym: Your cowboy is shaped like a pretzel and consists of like 15 pixels.

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,200
Scott: But it's so pure and simple and it still works to this day as a quality multiplayer versus experience.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,780
Rym: There's something about the direct competition games like this, Warlords doesn't actually hold up that well, it's too finicky.

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,760
Scott: Well, I think Arcade Warlords would hold up, but I think it's Atari Warlords is kind of weak.

66
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,060
Rym: I say combat holds up just as well, you just suck at combat.

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,380
Scott: Combat is too- doesn't have the purity that Outlaw does.

68
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,440
Rym: Wait, what's your argument on Counter-Strike?

69
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,159
Rym: Everyone who doesn't like it just sucks at it?

70
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:50,535
Rym: Combat?

71
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,300
Scott: No, combat is different.

72
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,559
Rym: Combat is- Yeah, because you lose like 100 to nothing stuck in the corner.

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,060
Scott: Combat has some serious flaws in it.

74
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:02,459
Scott: Well, the fact that when you get shot, right- It disorients you.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Scott: Yeah, you get spun around, so there's a serious momentum factor to the first strike.

76
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,160
Rym: Uh, yeah, you've got a plan for that shit.

77
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:18,740
Scott: Right, in addition to that, the way the controls are, right, in order to aim your shot after you fire it and then you can turn to have your shot move- That's only one mode.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Scott: I know, but I'm just saying is that in that mode, when you shoot and you want to angle your shot, you rotate your tank at the same time.

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,260
Rym: I'm sorry, Scott, that you don't have the ability to manage a precision multi-control scheme.

80
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,180
Scott: With a really, really- first of all, and that's a really precision control with a really non-precision control.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,931
Rym: I argue that our controller for the Atari is exceptionally precise.

82
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,240
Rym: It is perfectly binary in four directions.

83
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,947
Scott: Yeah, which is not enough for some sort of analog control of a- Because it's not analog control, that's your problem.

84
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,320
Rym: You're projecting your desires upon a game that is in fact pure.

85
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,127
Scott: It's broken.

86
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:55,360
Scott: It's not a good game.

87
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,838
Scott: You're also no good at maze craze.

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,859
Scott: Airplane mode is much better than tank mode.

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,320
Rym: Wait, biplane mode or jet plane mode?

90
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,180
Scott: Either one is better than tank mode.

91
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,607
Rym: What about maze craze?

92
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,580
Rym: What do you have against maze craze?

93
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,019
Scott: It's just kind of lame.

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,147
Rym: How is it kind of lame?

95
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,700
Rym: You've never beaten me at maze craze.

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Scott: Yeah, Evan, it's just not exciting.

97
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,799
Rym: I might have to take your sheriff's badge away after this.

98
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,392
Scott: You had to take it away by force, Mr.

99
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:19,894
Scott: Pretzel.

100
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:21,540
Scott: You're back in your pen.

101
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,568
Rym: So, I don't really have a news.

102
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:26,500
Rym: Video game news I haven't been paying attention to so much.

103
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,000
Rym: Partly because PAX is coming up and I'm putting all my effort into waiting for PAX.

104
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,028
Rym: But there's a game.

105
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,498
Rym: A lot of our listeners play it.

106
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,500
Rym: And they goaded me and Scott and a bunch of us to start playing it with them.

107
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,028
Rym: Or at least next to them.

108
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,160
Rym: It's a game that really encourages parallel play.

109
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,900
Rym: Because Civ V, like Civ IV served two purposes.

110
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,760
Rym: It was kind of this multiplayer versus game.

111
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,240
Rym: And it was also this kind of world building, see what happens game.

112
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,820
Rym: Like, yeah, Tokugawa totally tried to attack me.

113
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,460
Rym: But then, you know, something crazy happened.

114
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,619
Scott: Civ V has some of that.

115
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,040
Rym: Not nearly as much.

116
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,060
Scott: Well, I think Civ V makes you bring a little bit more of it yourself.

117
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,040
Scott: Like Dwarf Fortress makes you bring some of it yourself.

118
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,100
Rym: Yeah, Civ V is much less a world building game and more a win the game game.

119
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:12,519
Rym: But because the win the game game is broken in multiplayer, we basically can't play it.

120
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,319
Scott: I wonder if they fixed it by now.

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,885
Rym: I don't know.

122
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:15,719
Rym: I haven't seen any updates.

123
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:23,980
Rym: But Europa Universalis is the opposite of Civ V. It is basically the sandbox of, all right, it's the Middle Ages.

124
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:25,848
Rym: What country you want to be?

125
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,036
Rym: You want to be the Ottomans?

126
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:27,499
Rym: Let's go.

127
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,567
Rym: What are your goals?

128
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:29,680
Rym: Whatever the fuck you want.

129
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:30,757
Rym: Go for it.

130
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,419
Rym: It's kind of like Grand Theft Auto, but the world.

131
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,960
Scott: They give you quests to sort of suggest what you should do to match up with history.

132
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,840
Rym: I've been playing as Spain.

133
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,820
Rym: And the first quest is basically finish the Reconquista.

134
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,600
Rym: Which is way easy because it starts you when the Reconquista is already mostly done.

135
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,640
Rym: But I have complicated feelings about this game.

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,439
Rym: On one hand, I appreciate what it's trying to do.

137
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,540
Rym: I appreciate the depth and the complexity.

138
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,700
Rym: The fact that the game responds in unique and interesting ways.

139
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,600
Rym: That very small actions I take have a very pronounced effect in the long run.

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,857
Rym: However, I have played this game for like 20 hours.

141
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:15,380
Rym: And I cannot tell if I actually know how to play it or not.

142
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:18,319
Scott: You have to have someone explain it to you.

143
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,560
Scott: Otherwise you're just not going to know what's up.

144
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,180
Rym: I got some explanations from listeners.

145
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,060
Rym: I played through some online suggested tutorials where they walk you through the normal game.

146
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:31,340
Rym: And I read the wiki and I got a good handle on it.

147
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,500
Rym: I finished the Reconquista.

148
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,979
Rym: I conquered a bunch of North Africa.

149
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,300
Rym: I'm totally allied and all these things with all my neighbors.

150
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,919
Rym: I got trade stuff going on.

151
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,679
Rym: I got ships headed out to the New World.

152
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,640
Rym: And I feel like it'll take about 180 more hours of gameplay to figure out if that plan worked or not.

153
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:49,239
Scott: Well, the thing is, you can just speed it up real fast.

154
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,939
Rym: Yeah, but then my micromanagement.

155
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,218
Rym: I got to micromanage.

156
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,558
Scott: You want to micromanage?

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,180
Scott: Like you want to change the settings every single hour, really?

158
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,118
Rym: Uh, pretty much.

159
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,200
Rym: That's how I've been playing.

160
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,138
Scott: That's a problem.

161
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,100
Rym: Luckily, the military is pretty abstract.

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,760
Scott: Most of the settings you do take so long to have any sort of meaningful effect.

163
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,600
Scott: You've got to let time go by or else you're changed and actually doing things.

164
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,399
Rym: Most of it's diplomacy.

165
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,660
Scott: You've got to basically go at least a month before anything actually happens.

166
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,419
Rym: I'll basically speed it up, and then as soon as I get a diplomat or something, I've got to immediately set it back to zero because I've got to send that diplomat somewhere else.

167
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:21,279
Rym: You can do that.

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,857
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how I- Or you might hold on to the diplomat because you might have a more needy use for him.

169
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,560
Scott: that might appear.

170
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,720
Rym: Yeah, I love how you can't declare war because your diplomats are gone.

171
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,179
Rym: You have no one to send to tell them you've declared war on them.

172
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,220
Scott: Yeah, well you also need a Cassius Vella to declare war.

173
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,159
Rym: But I don't know if I like the game or not.

174
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:41,657
Rym: But I'm playing it.

175
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,540
Rym: And it's weird for me because Dwarf Fortress did the same thing.

176
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,780
Rym: And in Minecraft, I play these games.

177
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,340
Rym: I've got three games now where I do not have a strong opinion on them.

178
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,540
Rym: I enjoy them and I play them, but I don't know if I like them or not.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Rym: And this is a new experience for me.

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,239
Rym: I mean, as a kid, I'd put in like Spider-Man on the Atari and be like, "Fuck this game," or E.T.

181
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,060
Rym: I knew I didn't like it right away.

182
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,180
Rym: Mario 1, Castlevania 2, I knew I liked them right away.

183
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,720
Rym: Counter-Strike, I didn't like, and then I liked.

184
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,300
Rym: These games, I don't know if I like them or not.

185
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,739
Rym: And I don't know if I'll ever know if I like them or not.

186
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,280
Rym: And I don't know what to do about that.

187
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:21,300
Rym: I need other people to play it to validate my experiences.

188
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,540
Rym: You can get the games way cheap if you don't get the newest expansion.

189
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,360
Scott: Yeah, I'm just sort of, you know, I'm sort of eh.

190
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,220
Scott: I'm the Europa Universalis, right?

191
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,880
Scott: It's got good parts and it's got bad parts.

192
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,219
Scott: And I don't ever feel like a compulsion to play it.

193
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,057
Scott: But if I turned it on, I could totally get into it.

194
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,720
Rym: I feel like it really shines if you play it with a bunch of people, multiplayer.

195
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
Scott: Yeah, that could take a while though.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Rym: Yeah, well I feel like once we all have a, we grok it to some degree, or think we grok it, we should start some sort of big front row crew game where we play for like an hour once a week.

197
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:53,479
Scott: We'll see.

198
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,916
Rym: We'll see.

199
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:54,999
Scott: Good luck with that.

200
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,640
Scott: We've tried that a bunch of times, never happened.

201
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,320
Scott: Anyway, I also couldn't find any meaningful gaming news, right?

202
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,460
Scott: Except for the fact that Kotaku and all the other Gawker sites have a really shitty redesign that everyone complains about.

203
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,380
Scott: But this time, usually people complain about any change no matter what.

204
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,300
Scott: This time I agree with complaining about this change.

205
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,820
Rym: Yeah, well like Twitter, the new one is clearly a superior.

206
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:16,638
Scott: Right.

207
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:25,120
Scott: But like this new Kotaku and all the new Gawker sites, they're just, they don't work in older browsers and they're hard to read and they got glitches and it's not good.

208
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,500
Scott: Anyway, but on Kotaku, Steven Totillo, right?

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,459
Scott: He wrote this little article here.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,520
Scott: Why I Let Nintendo Beat a Video Game for Me, right?

211
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:39,720
Scott: And basically, you know, I've been a little bit leery of him, right?

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,939
Scott: Since he wrote that other thing, which is like, I can't get doomed to run.

213
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:49,360
Scott: I think that there's one major problem in games, right?

214
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,720
Scott: People talk, people like to talk about all the problems in game journalism, right?

215
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,520
Scott: And we're certainly not modeled game journalists of any.

216
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,139
Rym: No, we're not.

217
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,940
Rym: But at the same time, we can pull the cop out of, we don't pretend to be game journalists.

218
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,380
Rym: That's right.

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,079
Rym: We are game journalism commentators.

220
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,080
Scott: It's not the job that we're paid to do, right?

221
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,739
Scott: We're just guy, we're just armchair dudes.

222
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,210
Scott: But the thing is, I think the one major problem in game journalism that is not ever brought up, right?

223
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,720
Scott: Cause you'll bring up all sorts of problems like, oh, the companies pay you money and the advertisements on the right and all that kind of stuff, right?

224
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,300
Scott: Here's the problem.

225
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,890
Scott: I think that is the biggest problem.

226
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,540
Scott: is that the game journalists, right?

227
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,780
Scott: They are not, they do not have expert knowledge of games, right?

228
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:35,099
Scott: And they do not have expert skill in games.

229
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:38,640
Scott: You know, if you want someone to review a movie, right?

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,680
Scott: A film critic probably needs to have film knowledge of gone to film school.

231
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,540
Scott: She'd know something about film, right?

232
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:48,460
Scott: You know, obviously if they know a whole bunch about film, they're going to be a director.

233
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,820
Scott: That's the eternal problem in any area of expertise, right?

234
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,640
Scott: If you're really good and you really know that much, you're not going to be a critic.

235
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,020
Scott: You're going to be doing it, right?

236
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,780
Scott: So someone who's the most qualified game journalist in the world isn't going to be a game journalist.

237
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
Scott: They're going to be a game maker, right?

238
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,980
Scott: But the thing is, like, obviously his skill is so low, right?

239
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,180
Scott: He couldn't even beat this game, which is Donkey Kong Country Returns.

240
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,959
Scott: There's a new Donkey Kong Country for the Wii.

241
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,040
Scott: Donkey Kong Country Returns and it's a hard game apparently.

242
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,336
Scott: I guarantee I could beat it.

243
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,700
Scott: But Nintendo has a mode that they've added and they've added to, I think, some of their other games recently, which is just a beat this level for me.

244
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,500
Scott: So you push a button and then you watch Donkey Kong will turn gray and turn into Super Kong and he'll just beat the level on his own.

245
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Scott: You just watch him.

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,400
Rym: Wait, now, say you hit that and he beats the level and you get to watch it.

247
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,820
Rym: Does it also say that you have now beat the level and let you move on?

248
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,127
Rym: Yep.

249
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:43,980
Scott: You can just beat the whole game.

250
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,720
Scott: You just watch the whole game be beaten and see the ending.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,280
Rym: On one hand, I don't care.

252
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,639
Scott: After you die eight times.

253
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:59,520
Rym: On one hand, I don't care because someone who cares about the experience of gaming wouldn't use that option anyway and people should be able to do whatever they want.

254
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:00,900
Rym: If someone wants to cheat, fine.

255
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:04,400
Rym: On the other hand, are you even trying any more Nintendo?

256
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,460
Scott: Right.

257
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:21,920
Scott: He says, he brings up one point, which is he likes this not because it makes the game easier, but because there are a lot of cliche and boring parts in the game and this lets him skip over those parts, play the interesting parts and skip the boring parts.

258
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,819
Rym: Well, as a journalist, shouldn't he then say that the game is full of boring parts and they had to hack together this mechanic to let you skip them?

259
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,520
Rym: Why did I pay for this 40 hour game that only has four hours of content?

260
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:42,520
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much like, all right, look, we'll make this big old game and it has good parts and shitty parts, but we put this thing so you can skip the shitty parts.

261
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:43,940
Scott: Now it's a great game, right?

262
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,080
Scott: No, it's still a shitty game with plenty of shitty parts.

263
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,999
Scott: Allowing me to skip over the poop doesn't make it smell any better, right?

264
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:56,760
Scott: If there's a room that's full of shit and you hold your nose and run past it, it doesn't mean that room is not full of shit, right?

265
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:04,437
Rym: You can definitely tell, at least in game design, like the game designers think about these things versus the ones who don't, but I don't feel like any journalist think about these things.

266
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:08,120
Scott: No, this guy doesn't even know how to run Doom, right?

267
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,460
Scott: He had to get help to learn that you had to go get ZDoom or whatever.

268
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,016
Rym: Just buy it on Steam, it just works.

269
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,579
Scott: It didn't work for him.

270
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,537
Scott: He couldn't get it to work.

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,300
Rym: How can you not anyway?

272
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:18,299
Scott: Yeah, right?

273
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:29,979
Scott: So anyway, I think that this is just, I mean, we've talked about this kind of thing 100 times, like people have no skills and you gotta have, you know, it's the same bullshit over and over again.

274
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,138
Rym: We've been called haters.

275
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:31,873
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,400
Scott: Well, haters gonna hate, so we're gonna keep hating.

277
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:42,660
Scott: Pretty much what it comes down to is if a game has boring parts like this, just don't play the game at all rather than, you know, watch the game.

278
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Scott: This isn't even a game with like plots that you could watch.

279
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,400
Scott: There's a reason to watch it on YouTube, right?

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,820
Scott: Because it's basically the equivalent, right?

281
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,760
Scott: Is watching on YouTube.

282
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,280
Scott: There's not even a reason to watch this game on YouTube because it's not a story game.

283
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,607
Scott: Well, think about from the game

284
00:14:54,707 --> 00:15:10,920
Rym: play or game design perspective too, like part of what makes Super Meat Boy such an interesting risk reward cycle is that the escalating difficulty and the fact that you cannot progress without mastering everything along the way is what provides the fundamental reward that makes the game interesting.

285
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:18,620
Scott: Well, he also mentions that sometimes he would let the guy beat the level and if the level was interesting, but just hard, he would go back and do the level again on his own.

286
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,519
Scott: But now that he's seen the level be beat and he knows what to do.

287
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,560
Rym: That's interesting.

288
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,980
Scott: I mean, you have to balance the fact that what would meet would be like if there was a button you could push to see a perfect meat boy in action.

289
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,860
Rym: Ah, but at the same time, while it removes the discovery, it does not remove the execution.

290
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:38,200
Rym: And I would argue that Meat Boy is mostly execution and not discovery.

291
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:38,878
Rym: It is.

292
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,520
Rym: I always know I can see that is the way to get that bandage by the thought of fuck that.

293
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:53,240
Scott: Having not played it, I'm willing to wager that in a game such as Donkey Kong Country Returns that the execution level is far lower than in Meat Boy.

294
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,939
Rym: I might agree with you on that.

295
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,760
Scott: And that discovery would be far more significant a factor in the skill department.

296
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:13,518
Rym: I guess what it boils down to is that most game journalists I see, even when they write a very hard-hitting article, they tend to preface any criticism with some sort of like, "Oh, but, you know, a game could be fun anyway if you're this type of

297
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:13,760
Rym: person.".

298
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,760
Rym: They don't tend to take very negative stances when they're warranted.

299
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:28,539
Rym: And two, they very rarely, like, they'll do the surface analysis, but they'll never go deep, they'll never boil something down to the fundamental like, "This is the game mechanic boiled down and here is the good or bad thing about

300
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,600
Rym: it.".

301
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:28,721
Rym: I

302
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:45,724
Scott: mean, pretty much, it sounds to me like if you get rid of this skip over the level thing, that Donkey Kong Country Returns is just a side-scrolling, platforming game that at times gets really hard, but also at times has cliche bits that you've seen a thousand times before.

303
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:51,100
Scott: that could be quite boring, and that's pretty much what it comes down to in terms of this particular game.

304
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,020
Scott: But if you're going to skip over a game, don't even play it, just do something else.

305
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:06,199
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, what do you got for me?

306
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,060
Scott: So this is a game called Graph War, right?

307
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,175
Scott: And it's pretty interesting, it's a free Java web game.

308
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,617
Scott: you play in your browser, you just search for Graph War, you'll find it.

309
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:22,299
Scott: And the way it works is you pretty much try to shoot the other guy, you know, sort of scorched earth, kind of, right?

310
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:38,000
Scott: But you're in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, and the only thing is that Y is always zero, because your guy is set to Y zero, but your guy is not set to X zero, so if your guy is positioned at X negative ten, he's at X negative ten, right?

311
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:48,660
Scott: And then you just type in an equation, it says Y equals, and you can type in whatever maths you want, and then the bullet quotes will emanate from your guy following that math equation.

312
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:54,999
Scott: And, you know, I'm playing this game and I'm like, yeah, Y equals to X.

313
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,060
Rym: I was going a little more clever.

314
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,940
Rym: I used like a cubic sine function, so I'd get this kind of shotgun scatter of my line.

315
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,020
Scott: Yeah, but you should see, the thing is I played against people, right, who knew what they were doing.

316
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:16,100
Scott: They're pretty much just cheating, they're like math geniuses, they'll be a screen full of obstacles that you can't shoot through, and they'll make the bullet, it's like they're drawing a line on the screen with a pen.

317
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:27,419
Scott: They'll go over one ball, then go straight for a period, then go straight vertical, hit you, come all the way back down, go straight horizontal, it's like, you know, what the hell is this ridiculous shit?

318
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:27,801
Scott: Well,

319
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:43,280
Rym: I don't think they're math geniuses, because I was looking at some of these solutions online just a little while ago, and what it seems like is a few people pointed out these very particular functions that let you do that sort of thing on a graph, and these people just kind of memorized those and added them to their clipboard.

320
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,219
Scott: Yeah, but at least they're learning some maths.

321
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:46,420
Rym: I don't think they are.

322
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,059
Rym: I don't think they understand what those functions really mean or apply.

323
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,800
Scott: Actually, you know, graph war, it's like the fundamental idea, it's pretty creative and pretty interesting.

324
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,599
Rym: Play it with your friends without looking at a fact.

325
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:06,340
Scott: And pretty good, and it has advanced modes, the y prime and y double prime modes, where it'll integrate your function once or twice before graphing it, that's pretty interesting.

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,855
Scott: But I think here's how I would, if I was going to remake graph war, here's what I would do, number one, whenever it was your turn, right, the zero zero would always recenter on your guy.

327
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,340
Scott: So you would actually sort of be moving around in the in the plane.

328
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,680
Rym: That would have made it a little too easy to hit your guys, though.

329
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:23,398
Scott: Hold on.

330
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,358
Scott: We're going to make it right.

331
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,239
Scott: Number two, you type in a math and you'll actually get a little blue preview line that shows you where your thing is going to go.

332
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,320
Rym: That makes the game too easy.

333
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:31,935
Scott: Hold on.

334
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,880
Scott: I'm going to make it harder.

335
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,880
Scott: I will say I've got to put in things to make it easier, right?

336
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,200
Scott: User interface wise.

337
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,660
Scott: But then you put in things to make it harder, right?

338
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:51,180
Scott: So because right, like, for example, one thing that you could do to make it incredibly hard is you could put a limit on the number of characters you could put in the equation.

339
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:56,420
Scott: So it can really force you to like, you know, oh, I can't just be like, you know, a big long thing.

340
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,919
Scott: You know, oh, it's a little off.

341
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,580
Scott: Well, add more numbers up.

342
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,660
Scott: You can't you can't go any farther than that, right?

343
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:08,240
Scott: Something else you could do is you could actually have two people firing simultaneously.

344
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:14,679
Scott: Because right now the first player who goes actually has a big advantage because they just get the first shot, they could win.

345
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,500
Scott: If you're actually going simultaneously, even with a preview and even with the graph being centered on you at zero zero, right?

346
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,680
Scott: You still have to be faster than the other guy.

347
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,260
Scott: And you could put in a ton more obstacles, right?

348
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:27,600
Rym: I would go one step further.

349
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,097
Rym: What I would do is use some other coordinate system or some sort of you can have.

350
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:34,799
Scott: you can have radial mode.

351
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,200
Scott: You could have, you know, all kinds of things.

352
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,320
Rym: There are equations for that, too.

353
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,700
Rym: I would make like a non-uniform, almost non-Euclidean surface.

354
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,139
Scott: And that's just getting crazy.

355
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,220
Rym: I don't know.

356
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Scott: I mean, the way I was doing it, you could also throw in some sort of vector stuff to where you could actually control the velocity of the shot, which, you know, right.

357
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,712
Rym: That doesn't really make sense, though, in the context of writing an equation for a it does.

358
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,860
Scott: If you if you make it more like physics and you add some gravity, you can do that anyway.

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,540
Rym: Just use a kinematic instead of a polynomial.

360
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,278
Rym: I mean, that would have just worked.

361
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:07,400
Scott: Yeah, probably would.

362
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,480
Rym: But what I was doing is I used a sign like a cubic sign just to make this kind of scatter.

363
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:15,200
Rym: And then I would just use a factor to get it close to Scott.

364
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,460
Rym: Then I'd use another factor like plus three X to the Q minus two X squared plus one X. And I would just zoom in by adding a new factor everywhere.

365
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,060
Scott: You know what I've seen guys doing, though, is they'll do crazy shit like it'll come at you, it'll go straight horizontal, then come at you in a straight line diagonally.

366
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:35,380
Scott: And then when it gets pretty close to you, it'll burst into a sine wave ridiculously.

367
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:36,920
Scott: So it can't possibly miss you.

368
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,460
Scott: It's like shotgun at the last second.

369
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,797
Scott: Yeah, it's like all cheating.

370
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,539
Rym: All the people doing that.

371
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:42,238
Rym: I get that.

372
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,519
Rym: I get the copy paste vibe.

373
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:47,440
Scott: Someone had to figure out the math first.

374
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:47,795
Scott: Oh, yeah.

375
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:52,280
Rym: There are math geniuses, but I don't think the majority of the people you're going to play against in this game are math genius.

376
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,980
Scott: I don't know if there are that many math geniuses.

377
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,200
Rym: Why is America not the math genius center?

378
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Scott: People, it's not people in America playing.

379
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,480
Scott: I know one of our foreign listeners, lack of cheese is supposedly expert at this game and will kill you on the first shot every time.

380
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,720
Scott: And he is a math genius.

381
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,119
Rym: At least compared to us.

382
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,731
Rym: Yeah.

383
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,000
Rym: This is a game that's fun for people who aren't math geniuses and who don't cheat.

384
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,660
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:19,796
Rym: Of course, is it, is it, you could argue, I mean, we got our PAX panel on playing to win the game that it is not in fact cheating.

386
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:20,360
Rym: to read a fact.

387
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,820
Scott: I was thinking about making, if I could develop a tool for this game where you draw a line with like a stylus and then it would give you the equation, it would do the reverse.

388
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:29,360
Scott: That'd be pretty cool.

389
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
Rym: You know what this game reeks of?

390
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,778
Rym: Remember the old like graphing calculator games you'd play in your TI-85?

391
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,640
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

392
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,576
Scott: This game would be a lot better on a TI-86.

393
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,500
Rym: It'd be a good game to teach kids about math, actually.

394
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:39,927
Scott: Yeah.

395
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:40,487
Rym: Yeah.

396
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:42,960
Rym: All right.

397
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:50,240
Rym: So I'm trying to not use just college humor things of the day because I have a reputation for using college humor things of the day for various reasons.

398
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:52,940
Scott: So everything of the day you have is just something from college.

399
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:01,518
Rym: Board games, especially American board games from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s tend to be pretty awful.

400
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,158
Scott: But in particular- Not all of them, but many.

401
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,859
Rym: By and large, and a lot of the classic games that people like, like the Game of Life and Monopoly are actually pretty shit games if you boil them down.

402
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:19,846
Rym: But if you look at games from America from the 70s, they have a pretty interesting kind of style to them.

403
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:22,220
Rym: you don't see repeated in modern games.

404
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:23,580
Scott: A visual style, right?

405
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,875
Scott: There are some like Dune and Avalon Hill games.

406
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,559
Scott: They have a game design style too.

407
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,700
Rym: It's the Roll Your Dice Move Your Mice style.

408
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,260
Scott: Well, Roll Your Dice Move Your Mice is like one of the oldest things in all of board games.

409
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,140
Rym: Most 70s board games are mice and dice.

410
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,700
Rym: However, there's this sort of like pastel or paisley, very bright colors, muted.

411
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:47,159
Rym: Look at this.

412
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:48,160
Rym: This is a demake.

413
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:54,079
Rym: Someone made this game, a Ferris Bueller's Day Off board game in the style of a 70s American board game.

414
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,240
Rym: And it's pretty rocking.

415
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:57,600
Rym: And I like the graphic design.

416
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,800
Rym: I like everything about this game except the game because it is clearly not a good game.

417
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:09,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you roll your dice, you move, it says, "Oh no, Ferris didn't-".

418
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,059
Rym: Ferris Bueller had his day off.

419
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,580
Scott: Yeah, you're at the baseball game.

420
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,979
Scott: Move ahead three spaces.

421
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,983
Scott: Yay.

422
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,760
Rym: So very briefly in the meta moment, we are going to be at PAX East doing not one, not two, not three, but five panels.

423
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,080
Scott: Well, one of the panels is a triple panel.

424
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,360
Rym: One panel is actually three panels and then two more panels.

425
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,079
Scott: Yeah, they're actually lectures, not really panels in the strict sense, but it's considered a panel.

426
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,058
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean, they're in panel rooms as far as PAX is concerned, but we'll be there doing that.

427
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,498
Rym: You can talk to us after that.

428
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,879
Rym: This Friday, Nerd NYC board game night in Manhattan, we'll be there.

429
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:50,178
Rym: The book club book is still Michio Kaku's Hyperspace, which I finished a while ago, waiting for Scott to finish it.

430
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,000
Scott: The week after PAX East is- ZenConCon, we'll be there doing a bunch of anime and gaming lectures.

431
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,920
Rym: Actually, we're doing a lot of old PAX lectures because we like to recycle stuff.

432
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,578
Scott: And you should come to our website and our Twitter and our forum and the whole internets.

433
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,060
Rym: Lot of new faces in the forum lately.

434
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,939
Rym: I'm very happy about this.

435
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,180
Scott: Everybody should come and find us on the internets and do all our internets things.

436
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:12,880
Rym: Yeah, say hi.

437
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:13,860
Scott: GeekNights things.

438
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:15,720
Scott: We got Steam groups, right?

439
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,439
Scott: You can join the GeekNights Steam group and find people to play games with.

440
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,000
Rym: Yeah, the GeekNights Counter-Strike server is down right now because I unplugged it.

441
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,839
Rym: I'll be plugging it back in as soon as I have time to plug it back in.

442
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:25,600
Scott: All right.

443
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,040
Rym: So PAX Boston 2011, it's coming up in what?

444
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:30,139
Rym: Like 30 days.

445
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:31,320
Scott: Oh, shit.

446
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,750
Scott: 30 days.

447
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,960
Rym: I'm loving this fact that we get a PAX about every six months.

448
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,917
Scott: We need PAXs every four months.

449
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,359
Scott: Let's get on it, guys.

450
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:38,899
Scott: Come on.

451
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:41,559
Scott: Every three months, we'd have four PAXs.

452
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,380
Scott: It would be perfectly even and symmetrical.

453
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,120
Rym: PAX East, PAX Boston, or I think I am actually sadly responsible for BitchPax.

454
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,499
Scott: That's all you.

455
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:58,798
Rym: After asking that question, when our beloved benefactors so kindly referred to PAX East last year as the real PAX and then had to...

456
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:02,180
Scott: Were you going to raise this issue again at the board meeting?

457
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,600
Rym: Why, perhaps I am at the General Assembly.

458
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:08,120
Rym: I bring a motion before the board.

459
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:13,280
Rym: We have kind of a tradition every year of messing with the Q&A and doing something.

460
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,117
Rym: I mean, what, last year at PAX Prime, we brought John St.

461
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:16,419
Rym: John.

462
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,093
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:18,097
Scott: All right.

464
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:30,100
Scott: So yeah, so PAX East is going to have some good stuff this year, and it's also going to have not bad stuff, but stuff that you will have to be prepared for if you are going.

465
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,878
Scott: And if you are not going, get out.

466
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:34,280
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing for you in this episode.

467
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:37,300
Rym: If anything, you're going to feel bad because you'll want to be there.

468
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:42,719
Rym: You might say, "Rym and Scott, you did a PAX pregame show for the East Coast PAX last

469
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:42,900
Rym: year.".

470
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,518
Rym: And that is true.

471
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,519
Rym: Last year was the first Bitch PAX.

472
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,720
Rym: It was a brand new thing.

473
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,497
Rym: They had it in the Heinz.

474
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,760
Rym: This tiny little convention center.

475
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,720
Scott: It's not tiny.

476
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,340
Scott: It's a pretty big convention center.

477
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Rym: It's tiny relative to the kind of big cons we go to.

478
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,799
Rym: I mean, Otakon wouldn't fit in that.

479
00:26:57,101 --> 00:26:58,100
Rym: PAX doesn't fit in that.

480
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,400
Scott: Well, those are the biggest of the big.

481
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,520
Scott: It's big enough for pretty much any con, but the biggest of the big.

482
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,589
Rym: Yeah, like a 10 to 15,000 person con.

483
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,798
Scott: That's a big con.

484
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,220
Scott: That's a medium to large.

485
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,519
Scott: It's just not big enough for large.

486
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:13,500
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, last year the new PAX East was an experiment.

487
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,218
Rym: It was brand new.

488
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,560
Rym: There was a lot of worry.

489
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:23,655
Rym: We weren't sure if the PAX culture would make it intact on the East Coast where people are, to quote at least one enforcer, "slightly more

490
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:24,198
Rym: agro.".

491
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,780
Scott: Yeah, well, it did enlarge.

492
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,980
Rym: PAX East was basically the last one in the Heinz in Boston.

493
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,689
Rym: 99% PAX Prime.

494
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:36,040
Rym: It was almost the exact same event.

495
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,316
Scott: Yep, only East Coast.

496
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,940
Rym: Yep, East Coast, and with the minor difficulties that come with the new venue.

497
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:48,079
Rym: But I have to say, PAX East had way fewer problems with the new venue than pretty much any convention I've ever dealt with.

498
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,620
Rym: But the success of it was somewhat unexpected.

499
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:54,820
Scott: Well, it was unexpected by the people running it.

500
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,920
Scott: It wasn't unexpected by us.

501
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,380
Rym: I remember when they emailed us.

502
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,697
Rym: They're like, "Yeah, PAX, it's going to be in the Heinz in

503
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:00,160
Rym: Boston.".

504
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,691
Rym: And I was like, "Really?

505
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:02,678
Rym: The Heinz?

506
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,315
Rym: You're going to fill that place up six months in advance?

507
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:06,878
Rym: Seriously,

508
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:07,079
Rym: guys?".

509
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,920
Rym: So they knew, and they moved, and now they're going to be in pretty much the biggest place.

510
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,500
Rym: There aren't bigger places unless they leave Boston and go to Baltimore.

511
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,840
Scott: Well, they have a contract to stay in Boston, I heard.

512
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,860
Scott: It could be a rumor.

513
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,880
Rym: So this place can hold PAX probably for another year or two, but eventually they're going to expand into the whole thing, I'm sure.

514
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,859
Scott: Yeah, anyway, it's a gigantic, gigantic building called the BCEC, the Boston Convention Exhibition Center, something like that.

515
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,740
Scott: But there's a problem.

516
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,180
Rym: One, we often go to a lot of conventions, and different convention centers facilitate different kinds of conventions.

517
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,595
Rym: Convention centers like the Baltimore one are pretty much the best for a con like this, because gaming cons...

518
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:49,380
Scott: Architecturally.

519
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,020
Rym: Yeah, anime cons, the kind of geeky cons that all of you and we like to go to are not like normal business conventions.

520
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,179
Rym: People walk around a lot.

521
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,620
Rym: The space requirements are very different.

522
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:02,780
Rym: You need more smaller rooms as opposed to a few gigantic expo halls.

523
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,959
Scott: But you still need some gigantic expo halls.

524
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,700
Rym: And convention centers that small and medium-sized cons go to are great for that.

525
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,060
Rym: The Heinz has a pretty good layout.

526
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,960
Rym: It's actually very much like the layout at the convention center for real packs.

527
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:26,139
Rym: The BCEC is a lot like the Jacob Javits Center in New York City, in that it's one of those big cement monoliths that has a lot of problems for a convention like this.

528
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,160
Rym: So it is difficult to say how well the space will be utilized and how well the space will serve Pax's purposes.

529
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:42,860
Scott: However, I'm sure that because the space is so large, there will be great improvements in terms of being able to get into an event and line waiting, right?

530
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,120
Scott: There are big problems at the Heinz waiting in line to go to a panel, right?

531
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,440
Scott: Because there just weren't enough seats in the room and all these sorts of things.

532
00:29:49,824 --> 00:30:04,312
Scott: If they make the rooms big enough, which they can do with all this enormous space, they're not even using the whole convention center, because it's so enormous, that the panel rooms will be so large that hopefully, ideally, you'll just be able to walk in or out of panel rooms at will with no

533
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:04,919
Rym: line waiting.

534
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:07,260
Rym: This is purely anecdotal evidence.

535
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,060
Rym: I don't have any numbers.

536
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:08,640
Scott: It's a possibility.

537
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,780
Scott: I can't guarantee that that's what will happen.

538
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,859
Rym: I don't have any numbers from Pax.

539
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,840
Rym: This is just my opinion.

540
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:22,159
Rym: But in the last three years of Pax's, I have personally seen a decrease in the number of panels I looked at where the rooms were completely full and they had to shut the doors.

541
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:25,340
Rym: And I have a lot of ideas as to why this is the case.

542
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,259
Rym: One is that they've increased the sizes of rooms and they've reshuffled when events are.

543
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:40,159
Rym: And also that a lot of the panels are actually community things or journalist things, where not to disparage anyone and not to name any names, it's kind of the same content every year.

544
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:47,039
Scott: A lot of times, there'll just be a panel like, "Get together for Internet Video Show

545
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,260
Scott: X."

546
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,800
Scott: So all the fans of Internet Video Show X go to that.

547
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,780
Rym: And those things are awesome.

548
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,179
Rym: There's a ton of people there, but that's not going to fill the room anymore.

549
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,896
Scott: Yeah.

550
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:59,533
Scott: And if it's the same Internet Show X every single Pax, you know, it's like, "All

551
00:30:59,574 --> 00:30:59,757
Scott: right.".

552
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,640
Scott: This is why we never do GeekNights, the panel.

553
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,760
Scott: We always do a specific topic that appeals to all gamers and not just like, "All right, we're GeekNights.

554
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,720
Scott: What's up, other GeekNights fans?

555
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:12,834
Scott: Hello, how are you?

556
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,124
Scott: Okay.".

557
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:20,999
Rym: But I think that coupled with the bigger rooms, because one, let's just go straight into the differences between this Pax East and the last one.

558
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:23,759
Rym: There are more panel rooms.

559
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,779
Scott: Yeah, they added a panel room.

560
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,940
Rym: So there are many more panels as a result.

561
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,478
Scott: That's good.

562
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:34,300
Rym: And some of the panel rooms are much bigger, because the space is much bigger.

563
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:48,934
Rym: I think the end result is, this is just my guess, any panel you want to go to, unless it's a crazy popular one, which, not to toot our own horn, might include ours, because our panels pretty much consistently fill the room, unless they're at like 10 a.m.

564
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:49,480
Rym: on Sunday.

565
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:50,839
Scott: Yeah, but you don't really have to.

566
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,139
Scott: There are some that are just so insanely popular, like famous, famous person.

567
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:13,299
Rym: Yeah, well, the thing that I was about to say, the only panels that I think are going to fill up, where you're actually going to have to line up an hour or more in advance, are anything involving Wil Wheaton or Mike and Gabe and Tycho, or anything that is ultra, like the standby ultra popular things, like special events.

568
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,420
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of those things will be in main events, and hopefully they will make main events large enough that you won't have to really wait in line.

569
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:28,160
Scott: I mean, you'll still have to wait in line, because the way they do main events is the queue room, and you wait in the line room, and then when that main event begins, you go in, right?

570
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:32,239
Scott: That's how it works for the beginning of concerts, or for the keynote, or for anything like that.

571
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,860
Rym: So if you want to go to a panel, just look at the title, forget the description, no one reads that, just look at the title of the event.

572
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:55,638
Rym: If the title of the event does not involve a Wil Wheaton, or some other very famous person in the PAX culture, or it is not a title that very clearly is going to draw a very large crowd, like Dungeons and Dragons sucks, and why you shouldn't play it.

573
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,780
Rym: I mean, a lynch mob's gonna form outside of that.

574
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,800
Scott: Meet the creators of Famous Game.

575
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,900
Rym: Yep, or see the unveiling of Duke Nukem Forever 2.

576
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,580
Scott: Yeah, new game that everyone wants to play.

577
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,199
Scott: Unveiled, sneak preview, see stuff you won't be able to see anywhere else ever.

578
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Rym: Portal 2 with swag.

579
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,600
Scott: Anything with swag, it's a huge crowd, yeah.

580
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,479
Rym: I guess you gotta look at the description for the swag.

581
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,315
Rym: Very few panel titles say swag.

582
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Scott: If there's a line waiting situation, just be prepared to wait in a line, get to the thing a little early, and if it's not a line situation, then just-- Don't bother, just wait and just show up at the event.

583
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,599
Rym: I don't think any of the--.

584
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,660
Scott: I hope, I hope, I can't guarantee, but I hope.

585
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:36,159
Rym: I do not believe that the majority of the panels will fill the rooms to capacity.

586
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,360
Rym: And I think you can get away with just kind of showing up at the last minute.

587
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,060
Scott: However, for things such as the keynote, you're gonna have to wait at the beginning of the contest.

588
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:47,840
Scott: For the closing ceremonies, you're gonna have to wait at the end of the con.

589
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:56,060
Rym: Let's talk about that, because that's, we're not sure of the numbers for how many people the main events hall at the new venue can hold.

590
00:33:56,542 --> 00:34:06,880
Scott: That is true, however, I mean, it is possible that the number of people that can be in main events is equal to the number of people with badges, but I can almost guarantee it's gonna be less than that.

591
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:11,079
Scott: Not everyone with a badge can fit in main events at the same time, that is unlikely.

592
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:18,639
Rym: Having talked to some enforcers, and also having just looked at the BCEC's website, and as a journalist, I actually emailed them and talked to them.

593
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Rym: I called them pretending I wanted to do a convention so I could just talk about room sizes and everything.

594
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:43,540
Rym: My guess is that the getting into of main events will be much like PAX Prime prior to Benaroya Hall, where as long as you showed up reasonably early to get in line, like one to two hours before the keynote or the Omegathon finale, you'd pretty much be guaranteed to get a spot.

595
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,199
Scott: And that's the beginning of the con anyway, so there's nothing to do before the keynote except wait in line.

596
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,199
Scott: But remember, bring board games and DS's to play in line.

597
00:34:51,360 --> 00:35:00,318
Rym: But and if you waited for the concerts until they were underway and you missed like the first half hour, in PAX Prime, you could usually always just walk in.

598
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:01,478
Rym: There was plenty of room.

599
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,540
Scott: We've also, there was confirmation that the wristbands for concerts are done away with.

600
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:05,959
Rym: That's gone.

601
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,119
Scott: So I can almost guarantee that because concerts are, there's no seating, it's just an open room.

602
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,900
Scott: I can pretty much guarantee that concerts will just be walk in, walk out freely.

603
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
Rym: So if you went to the most recent PAX.

604
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,039
Scott: Almost guarantee.

605
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,220
Rym: Obviously you couldn't just walk into the concerts.

606
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,780
Rym: Everything just filled up because Benaroya Hall couldn't seat that many people and there wasn't really standing room.

607
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,280
Rym: But if you went to PAX's before the most recent one, that wasn't the case.

608
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,800
Rym: You literally could go to any concert Friday or Saturday and just walk in 10 or 15 minutes after it started.

609
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,200
Scott: Yep.

610
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,120
Rym: No trouble.

611
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:37,620
Rym: Yep.

612
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:40,320
Rym: So I think we're going back to that.

613
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,699
Rym: I think that is going to be the end result because I think even if the space is bigger, it will eventually get mostly full because a lot more people are going to be at this PAX.

614
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,498
Scott: I mean, you know, and also we can never predict what a fire marshal might do, right?

615
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,772
Scott: It's always a question.

616
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,620
Scott: Yeah, conventions that have had-- None of the information that we're giving you is like official information.

617
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:01,800
Scott: This is just our best estimates as experienced PAX goers.

618
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,660
Rym: Yep, and just convention goers in general.

619
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,940
Scott: And researchers of this, you know, we re-research.

620
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:07,860
Scott: We find out all the information we could find out.

621
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:08,898
Rym: So big change.

622
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,160
Rym: Tabletop, we have pretty good authority on, is way goddamn bigger.

623
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:18,460
Scott: Is it one big area or is it multiple small areas?

624
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:22,119
Rym: I believe that there's one big area, but there are also many small rooms.

625
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,070
Scott: Because the thing is that the one big area tabletop is good because there's never a shortage of tables, but-- Loud.

626
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,319
Scott: And for a lot of games, an RPG, you need some quiet or else you're going to lose your voice real quick, especially teaching a game.

627
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:40,020
Scott: Oh my God, at MagFest-- You teach one game, you could lose your whole voice speaking over a loud room.

628
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,099
Rym: At MagFest, after I ran the sword like the third time, I literally couldn't talk anymore.

629
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:44,760
Scott: Yep.

630
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,579
Rym: But the telling is, and we actually, we talked to some PAX people about this, tabletop is going to be pretty damn big.

631
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:58,860
Rym: And my advice to you, if you're going to PAX and you are not a tabletop kind of person, go over there and play games with strangers.

632
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,760
Rym: That is going to be, I think, the best part of PAX.

633
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:01,882
Rym: We

634
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:17,540
Scott: said this all the time, pretty much any time we talk about PAX, but if you are at PAX and you are not doing something at that moment, like you have, you know, if there is not an event that you have planned at this exact moment in time and you're not eating or showering or sleeping, right, tabletop is the default activity.

635
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,618
Scott: It's like, not do anything right this second, no panels right now.

636
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,000
Rym: No, granted, there is the other kind of person, the video gamer who will go to the console free play.

637
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,700
Scott: You could go to console free play.

638
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:35,000
Scott: However, the way console free play works is you sign up to check a game out and then you wait for your number to be called.

639
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:45,440
Scott: So in console free play, it's possible that you could be spending a lot of time, depending on how busy it is at that exact moment, you might be spending your time up there just waiting.

640
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,760
Rym: Well, the real advice for both of these is that in both console free play and in the tabletop, PAX is way friendly.

641
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,899
Rym: I think a lot of people who have never been to a PAX are going to show up to this con.

642
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,236
Rym: Pretty much, if you just say, "Hey, anyone want to play

643
00:37:58,256 --> 00:37:58,276
Rym: X?"

644
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,540
Rym: You're going to find a group within about five minutes.

645
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:05,680
Scott: Yeah, if some other guy checked out Street Fighter from the console free play, go up and play with him, right?

646
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,635
Scott: But if you want to check out something, it might be some time before--.

647
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,321
Scott: But

648
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:26,939
Rym: tabletop, you're much more likely to get a game going much quicker, partly because of the culture of tabletopers, partly because of the way the area is going to be set up, partly because the enforcers over there tend to be very, very knowledgeable and attentive of tabletop games, because usually they're the passionate types who want other people to play the games.

649
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:30,516
Rym: So you go up to enforcer over there and be like, "What game should I

650
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:30,719
Rym: play?".

651
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,479
Rym: They will probably just hand you a game without even saying anything, and it'll probably be a good game.

652
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,940
Scott: Yeah, well, even a bad game can be pretty entertaining, right?

653
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,888
Scott: We didn't play.

654
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:41,519
Scott: test this at all?

655
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,037
Rym: Suggested games.

656
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,839
Rym: Bananagrams is going to be big.

657
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,098
Scott: Bananagrams, huge.

658
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,279
Rym: In fact, I would recommend buy Bananagrams ahead of the con and just bring it.

659
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,839
Scott: Yeah, because you never know if the library is going to run out.

660
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,820
Scott: Like, if you don't play Dominion, they might all be checked out and be full.

661
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,040
Rym: Bananagrams, you can whip that out in line and clean it up if the line starts moving.

662
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,240
Scott: Yeah, a very good choice.

663
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,840
Scott: Jungle Speed.

664
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,939
Rym: Jungle Speed is like the go-to game.

665
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,680
Rym: Dominion is going to be goddamn everywhere.

666
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,700
Rym: In fact, I think you'll see more Dominion than anything.

667
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,320
Rym: Dominion and Bananagrams is my prediction.

668
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:13,160
Scott: That's what's been popular.

669
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,640
Scott: You know, that's sort of like obvious, right?

670
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,699
Scott: Do you think that this is going to be a game that people haven't... It's like it's going to suddenly burst onto the scene?

671
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:21,540
Scott: Like a hot new game?

672
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,540
Rym: Honestly, in tabletop, I can't think of anything.

673
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,100
Rym: I think there's going to be a lot of WotC stuff.

674
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,880
Rym: You know, the D&D, do a dungeon delve, whatever, but that's always very well done.

675
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,459
Rym: If you like that stuff, go do it.

676
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,260
Rym: We're going to try to really push some indie RPGs in that area.

677
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,620
Scott: But

678
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:49,580
Rym: I guess if you've never been to a PAX before, and this is your first PAX, I know a lot of you have probably never been to any sort of PAX before, and you've been to other gaming cons, my advice to you is that PAX is nothing like other gaming cons.

679
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:58,560
Rym: But if you've never been to a PAX before at all, you can skip on a lot of the gaming your first time and do things like all the concerts and all the big events.

680
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:01,180
Scott: I mean, you can do those and get a lot of gaming.

681
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:01,960
Scott: PAX is long.

682
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,720
Rym: Yeah, you can, but I guess my advice is don't skip the concerts to game if it's your first PAX.

683
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,800
Rym: At least go to one of the concerts.

684
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:17,040
Scott: But yeah, that is one thing about PAX, is the concerts are awesome, but they are pretty much mostly the same concerts at every PAX.

685
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:23,560
Scott: So if you've seen them and they're not your favorite bands in the world, you know, you don't need to see them again necessarily.

686
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Rym: PAX veterans tend to go through three stages.

687
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:31,099
Rym: The first stage, the neophyte PAX-E, is go to both concerts because holy fucking god, is it awesome.

688
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:39,860
Rym: The next stage is pretty much only go to the concert that you care about the most, either Friday or Saturday, and game all night the other night.

689
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:46,020
Rym: The third stage is us, which is game all night until they kick you out every night.

690
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,580
Rym: Last PAX, we stayed until like 2 a.m.

691
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,960
Rym: when the enforcers were like, "All right, guys, you gotta go to bed.

692
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:54,715
Rym: Lock in the room, get

693
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:54,999
Rym: out.".

694
00:40:55,121 --> 00:41:04,299
Scott: All right, but yeah, whether you're new to PAX or old to PAX, there are some things you absolutely must go to, no matter what, and these things are, number one, the keynote, right?

695
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,617
Scott: Yes.

696
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:15,600
Scott: The keynote this year at PAX East is Jane McGonigal, who actually has a degree in game theory, and she did a TED Talk, and she is like a genius who is very smart, and you should go and hear what she has to say.

697
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,620
Rym: Every PAX keynote has been without exception amazing.

698
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,060
Rym: The least good one in recent memory was Wil Wheaton's, and it wasn't bad.

699
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:24,339
Rym: It was actually really great.

700
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:28,760
Scott: No, he just has a little, it's like he does a good keynote with a lot of pandering.

701
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,580
Rym: He did, he played the Woo game with the audience.

702
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,160
Rym: I don't think people realize what the Woo game is at PAX that much.

703
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:40,440
Rym: However, if that is the worst the keynotes have ever gotten, that's like, yeah, it was 8 out of 10 instead of 9 out of 10.

704
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,180
Scott: Right, so anyway, also, immediately following the keynote, don't leave the room because it's Q&A number one.

705
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,160
Scott: Now, they do do two Q&As, I believe.

706
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,236
Rym: You want to go to the first one.

707
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,220
Scott: There's Mike and Jerry, right?

708
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,940
Scott: But the first one is really the one you want to go to.

709
00:41:53,201 --> 00:42:01,119
Scott: I mean, if you're someone who really only cares about gaming and you don't care about Penny Arcade, then maybe you shouldn't, you know, don't need to go to the Q&A.

710
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,839
Rym: See, I would say no, you should go anyway, because the Q&A is now, it's a little less so.

711
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:14,220
Rym: One thing we didn't expect that happened at the last PAX East was that the Q&A had a lot more actual questions for Gabe and Tycho.

712
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,520
Rym: Like, how do you do this?

713
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:15,977
Rym: What do you do?

714
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,280
Rym: Because a lot of these people had never seen them before.

715
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:18,779
Rym: That's true.

716
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:26,879
Rym: At PAX Prime, it is basically the, you get to stand in front of a microphone, and there are thousands and thousands of PAX East in the room.

717
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,799
Rym: Gabe and Tycho are on stage.

718
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,460
Rym: You say something, they react to it, and maybe it's funny.

719
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:35,718
Rym: And then that's it.

720
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,400
Rym: Most of the questions are not actually questions.

721
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,080
Scott: I mean, we go to it because it's sort of a ceremonial kind of thing, right?

722
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:43,699
Scott: You know, with the hustling and all that.

723
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:45,000
Rym: It really kicks off the con.

724
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,500
Rym: Like, it is a huge part of PAX culture.

725
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:58,939
Scott: But if you really, there are gonna be people who go to PAX who are not necessarily fans of Penny Arcade, who are gamers, and they mostly care about gaming, and they could go to the expo hall right then, which is a good time to go.

726
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,999
Scott: Right away, you know, you can get in line for things and see things before the people see you.

727
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,999
Rym: But those people should still go to the keynote, and the Q&A is immediately after the keynote, and you're already in main events.

728
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,720
Scott: But you could leave the keynote and go to the expo hall.

729
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,240
Rym: But then you miss the knuckle crack.

730
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,219
Scott: Knuckle crack is not that important if you're not a Penny Arcade fan.

731
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,979
Rym: The knuckle crack is pretty important, because if you've never experienced that, they do this every year.

732
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:22,279
Scott: You can watch it on YouTube.

733
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:25,400
Rym: It doesn't quite have the same visceral effect as it has in person.

734
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,000
Rym: It is one of the more sickening sounds a group of humans can make.

735
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,159
Rym: It's pretty sickening.

736
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,119
Scott: Anyway, you're hyping it up too much.

737
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,720
Scott: Anyway, there's a Q&A number one immediately following the keynote.

738
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,079
Scott: Very important to go to that.

739
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,400
Scott: And then, the concerts are Friday night and Saturday night.

740
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,820
Rym: The other big one, you should go to at least one someday.

741
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:51,380
Rym: Maybe not every PAX, because this is one of the events where your choice is go to it or do a ton of other stuff, is the draw a strip panel, the make a strip.

742
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:52,880
Scott: I've never actually been to it.

743
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,340
Scott: The one time I was gonna be at it, it got delayed and rescheduled.

744
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,580
Rym: Yep, and then we couldn't go to it because we had to do our panel.

745
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,160
Scott: Right.

746
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,220
Scott: But yeah, the make a strip panel, you get to watch them make a strip of Penny Arcade.

747
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,560
Scott: And, you know, if you want to lull, you should go to it.

748
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:09,480
Rym: It's pretty great to watch.

749
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,279
Rym: I think we have on DVD, one of the last ones from when they made DVDs of PAX.

750
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,440
Scott: Yep, that's a very important thing.

751
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,340
Scott: If you want PAX merch, specifically the PAX t-shirt.

752
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,818
Rym: Day one.

753
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,580
Scott: You gotta go immediately, get in line as soon as possible.

754
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,280
Rym: They don't sell them after the con and they sell out almost right away, every year.

755
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:35,040
Scott: They're gonna sell out of, they won't sell out of everything, but they sell out of, for example, if there is a special PAX merch, such as the scarf from last year, it will sell out very quickly.

756
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,960
Rym: That PAX e-scarf is in high demand.

757
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,520
Scott: The official PAX shirt that will say, you know, PAX East 11 on it, that will be sold out very, very quickly.

758
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:46,500
Scott: You need to go and get one right away.

759
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:49,520
Scott: So as soon as you have an opportunity, go get in the merch line.

760
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:50,939
Scott: It's gonna be a long line.

761
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:54,600
Scott: It doesn't take that long, but get in that line, buy what you need to buy.

762
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,940
Scott: They have discount packs where you can get like, you know, two shirts and a poster and a scarf for less money than they would cost separately.

763
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,540
Scott: You know, they do that kind of stuff, but don't ignore the merch table.

764
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:11,280
Scott: If you have any slight desire for PAX merchandise, you need to run and get it before it sells out because it sells out every time.

765
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:15,840
Rym: The venue itself aside, I mean, the panel rooms are bigger.

766
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:25,400
Rym: We have it on pretty good authority that the philosophy of this PAX East is to do everything the same as the last PAX East, because it worked so well, but bigger.

767
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,704
Rym: The rationale for that is that PAX East, you know, it was kind of.

768
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:33,240
Rym: everyone wasn't sure how it would go, and it ended up going basically perfectly.

769
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,140
Rym: So now that it's a new venue, it's kind of like this whole new ball game.

770
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,800
Rym: So at least the first year, we've just got to make sure that everything still goes perfectly.

771
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:48,200
Rym: As long as there are no disasters, next year is when maybe different stuff will start happening.

772
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:49,300
Scott: PAX East 2012.

773
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:57,460
Rym: So if you've been to bitch PAX East in the past, expect it to be exactly the same, but a lot bigger, and with a much better panel and main event situation.

774
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:10,420
Rym: Now let's talk about hotels in the venue, because at all other PAX Easts, and you know, PAX Primes are like this, and the old PAX East, all the hotels and the convention center are like right next to each other, and there's awesome food right there.

775
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:14,099
Scott: This hotel is attached to the convention center, and there's food to eat, so you never have to go.

776
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,899
Scott: It was great locations, right?

777
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,260
Scott: The Seattle Convention Center and the Heinz are located so well, they're attached to malls, right?

778
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:30,280
Scott: So you can grab food really quickly, all kinds of food ranging from, you know, cheapest cheap to, you know, glorious five-star dining right nearby.

779
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:33,080
Scott: You know, your hotel is right nearby.

780
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:35,380
Scott: You don't have to take a long trip back and forth to hotel.

781
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,980
Scott: Super convenient, you know, you need food, you got food.

782
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,320
Scott: Need to go to bed, you go to bed.

783
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:41,271
Scott: Wake up, play games.

784
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:42,100
Scott: So awesome.

785
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,279
Rym: The BCEC is basically far away from everything we know of that is good and holy in Boston.

786
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,860
Scott: Right, so here's the situation, right?

787
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,320
Scott: And this is, you know, you can't do anything about it now.

788
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,540
Scott: It's too late for this advice.

789
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,160
Rym: Most of you are not staying in the only good hotel.

790
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,540
Scott: There is one hotel we're staying in, because we jumped on it immediately.

791
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,760
Scott: The Westin is attached to the convention center, right?

792
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,360
Scott: There might be one or more hotels that are nearby.

793
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,940
Rym: I think there's a renaissance over there.

794
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,439
Scott: Yeah, there's one or two that might be nearby, but that's it.

795
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:17,458
Scott: If you're buying a badge, say, now, or you don't have a hotel yet, odds are your hotel is going to be kind of far away from the BCEC.

796
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,020
Scott: You're going to have to take the tea to get over there or something.

797
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,379
Rym: There's a, there's a, it's both good and bad.

798
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,580
Rym: The bad part is that obviously you're not right next to the convention center.

799
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,360
Rym: It's not the old, you know, oh, let's walk up to the room for 10 minutes to chill and come back down before dinner, drop off our merch, whatever.

800
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:42,019
Rym: But the pro is, if you're staying in all the usual hotels, which are actually kind of over by the Heinz, that area has way good food.

801
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:52,300
Rym: So if you're not staying near the convention center, my advice to you is get up kind of early, get an awesome breakfast at like the Trident cafe or all those other places.

802
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,820
Rym: Maybe we'll try to link to the really good ones, but really the Trident is where you want to go.

803
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,040
Rym: They have like the best breakfast.

804
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,640
Scott: There was another secret awesome breakfast.

805
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:06,640
Rym: I'm not going to tell anyone that one because I'm going to tell blessed people that one, but all the rest of you go to the Trident, which is still really awesome.

806
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:10,539
Rym: That place has some of the best waffles and the best loose leaf tea I've had in a long time.

807
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,379
Rym: So get an awesome, gigantic breakfast and then go over to the convention center, make do for lunch.

808
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:31,580
Rym: And then when you want to get food, like maybe three hours before the concerts or your end run into the night, go back to your hotel, walk two or three blocks away from the Heinz or away from your hotels into the restaurant district by those kind of Boston equipment.

809
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:33,919
Scott: Same place with the Trident cafe is Newbury street.

810
00:48:34,263 --> 00:48:34,899
Rym: Newbury street.

811
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:36,840
Rym: That is where all the good restaurants are.

812
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,620
Rym: Get a crazy huge dinner and then go back to Pax.

813
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,273
Scott: Yeah.

814
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:48,999
Scott: I mean, you're pretty much, if you're going to be somewhere where it's going to take you time to get back and forth to the convention center, you got to really think about how much stuff you're carrying with you.

815
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,220
Scott: You know, you got to make sure you got water.

816
00:48:51,702 --> 00:48:58,160
Scott: You got to worry about, you know, bags full of stuff you may have bought or board games you might be carrying with you, which is not a concern.

817
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,720
Scott: People usually got to worry about, you know, time that you're losing, going back and forth and back and forth.

818
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,739
Scott: Minimize your back and forth trips.

819
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,419
Rym: So, but take advantage of this.

820
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,780
Rym: Eat at the restaurants that are by your hotel, not at the restaurants by Pax.

821
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,920
Scott: The restaurants near Pax East, you know, because the hotels are limited over there.

822
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,199
Scott: The restaurants are also limited over there.

823
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,900
Rym: There is a mixture of really crappy places and really expensive places.

824
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,740
Rym: I mean, I can't speak for any of them.

825
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,780
Rym: I don't know the area and I don't know anyone who knows the area very well.

826
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,519
Scott: Near the Heinz, the previous convention center, there was a ton of awesome food of all kinds.

827
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:36,940
Scott: But near the new convention center, the food supply is much more limited.

828
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,460
Rym: Also, if you want to go, I'm sure there'll be concessions in the convention center.

829
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:47,440
Scott: And usually I recommend against those because they're overpriced, but they actually might be viable for lunch at this convention center.

830
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:49,180
Scott: If there aren't any good lunches nearby.

831
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,620
Scott: I mean, the nearest McDonald's is a half a mile.

832
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:57,319
Rym: If you're willing to go to McDonald's, a lot of people for the evening of Pax will go out for dinner and drinks and basically not come back.

833
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:08,720
Rym: And I think there's going to be a culture at all the Pax hotels, like the big Pax hotels that aren't next to the center of gaming in the lobby and a lot of Pax people hanging out at the restaurants over that way.

834
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:15,480
Rym: So if you're in all those hotels, check the Twitter and pay attention and basically take advantage of all those restaurants.

835
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,860
Rym: Don't even bother with the stuff by Pax, because that's kind of the only benefit you get to staying in those hotels.

836
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,939
Rym: So milk it, milk it for all it's worth.

837
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:33,700
Scott: But yeah, this is why in the future, any convention you go to, if it's a big convention, the kind of convention that sells out, San Diego Comic-Con, an Otakon, a Pax, right?

838
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:37,200
Scott: You need to buy your badges the day they go on sale.

839
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,771
Rym: Well, it's tricky.

840
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:39,860
Rym: For Pax you should do that.

841
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,858
Rym: For other cons you shouldn't, because like, for example, Otakon, you cannot transfer your badge if you buy it.

842
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,200
Rym: So if you buy it and then you can't go, you're screwed.

843
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,439
Rym: Pax, you can just sell your badge.

844
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,599
Rym: You can just sell it to whoever you want.

845
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,119
Scott: But even for Otakon, if you don't buy your badge right away, you might not get one.

846
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,880
Rym: Otakon doesn't sell out that early.

847
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:03,120
Scott: Plus a lot of the conventions, they will give you a discount for buying earlier.

848
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,593
Rym: Pax is the convention.

849
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,715
Rym: I'm really going to give this advice, though, and I think Scott is 100% right.

850
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,979
Rym: If you even think you want to go to Pax, buy your badge the day they go on sale and get a hotel room the day they go up.

851
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:22,520
Rym: You can cancel a hotel room and it won't cost you anything, and you can easily, trivially sell the badge and probably make a minor profit on it.

852
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,620
Scott: Yeah, Pax West badges are going on sale very soon, so pay attention to that.

853
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,300
Scott: If you have any plans to go to Seattle.

854
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,739
Rym: Don't think you can scalp them.

855
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:34,860
Rym: There's rumblings of increased anti-skelper technology.

856
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,580
Scott: Right, but there's no anti-Craigslist technology, or eBay, or other legitimate means of selling.

857
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,880
Rym: Yeah, and they're very open about, if you legitimately can't come or don't want to come...

858
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,176
Scott: Go to the Pax forums and you'll find another Pax person who's like, "Oh shit, I didn't get a badge because they didn't listen to our

859
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:50,539
Scott: advice.".

860
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:55,940
Rym: I guarantee you can sell an unused Pax badge if you need to.

861
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:56,560
Scott: Absolutely.

862
00:51:57,841 --> 00:52:01,420
Rym: So I don't know, I mean, if you're a veteran of Paxes, you know the deal.

863
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:07,060
Rym: The only difference is that this con is going to be bigger and further away from the restaurants than the previous Pax East.

864
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:15,540
Rym: If you've never been to a Pax, Pax is way different from all other cons, and generally everything about it will be better, most likely, in your eyes.

865
00:52:16,122 --> 00:52:21,040
Scott: Yeah, the only other piece of advice I can give you is that, you know, everyone has the thing that they're interested in, right?

866
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:33,440
Scott: We talked about, we said you should, you know, default the tabletop and, you know, the things that we like to do, but everyone has a thing that's their thing, even within, you know, this gaming community, you think everyone's a gamer, but there might be some people, they specialize in D&D, right?

867
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,240
Scott: Or they specialize in, you know, they really want to see Portal 2, or they really want to see, you know, certain kinds of things.

868
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:48,820
Scott: Whatever that thing is, you know, immediately after Q&A 1, go for that thing that is so important to you and make sure you get it done, right?

869
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:56,160
Scott: If there's some panel that's like the most important thing to do, it's the number one reason you went to Pax, you're so excited about it, make sure you go to it, you know, early enough.

870
00:52:56,261 --> 00:53:03,319
Scott: Don't miss out on that thing that's important to you, whether it's, you know, the fancy Steel Battalion room, if they have that again, which they probably will, right?

871
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:12,280
Scott: Or, you know, if it's, you want to play like some awesome D&D campaign, well, better go over to the WotC area or Magic Tournament, make sure you sign up before it fills up.

872
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,900
Rym: Now, simultaneously, my advice to you is that the expo hall is crazy.

873
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:22,240
Rym: Like, you will be shocked at the opulence and just the money that's being thrown around.

874
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:27,900
Rym: However, I recommend never waiting in line for anything in the expo hall.

875
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,281
Rym: - Right.

876
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:30,079
Rym: - Very rarely is it worth it.

877
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:32,840
Scott: I have never waited in line for anything in the expo hall, right?

878
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,980
Scott: For example, you could have waited in line to see a Civ 5 video, right?

879
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,319
Scott: But that was at the last PAX East a year ago.

880
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:42,840
Scott: But now I just have Civ 5 on my computer, right?

881
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,062
Rym: - Yup.

882
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:50,000
Scott: - How impatient, you know, was it really worth waiting in that line for hours and using up precious time at PAX?

883
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,739
Rym: There was only one time it was worth it.

884
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:54,580
Rym: The people who got that Fallout Boy puppet.

885
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,460
Rym: That is like the only piece of swag that has a cultural legacy.

886
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:03,460
Scott: Right, but I mean, the thing is, right, it's like you only have three days at PAX and they're not even three full days because PAX isn't all night.

887
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,480
Scott: So, you know, and the expo hall closes even, you know, earlier.

888
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,060
Rym: Well, we say PAX isn't all night.

889
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:23,660
Rym: We don't know if it'll happen at this PAX because of the diaspora of all the different hotels, but with this PAX, maybe we'll see what happens to all the other PAXs where there is crazy gaming going pretty much all night in the hotel lobbies.

890
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,820
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, right, you're gonna wait and say a line to see some game or play some game that's not out yet for X hours at PAX.

891
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,880
Scott: Those are PAX hours.

892
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:34,439
Scott: They're more valuable than regular hours.

893
00:54:34,822 --> 00:54:36,854
Scott: And then you're gonna play that game for what, 10 minutes, 15 minutes?

894
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,700
Scott: They're gonna, you know, give you maybe some swag, right?

895
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:47,680
Scott: Was it really worth it, right, to do that when in six months, maybe four months, you're gonna have the game, right?

896
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:53,979
Scott: So if that's the thing you really care about, that's what you live for, that game, that's your game, then maybe it's worth it.

897
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,140
Scott: But in my opinion, just be patient.

898
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:05,419
Scott: You know, there's tons of things to see and do at PAX to fill up all your time and be thoroughly entertained where you won't have to wait in a line to see a preview of a game or anything like that.

899
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,020
Scott: You know, most of the expo hall, you don't have to wait for things.

900
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:20,240
Scott: You can just see them straight up, you know, do all those things and then, you know, spend the rest of your time actually playing games and seeing panels and seeing events that, you know, things you could not do if you were not at PAX.

901
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:26,318
Rym: Speaking of panels, we're gonna, I'm working on having it printed out so we can just give it to people at the con, but we'll post it online too.

902
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,499
Rym: Between us and all our friends, we're actually doing a lot of panels at PAX.

903
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,193
Scott: Yeah, I already can think of like one, two, three, four, right?

904
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:41,140
Scott: So four or five panels of friends of ours are doing in addition to the three that we are doing.

905
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:50,680
Rym: Like for example, Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson, Action Castle and Burning Wheel and Inspectors and Free Market, all those games, they're gonna be there doing panels.

906
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:56,997
Scott: Yep, they're also gonna have some sort of a, I don't know if they, did they get a booth or did they have some sort of area where they are demoing games?

907
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,140
Rym: We will likely also be demoing those games.

908
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:00,980
Scott: It's possible.

909
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,359
Scott: Who knows how much time we'll spend doing that, but yeah.

910
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:14,160
Rym: So we will post our path through packs of panels that we think you should attend, but we haven't completed that yet because I don't know everyone's schedules.

911
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:14,858
Scott: They have not told me.

912
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:21,900
Scott: When the PAX schedule appears, we will post our GeekNights recommended PAX schedule, sort of the GeekNights track.

913
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,020
Rym: Yep, follow the GeekNights Twitter because we will be posting updates pretty much throughout the con.

914
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,320
Scott: Oh, that's one more thing, right?

915
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:43,719
Scott: At the con, you're gonna want to have a smartphone if you got one and you could get the con schedule on there and you can look at tweets with the hashtag #hashpacs and you can see all the stuff that's going on and keeping, you know, if there's spontaneous events or anything like that, you know, you'll know what's up.

916
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:46,440
Scott: And it's gonna help you out a ton, especially maps.

917
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,039
Scott: Maps will help you out a lot also.

918
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,879
Rym: All right, I think that's pretty much enough.

919
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,400
Rym: I mean, you'll figure it out when you get there.

920
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,220
Scott: Yeah, there's only so much that advice can help you.

921
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,972
Scott: You need to have, you know, experience.

922
00:56:58,033 --> 00:56:58,980
Scott: pretty much does the rest.

923
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:05,280
Rym: However, if you really want a lot more advice, we did an episode very much like this for the last PAX East.

924
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,800
Scott: We've also done similar episodes for many, many conventions in the past.

925
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,620
Rym: We will link to all of them in the show notes.

926
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:16,360
Scott: If you have a specific question, you can come to our forum or email us or whatever, you know, we can help you out.

927
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,600
Scott: Also, PAX forums can be very helpful as well.

928
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:22,538
Rym: Yeah, the PAX, well, the Penny Arcade forums in general are somewhat thorny.

929
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:24,660
Scott: But the PAX forums specifically.

930
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:25,780
Scott: There is a sub forum.

931
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,160
Scott: If you go to the PAX official website.

932
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,299
Rym: It is still thorny, however less so.

933
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,279
Scott: It is not that thorny.

934
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,559
Scott: I've actually been going to check it out.

935
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,360
Rym: Yeah, it's not like the ivory tower of the GeekNights forums.

936
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:34,836
Scott: No.

937
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,579
Rym: That's for sure.

938
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:38,859
Rym: But if you see us, we will be there.

939
00:57:39,443 --> 00:57:42,579
Rym: And if you want to talk to us, I feel like I should point this out.

940
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:50,100
Rym: It is probably not the best idea to try to catch us after one of our panels, because usually we're trying to get the hell out of there to get to some other event.

941
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:51,939
Scott: And people are mobbing us.

942
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,119
Rym: And we need to clear the room.

943
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:59,820
Rym: So if we finish a panel and you have a question, you'll probably want to email us or try to catch us later in tabletop.

944
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,520
Scott: Yeah, you can come and see us if you know what we look like, right?

945
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,209
Scott: Anytime.

946
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,460
Scott: We're around the con.

947
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,280
Scott: If you see us, just be like, hey, whatever you got to say.

948
00:58:07,883 --> 00:58:11,420
Rym: We stand out and you'll probably find us in tabletop if nowhere else.

949
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:17,940
Rym: But after our panels, we really need to help the enforcers clear the room out so that we can then clean up and get out of the room.

950
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:21,480
Scott: Yeah, you can also ask an enforcer if they know who we are.

951
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,600
Scott: Quite as few of them do, and they might be able to tell you our current location.

952
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:30,000
Rym: Especially the people who run the various theaters and the people who run the tabletop.

953
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,060
Rym: They will probably remember us or know who we are.

954
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,780
Scott: I also think that I believe enforcer signups might be going on right now still.

955
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,179
Scott: I think if you want to be an enforcer, you can.

956
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,220
Rym: It's pretty likely you could because think about how much bigger this tax is.

957
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,139
Rym: They need help.

958
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:45,939
Scott: They need help.

959
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,100
Scott: So if you have any thought of enforcing, go sign up.

960
00:58:49,600 --> 00:59:01,040
Rym: And if you have any thought and it is too late by the time you listen to this, go find out what you need to do to sign up for next time because the enforcers have a damn good time and it is not like staffing any other convention you have ever seen.

961
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:04,100
Scott: It's also a good move if, say, the badges sell out.

962
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,920
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

963
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:19,040
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

964
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:24,460
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

965
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,400
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

966
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,078
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

967
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,676
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

968
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,980
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

969
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,100
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
