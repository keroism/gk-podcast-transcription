1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,469
Scott: It's Monday January 15th.

2
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:15,742
Rym: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,427
Scott: we teach you about content management system.

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,150
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:21,683
Scott: You know what?

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,475
Scott: I finally did today after a bunch of months of not doing it.

7
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,680
Rym: Why what was that Scott?

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:29,112
Scott: I got me a haircut just one just one.

9
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,280
Rym: Ah, so you get the rest on next week.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,722
Rym: I take it.

11
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,130
Scott: perhaps it was.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,779
Scott: it was kind of expensive for just one.

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:40,057
Scott: It's not so exciting when I get a haircut because I have short hair.

14
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:43,060
Scott: Oh, I Know it's not a possessive thing.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,158
Scott: I mean I could have any hair length I wanted but I keep my hair in a short style.

16
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:50,309
Rym: for comfort I say you should grow the big Jew afro out.

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,040
Scott: No, cuz I'll look like Einstein only without gray hair.

18
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,625
Rym: No, not so much.

19
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:57,193
Rym: Yeah, just a poof like like an Einstein.

20
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,220
Scott: It's an Einstein if I let it go.

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,245
Rym: Why don't you let it go?

22
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,109
Rym: They'd be kind of awesome.

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,335
Scott: No wouldn't be awesome.

24
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,320
Scott: It'd be kind of silly.

25
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,680
Rym: Why you'd stand out in a crowd?

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,666
Scott: Yeah, that's bad.

27
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,993
Scott: We're standing out for that reason.

28
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:09,119
Scott: It's much works.

29
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:13,214
Scott: I know it's much more exciting if Rym gets a haircut because he hasn't cut his hair in forever.

30
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,860
Scott: Well, not significantly.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,144
Rym: No, I get haircuts often.

32
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:19,234
Scott: I mean my hair was yeah, but you don't get your hair short.

33
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,618
Scott: It's remains long.

34
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:21,320
Rym: God my hair.

35
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,288
Rym: I don't think I'll ever cut my hair long.

36
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,734
Rym: in fact cut my hair short.

37
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:27,646
Rym: Yeah, in fact, uh, Wasn't that long ago?

38
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,780
Rym: We're having a party and our good friend Conrad was here.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,092
Rym: He's trying to convince me that within a few years.

40
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,398
Rym: I'm gonna cut all my hair off.

41
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,607
Scott: Maybe if someone drugs you.

42
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:40,119
Rym: well, but if someone drug me and cut it off forcibly That's the only way I could see it happening.

43
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,635
Scott: Someone drugs you and you're so deranged that you do it and you think you're not doing it.

44
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,100
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

45
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:49,782
Rym: I think I'd be more likely to I don't know go on a killing spree or something Perhaps.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,559
Rym: but anyway more importantly today is Martin Luther King jr.

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,719
Rym: Day But apparently I'm the only person in the world to get the day off work.

48
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,176
Scott: Yeah, I didn't I did but I had.

49
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:00,925
Scott: a Reason is that I go.

50
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:01,669
Rym: I had no idea.

51
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,236
Rym: I got the day off until just recently.

52
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:09,235
Rym: I know school I've been to elementary middle junior high college whatever ever gave the day off.

53
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,759
Rym: the garbage collection came.

54
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,714
Rym: Anyway, the railroad didn't count it as a holiday.

55
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,020
Scott: Did the garbage collection come?

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,750
Rym: I assume it did because I don't think they'd recognize that holiday.

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,483
Rym: Well, we better go outside and Jake there were peak trains Everything.

58
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:24,849
Rym: it wasn't even a holiday.

59
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,320
Rym: I just happened to get the day off which is kind of annoying.

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,651
Rym: I'd rather would have gone to work and gotten a different day off.

61
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:33,528
Scott: Yeah, I technically didn't go to work Get the day off, but I didn't go to work.

62
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,676
Rym: Yeah, I just ran off into Manhattan.

63
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:36,760
Rym: Just have some dinner with Emily.

64
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:37,523
Scott: That's good.

65
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,508
Rym: I got some good Thai food.

66
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,219
Rym: considering we got gypped on our Thai food over the weekend.

67
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,440
Scott: That guy did not know how to figure out like how many seats he had.

68
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:52,219
Rym: Yeah, if the proprietors of the Sukkotai in downtown beacon happen to listen to GeekNights You need more confident front-end staff.

69
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:56,720
Scott: Yeah, you should know at all times what the weight will be for any number of people.

70
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:03,060
Rym: You see I don't even care if they just say, you know I don't know how long the weights gonna be or you'll just have to wait and see that'd be fine.

71
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,827
Scott: Yeah, you gotta say something.

72
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:08,681
Rym: I don't need you to lie to me and I don't need you to spend five minutes coming up with A lie.

73
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:09,163
Scott: Yep.

74
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:20,933
Scott: Just tell me whatever you can right away instead of making me stand there and waiting for you to say something Yeah, and then saying yeah, it'll be 15 minutes and it won't be Especially when the barbecue place down the street was empty.

75
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,280
Rym: we could have eaten there immediately.

76
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,515
Scott: Yeah, we could but I didn't really want to eat there so badly.

77
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:32,400
Rym: Anyway, yeah So we didn't talk about it last week since we wanted to make sure all the details were out.

78
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,496
Rym: but now I think it's safe to talk about the fact that Probably the most important announcement of all the Apple and CES whatnot was simply the iPhone.

79
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,054
Scott: Oh great We have a phone.

80
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:43,377
Scott: tada.

81
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:49,200
Rym: Well, one thing that I think would say the most about how I feel about this is that in Japan?

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,559
Rym: No one gives one shit about this phone.

83
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:56,280
Scott: Yeah Well what the iPhone really comes down to is that phones and especially in the u.s.

84
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,340
Scott: Suck ass and it's mostly the fault of the carriers and not the fault of technology not being advanced enough.

85
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:09,200
Rym: Yeah The individual phones have a lot of power in them and it's not at all difficult to put cool features or nice things in phones.

86
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:10,860
Rym: But the carriers want to make money.

87
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:15,973
Rym: So the phone has a camera But they want to charge you five bucks a month to be able to get pictures off of it.

88
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:25,060
Rym: or the phone has a Bluetooth But you won't want you to pay extra or they just don't want you to even have access to it And they only want you to be able to get your address book off of it, but not put ringtones on it.

89
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:30,460
Scott: Yeah, and the other problem of course, is that the people who make the phones and the phone operating systems?

90
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:40,039
Scott: they you know don't really give a shit about the interface on your phone because 99% of people just make phone calls and do text messages and maybe take a picture.

91
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:45,780
Scott: and You know, you don't really need a fancy to develop a better user interface for that sort of thing.

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,482
Scott: No one cares.

93
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:52,400
Scott: and the smartphones are mostly used by business users who get used to whatever you give their company buys them.

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,992
Scott: So you don't need a better interface to sell something to a company.

95
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:56,680
Scott: You just need better security and whatever.

96
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,797
Rym: So the iPhone is just another one of these smartphones.

97
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:07,459
Scott: basically Well, it's technically not a smartphone because the term smartphone means something specific to some people.

98
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:07,880
Scott: whatever.

99
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:14,107
Scott: It's a PDA plus a phone Plus a camera plus.

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,614
Scott: Yeah plus a camera maybe not even a camera.

101
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:18,660
Rym: most people when they use the word smartphone a video.

102
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:19,724
Scott: It's an iPod.

103
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,349
Rym: maybe most people smartphone.

104
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:22,473
Rym: They just think a PDA.

105
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,240
Rym: that were they basically picture a blackberry.

106
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,665
Scott: Yeah, that's what I picture also.

107
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:28,576
Scott: It's a phone and a PDA and an iPod in one device.

108
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,987
Scott: now What's good about the iPhone?

109
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,000
Scott: the user interface is awesome, or at least it looks awesome.

110
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,271
Scott: I don't know who's used it yet.

111
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,199
Scott: Do you know anyone who's used it?

112
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,819
Scott: Yeah, considering it's not out and it's not gonna be out for many months Well supposedly some technology journalists have gotten to use it and I'm sure people at Apple have used it.

113
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,740
Scott: But yeah, it's definitely better than anything I've ever seen on a handheld device.

114
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,028
Rym: However, it has some significant drawbacks.

115
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:55,320
Rym: It costs a lot of money for what you get now.

116
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,165
Scott: Granted phones like.

117
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,693
Scott: you know the price of an iPod right.

118
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:01,860
Scott: that's that quality plus a phone.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,633
Scott: That's that quality plus a PDA.

120
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,520
Scott: That's that quality.

121
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,559
Scott: You're kind of getting a deal.

122
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:12,020
Rym: But at the same time the same sense that a PlayStation 3 is a deal because it comes with a blu-ray player.

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:23,069
Scott: Yeah at the same time while the iPhone is like $600 you could get like the Motorola Q for a hundred dollars And iPhones not that much better than it.

124
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:27,265
Rym: Also the iPhones battery less Not so long.

125
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:36,660
Scott: Well, it's not that the problem with the battery doesn't last so long is kind of bad You know, I think it lasts five hours of calling and video watching and whatever.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,880
Scott: But the big problem is that like on all other Apple products, you can't change the battery.

127
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,791
Scott: So I mean that's on an iPod.

128
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:50,732
Scott: not being able to change the battery kind of sucks But it's not so bad because it lasts a really long time.

129
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,122
Scott: and if your iPod runs out of battery Oh, no.

130
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,787
Scott: Well, what if you listen to music on a flight?

131
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:17,229
Scott: That's like a five-hour flight and After listening to music for five hours your battery's dead and now you can't make a phone call like that really sucks is when you know You do one thing watching video or listening to music and it kills off your ability to make phone calls or take pictures And that that's kind of bad.

132
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:22,936
Rym: now plus all this there's the issue with Cisco who claims to have the.

133
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,971
Rym: They have rights to the name iPhone and oh, whatever.

134
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,877
Scott: There's so much conflicting news on that.

135
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,660
Scott: I just don't give a shit.

136
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,247
Scott: It's all silly.

137
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,380
Rym: Yeah, let's going back and forth.

138
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,060
Rym: I imagine that Apple was fully aware of this and they're using it possibly as a free publicity marketing toy or a marketing tool.

139
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Rym: But in the end the impression I get is that after the initial buzz among all the Mac fanatics about the iPhone Coverage of it pretty much disappeared from my internet in terms of the sites I go to and there's been no more news about it.

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Scott: It was like this huge outburst of OMG to iPhone and then quiet and I think this is actually the reason why Apple likes to Announce their products the day before they come out that way.

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,465
Scott: There's a huge burst of news and then while that burst is still going strong people buy the product now Because what they want.

142
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,275
Scott: they had to submit this because it's a phone to the FCC.

143
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,900
Scott: when the FCC gets a submission They put it on the internet.

144
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:23,920
Scott: So if Apple didn't announce the iPhone We would have found out about it from the FCC and Apple would rather tell us about it from you know At their keynote then have us find out about it on the FCC website.

145
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,412
Scott: So they announced it early.

146
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,600
Scott: It's not gonna be out until June.

147
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:43,400
Scott: So now there's a huge explosion of news and then there's gonna be this quiet time where people actually have time to think about purchasing the Apple product instead of just buying it on instinct because it looks so cool at the keynote yesterday and that Might not, you know do the trick for Apple.

148
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:48,558
Rym: Yeah, honestly, I don't think the iPhone is going to do very well, but that is my.

149
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:52,244
Scott: well He's not the first iPhone, you know It doesn't help that.

150
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:57,288
Scott: the opinion of a lot of people in this country is that they want a phone that just makes calls and Doesn't do anything else.

151
00:08:57,308 --> 00:09:07,560
Rym: Well considering that I'm one of those people I always will take whatever phone is free with whatever plan I've got and I'll sign a Contract for one or two or whatever years just so I'll get a free phone.

152
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:18,826
Scott: Yep, the other thing is that a lot of the people who would make you know The use of all the features on this phone like college kids and teens and 20-somethings Probably can't afford this phone.

153
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:31,160
Scott: and the business people that can't afford this phone can't use this phone because it doesn't Support all the things that business people need like installing Java applications or getting mail from exchange servers Lotus or whatever.

154
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,599
Scott: Yeah, it just you know.

155
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:39,580
Scott: Blackberry for all you know It's problems is really awesome at getting email better than any other portable device.

156
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,472
Scott: And while the interface for the email might be better on the iPhone.

157
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:52,346
Scott: the actual, you know Working of the email on the Blackberry is beyond compare from anything I've ever seen, you know now that I think about it Despite all my technological leanings.

158
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:56,140
Rym: I have had exactly three cell phones in my entire life.

159
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,551
Rym: The first one was the size of a brick and lasted an hour.

160
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:05,771
Rym: Yeah, I had that when I was in high school Yep, then I got my own my first real like cell phone.

161
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,835
Rym: That was purely mine.

162
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:13,440
Rym: It wasn't just shared with my mom Was the one I used up until it broke while I was on co-op for IBM Yep.

163
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:21,511
Rym: And then when I went back to IBM the second time when that phone broke is when I got the third phone which I'm still Using to this day and will probably use for another several years.

164
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:22,194
Rym: Yes, I break it.

165
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:23,600
Scott: I just got my third phone.

166
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,036
Scott: I had the star tack and then I had that Samsung whatever which I still have but I'm not using.

167
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,442
Scott: and now I have the LG.

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,202
Rym: yeah, I remember your first cell phone sucked The L.

169
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:35,474
Scott: that the Motorola star tech is actually an awesome freaking phone.

170
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:40,512
Scott: if you want a phone that just makes calls I mean when that phone came out, it was the razor of its time.

171
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,600
Scott: It was thin thinner than anything else.

172
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,230
Scott: It was really reliable.

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,900
Scott: It always got a great signal.

174
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:50,519
Scott: It didn't do anything but make calls, but it made fucking calls.

175
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,508
Rym: Yeah, I remember there being an issue.

176
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,133
Rym: if you didn't hold the mouth part in the exact right space It was almost impossible to hear you talking.

177
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,019
Scott: I don't remember that.

178
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,515
Rym: Well, cuz you weren't the one being called by stuff.

179
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:00,938
Scott: shit for you.

180
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:09,539
Scott: Anyway, I think the iPhone, you know the initial one a lot of the super Apple fans with lots of money like all day.

181
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:12,700
Scott: You know hip Silicon Valley people will buy one, you know.

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,279
Scott: And maybe a few companies who use a lot of Apple products will be able to buy one.

183
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,668
Scott: But other than that, you're not gonna see a whole.

184
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:23,999
Scott: you're not gonna see Apple's predicted one in a hundred people getting it.

185
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:31,780
Scott: They expect 1% market share which isn't shooting too far but it's not shooting too low either.

186
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,005
Rym: I don't know if I were Apple.

187
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,139
Rym: I don't think this is the right time at all to be bringing out a product like this.

188
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,108
Scott: Oh, I think the time is right.

189
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,860
Scott: I mean a lot of people in this country are upset with their phones.

190
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,004
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

191
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:46,380
Rym: Are they really gonna pay Spain this amount of money to move to singular?

192
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,217
Scott: Yeah, as the other problem is, you know having only on one carrier I mean Apple has always made a product.

193
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:57,493
Scott: Well, the reason the iPod did so well is that anyone can have an iPod.

194
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,826
Scott: it the iPod didn't really take off until they had iTunes for Windows.

195
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:08,460
Scott: without iTunes for Windows the iPod would be in the shitter It wouldn't be doing very well at all and all these non iPod players would be doing a lot better than they are.

196
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:18,030
Scott: So by having a singular only that's gonna really hold them back because there's probably a lot of people who want iPhones who were in areas where singular doesn't have service.

197
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,856
Scott: See it's not why singular.

198
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:22,486
Rym: if they had gone with Sprint Or Verizon it would've been fine.

199
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:26,360
Scott: That's because we live in a Sprint Verizon area, which is the vast majority of this country.

200
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,965
Scott: Well, it's mostly the Northeast.

201
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:32,440
Rym: actually there are very few places that get singular and don't get Sprint Verizon.

202
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,040
Scott: It's true, but they're it's sort of a different thing.

203
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:41,499
Scott: The real problem here right is that this phone does a lot of internetting and web browsing, but they only included edge.

204
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Scott: They didn't include HSD PA.

205
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,780
Scott: so it's gonna be slow.

206
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:48,088
Scott: I mean it has this fancy Safari web browser.

207
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,305
Scott: that web browser is gonna be slower than the one of my shitty LG phone that I just got.

208
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:56,468
Scott: well shitty compared to the iPhone It's not really shitty, but think about that.

209
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,779
Scott: the $600 phone browses the web slower than I.

210
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,992
Rym: guess That you'll use the Wi-Fi capability and hook up to hotspots.

211
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,260
Rym: Yeah, you do that with your laptop.

212
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,382
Scott: Exactly.

213
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,411
Scott: if this Wi-Fi I can freakin sit down.

214
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,877
Scott: What do I I mean?

215
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:11,640
Scott: Wi-Fi on the phone?

216
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,340
Scott: I agree is useful, but yeah, the other thing is that this thing has Bluetooth But you still need to use a wire to connect it to a computer to get songs.

217
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,839
Scott: You can't have podcast download directly to it.

218
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,800
Scott: It doesn't have iTunes running on it.

219
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,086
Scott: You need if you get to want to buy music you got to buy it and then put it on there with a cable a USB Cable just like you do a normal iPod.

220
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:31,889
Scott: What the hell.

221
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,855
Scott: the PSP which is cheaper.

222
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:39,357
Rym: believe that in fact We have a lot of listeners using the PSP relative to how many SPS there are in the world.

223
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:48,680
Scott: PSP Which is cheaper than the iPhone and Has an equivalent screen can download podcasts directly over Wi-Fi and subscribe to them and everything.

224
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,679
Scott: You don't need to plug it into a computer shit.

225
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:55,839
Scott: So if the iPhone which is like three times the cost of the PSP can't do that kind of said.

226
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,419
Scott: Anyway, I think there's not much more to say about the iPhone.

227
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:02,960
Rym: Well, I guess we'll say something when it actually comes out or when Apple announces the changes.

228
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,448
Rym: That'll make it a little bit more palatable.

229
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,133
Scott: Yeah, hopefully if they announce any changes I imagine that we're gonna be waiting for the iPhone nano.

230
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:13,423
Rym: Yeah, I mean in general I just get the sense that a lot of people Were.

231
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,320
Rym: I mean people were rabid about the idea of an Apple phone for years and years and years and it is it's very sexy.

232
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:23,340
Rym: Every year they were just salivate about the possible rumors of yeah, Apple's gonna definitely do it this year.

233
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,129
Rym: No, they're definitely gonna do it this year.

234
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,777
Scott: And then they finally did it.

235
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:27,220
Rym: everyone went.

236
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:37,280
Scott: Oh a lot of people are still going But those are the people who you know aren't harmed by the deficiencies of the product.

237
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,025
Rym: Well, it's not just that.

238
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,400
Rym: I think there aren't that many people doing that.

239
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,650
Rym: It's just the people doing that are loud and on the Apple rumor sites.

240
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,075
Scott: Well, we'll find out in June.

241
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:45,997
Rym: We will.

242
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,810
Scott: we will indeed All right.

243
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,719
Scott: I got a short news.

244
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,266
Scott: There's someone named Louise Brown.

245
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,200
Scott: She was the first test tube baby in the entire world.

246
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:03,667
Scott: she was the first person ever to be conceived conceived by IVF and She just had a baby the normal way.

247
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,553
Rym: Wow so much for coordinators.

248
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:06,977
Scott: Yeah, isn't that kind of?

249
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:07,840
Scott: I think it's pretty cool.

250
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,179
Rym: I think it's a testament to how far we've come.

251
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,715
Scott: She looks like she's living an average American life, but you know, just a normal person not special or anything.

252
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,220
Scott: But hey, that's pretty cool.

253
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:25,019
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean we were actually talking about this over the weekend Which was actually a meta conversation after a bunch of us listened to an episode of our own show.

254
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:27,760
Rym: Really yeah the Parthenon thing.

255
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:41,584
Rym: Oh that yeah about how compared to the vast Vast majority of human existence compared to the great great majority of every human that has ever lived on this earth as far as we Know we are gods All right.

256
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:42,287
Scott: So think about this.

257
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,560
Scott: they made a person and a test tube.

258
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,920
Scott: Yes And then that person was born and they remembered they wrote down what person that was and they knew about that person.

259
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:57,017
Scott: That person knew who she was and then that person had a baby at the age of 28 pretty recently.

260
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:11,920
Scott: Yeah Take this baby talk to that person and they took pictures of that baby and that person and now We have them on the internet and we can read them and talk about them on a podcast If you record and distribute to you over the same Internet's.

261
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:20,110
Rym: We've come a long way from traveling 12 miles to market and then 12 miles back and that Consisted of the majority of your summer.

262
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:30,420
Scott: That's why technologies are awesome things of the day.

263
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:32,199
Scott: What you got over there?

264
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,165
Rym: Alright, so I had a couple.

265
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:42,920
Rym: like I always do I was looking through things of the day and I found one to trump All of them and I believe the only thing that could trump it is my thing of the day for tomorrow.

266
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,140
Rym: So I figured I got to put him in the proper order.

267
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,626
Rym: I mean you can't put it'd be like what riding the best roller coaster in the world then trying to have fun on the second Best roller coaster in the world.

268
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:57,119
Scott: It's not exactly you got to ride the small roller coaster And then the big one or else it doesn't work.

269
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:57,905
Scott: You just buy this.

270
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,059
Scott: if you're gonna do that just ride the big one and go home.

271
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:09,835
Rym: So of the two clips from Japanese television Japanese television close watch out Now, I'm sure you all remember an old show called Takeshi's challenge known in the u.s.

272
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,200
Rym: As most extreme challenge.

273
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:23,160
Rym: Yep, it was one of those shows where it's Japanese people being forced to undergo Incredible tests of strength and feats of dexterity often involving severe injury and humorous consequences.

274
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:29,680
Rym: Well, this is a little bit beyond that and it's not, you know, normal Japanese people being thrust into these situations.

275
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:45,014
Rym: It's Japanese people who are experts at things like gold medalist gymnasts and athletes And really people who are very much at the top of their form and it's a lot like American gladiators Except that I don't think a single American gladiator could even come close to man.

276
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:46,640
Scott: American gladiators is so awesome.

277
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,332
Rym: I'm actually haters was one of the best shows on TV.

278
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,120
Scott: the best part was the best part American gladiators.

279
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,100
Scott: It's the one where they got shooting the tennis balls.

280
00:17:53,163 --> 00:18:00,800
Rym: Yes and you had to go from station to station with those little guns and try to shoot the target and I always got pissed because Most people couldn't shoot for crap.

281
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,704
Scott: They just kept missing.

282
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:05,300
Scott: and I was like, how can you not hit that giant red thing with the rocket launcher?

283
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,879
Scott: The rocket launcher is so accurate and said shot so far without any physical effort.

284
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:18,206
Rym: Well, remember most people are more afraid of those tennis balls than they are worried about hitting the thing because the thing can run out Tennis balls, so you're more.

285
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:26,520
Rym: what you want to do is just avoid enough tennis balls to get close enough to lob the grenade I think is the gladiators are too smart and they'll never run out of tennis balls after they shoot enough at you.

286
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,734
Scott: They won't shoot unless they think they got a good shot.

287
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:29,579
Rym: I saw it happen once.

288
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,965
Scott: Yeah, it has happened.

289
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,053
Scott: But most of the gladiators are too smart to you God.

290
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:34,720
Rym: We got to do a show on American gladiators.

291
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,607
Rym: Shit, all right cuz think we could cut.

292
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:37,992
Rym: we could do American gladiators week.

293
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:39,518
Scott: No, no, no.

294
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:46,940
Rym: on Tuesday We talk about the game American gladiators Monday Monday, we talk about the technology behind American gladiators.

295
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,424
Scott: What technology was there?

296
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,577
Scott: people running and jumping in ropes and platforms and tennis ball shooters?

297
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,980
Rym: Yeah tennis ball Yeah, we could stretch that into at least.

298
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,047
Rym: Anyway American gladiators is crap.

299
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,280
Rym: the new hotness and I guess it's not that new is the show in Japan.

300
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,833
Rym: I didn't do any research.

301
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:05,680
Rym: I don't know what the show is.

302
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:13,360
Rym: all I know is that these are clips of the best contender on the show ever Nagano and his amazing prowess.

303
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:23,660
Scott: Yeah, I mean once you see what this guy is doing you say, okay Let's replace the decathlon with that and then we'll know who's the best.

304
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,330
Rym: I mean really I think this should be an Olympic event.

305
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,680
Rym: you set up one of these things secretly.

306
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:34,731
Rym: Maybe you give people a list of types of things that could be in it And then just whoever gets the furthest gets the gold medal.

307
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:35,112
Scott: Yep.

308
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:39,740
Scott: You have a big obstacle course and You know, you know, it's an obstacle course.

309
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,262
Scott: they have to get to the end without falling off and You just

310
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:44,727
Scott: build it in a room

311
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:52,673
Scott: and some court sort of building and you have the athletes come in one at a time To do it and after they're done They have to stay in there until everyone else is done.

312
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,619
Scott: and then you you know You videotape the whole thing, of course.

313
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,736
Scott: And then when everyone's done you send them all home and then you put it on TV.

314
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:05,100
Scott: that way, you know There's no advantage of knowing the obstacles beforehand, but watch this video.

315
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,640
Rym: I mean some of these things aren't even just interesting they're downright cruel.

316
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:14,140
Rym: It's like alright, he's already tasked with something that I could not do and likely will never be able to do.

317
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:19,896
Rym: It is something that looks very painful and difficult and then they also make it go like up and down.

318
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:25,974
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it's just it's too much and this guy does it just easily.

319
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,361
Scott: I think this guy could probably beat the Prince of Persia Easily.

320
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,268
Rym: Yeah, he might be able to.

321
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:31,930
Scott: I think he could.

322
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,696
Rym: we'll have to save him for Thunderdome.

323
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:47,439
Scott: Oh, wow alright, so There's a. this is animation studio called Frederator Studios and you know, they have a podcast little animations They make and there's a TV channel called Nickelodeon and you should probably know about them.

324
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:55,040
Scott: And anyway, they combined to create this seven minute little random cartoon animation called adventure time.

325
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,189
Rym: I'm not sure what I can say about this.

326
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,330
Scott: My sister showed it to me like oh you got to see this Ah, and she was all excited about it.

327
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,256
Scott: Like she was quoting it.

328
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,392
Scott: She was like Algebraic Rhombus and I was like the medical.

329
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,540
Rym: Yeah, that was totally mad.

330
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,869
Scott: Yeah, I was like, uh, whatever.

331
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,499
Scott: and then she showed it to me and I was like WTF mate.

332
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,643
Scott: And well Here it is.

333
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,009
Scott: So you can suffer watching it.

334
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,479
Rym: Also, I really don't know what to say.

335
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:24,040
Rym: Other than that, I'm disappointed that the drum set did not come into play.

336
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:28,918
Scott: That's what I was wondering cuz I when I watched it at my parents house My sister showed it to me.

337
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:36,222
Scott: I kind of stopped watching when the drum set appeared and I assumed the drum set would come into play and it did not and I Was very disappointed.

338
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:40,454
Scott: But yeah, if you like, you know weird animations.

339
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,322
Rym: if you are in desperate need of a catchphrase This is for you.

340
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,648
Scott: Oh, yeah, this will get you a catchphrase right quick.

341
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,673
Scott: Also rainicorns.

342
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:52,408
Rym: I Love when the dogs flirting with the rainicorn.

343
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,793
Scott: Yeah, that's a good part.

344
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:54,375
Rym: Yeah, it is.

345
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:55,339
Scott: That's probably the only good part

346
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:12,800
Rym: Right, so this might sound like a somewhat esoteric topic but it actually relates to a lot more of you out there than you might think because many times our friends or just people who Listen to the show will ask us questions that basically the answer to any of those questions is always use a CMS.

347
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,349
Rym: So tonight we're gonna talk a bit about content management systems.

348
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,400
Scott: No, we're not gonna get into details about specific content management systems.

349
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,404
Scott: We'll mention a few.

350
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:30,800
Scott: but we're not gonna like go over a list of content management systems and tell you you know The pros and cons of using each one and when in what situations one is better than the other.

351
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,246
Scott: That's for another time.

352
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:35,117
Scott: Plus we haven't used that many content management systems.

353
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,243
Rym: I've used 1.5.

354
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:42,573
Scott: I've used Three and a half the maybe three and a quarter.

355
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,800
Scott: So we're not really qualified to do that.

356
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:57,160
Rym: No But a lot of people have problems mostly involving making websites and they they try to solve these problems The same way that we would have solved them in 1994.

357
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,731
Rym: Exactly, and the world is well no 96.

358
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,037
Scott: there weren't websites in 94.

359
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:01,740
Scott: Well, he's not for us.

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,224
Scott: There weren't websites for us in 90.

361
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:04,608
Rym: No, but there were websites.

362
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:05,009
Scott: there were.

363
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,055
Rym: I was learning HTML in 1994.

364
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:07,116
Rym: No.

365
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:10,547
Rym: Wow Yeah, well HTML what all.

366
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,820
Rym: one day someone was talking about HTML in my school.

367
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,787
Rym: I was like, isn't that the thing block like?

368
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,373
Rym: I didn't know much about it me either.

369
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:21,040
Rym: and he enlightened me with this very simple Statement it's real easy.

370
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:24,539
Rym: If you want something to be bold you just put B's on either side of it.

371
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,009
Rym: You know B starts it and a slash B ends it.

372
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,998
Rym: and I was like other things other than bold.

373
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:30,646
Rym: and he's like, yeah There's a thing for everything.

374
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,295
Rym: and I thought oh that's simple.

375
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:38,320
Scott: Yep Yeah, so anyway, let's start talking about the way it used to be in.

376
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,700
Scott: You know, why do we need a content management system and what one does?

377
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,340
Rym: Yeah, so let's say you've got something you want to put on the internet some sort of website information.

378
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,785
Scott: Well now if you want to make a web page a single page then if it's today or if it's 1997 you do it the same way.

379
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:55,290
Scott: you write HTML.

380
00:23:55,691 --> 00:24:08,394
Scott: Well, I guess nowadays you also write a cascading style sheet, but that doesn't matter and You put it on a web server and then if someone visits your web server It sends them the page you wrote and their web browser draws it.

381
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,910
Rym: if you want to change that page You just have to edit it and upload a new one.

382
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:12,935
Scott: Yep, that it's.

383
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:13,800
Scott: it was pretty simple.

384
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,323
Scott: It's simple.

385
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,288
Scott: now is simple then.

386
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:19,005
Rym: but let's say you want to do regular content Like you want to make a webcomic.

387
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:29,060
Scott: you want to make a website a site with a lot of pages and the pages link to Each other and there's stuff on the pages and there's a lot of different URLs that people can type in to get to different pages.

388
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:35,305
Rym: Yep, so now in the old days you would either make a whole bunch of different pages Yeah You would make one web page.

389
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,550
Scott: that looked a certain way.

390
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,040
Scott: then you would copy that entire page and then Manually edit the parts.

391
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,940
Scott: That would be different and then you would have to modify the other pages to make the links to the new page.

392
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:51,100
Rym: So if you ever added a page to your site You had to go to all your other pages and add the link to it.

393
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:54,060
Scott: It was pretty painful depending on how you designed your website.

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,927
Rym: So out of this came things like frames.

395
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,660
Rym: frames are bad, but the thing is frames solved that problem.

396
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,339
Scott: They solved the problem a little bit.

397
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:13,197
Rym: Well, what frames did is you could have one web page that was open in a frame us on the screen And then that web page could then through it links on it open web pages in other frames.

398
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:26,740
Rym: so you could have a Navigation frame that linked to all your pages and then whenever you wanted to add content to your main site You'd make a new page and then you just put a link to that page in your navigation frame or something along those lines.

399
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,680
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't a total solution.

400
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:34,120
Scott: It made life a little easier for web developers and it made life a lot harder for web browsers.

401
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:46,117
Rym: Yeah, also for web developers it wasn't the greatest because a lot of people didn't really understand how to use frames and The design was shitty and a lot of people used frames poorly and they're also not good.

402
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:47,080
Rym: They're not very extensible.

403
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:51,160
Rym: No, so I guess the look at the example of a webcomic because it's the easiest one.

404
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,626
Rym: We can just use that as our metaphor.

405
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:53,068
Rym: Mm-hmm.

406
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,680
Rym: So you've got this website with your webcomic on it.

407
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:04,240
Rym: So you've got a bunch of pages, you know Like my biography about the characters links to my friend web comics how to get a hold of me how to buy my stuff.

408
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:08,197
Rym: Additionally, you're constantly adding new content to the site.

409
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,460
Scott: every day You're uploading a new picture to the website and that picture needs its own page.

410
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,209
Scott: It needs to also go on the front page.

411
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,260
Rym: It also needs to be part of your navigation.

412
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:21,424
Rym: So if someone's going through the archives they can read all of these pictures in order Mm-hmm.

413
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:28,800
Rym: in the old days You would make all of these pages Individually and just keep updating in each one to add links to the previous one in the last one.

414
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,636
Scott: So every day you would modify the front page.

415
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:32,280
Scott: you would mod.

416
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,951
Scott: You would make a brand new page for that comic itself.

417
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,160
Scott: You would modify your archives page.

418
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,932
Scott: You would rewrite your whole news post in HTML.

419
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,316
Scott: You would be writing HTML you.

420
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:43,520
Scott: you couldn't just write it.

421
00:26:43,781 --> 00:27:00,213
Scott: You had to also be thinking about the HTML and what you are writing at the same time Even if you're using a cascading style sheet, so you don't have to worry about the style of what you're writing You still have to constantly be going like P at the beginning of the paragraph Slash P at the end of the paragraph whenever you make a link.

422
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:01,520
Scott: you had to go a a trip.

423
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,973
Scott: You know, it's kind of annoying to do that and it sucks.

424
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:08,698
Scott: and if you mess up You got to go back and mess with it again.

425
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:18,017
Rym: Now this was before the advent of what we like to call dynamic HTML or just dynamic web pages Database dynamic HTML something different.

426
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:28,287
Scott: Yeah PHP's and CGI's and pearls and pythons and rubies and the ability of web servers to run code to Dynamically generate web pages.

427
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,540
Rym: So very simply before you'd make the web page someone went to your site.

428
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,623
Rym: They would see the web page.

429
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:39,097
Rym: now with these content management systems you well with these techniques We'll get a little ahead of ourselves.

430
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:46,520
Rym: there You make the instructions for the web server to make the web page and then you put the data in a database or something.

431
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:53,680
Scott: Yes, for example, let's say I make a webcomic and I all I do is I have a folder full of webcomic images.

432
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,368
Scott: They're just JPEGs and they're.

433
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,920
Scott: the names of the files are the date.

434
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:08,193
Scott: well I make a little program and I say program look at the current date and then go and get the comic of that date and Display it.

435
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:18,367
Scott: So now someone visits my web server and they say hey web server Give me the home page and the little pro instead of just giving them the page which is what you know Just that HTML I wrote by hand.

436
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:25,530
Scott: The program would run and the program would pick the newest webcomic or the current webcomic and give it to them.

437
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:32,856
Rym: Yeah It would basically write a web page on the fly for every day every single visitor who came to the site based on whatever Parameters you gave it.

438
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:38,202
Scott: Yeah, you could also do something like okay Hey program, look at the URL the person typed in.

439
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,890
Scott: does that URL have the date in it?

440
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,946
Scott: If the date is in the URL get the comic for that date.

441
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,610
Scott: now I've only written one little program and I've written one web page.

442
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:53,630
Scott: But depending on what URL the person types in and what date it is the what's on the pages will change.

443
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,838
Rym: So what are the benefits of this as it is now?

444
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:59,170
Rym: now instead of having to make manual web pages?

445
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,070
Rym: So your content and your design are intertwined and you're constantly meddling with both of them.

446
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,990
Rym: Now you have a thing that will present the data and you don't have to worry about that.

447
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:14,968
Rym: All you have to do is mark up the data itself and put it in a format that the thing will understand And it'll take care of the rest.

448
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:15,649
Scott: Yep.

449
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:23,349
Scott: So whether it's a webcomic or a blog post if you want to make more stuff for your website You don't actually need to modify your website.

450
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,586
Scott: You just make a text file with your.

451
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:33,710
Scott: you know Your blog post or you make an image with your webcomic and you upload it into the right folder and BAM You've got your stuff going on now.

452
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:43,310
Rym: that's great and all but it still requires a lot of technological know-how to set up and It doesn't remove a lot of the because now you still have to interact with the database.

453
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,137
Rym: You still have to interact with these directories.

454
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:48,450
Rym: You still have to deal with each individual item that you're putting up.

455
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,770
Rym: Yeah, the web the system takes care of the presentation, but you still have to do the backend work.

456
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,438
Scott: So what do we do?

457
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,890
Scott: We make a content management system.

458
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:10,362
Scott: Now if you want to still do the back-end work There are sort of these halfway light content management systems that exist like block some I don't know how to pronounce it Bo lo Bo lo s XOM below access.

459
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:12,088
Scott: So I don't know if the X or the S comes first.

460
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:12,750
Scott: It doesn't matter.

461
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:30,925
Scott: There are things that do that But for people who don't have the time to deal with that like a single Perl script to manage their whole website you use things like WordPress Andrew Paul and blogger and movable type and Emotion engine and I can't think of any others right now, but there's a lot of them.

462
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,009
Scott: What do these do?

463
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:39,930
Scott: Well, they use a database to the fullest abilities and an administration interface and it's it's all super powerful.

464
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,482
Rym: So now you've got this set up and it'll.

465
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:45,570
Rym: it takes care of the front end and the back end.

466
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:53,190
Rym: so basically all you have to do now is Create your content in the system and it'll take care of the rest.

467
00:30:53,491 --> 00:31:01,017
Rym: So instead of having to interact with the low-level back-end once it's set up like a look at our podcast We've run WordPress.

468
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:02,223
Rym: WordPress is running.

469
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:03,610
Scott: It's sort of like we have a web server.

470
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:07,242
Scott: We install this program on the web server called WordPress.

471
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:09,890
Scott: then we log WordPress automatically.

472
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,597
Scott: And you know, we have a database server.

473
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,650
Scott: Also WordPress automatically does its thing with the database server.

474
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,657
Scott: We just had to tell it where the database server is.

475
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,010
Scott: So it's keeping a lot of information in the database.

476
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:25,646
Scott: We visit the WordPress website we log in then we see a box.

477
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,203
Scott: the box says, you know Do this do that?

478
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:28,548
Scott: do this?

479
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:36,786
Scott: so if I want to make a new post for the podcast I go New post and there's a box and I type the new post in the box and then I click publish.

480
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:38,110
Rym: it creates an environment where?

481
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:45,569
Rym: You can do all of the editing and writing or whatever you need to do for your content Without having to interact with the technological aspects of it.

482
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:57,563
Scott: So you make your website once, you know, you make one theme for your website, you know You only have to design the header once the footer once, you know What you want posts to look like what you want the archives to look like.

483
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:12,810
Scott: you design all those things just one time and then from then on you go and you log into your website and this is an administrator's interface and you make new content and people can post comments and forums and whatever your CMS offers.

484
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:17,462
Rym: So since these things exist even though that a lot of people don't seem to know about the next time.

485
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:32,483
Rym: if any of you were thinking of making some sort of website or something and you have to ask someone like you want to know how to make your mat your navigation or how to make your site and You want to use Dreamweaver or you want to make a web page the old-school way.

486
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:34,930
Rym: and you ask anyone like us?

487
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,121
Rym: The answer is pretty much going to be use a content management system.

488
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,350
Rym: There's no reason to make pages by hand anymore.

489
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:45,550
Scott: Yeah, too many people just do things the old-school way and they cause themselves unnecessary grief.

490
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,789
Scott: I mean look at how many people out there I see them.

491
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,780
Scott: They're looking up the specifics of how to make an RSS feed.

492
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,468
Scott: and it's like dude if you use a content management system It automatically makes your RSS feed.

493
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,833
Scott: You don't need to do anything.

494
00:32:56,853 --> 00:33:03,955
Scott: it that that's the power of having your website in a database and such being handled by some Application to some other.

495
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:04,417
Scott: guy wrote.

496
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,930
Rym: Yeah, it's fully extensible because all the data is there.

497
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:15,077
Rym: So we've got our WordPress and you know We tag all of our episodes say with different things so you can click on Anime and get every post we've ever made about anime.

498
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:22,057
Rym: say we want to make a special feed that has I don't know Every board game episode we've done.

499
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:25,670
Rym: we want to make a special thing about board games or a special board game section.

500
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,522
Rym: We don't need to do anything.

501
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:28,750
Rym: It's already all there.

502
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:33,748
Rym: All we need to do is make a page that draws all the board game episodes together and formats them.

503
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:39,670
Rym: However, we want Yeah, I mean so you can change your website completely without having to change anything behind the scenes.

504
00:33:40,251 --> 00:34:04,350
Scott: Yeah, if your content, you know that belongs on your website your articles your pictures all your the things that people are coming to Your website to see if they are all organized You know in a database or on a file server in a way that makes sense to a computer then the content management system can present them in whatever way it is told to do and They do it in a very clever way and you don't need to work on that shit anymore.

505
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:07,690
Scott: No HTML writing is necessary unless you want to make a theme.

506
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,590
Scott: No, PHP Programmings are necessary unless you want to make a plug-in or a theme, you know, it's all done for you.

507
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,029
Scott: Stop making websites by hand you fools.

508
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:20,619
Scott: Why are you causing yourself this pain?

509
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,168
Scott: And why are you asking me to help you do things the bad way?

510
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:23,248
Scott: Why?

511
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:33,670
Rym: I mean, it seems like a lot of especially a lot of organizations like most anime conventions even seem to just Make a website by hand and they have a lot of trouble with it.

512
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:43,510
Rym: And then whenever the webmaster changes or a new year comes there's always all sorts of confusion as to well Who designed this or this part doesn't work with that or we need to rewrite that page.

513
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,577
Rym: We don't have access to it.

514
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:46,268
Rym: And none of that's a problem if you use a CMS.

515
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,829
Scott: No, it's like if you want to change the way your page looks.

516
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,090
Scott: well.

517
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,110
Scott: There's a theme and the theme is like, you know, very simple.

518
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,693
Scott: There's the header.

519
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,829
Scott: if you modify the header the header changes on every page.

520
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:58,256
Scott: You'll need to change it once.

521
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:01,590
Scott: none of this copying it onto every single freaking page.

522
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:05,070
Scott: Maybe one time you mess up and now there's a broken page somewhere on your site.

523
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:06,815
Scott: none of that business happens.

524
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:13,869
Rym: and remember a lot of people they hear cut CMS or content management system and the first thing they Think about is oh that only works if you want to make a blog.

525
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,746
Rym: That's the basic format that all these make.

526
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:22,250
Rym: by default You can use these content management systems to make all sorts of sites that don't look anything like blogs.

527
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:32,550
Scott: Yeah, I know a lot of times if a site uses a popular content management system like, you know movable type WordPress or drew Paul you can recognize it because they have the default themes.

528
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,610
Scott: You know in the default look and feel of sites that running those CMS's but you can change the themes a lot.

529
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:44,889
Scott: I mean I'm pretty sure it's whit TV runs on drew Paul and it doesn't look like anything that any other drew Paul sites.

530
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,090
Rym: plus.

531
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,914
Rym: I mean we're working on an updated GeekNights site and it's not gonna look at all like it looks now When we're done with it,

532
00:35:51,114 --> 00:36:02,094
Scott: no, not at all, you know, it's like you could have anything running in the back and The people who are actually coming to visit your site will have no idea what's going on back there If you don't want them to know.

533
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:03,379
Scott: plus you look.

534
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:09,884
Scott: if a CMS, you know has too many features It's better to have one with too many features than what would not enough features.

535
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:15,670
Scott: if it doesn't have enough features Then you need to start hacking at it to do plugins and shit and it's a pain in the ass.

536
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:20,190
Scott: If your CMS has too many features you can just disable the features you're not using.

537
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,545
Scott: I mean, I know a lot of sites that run drew Paul, which has a forum.

538
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,536
Scott: They don't use that forum If you just don't even know what's there.

539
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:33,205
Scott: I mean, it's in there somewhere, but no one's using it and there's no links to it Or anything, you know, it just picked the CMS.

540
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:33,929
Scott: that's right for you.

541
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,970
Scott: A lot of them out there kind of suck, but we're not gonna get in the specific ones or anything.

542
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,633
Scott: I already said that.

543
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,781
Scott: but yeah CMS is.

544
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:43,130
Scott: they are for the people who make the smart web pages.

545
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:51,798
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
