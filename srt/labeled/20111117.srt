00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,044
Rym: It's Thursday, November 17th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,267
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,230
Rym: Emily, and I talked about our trip to Japan.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,123
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:30,820
Rym: I guess we're back to kind of our normal schedule.

6
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,911
Scott: I know it's bullshit because next week is gonna be Thanksgiving.

7
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,640
Rym: ah shit, and then there's gonna be wait Monday Wednesday.

8
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,245
Rym: We can do it.

9
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:39,100
Scott: I'm just saying there's gonna be some mad holidays.

10
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,119
Rym: I will manage unless I get sent to Turkey and then there's gonna be no GeekNights for a while.

11
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:48,320
Scott: well And then right so I'm off work from Christmas through mag fest.

12
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,798
Scott: Oh, yeah, so I go into work until after mag fest once.

13
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,313
Rym: so Scott What are you going to do in that time?

14
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:56,419
Scott: shit talk?

15
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:03,279
Scott: Perhaps some of it will actually be shit, but most of it talk.

16
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:07,092
Scott: Yeah, read a lot of comic books play some other Zelda game.

17
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,640
Scott: all we'll have by then got a Gundam model.

18
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:12,208
Rym: So much like we'll save it.

19
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,760
Scott: maybe I'll write a line of code or something.

20
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,974
Rym: I'm waiting for Tuesday to talk about burning apocalypse con, but it was pretty fun.

21
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,495
Rym: It was okay.

22
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:20,699
Rym: It's only okay.

23
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,310
Scott: I mean it wasn't like packs, but no one was.

24
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,476
Scott: you know no one's saying it was.

25
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:25,460
Scott: it was a completely different thing.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,820
Rym: I was in some pretty good games But the people who played in my game.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,912
Scott: I was in an excellent day game.

28
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:33,131
Rym: all the game that I got bumped out of that I wanted to be as he was the best.

29
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:34,700
Scott: you should have joined the horde.

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:38,599
Rym: Yeah, I did join and I got bumped by someone who may have looked like you.

31
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,880
Emily: It was me with my number one priority.

32
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:51,723
Rym: Meanwhile in the first slot I actually had second priority But a table of people lied to me and said I had fourth and because I didn't have the schedule on me I didn't check.

33
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,713
Scott: I actually printed the schedule beforehand.

34
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,957
Scott: I went before going.

35
00:01:56,137 --> 00:02:02,373
Scott: I printed my own copy And I wrote on it my priorities for each Slot and I put checkmarks.

36
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:03,660
Scott: and this is the games that look good.

37
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:04,645
Rym: You know why I didn't do that?

38
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:10,654
Rym: because the entire night before I was writing the game I was running and burning characters for it a free market.

39
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:15,560
Rym: you require no writing Ah, but it was worth it because uh one of the players in my game.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,245
Rym: So it was the best game.

41
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:16,849
Rym: They played all week.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,574
Rym: It probably was one of the better games Yeah And I was very happy that I turned a ton of people away from that game like it did.

43
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,680
Rym: the priorities went way up way quick.

44
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:35,080
Rym: Mm-hmm The secret was I stole the entire game from Hyperion and the Prince of Nothing Steal from the Forgotten Masters, I started the game.

45
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,935
Scott: I'm like he's told by.

46
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,792
Rym: I Start the game like before.

47
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,162
Rym: it started like there's small talk And I'm like.

48
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:44,267
Rym: so if any of you ever read our Scott backers Prince of Nothing series and none of them had I was like Hey, you know who our Scott backer is?

49
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:44,791
Rym: none of them did.

50
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:45,857
Rym: I was like all right?

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,352
Rym: And if you ever read Dan Simmons Hyperion none of them had.

52
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:51,160
Scott: and I was like all right doesn't even heard of it.

53
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,112
Rym: Uh actually I don't know.

54
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:53,577
Rym: I didn't ask that.

55
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,126
Scott: okay All right, that's it.

56
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:04,140
Rym: Uh one more important thing because I was reminded of because the Prince of Nothing Kellis Nair thing, but we played a support games last night.

57
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,936
Rym: We played Puerto Rico first time in a long time.

58
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,624
Rym: yep Scott knows better.

59
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,209
Rym: you should know better.

60
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:17,505
Rym: yet somehow I tricked him with my simplest and dumbest trick of Acting all petulant.

61
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:21,139
Scott: so that makes that we would both call Apple when you were ahead yep.

62
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,892
Rym: So I was doing.

63
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:23,760
Rym: I was doing pretty well.

64
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,598
Scott: The only reason I went along with it is because Richard got the second ten building which convinced me.

65
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:37,980
Scott: ah But I knew it wouldn't be enough to push him over the edge and the only difference between me and you Was that I didn't have the late-game doubloons to buy that one building.

66
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,080
Scott: It was pretty much the one building between the two of us.

67
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:45,605
Scott: I was actually ahead on the chips which is why I Cooperated because I said I'm ahead on the chips Scott I'm gonna stay ahead.

68
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,854
Rym: if you thought you were you actually weren't.

69
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,746
Rym: you forgot that I had two Unopposed captains early on.

70
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,994
Scott: only the customs house is what put you over.

71
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:54,680
Scott: if I had the customs house you would have lost.

72
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:56,734
Rym: Yeah, but I had the customs house.

73
00:03:56,794 --> 00:04:02,780
Scott: No shit No You didn't have the customs house when I started cooperating And I was pretty sure I was gonna get the customs house and I started going.

74
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,622
Scott: Remember

75
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:18,039
Rym: when we were talking about the big buildings right and I was like that's the building like I started suggesting to someone That you know an ex building and you interrupted and said that's the building Rym needs buy it when in fact that was not the building I wanted or needed.

76
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,623
Scott: It was.

77
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:29,006
Scott: it was at the time it was but not no I mean at the time and I wasn't gonna tell and the other thing was I didn't want to tell them to buy the customs House because that's the one I wanted.

78
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,095
Rym: but Scott I had more time you through the entire game.

79
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,580
Scott: No, I had more victory chips.

80
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,266
Scott: No, you did.

81
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:34,649
Scott: I did.

82
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,246
Rym: I had 37 points from those At the end of the game the chip.

83
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:41,672
Scott: Yes, the victory point chips.

84
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,760
Rym: I had 50 something at the end of the game.

85
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,456
Rym: Yeah, they were almost the entire when you were going for that building.

86
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,280
Rym: I had more Anyway anyway.

87
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:56,000
Rym: but Hint for anyone ever plays a game with me if I suddenly start acting kind of pissy and anti-social.

88
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,180
Scott: I do not cooperate with Rym under any circumstance.

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,767
Rym: I'm like, oh I can't win god damn it because chase bought a building that I really wanted and I used that opportunity To just sit there and be like fuck.

90
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:05,209
Rym: I lost.

91
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:15,394
Scott: and for whatever reason Scott believed it I Believed it only because Richard had 210 buildings and I believed I was gonna get the customs house Once you got the customs house, I started to worry but it was already over.

92
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:19,740
Rym: I was worried that Emily Was gonna be like hey rims doing fine.

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,320
Scott: No, I started to worry when the governor moved twice and I hadn't acquired in a single doubloon.

94
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:30,738
Scott: That's when I started to worry because I said, oh, I'm not gonna be able to buy it fuck Yeah, and then it was over and it was too late.

95
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,753
Scott: But before those two rounds passed I was still feeling pretty good.

96
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:37,142
Rym: I remembered how much I fucking love that game though It's a good game.

97
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,025
Scott: Yes game.

98
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,370
Rym: All right, you got some news.

99
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,140
Scott: I do so, you know the torchlight the Diablo clone.

100
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:43,487
Scott: Yeah, did you actually play that?

101
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,317
Rym: Uh, no, but I know about it.

102
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,127
Scott: All right Well, it's Diablo clone.

103
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,120
Scott: I pretty much played it and then beat it and then it was done.

104
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,968
Rym: It looks way more fun than the new Diablo.

105
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,058
Scott: Yeah, so I looked at PAX West I saw a torchlight do and I talked to the guys and those guys.

106
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,178
Scott: well You know It's still at its core a game where you click and click and click and click and click and eventually win.

107
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:02,579
Scott: and that's it.

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,172
Rym: Attack attack attack potion attack attack potion attack town portal.

109
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:06,514
Scott: Yep.

110
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:06,975
Scott: That's it.

111
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:07,899
Scott: There's nothing to it.

112
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:11,797
Scott: Mindless clicking clicking on the monsters looking at flashy colors.

113
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,119
Scott: That's it.

114
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,047
Scott: But Every other aspect of this game.

115
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,411
Scott: These guys are getting right.

116
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:17,113
Scott: I talked to them.

117
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,060
Scott: They're gonna have a flat price play forever.

118
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:21,648
Scott: No DLCs another bull, you know stupid bullshit.

119
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,611
Scott: That's unfair, right?

120
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,240
Scott: No paying to get better characters, right?

121
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,660
Scott: Awesome co-ops that will actually work unlike say magica, right?

122
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:32,848
Scott: You know, basically everything awesome.

123
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,780
Scott: they got everything right except for the fact that it's a game where all you do is click.

124
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:45,440
Scott: torchlight 2 however sadly is gonna be delayed a Delayed from this year until some point in the near future.

125
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,357
Rym: I want to take you back to a time the distant past When we were waiting for a game called tribes to to come out and it got delayed.

126
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:55,071
Rym: Yep Nothing will ever compare to that feeling.

127
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:56,299
Scott: I'm gonna call it right now.

128
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,780
Scott: This will not become the next Duke Nukem forever because what I saw at PAX was so close to done.

129
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:09,277
Rym: I think that they're just wait will not become the next game that comes out and people can buy After ten years.

130
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,293
Scott: But yeah, actually the guy this is the funny part of this right.

131
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,497
Scott: it's like okay game was delayed.

132
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,220
Scott: what's the big deal?

133
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,003
Scott: He's a big deal.

134
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:22,328
Scott: the guy who announced, you know from the company who announced the delay He said quote.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,920
Scott: besides you're all playing Skyrim right now.

136
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,763
Scott: Anyway, aren't you?

137
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:31,100
Scott: or battlefield 3 or uncharted 3 or Saints Row 3 or deuce Arkham City or Skyward Sword?

138
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,140
Scott: Or Minecraft or modern warfare 3 or Dark Souls or Assassin's Creed revelations?

139
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,171
Scott: And he's like it's a joystick.

140
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:39,513
Scott: was like.

141
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:40,057
Scott: you're right.

142
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:50,040
Scott: No rush It'll take us this time next year to make our way through everything you just mentioned In some non gaming news, I just want to bring this up very briefly.

143
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:54,515
Rym: It was kind of an open e sort of meta thing, but I can buy.

144
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,040
Rym: Wall Street is all up in my business.

145
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,649
Rym: They're like outside my building.

146
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,640
Scott: every day should come and move up to where I'm working.

147
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,220
Scott: Yes, where it's just as bad every day of every year that I ever go to work this tourists up in my business.

148
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,736
Rym: Today was literally a constant stream of police sirens and yelling outside my building.

149
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:11,979
Scott: how high up are you?

150
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,515
Scott: 16 stories and you still hear it.

151
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:22,060
Rym: Yeah From the 16th floor I can hear individual people talking on the ground floor like on the street.

152
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:30,037
Scott: I'm on the seventh floor and I can only hear the following things from the street the tour bus with the microphone All right on the top, right?

153
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:37,299
Scott: If a guy comes and starts busking with a sax or drumming or something like that I can hear it or a siren of some sort.

154
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,051
Scott: I cannot hear anything else.

155
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:44,179
Rym: in my old building in the Lincoln building I one time I was staying at work late for something and I heard a ruckus outside.

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Rym: So I opened the window and I see a cabbie chasing a guy around his cab.

157
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:53,410
Rym: So I can hear the whole argument and it was really funny and I just kind of held my phone videoing the thing.

158
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,134
Rym: in case you know It turned into YouTube and it didn't.

159
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,000
Rym: they just ran around for a while.

160
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:11,380
Scott: I was walking down the street in Astoria some months ago And there was like a cabbie was gonna fight and a yellow cab was gonna fight with a non yellow cab and the two guys Were out and like one guy was getting ready to punch the other guy and the other guy was like respect yourself What are you doing?

161
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,270
Rym: Respect that's that's a good thing to say right.

162
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,299
Scott: and then it was just sort of like in.

163
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:18,605
Rym: Thing.

164
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,571
Rym: is that's beautiful?

165
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,520
Rym: that's on one hand admonishment coupled with insight.

166
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,315
Rym: You're inciting the person but yet at the same time the thing you were inciting them about.

167
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:29,800
Rym: they'll feel worse if they act.

168
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,332
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't.

169
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:32,018
Scott: I just kept walking.

170
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:41,015
Rym: It wasn't Lately, I stopped whenever I see stuff except the only rare stuff because it's happening So constantly that it's like, oh look a whole bunch of riot police marching in formation.

171
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:41,698
Rym: Cool.

172
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,149
Scott: Cool Nice shields could borrow one.

173
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:54,620
Scott: Oh We should buy riot police here on the internet and then show up and have two lines of real line of real riot Please in the line of fake rat police face because we keep talking about video games.

174
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,559
Rym: So I played counter-strike one six few days ago.

175
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,938
Scott: I keep meaning to do it, but then I end up just clicking on source and playing for real.

176
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:01,380
Rym: It was fine.

177
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,250
Rym: I was playing okay, and then I Realized as an item that I forgot about the riot shield.

178
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,878
Scott: I thought they that was like in and out.

179
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:10,540
Rym: No, it wasn't out.

180
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,764
Rym: It's just we started playing source.

181
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:12,446
Scott: I forgot.

182
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,008
Scott: they added it.

183
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,900
Rym: Yeah, you know what that thing is unfair fucking hacks broken.

184
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:17,829
Rym: It is awesome.

185
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,799
Scott: How broken could it be?

186
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,200
Rym: I was invincible God with that thing if I was gonna base, but it doesn't stop bullets.

187
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,899
Scott: How many bullets does it stop all of them?

188
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,078
Scott: What if someone shoots you in the back?

189
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,232
Rym: You back up into a corner put it in new front of yourself and duck.

190
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:35,864
Rym: if you have three people doing that in each bombsite The bombsite is pretty big.

191
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:36,505
Rym: Yeah.

192
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,032
Scott: Did you have the bomb behind you in a corner next to a crate?

193
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,777
Rym: We were counter terrorists.

194
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:44,920
Scott: Oh So you can you shoot from around behind the shield.

195
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:49,880
Rym: Uh, you can put it to the side and then it'll protect you halfway and then you can shoot but then you can be shot.

196
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,275
Rym: ah Interesting you'll play and you'll see it's it's fun.

197
00:10:53,295 --> 00:11:09,380
Rym: Okay So things of the day in the course of our game night Of course all social gatherings at the geek house unless we specifically prevent it turn into everybody show a YouTube video before we go to bed.

198
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:24,353
Rym: So we were talking about adaptive Like picture stuff like adaptive scaling, you know the stuff where you like take a picture and you make it wider and it figures out more scenario or more scenery to put like in between the edges dynamically stuff like that.

199
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:32,820
Rym: and The discussion went to how like a lot of techno music uses what is effectively a compressor set up wrong to make like cool effects.

200
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:39,373
Scott: So the debate was like you have a tool with an intended purpose But then you somehow use the tool in a way that it was not intended.

201
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:43,086
Scott: right like a saw is meant to cut wood But it can also be an instrument.

202
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,620
Scott: right exactly, you know, it's like you're not using the saw, right?

203
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,079
Scott: But I'm still making something cool.

204
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:49,950
Rym: So we start.

205
00:11:49,991 --> 00:12:00,220
Rym: I started positing Why doesn't someone Do the same thing with video like set up like what if you set up a codec like really wrong to do an interesting thing?

206
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:06,320
Rym: And a friend chase Gordon who was an awesome listener and friend and member of our New York City hangout crew.

207
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,280
Rym: Now you might remember him from such classics as the old Rochester whiskey.

208
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,774
Scott: Rym and Scott's old Rochester whiskey immediately turned that particular comics.

209
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:30,418
Rym: Oh, there's a thing Datamosh young Jake did a rap did a song and when he has a music video associated with it which is my thing of the day, which is him doing exactly what I suggested and It's actually pretty cool.

210
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,657
Rym: Yeah, I dig this.

211
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,324
Rym: Lyrics are also funny.

212
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:34,806
Rym: They're funny.

213
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:37,956
Rym: in the same way then, you know sit like fuck.

214
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,942
Rym: shit stack is yep Like it's.

215
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,888
Rym: so he's like I'm so cool.

216
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,191
Rym: Look at my shit.

217
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:46,300
Rym: I'm doing this on purpose doing this on purpose.

218
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,214
Scott: So I found the best tumblr best tumblr magic cards with googly eyes.

219
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,020
Scott: The guy takes magic the gathering cards.

220
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:58,380
Scott: He figures out the exact best googly eyes to put on them in the exact right places.

221
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,460
Scott: He even gets the black dots in the googly eyes in the best possible position on the magic card.

222
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,560
Scott: Googly eyes are generally pretty useful and he just just putting you just puts googly eyes in the magic card and they become hilarious.

223
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,040
Scott: My favorite is this one the Vodalian serpent.

224
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:13,995
Scott: That's pretty great Right.

225
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,000
Scott: There's also some clever ones.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,626
Scott: So there's like a spider and as a fuck ton of eyes or a card There's like a whole bunch of creatures.

227
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:25,848
Scott: So there's a whole bunch of eyes and all of them or this one That's like a lumber knot.

228
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,760
Scott: It's got two eyes and two weird-ass places.

229
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,405
Scott: I'm sure there's like some Cyclops is around.

230
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,608
Rym: I just noticed the back of the car.

231
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,290
Rym: That's pretty good, too.

232
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:39,239
Scott: Oh, yeah His background on the blog is a magic card with five googly eyes where the five colored dots normally would be.

233
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:40,083
Rym: It's funny.

234
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:46,100
Rym: every now and then I get this weird urge to play magic kind of like how I imagine ex-smokers Occasionally get a weird urge to smoke a cigarette.

235
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,620
Rym: Yeah We thought I should play magic and then I remember how much I hate magic.

236
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:55,060
Scott: We can just go to a gaming store and we could buy two starter decks for like almost nothing and just play whatever you get.

237
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:56,109
Rym: Suck now though.

238
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,340
Scott: I know but that's what I'm saying.

239
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,601
Scott: We just.

240
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:01,810
Scott: but the thing is the ones we get at packs for free are yeah ass Those are like babies.

241
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:02,680
Rym: first magic, right?

242
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,700
Scott: We should get the ones just two real ones from some set that's identical and just whatever you why don't we just take all of?

243
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,286
Rym: Magic cards that we own?

244
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,935
Rym: because I play with those because they are not equal.

245
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:13,678
Rym: who gives a shit?

246
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:14,139
Scott: just do it.

247
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:14,751
Scott: We could do.

248
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,798
Scott: well, you know We could do is you could try that mode where there's like one giant deck or something like that.

249
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,163
Scott: Right?

250
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:23,555
Scott: wasn't there a mode where there's a giant deck and there's five stacks of open-faced land?

251
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,398
Rym: a better way to play?

252
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,020
Rym: is that the star?

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,520
Rym: Mode that nobody plays anymore where everyone plays a one color deck one of each color.

254
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,197
Rym: Oh you win if you beat the two people across from you.

255
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:33,507
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

256
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:34,434
Scott: Yeah, it's a good mode.

257
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:34,958
Scott: I'll be white.

258
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:43,140
Rym: You could be white All right, so I don't know what happened but we just keep having guests on GeekNights.

259
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,020
Emily: Yes, so making your life cuz you got no show ideas.

260
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:46,559
Scott: You know what?

261
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:54,370
Rym: It is no longer difficult to have guests on the show because remember the last time we used to have guests I had that Non awesome sound card and I couldn't like multi-track.

262
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,059
Scott: Well now you got all those little tiny sound USB external guys.

263
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,288
Rym: Uh, no, I don't use.

264
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,820
Scott: All right, you get the firewire interface.

265
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,276
Rym: Yeah, you know how many people we can have on GeekNights with no trouble.

266
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:08,072
Rym: 100 And That's if I don't use my multiplexer.

267
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,041
Rym: then we can go up to 20.

268
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,615
Rym: But at that point I might have some hardware problems in terms of my.

269
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,300
Scott: we have that many inputs on the mixer.

270
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:18,289
Rym: No, I'd have to multiplex.

271
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,792
Rym: Oh, yeah.

272
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:19,316
Scott: Okay.

273
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:32,589
Emily: Yes So the reason I'm on the show today instead of just sitting in the corner and laughing at those guys is because those guys those guys Those little guys You're jaded to us a little bit.

274
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:42,380
Rym: because when Jared was those guys It was difficult to record because Jared was laughing so hard that like he couldn't even like look at the mic Like he did go away from the microphone and start laughing like hysterically.

275
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:46,440
Emily: It's funny cuz I I guess I'm kind of a nerd to it now.

276
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,008
Emily: But it's like when I see other people react to you.

277
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:55,294
Emily: then it comes back to me how hilarious it actually is, you know So, um, but yeah, I had the.

278
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,580
Emily: we figured it's Thursday.

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:12,960
Emily: So everything is just kind of whatever topic we want to talk about and I figured since it was rims first trip to Japan it might be kind of cool to Talk about that a little bit and how Scott asked questions like you don't want me to ask questions.

280
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,004
Emily: No, I said you

281
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:14,767
Rym: said we do want

Scott: how many panty vending machines?

285
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,365
Scott: Did you see zero?

286
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,015
Emily: the whole panty vending machine thing is a myth.

287
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:23,179

00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:46,720
Emily: go in and they always list, you know two prices There's the rest and then there's the stay which is overnight, you know.

307
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:52,049
Emily: So rest is like a few hours and so that's when you want to have a quickie or something.

308
00:17:52,069 --> 00:18:09,539
Emily: you go to the love hotel and pay like 30 bucks and you Can have a couple hours in a in a fantasy themed room, but this hotel was called hotel to you I get it which was like hotel and then that happened The best hotel I've ever seen.

309
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:24,970
Emily: It's like when somebody's telling a story and it's kind of like you say that before you like Big lead-up to how these people ended up.

310
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,780
Emily: So I thought that was pretty hilarious.

311
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:39,655
Rym: I guess if we kind of go chronologically the first thing I have to say is that I've determined Scientifically that jet lag is a motherfucking myth.

312
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:48,103
Scott: There's no such thing Jet lag and people always complain about it, but I'd like go whole Like.

313
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:48,927
Rym: you're gonna.

314
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,775
Rym: you know jet lag you're gonna experience it.

315
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:51,880
Rym: It's gonna really mess you up.

316
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,925
Rym: You gotta be ready for this.

317
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,680
Rym: I get to Japan and I'm just like fine.

318
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,959
Emily: So when we were at PAX, right, it's Seattle is what three hours different for.

319
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:08,080
Emily: So When we flew over it was like, you know, I get tired a little early in the evening.

320
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:13,708
Emily: So it's like it hits 10 o'clock at night and I'm like guys I gotta go to bed, you know They're like, oh you big wuss baby.

321
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,135
Emily: Come on play more games.

322
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,632
Emily: I'm like, no seriously I'm tired, you know jet lag and they're like whatever chat like.

323
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,040
Emily: and Rym says I don't have jet lag at all.

324
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,146
Emily: I never get jet lag.

325
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,860
Emily: and I'm like well wait until you have a major time shift.

326
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:37,459
Emily: And so I was waiting to get my revenge because here we have an international flight which is basically what 13 13 or 14 hours depending on whether it's daylight savings time.

327
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:55,960
Emily: and So I was like your day will become night and you'll see the pain and then you will be sick and not want to eat anything because actually I get less sleepy and more like I'm hungry at weird times and not hungry when I'm supposed to eat like I Really sick to my stomach cuz my body is like you're not supposed to be eating.

328
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:02,964
Scott: I think I'm starting to agree with Rym because like when I was Israel, I didn't have any problems and when I went to Seattle I've never had any problems.

329
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:09,800
Rym: I think that he is the build-up like I'd basically stayed up before But so then I slept on the plane and that was my night sleep.

330
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,890
Rym: So I woke up in Japan at like 11 a.m.

331
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,569
Rym: Or something had a whole day and then like 930 10 o'clock I went to bed and I was fine.

332
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:19,493
Rym: I was just like on normal time.

333
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:24,332
Rym: In fact, I slept better in Japan Slept in like the last decade.

334
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:27,951
Scott: special beds there some shit Different kind of mattresses.

335
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:28,776
Rym: Yeah futon.

336
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,186
Emily: All right Most of the time we slept on the floor.

337
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:38,216
Emily: actually because most of the the hotels we stayed at were traditional broken And so it's just like three mats.

338
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:45,640
Emily: and yeah It was like we had tatami mats and then just pulled out the the futons from the closet and slept on those.

339
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:46,929
Rym: They were really nice rooms.

340
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,198
Scott: They have internet in those rooms.

341
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,240
Rym: Interestingly a few of them did but I noticed because you know, I didn't have a data plan.

342
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,213
Rym: I was tracking like GPS coordinates of walking around.

343
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:59,660
Rym: There's basically Pretty much zero free Wi-Fi anywhere in Japan.

344
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:09,658
Rym: There's a million locked Wi-Fi's and Wi-Fi's you can log into and pay money to get internet But there's no free ones.

345
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:18,774
Emily: There were a few like the one in the shopping district in Kyoto like Google or Yahoo or someone isn't providing no First Man, I tell you though.

346
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,442
Emily: I hated my cell phone I rented.

347
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:24,715
Emily: I rented from a US company and it was like this crappy Nokia phone that would.

348
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:33,800
Emily: the screen would stay on it would Run out of battery in a few hours And I hadn't realized how much I depend on a smartphone because there were so many times where we'd be walking around.

349
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,090
Emily: I'd be like Google Maps.

350
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:39,432
Scott: Oh, no, Google Just paid whatever it cost to get a real phone.

351
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,060
Emily: That's I think I'm gonna do it next time.

352
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,000
Emily: I'm like just get it from a tree Like the next iPhones.

353
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,268
Emily: Yeah, I saw that there were.

354
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,340
Emily: actually a lot of the phones are starting to use the global standard.

355
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:53,360
Scott: Well, it's just they have all they have, you know, both sets of radios.

356
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,043
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's like the old days like my pre my old cell phone way back had it could do analog and two different Digital formats.

357
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:04,439
Scott: It's just a fistful of radios in there and then you could turn on only the ones you're using right now.

358
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:12,660
Rym: but interestingly I did learn that a Smartphone that has good GPS and a magnetic compass but does not have any data whatsoever It's still.

359
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,372
Rym: Do you mean what was I gonna do?

360
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,416
Scott: not free Wi-Fi's?

361
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:38,381
Rym: yeah But basically I was I could use the cache Google Maps and the GPS stuff And if I started a track like when we're going somewhere like we rented bikes in Nagoya for a day I was actually pretty good, you know, it was clown bikes Like.

362
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:42,675
Emily: actually they were some of the better rental bikes because they were actual mountain bikes.

363
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,946
Emily: the frame was okay for me But quite small.

364
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,780
Rym: I would look like I was riding a clown.

365
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:50,170
Emily: It wasn't as bad as the tourist bike rental.

366
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:53,480
Scott: No, but they're meant for tiny Japanese people, right?

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,800
Emily: Japanese people were riding frames that were way too.

368
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,311
Rym: So here's the weird thing about bikes that I noticed.

369
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:01,020
Emily: one two thirds of the people.

370
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,180
Rym: Yes, so two-thirds of the people like bikes are everywhere.

371
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:08,676
Rym: But there's no such thing as biking on the left or right or on the street or the sidewalk.

372
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:09,880
Rym: people just bike fucking everywhere.

373
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:17,380
Rym: So the sidewalks just have people careening in expertly around barely missing everybody and like wobble wobble on the sidewalk.

374
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,533
Emily: Yeah, and it's actually getting to be a problem.

375
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,567
Emily: Like I was talking with Mr.

376
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:31,870
Emily: Noda and he was saying that They're starting to be laws looked into because there are so many pedestrian and bicycle accidents I can tell you why nobody knows how to ride their bike.

377
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:33,055
Emily: It isn't car and bike.

378
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:34,059
Emily: It's a pedestrian.

379
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,896
Rym: and bike Yeah Is the main cause of the bikes go really really slow and they wobble all over the place on the sidewalk.

380
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:55,608
Emily: and also it's weird Because like in New York, it seems like the people who bike are either one delivery guys who have the really tough-looking BMX bikes You know, they're like really chunky frames and stuff or the like Hipster style like fixie whatever But it's popular in hip.

381
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,480
Emily: it's mostly like what do they call mama Charlie's.

382
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Emily: Yeah, mama Charlie's and the mama Charlie's are like these single gear fixed, you know fixed gear bicycle.

383
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,027
Rym: I'll put it this way Scott.

384
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:13,322
Rym: Our average New York walking speed is faster than the average Cuz.

385
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:14,768
Emily: think of how far we got.

386
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,157
Emily: of course we had mountain bikes, but we were also.

387
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:17,800
Rym: we were booking.

388
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,182
Rym: I mean we.

389
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,528
Rym: I mean any biker we came to.

390
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:20,512
Rym: we just blew by it.

391
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,900
Emily: was it was actually funny because We were riding around?

392
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,909
Emily: No, actually actually the one time we got Called out to we were riding around campus.

393
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:44,879
Emily: We were at Nagoya University and we're riding around campus and this one Group of kids was just like yo cool bikes, you know, and they were yelling Small but I was like the rentals and they're like, oh they're still cool.

394
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:46,909
Rym: Almost no one had like mountain bikes.

395
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,020
Rym: But yeah the other third like there were bikers.

396
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,959
Rym: There was a very tiny minority of what if you had actually cool bikes?

397
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,163
Rym: then Here's the deal.

398
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,952
Rym: The majority of people are riding crap bikes.

399
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,480
Rym: They don't really know how to ride them.

400
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,505
Rym: They're going very slow and wobbly.

401
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:59,249
Rym: They're on the sidewalk.

402
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,111
Rym: a small minority are on bikes like ours Going wicked fast with the traffic in the street.

403
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,380
Rym: Yeah, and they're like two completely separate classes.

404
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,030
Scott: I've seen initial D action on the street.

405
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,611
Scott: I saw a lot of rice cars All right, any cars that like do not exist using the GTRs.

406
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:13,253
Scott: and actually

407
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:14,497
Rym: yes when we were

408
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:20,478
Emily: cars Mm-hmm, like yeah boxy square cars because it's hard to park so a lot of they're

409
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:21,483
Scott: all tiny could you

410
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:32,391
Emily: really tall but really like Short, you know, so they're like this cube shape kind of cars instead of the more aerodynamic Aerofoil curves that we tend to.

411
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:39,840
Rym: but I did see two GTRs parked in the notice neighborhood and I saw another GTR when we were in Kyoto parked out in a fancy neighborhood.

412
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,568
Rym: Cool a lot of GTRs.

413
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:42,393
Emily: I didn't notice.

414
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:45,167
Rym: but well GTR I noticed it's one of those.

415
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:49,516
Rym: it's one of the few cars that other than the Miata that I'm just Might have stolen it.

416
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,500
Rym: They're kind of nondescript compared to like a Lamborghini.

417
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:04,580
Emily: But So yeah riding bikes was actually one of those ideas where it was rims idea.

418
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:15,550
Emily: So let's rent bikes when we get to Nagoya because we hadn't really done a lot of exercise We walked around a lot, but we hadn't like run or Yeah crazy.

419
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:21,499
Emily: and so Because Rym doesn't really speak much of the language a lot of the trip planning kind of falls on me.

420
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:27,000
Emily: And so I was like, okay, so if we're gonna rent bikes, I have to arrange the renting of the bikes.

421
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,456
Emily: So we stopped for an hour at a net cafe.

422
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:35,968
Emily: Oh my god I thought he was gonna love the net cafe.

423
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,494
Rym: Talk about a den of iniquity.

424
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:49,376
Emily: No, it's like this huge Library of manga like there are shells and shelves of manga and free drinks and these little box cubicles and more cigarette smoke that I've been exposed to in the rest of my life.

425
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:53,327
Rym: come on, I Was getting like nauseous.

426
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,900
Scott: I couldn't have gone in like I would have gone out immediately.

427
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:01,676
Rym: It's funny because people like smoking is okay in Japan for the most part like people smoke all over plays.

428
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:05,037
Emily: but but you saw in Nagoya, they have anti-smoking signs in certain.

429
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,687
Rym: Oh, yeah What I was gonna get to is that it didn't.

430
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,518
Rym: I was surprised.

431
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:20,947
Rym: actually I think the smoking rates are way less than they were not that long ago because in all the upper scale places they're really like no one was smoking and like the nicer the ocons like you weren't allowed to smoke in the room and You're not allowed to smoke on the street.

432
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,517
Rym: Really you have to smoke in like smoking areas on the street.

433
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:24,120
Scott: That's good.

434
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,765
Emily: No smoking while walking.

435
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:32,529
Rym: the only place about that occasionally like if you're at a cheaper like less great restaurant There'd be like someone smoking which really sucked.

436
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,580
Rym: but whatever the nice restaurants known was smoking.

437
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:42,926
Rym: but Whenever we went into a game center everybody's smoking Especially in the pachinko area.

438
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,932
Rym: Oh my god go over to everyone.

439
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:45,614
Rym: game center.

440
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:48,081
Rym: There's like 40 pachinko parlors Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:48,422 --> 00:28:05,810
Emily: pachinko is everywhere and it's really loud and the game centers usually have pachinko in them Like they'll be like, you know one-third video game machines and one like two-thirds pachinko and slot patchy slot and stuff like that, so The crane games are off the hook.

442
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,898
Rym: There's like food in there.

443
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:11,426
Emily: It's like ice cream.

444
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,240
Emily: it's like a refrigerated crane game where you can grab ice.

445
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,220
Rym: This gave me a dystopian vision of the future where the homeless are given tokens and there are food crane games in the street.

446
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,727
Emily: That's really sick.

447
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,753
Rym: Yeah, I could see it.

448
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:33,680
Emily: They have all sorts of stuff like, you know, there's the traditional stuffed animals But there's also like anime figures and like it's kind of like a wild world.

449
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:46,169
Emily: they'll have the machines where you can like get a PSP and stuff from the crane game, but I Arcades in Japan like I knew they're awesome, but actually being in one they are awesome But they're not as good as they used to be.

450
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,957
Scott: but they're full of smoke like it's but it's.

451
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:48,660
Rym: so here's the thing.

452
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:56,420
Rym: They were full of smoke But all the smokers were either in the fighting game area, which is kind of separate or in the pachinko like crap area.

453
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,495
Rym: So where all the good games were that weren't fighting games.

454
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:00,400
Rym: there's really no smoke.

455
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,591
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it was smoking and playing DDR right now.

456
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:03,877
Rym: No, we did find a DDR machine.

457
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,128
Rym: It was like yeah, it was only one.

458
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,620
Rym: It was like 16th mix or something crazy.

459
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,603
Rym: It was all like that.

460
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,288
Rym: It was all like deaf punk songs.

461
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,153
Emily: We did gorillas.

462
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,240
Emily: We did feel-good ink and we did.

463
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,647
Scott: Let me see how many DDS got like.

464
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,534
Rym: the foot system is completely different now.

465
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:20,999
Rym: Yeah, I was like this song is 16 feet.

466
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,223
Rym: What does that mean?

467
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,071
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna look up.

468
00:29:24,252 --> 00:29:24,855
Emily: so we were.

469
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,060
Emily: we were like exhausted.

470
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,501
Emily: Those are.

471
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:37,556
Rym: we played tanks tanks tanks and initial D not for not five Mario, but six Initial d6 with a full-size steering wheel and Mario Kart 2 which was actually really awesome.

472
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,580
Emily: Yeah, that was really fun.

473
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:50,460
Emily: We went to game centers a couple of times like in Tokyo and then we went in Kyoto in Gion Before we went back to the hotel, but I think my favorite thing was watching you play the Gundam pod.

474
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,419
Rym: Oh my god, the gun gun is a four.

475
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,340
Rym: It's like you sit in a pipe.

476
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,887
Rym: It's like the old a mech warrior belt that kind of things that were in the US that then disappeared but way more advanced and it's like a dollar to play too.

477
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,879
Rym: and it the games like forever and it's just four on four people.

478
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,560
Rym: and There's like there's voice chat and radio channels.

479
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,559
Rym: So you can like chat with each other or like flip the broadcast and like chat with the enemy team.

480
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,000
Rym: And the controls were like it looked like I was inside of a Gundam.

481
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,152
Rym: I had all the controls of a Gundam and a million buttons and switches.

482
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:21,714
Scott: and all these are.

483
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:27,152
Rym: kids afford those pods Because there's tournaments in these things like every day as far as I can tell.

484
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:33,960
Emily: think if you get people in there constantly There's like a steady stream of people those people at school.

485
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,749
Rym: well Scott like imagine this imagine you and me.

486
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:44,698
Rym: imagine if there was an arcade that a good computers and There was just a Counter-Strike League like the bowling league and we just like go there every other week.

487
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:46,460
Rym: Yeah Counter-Strike.

488
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:57,220
Emily: I saw a thing where it was a soccer game, but it had like winning 11 Yeah, but it was like they had in one station for every player every player on the team.

489
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:09,889
Emily: So you'd actually be in the room and play soccer Virtually with the people around you which kind of sounds funny to somebody who actually likes to play soccer in real life Because it's like why not just go play soccer.

490
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:18,260
Emily: But the fact is you you have like these You know World Cup kind of matches virtually with all your friends sitting in the same room.

491
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,811
Scott: So the newest DDR that came out in November of 2011 November 16th.

492
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:26,150
Scott: So yesterday Yeah is dance dance revolution x3 verse second.

493
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:27,675
Rym: Okay x2 is what we were playing.

494
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:29,460
Scott: That was the set that was came out in July.

495
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:30,738
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

496
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:32,608
Rym: So note on Pirate Bay.

497
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:33,954
Rym: No one's even pirating that shit.

498
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:35,019
Emily: so sad.

499
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,323
Emily: DDR.

500
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,610
Emily: DDR is really fun.

501
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,360
Emily: It's a good way to keep fit in the winter.

502
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,740
Emily: I've I've awakened to its its terms.

503
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:49,029
Rym: So we went to like all the day when we started in Tokyo and then we went to Nagoya And then we went to Hakone and then Kyoto.

504
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,498
Emily: No, we went Hakone before.

505
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,922
Rym: Oh, yeah Yes It's.

506
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:59,219
Emily: we went to Tokyo and then went to Ora Wada and took the little train over to Hakone and then we went.

507
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:14,087
Emily: What one thing I must recommend and if you're gonna be in Japan for like a week or something or two weeks is Maybe and you're gonna be traveling around a lot and seeing a lot of different places Look into the rail pass because it

508
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,880
Rym: was like a Galaxy Express style like just you show it to people.

509
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,280
Rym: They're like, oh just step right through unlimited everything any any kind of train doesn't matter what any JR train.

510
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:28,489
Rym: So all this all the Tokyo like stuff and the Shinkansen But not the Nozomi line and the buses.

511
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:30,536
Emily: so you can go on highway buses once I can.

512
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:32,251
Scott: even you can just take the bullet Trains all you want.

513
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,778
Emily: Yeah, we did.

514
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,840
Rym: Yeah, there's the Nozomi the kodama and the Hikari.

515
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,905
Scott: So what are the other.

516
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:38,668
Scott: what is the difference?

517
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:45,395
Scott: the Nozomi is like the Krazy Express as far as I can tell Everywhere all the way to Japan.

518
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:49,651
Emily: Yes I believe it runs between.

519
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,175
Emily: it's the Tokaido sense.

520
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:54,565
Emily: So I think it runs between Tokyo and Kyoto.

521
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:59,057
Emily: if I'm not mistaken, it might run further south, but there are.

522
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:04,448
Emily: there are a couple different Shinkansen lines all kind of branching from Tokyo.

523
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,175
Rym: So our trains we have no excuse.

524
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:10,427
Rym: the the Shinkansen was Ridiculously fast.

525
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:14,424
Rym: It's cheaper than Amtrak tickets Like.

526
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,579
Scott: well people are using it constantly every day.

527
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:20,776
Rym: It runs all the time and you know what to put it in perspective.

528
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:29,966
Rym: if we had Shinkansen in America, which one to the rail gauge is narrower than our gauge, which is I think a big key to how it works well, it's because our main thing is.

529
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:35,804
Scott: I've read a whole thing about how our rails because they're also had to be used for freight and Because they all right.

530
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:36,989
Scott: So that's why they're watching.

531
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,414
Rym: consent takes less right-of-way.

532
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,789
Rym: It's faster on the outside It's quieter than Amtrak trains.

533
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:55,659
Rym: Yeah, despite being fast and If we had Shinkansen here With stops with many stops it would be About the same commuting from Albany to Manhattan every day than we had commuting from Beacon to Manhattan.

534
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,729
Rym: Yeah, Albany to Manhattan you could commute.

535
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,355
Rym: we wouldn't be that bad.

536
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:03,509
Emily: We were going what like 250.

537
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:14,679
Rym: yeah Fast as a plane the average speed you can get to Florida in two or three hours the average speed Including many stops along the way was like a hundred and forty eight miles an hour, which included, you know All the time it was stopped.

538
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,114
Scott: Flying to Florida is like an hour and a half.

539
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:17,900
Scott: ish, right?

540
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:42,975
Emily: Might be a little much but like you figure Japan is like, California And they used to run this commercial about how you could get anywhere and I believe it might have just been the main island But anywhere in the main island of Honshu in three hours because I remember eats me son Chican and it was like anywhere on the island three hours.

541
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,659
Scott: Did you go to the other island?

542
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,266
Scott: No, no You didn't go to the island that had.

543
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:51,313
Scott: I was among a diet with the animals on it.

544
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,179
Emily: No, that's actually that's in Okinawa.

545
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,603
Emily: That's like going to Hawaii.

546
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:55,326
Emily: Yeah.

547
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:59,700
Emily: Okay, but like if if I was gonna go to Okinawa, I'd plan a trip.

548
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,534
Rym: So that's like going to TiVo and be like, oh you were in New York.

549
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,740
Rym: Did you go see Mount Rushmore?

550
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,824
Emily: We're like you were in New York.

551
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:07,811
Emily: Did you go see Hawaiian Islands?

552
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,717
Emily: You know, it's like it's but it's.

553
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,504
Scott: it's the same country Right, so you entered.

554
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,533
Emily: it's not though the okay.

555
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:20,666
Emily: Well, you don't need to use your passport politically, but culturally and linguistically It's very similar to the u.s.

556
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:34,060
Emily: Is relationship with Hawaiian Islands, you know, it was a distinct culture Which was then taken into the Japanese Country like I forget exactly when it was like a few hundred.

557
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,650
Scott: But I figured like a high school can go on a day trip there.

558
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,537
Scott: then so can a terrorist right?

559
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:39,440
Scott: No, whatever.

560
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:40,840
Emily: They didn't go on a day trip.

561
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,735
Emily: I thought they did go on the school trip kind of like how I went to Hokkaido.

562
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:48,267
Scott: school trip isn't just one day Trip is.

563
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:52,348
Emily: usually you take it's like Might be four days to a week.

564
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:58,296
Emily: usually, you know, it's it's like an actual vacation so it's.

565
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,969
Emily: But anyway, I'd like to go to Okinawa someday.

566
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:08,968
Emily: I haven't I haven't really explored that far afield but In any case now

567
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:27,143
Rym: one trouble with the rail pass is that most of the subways in the cities are private like New York used to be which really sucks and half the bus is like there's Traps, I'll give you the bus stop Which takes like the normal pass but then like a Private bus that follows the same route will just show up and if you get on it You're fucked and you gotta pay

568
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:36,557
Emily: there in Kyoto because we bought like it's three dollars to get all you can ride city bus pass For a day in Kyoto and actually most of the cities have that.

569
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:37,280
Emily: like in Nagoya.

570
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,960
Emily: We pay seven dollars on the private subway in Nagoya and you can just ride around all you want.

571
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:49,859
Emily: But in Kyoto, we pay the three dollars for the pass and apparently they're a city bus and Kyoto bus.

572
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:54,234
Emily: so if you see it's a city bus and just Kyoto bus.

573
00:36:54,555 --> 00:37:00,296
Emily: and It was like oh no cuz we got on the one going to Gion.

574
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:04,032
Emily: and then I was like Notice the sign that was like you cannot use your pass.

575
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:07,003
Emily: and then the the conductor Said that.

576
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:11,720
Emily: and the funny thing is there are Japanese tourists who were confused the same way.

577
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:17,464
Emily: So it wasn't just us being dumb Americans like one old lady Day pass.

578
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,450
Emily: and he was like no day passes.

579
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,173
Emily: This is the private bus and it was like dang it Why you know is a bit frustrated.

580
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:25,555
Rym: Yes.

581
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,563
Scott: It's yeah Subway.

582
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,420
Scott: you would get trademarked in the US for doing that, right?

583
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,109
Scott: It's like that's.

584
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,619
Scott: it's like weird.

585
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:38,500
Scott: We have like these laws and that's the kind of thing they're meant to stop and we're like But we get mad when the laws are too strong, but in other places, they don't have the laws.

586
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,713
Rym: You're like, oh, yeah, we were solving a problem though Cabs in New York or in Japan at least in Tokyo.

587
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:46,420
Scott: We're really funny how much money they cut.

588
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,119
Rym: They were actually really cheap and you're not allowed to tip them like you don't tip.

589
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:51,305
Rym: Well, like why would like?

590
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:51,686
Rym: it's crazy.

591
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:52,850
Rym: It's like it's weird if you tip them.

592
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:59,374
Emily: I I know that in most Japan Businesses like restaurants you never tip which is great.

593
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,593
Scott: I'm so like Was it was their sales tags?

594
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:03,780
Rym: Yeah, but it was fine.

595
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:04,642
Rym: So here's the deal.

596
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:19,453
Rym: sales tax is 5% on everything not on everything and prices on everything are in multiples of five or ten And as a result you pretty much almost never get like 1 yen coins or any crap like that Like they round things to reasonable amounts.

597
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:22,956
Scott: Mm-hmm Any like electronic stores or anything?

598
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:27,018
Emily: We went to Big camera we went to big camera.

599
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,300
Rym: we did.

600
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:32,162
Scott: They have all kinds of stuff that you can't get here Really?

601
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:36,444
Scott: I mean, I thought they have like all kinds of small things that you can't buy here like laptops We can't get.

602
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,078
Rym: the boutique laptop market is really kind of dried up.

603
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:44,560
Emily: Yeah Yeah, I mean you you could see the cell phones like the fancy Japanese cell phone.

604
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,273
Scott: But I mean are they really or anything better than like our smartphones now?

605
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:48,660
Scott: I think we've caught up pretty much.

606
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,066
Emily: I mean the smartphone thing.

607
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:53,000
Scott: it's interesting because I mean except you can watch TV on their phones.

608
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:57,246
Emily: Well, the traditional Japanese cell phone are still very popular.

609
00:38:57,306 --> 00:39:05,147
Emily: but smartphones like iPhone is super big like it's a very very coveted Cellphone, why don't everything just go get one?

610
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:05,649
Scott: It's not that much.

611
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,540
Emily: a lot of people do, you know a lot of but it's very expensive.

612
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,372
Scott: So a lot of people everything did it cost more than it cost here?

613
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:11,613
Scott: Yes.

614
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:12,075
Scott: Yes.

615
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,340
Scott: How much is an iPhone in Japan?

616
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,064
Rym: There's the trouble to.

617
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:18,820
Rym: the exchange rate was pretty much as far against us as it could have possibly been.

618
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:25,345
Emily: I used to remember when it was like one penny to one yen about like one night in Kyoto because you know No one takes credit cards really.

619
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:30,847
Rym: so we were kind of low on money like we had like 7,000 yen left Which is you know, that's like 70 bucks.

620
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,516
Rym: give or take little eat less because the exchange rate.

621
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:45,186
Rym: but we were in Gion The river so basically every place was too fancy and we could not afford to eat $700 with $70.

622
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:47,316
Scott: two people can't eat for seven.

623
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:48,080
Rym: where we were.

624
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:49,723
Emily: Here's the thing.

625
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,368
Emily: It was like the Park Avenue.

626
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:52,572
Emily: It was the fancy place.

627
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,820
Emily: We're all like you go to the fancy.

628
00:39:55,023 --> 00:40:00,640
Rym: You couldn't go to be Walked way back to our real count and there was a little cheaper place.

629
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,651
Emily: We didn't eat combini bento very much or anything like.

630
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,542
Rym: I basically ate my way across Japan eating the best goddamn food That was.

631
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:14,737
Emily: that was mostly thanks to our family.

632
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:17,673
Emily: Oh my Notice awesome people.

633
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:18,800

Emily: just the the extended family.

636
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,268
Emily: It was actually cool cuz it was Hiro Takei.

637
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:30,359
Rym: He's like my five-year-old nephew and he was playing Pokemon on his DS.

638
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,078
Rym: I was playing Advance Wars in my DS.

639
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:38,984
Rym: All of them were like like all the kids were like, oh my god He has a DS.

00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:39,728
Rym: when I had it out.

00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,660
Emily: and he's like I can show you.

644
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,654
Emily: And then he's like, oh my god, it's all in English.

645
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:51,379
Emily: What am I gonna do?

646
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:07,175
Emily: but it was really cool cuz since it was the birthday everybody came over to grandparents house and So I got to see my host sister and host brother and who are who are married and living In their own houses and I got to see all

Scott: that to each other.

648
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:21,120
Emily: When when I was living there Kaori nay-san was still a single and living at home, but she recently got married and she has two kids.

649
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:22,565
Emily: They're both very cute.

650
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:23,448
Rym: But mr.

Rym: Noted that they took us out to his like his favorite sushi place.

652
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:28,900
Rym: That was the best sushi I've ever had in my life.

653
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:36,009
Scott: I've never had anything because where the fish are if you let the fish are you would taste good and of course Oh, it was all super good.

654
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,652
Scott: Unless you're him.

655
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:37,937
Scott: You want to eat some East River sushi?

656
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:38,700

Emily: We had raw shrimp raw shrimp in the u.s.

00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:44,860
Emily: I would be too scared.

659
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,708
Scott: Where would you even get a raw shrimp in the u.s.

660
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,034
Emily: That that was maybe.

661
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:52,940

662
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:57,386
Scott: I'm not gonna eat it A few years ago.

663
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:02,328
Rym: raw shrimp is a food Entirely distinct from cooked shrimp.

664
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:09,500
Rym: It is that what I ate that day Is probably between the shellfish and the shrimp the most delicious.

665
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:12,680
Scott: Are you sure they weren't cheating where they perhaps injecting it secretly?

666
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,160
Scott: So you think it was raw but really it was just butter shaped like shrimp.

667
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:26,800
Scott: Did they feed the Shrimps that were like that were living in a tank or they would dump sugar in the tank for the shrimps to eat?

668
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,623
Emily: That's silly.

669
00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:29,129
Scott: No, so that would work.

670
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:31,600
Rym: It was weird though cuz it was like gray and I was uncooked.

671
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:32,482
Rym: It was those.

00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,491

706
00:44:53,961 --> 00:45:01,132
Emily: it's like you're taking to a private room and you sit on the floor and There's like wilderness and koi outside and the.

707
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:09,869
Rym: we should make a restaurant like that on a roof and the servers come to the door in the traditional way like they open the door and they're like sitting in front of the door and Then they bring the food in and it was.

708
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:12,242
Rym: that was a Teva I learned.

709
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:17,960

00:45:59,455 --> 00:46:00,339
Rym: we went to this.

726
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:02,831
Rym: It was like amusement park, but basically it was sets.

727
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,640
Scott: Did they have all Japanese movies?

728
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,269

00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:11,039
Scott: you crowd her it

733
00:46:13,423 --> 00:46:15,758
Emily: Extra to get into the Power Rangers stuff in the haunted

734
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:16,000
Rym: house.

735
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,160
Rym: The best part was the sets like you've now if I watch old like Japanese samurai movies like these sets were all used.

736
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:24,709
Emily: Yeah, only Kyoto Studios.

737
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:30,610
Rym: It was like toy, but they made a lot of movies Like there's this one bridge and there's all this.

738
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,120
Rym: like the text was like this bridge is in every goddamn movie.

739
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,580
Scott: Yeah, we only built one bridge because it's hard to make bridge.

740
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:48,040
Rym: Basically, the sign was like we changed the signs and like a little bit of the landscaping around it and it's a different bridge and we And they always set the scene by changing the name of the town on the sign on the bridge.

741
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:48,558
Emily: Yeah

742
00:46:49,202 --> 00:47:02,719
Rym: But the best part of all of that was there was a building that had these sets for ninjas and all it was Was it was a part that looked like the rafters above a room and then right under that was the part that looked like the rafters Under the floor in a room.

743
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:14,100
Emily: so you'd anytime they had to shoot a scene of a ninja like being above the eaves and listening in or being below the Listening and they just had that one room in the building that they'd they'd shoot.

744
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,206
Emily: Yeah, so there were.

745
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:19,700
Emily: there were a bunch of things from different period dramas and did I get key?

746
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:20,883
Emily: And so that was.

747
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:21,988
Emily: that was really cool.

748
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,700
Rym: There's a really cool exhibit in like the museum part of it, too.

749
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,219
Rym: It was like famous Japanese directors and a collection of their personal effects that were kind of like relevant to there.

750
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:38,587
Rym: I love that cuz actually even though I'm like a pair of binoculars and a teacup and a canteen and Beret or whatever.

751
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:39,914
Emily: No, I'm like really into film.

752
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:41,685
Scott: It's probably just all Japanese film directors.

753
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,610
Emily: there were a lot of.

754
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,635
Scott: Here's everyone's beret.

755
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:49,788
Scott: Here's their backup beret.

756
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:57,896
Emily: It was cool cuz it was like from the 19 Like 1920s and stuff onwards a pre-war really early stuff.

757
00:47:58,037 --> 00:47:58,237
Emily: It was.

758
00:47:58,398 --> 00:47:59,080
Emily: it was pretty neat.

759
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,791
Emily: But speaking of museums, how do you like the Ghibli Museum?

760
00:48:02,991 --> 00:48:13,815
Rym: Yeah, the Ghibli Museum is like wickedly awesome People like fight to get tickets or whatever, you know, it was way crowded You know, basically it's like it looks like Ghibli movies like the whole thing like.

761
00:48:13,835 --> 00:48:24,176
Rym: there's there's the the Lop to Robot like on the roof kind of looking at a garden like a wildly growing garden on the roof And there's all these weird little like like hidey holes like you'd like.

762
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,060
Rym: there's like you're walking.

763
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:26,865
Rym: Yeah, you could.

764
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:30,700
Rym: we did even though you even though you're big like you go in and there's a little spiral staircase.

765
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,624
Rym: It's like really tiny.

766
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,648
Rym: you like squeeze into it.

767
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:34,898
Rym: It goes up like three stars, but it's meant for Japanese people.

768
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,580
Emily: Yeah It's meant for kids.

769
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:37,922
Emily: It's the.

770
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:39,891
Emily: how do you fit out for kids?

771
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:46,504
Rym: because we crouched in and just kind of Witched our way up and then we got to a little tunnel and it took us across and then we're like up in another part of the museum.

772
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:52,788
Emily: it's it's like a museum where Actually being in the building itself is fun.

773
00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:12,005
Emily: Like if you were a little kid, it's a very adventureful building You know, you're like popping out of doorways and being like, oh there there it is And just going around through like you have to crouch down to get into some doorways and it's it's really neat It's very Very good design.

774
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:14,595
Scott: They also show the fire marshal probably wouldn't let it exist.

775
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:20,619
Rym: Oh, so I'll say this You any US fire marshal if you ever go to Japan, you will have a heart attack.

776
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:31,180
Rym: Like we were on a bus right a bus to go back from the fancy restaurant and the bus had little things on the seats Like there was a aisle up the middle and sets of two seats on either side like a normal bus to take people somewhere.

777
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:34,880
Rym: And there was these things like and I couldn't figure out what they are and I look at them.

778
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,786
Rym: I realize they were pads.

779
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:43,159
Rym: you could flip them up and put them across the aisle to make a fifth seat blocking the aisle All the way up the bus.

780
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,893
Rym: Yeah And there's stuff like that everywhere in Japan like they did and I feel like.

781
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:53,872
Rym: it's probably not any more Dangerous to be like that in Japan because I it's people are tiny.

782
00:49:54,173 --> 00:50:02,480
Rym: No because people seem more Polite and I feel like if there was an announcement like you evacuate the theater people would just walk out calmly.

783
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:05,020
Emily: People are in general pretty good about that.

784
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,272
Emily: I mean you look at the footage from after the earthquake and people.

785
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:20,400
Emily: I think it's like they have a good sense of Other people of society and so they're like paying attention and not causing trouble or budging in line or anything like that.

786
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,506
Emily: It's like okay.

787
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:22,752
Emily: This is what we have to do.

788
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,240
Emily: We'll be very orderly about it.

789
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:25,349
Rym: There's a fire.

790
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:36,524
Emily: everybody's gonna be George Costanza yeah, but Anyway, we got to see like one of the short films that they that they run only in the museum There was one about.

791
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:38,312
Emily: it was about catching a whale.

792
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,899
Rym: the whale was totally troll.

793
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:49,370
Scott: face the whales like Like had a big eyeball and was sort of like yeah, if he'd roll it up like yeah Yeah, I know the style.

794
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,100
Scott: I know they've done that in a lot of Ghibli movies.

795
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:52,972
Emily: Do the eyeball roll.

796
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,174
Emily: it was it was.

797
00:50:54,195 --> 00:51:02,580
Rym: oh so that the one of the neatest things in the museum Is that this like room of animation and they're like zoetrops and all the different like old anime?

798
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,469
Rym: They had a 3d zoetrope with models And then a stroke so it's spinning.

799
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:09,071
Rym: you're like what's this?

800
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:13,880
Rym: and the strobe light comes on and it's a three-dimensional Like stop-motion animation just happening in front of you.

801
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:22,394
Emily: Yeah it looks like a ton of dolls just dancing and it's got like little Totoro's jumping up and down and Jumping rope and stuff like that.

802
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:23,460
Emily: Oh, it's so cool.

803
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:28,780
Emily: But actually my favorite room was the how animation is made room whether you already know there.

804
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,050
Emily: No, but it's like a fictional animation studio.

805
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,173
Rym: It was to a dream.

806
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,640
Rym: It was to animation what the matrix is to hacking.

807
00:51:36,061 --> 00:51:36,463
Scott: Oh, okay.

808
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:36,804
Emily: Yeah.

809
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:37,707
Emily: Well, it was.

810
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:45,715
Emily: it was very sweet and old-fashioned from a bygone era Big wooden desks and stuff like that like on the desk.

811
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:47,100
Rym: It shows like an animator station.

812
00:51:47,120 --> 00:52:00,763
Rym: There's like paper everywhere and likes drawings and drawings and notes and notes and reference models and books strewn everywhere And then a pot full of an infinite number of cigarette butts And a lot of the signs were were more Truthful, it wasn't like.

813
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:03,671
Emily: animation is perfect and wonderful job forever.

814
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:15,179
Emily: One of them in English said something like this is really tedious yeah, and I I just really liked reading about it and you know, I could have spent a lot more time in there But it was pretty crowded.

815
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:26,597
Emily: Tezuka Museum We didn't get time Actually, it was like also the International Manga Museum in Kyoto, which we which we also missed out on.

816
00:52:26,697 --> 00:52:34,127
Scott: but it was like You can't even come to New York and see all the museum City not a whole country.

817
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,436
Rym: we went to multiple major cities and we were in Nagoya.

818
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,546
Rym: we went to the university We out there.

819
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:40,274
Rym: I wanted to see some jazz, you know where we went.

820
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:47,580
Rym: blue note The blue note has a sister blue note the only other one in Nagoya because Nagoya is a huge jazz scene.

821
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:52,297
Scott: Like imagine if New York Chicago and LA were in the same state.

822
00:52:52,578 --> 00:53:00,440
Rym: Yeah but the thing is in New York a lot of the jazz musicians that play around here are from Nagoya come from Nagoya.

823
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:06,745
Emily: Yeah, I thought that was really cool and they have kind of almost like a musician exchange You know with the blue notes.

824
00:53:06,845 --> 00:53:10,437
Rym: and the coolest thing was there was no smoking in the blue note.

825
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:10,818
Rym: Yeah.

826
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:11,480
Emily: Oh my gosh.

827
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,906
Emily: But I went.

828
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:15,960
Emily: I actually cuz Rym was like he really wanted to see a show.

829
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:19,180
Emily: And so at first we were like, maybe we can go see Takarazuka.

830
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,044
Emily: I can't see that and it was like totally sold out and it was really to try to do.

831
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,840
Emily: But when we went to Nagoya Rym was like, how about some jazz club?

832
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,144
Emily: And and so I went.

833
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:34,676
Emily: we were at oasis 21 this big park in the in the city.

834
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:35,739
Emily: It's amazing all.

835
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:45,187
Emily: and I went to the JTB office in the mall and I was like, I'm uh, I'm here, you know on Recommendations of the US branch of JTB.

836
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:53,189
Emily: I was wondering if you could give me any information about jazz clubs in In Nagoya and the lady was super helpful.

837
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:56,159
Emily: She was like, oh, yeah, the blue note is just a few blocks.

838
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,023
Emily: that way I'm like, huh?

839
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:08,508
Emily: That's funny because the blue notes the one we go to in New York and So that actually that was a really good performance and it was kind of laid-back which was nice You know, it was at least for me.

840
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:10,274
Emily: The trip was kind of intense.

841
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:19,300
Emily: Like I'm so used to To living in Japan where I do cool stuff, but it was like spread out and most of it was just like routine daily life.

842
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:25,354
Rym: I was filled with Illimitable indomitable energy, but I think it was partly because you didn't have to do anything or talk.

843
00:54:25,414 --> 00:54:28,884
Rym: There's also nothing to drink Except tea.

844
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:29,967
Emily: That's true.

845
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:33,898
Scott: So I was didn't get like all the weird things like coffee to hit.

846
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:34,540
Scott: can they heat this?

847
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:36,339
Rym: I did I got all that stuff.

848
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:40,756
Rym: But I basically was drinking caffeinated beverages all the time constantly while I was awake.

849
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:41,760
Emily: and then you drink booze.

850
00:54:45,147 --> 00:54:49,211
Rym: They don't have just like water Like if you go to a restaurant, but usually they don't.

851
00:54:49,272 --> 00:54:54,579
Rym: they don't just water they give you tea And as far as I can tell pretty much everyone just orders a beer.

852
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:56,769
Rym: Like beer is cuz.

853
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:02,131
Emily: we ate a lot of the times when we were by ourselves We'd eat at like Izakaya, which is like the neighborhood pub.

854
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:04,580
Scott: Yeah, you know, no, you're gonna get beer there.

855
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,262
Emily: Yeah, it's.

856
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,991
Emily: it's very also like a notice like like in a place.

857
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:15,920
Rym: beer with dinner is just kind of a much more Typical thing and I really really understand now why Japan seems so big on very light beers.

858
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:23,272
Rym: yeah Guinness doesn't go well with Japanese food, but Like a Karen or something really goes well with like a kitsune.

859
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:27,568
Rym: Yeah, they're not drinking, you know, the manly beer I had to keep stay with on Scott.

860
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:29,396
Rym: Let me tell you they're pretty good.

861
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,751
Rym: Yeah They were pretty damn good.

862
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:36,690
Emily: I haven't had one in a while But anyway, let's see what other cool stuff we did.

863
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:46,671
Emily: we do I don't we don't want to go on too long or anything but So well, we went to onsen And we saw Mount Fuji from the show.

864
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:47,414
Scott: how hot was it?

865
00:55:47,475 --> 00:55:48,880
Scott: was it like it was normal?

866
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:49,964
Emily: We didn't go in.

867
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:51,689
Scott: the was hotter than the bathroom.

868
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,729
Emily: It wasn't a Rotenborough with an actual natural No, the water was hot spring, you know.

869
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,420
Emily: So they pumped up the water from an underground aquifer and I'm assuming probably mixed it with tap water.

870
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:08,940
Emily: But you could tell it was hot spring water because of all the mineral deposits.

871
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,200
Rym: And I actually have pictures from the cable car through the mountains the volcano.

872
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:19,500
Emily: We went on a ropeway over a volcano while we were there too.

873
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,740
Rym: We went on there's like this touristy pirate boat that takes you through the lake in Hakone like our pirates.

874
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:30,080
Rym: But it's silly like there's a silly statue of Nelson and there's a pirate statue on it.

875
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:36,780
Emily: He's like he's pointing a pistol and everybody else points like poses like he's shooting them or something like that.

876
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:46,710
Rym: But the funny thing is we're standing up in like the crow's nest area like the like the little like observation deck thing they had for people to stand on and the pirates like hanging off the ledge up There and his butt's just there.

877
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,978
Rym: I didn't really think much of it.

878
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:58,408
Rym: Every little kid who walked up there Walked up looked at the butt went straight for it and like shoved a sword into it poked at it Put their face on it.

879
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,640
Rym: I got a really good picture of it.

880
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:16,549
Scott: It's easy for people to be child brothers you show them but It's easy to become a comedian.

881
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,099
Rym: just show someone a. but that's right.

882
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:19,996
Rym: The adults weren't like stop it.

883
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:27,337
Emily: they were like The kids just like they were so single-minded about it as soon as they saw the pirate.

884
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,743
Emily: it wasn't like hey It's a pirate.

885
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,171
Emily: and then they were like looking at the pirate.

886
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:34,905
Emily: It was just like hey, it's a. but So we.

887
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:37,980
Emily: so we did all the the Hakone sightseeing stuff.

888
00:57:38,100 --> 00:58:00,879
Emily: but yeah onsen was really really nice and apparently in the new Eva movies, there's like Scenes in Hakone or something because in the in the New type magazine there was this whole thing about like oh This part of Hakone was in this scene and stuff like that and they also were selling as souvenirs Kaji's watermelon Manju.

1166
01:14:06,832 --> 01:14:25,370
Emily: I consider them part of my family and so I was good to see them, but it was also just good to be back and My whole thing was I was a little stressed out because I was like How do I convey to Rym what it's like to be in a place and show him all these different facets of this country?

1167
01:14:25,472 --> 01:14:26,287
Emily: I love so much.

1168
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:31,290
Emily: But actually I think for a couple of weeks we did a pretty good job.

1169
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:38,265
Emily: We saw a lot of traditional stuff but we also saw a lot of modern stuff and we went nerdy stuff and we went normal stuff.

01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:42,723
Scott: and you know it What's in the regular movie theater?

1171
01:14:43,306 --> 01:14:44,210

01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,399
Emily: There was one about like my husband is depressed.

01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:49,945
Emily: There was one about one about a police dog.

1175
01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:00,450
Emily: I'm see that but I kind of want to see it too because if it's got like canine units in it I'm like I was in book off the other day.

1176
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,215
Scott: They have all the base.

1177
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:03,709
Scott: I'd shake down DVDs, but I don't think they have English on them.

1178
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:11,481
Emily: Ah, you could always look and see even had like the TV boxes like all the deeply DVDs have English subtitles But they had everything.

1179
01:15:11,785 --> 01:15:12,250
Emily: that's cool.

1180
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:16,103
Emily: But yeah, it was pretty good and I didn't even make Rym.

1181
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:17,650
Emily: go into too many bookstores.

1182
01:15:20,839 --> 01:15:21,649
Scott: We have Japanese book.

1183
01:15:23,873 --> 01:15:25,441

1184
01:15:25,742 --> 01:15:27,390
Emily: well one the books are a lot cheaper.

1185
01:15:29,132 --> 01:15:31,098
Scott: Yeah, you go like the Muji store in the Uniqlo.

1186
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:31,841
Emily: there we looked at.

1187
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:46,875
Emily: actually we did actually go in the Muji store cuz there's one right near like Muji Stuff that we don't have here And washing machines and stuff like like washing machines and It's okay tiny it's.

1188
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:58,837
