1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,549
Rym: It's Thursday March 1st 2018.

2
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,158
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights' tonight.

3
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:18,999
Rym: camp of the summer and band variety.

4
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:21,599
Scott: Isn't band camp also in the Sun?

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,325
Rym: Yeah, but band camp.

6
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,918
Rym: would you say that summer camp and band camp aren't the same thing?

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,331
Scott: Not only they have many similarities very few though.

8
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,599
Rym: And also they have separate Wikipedia pages.

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,958
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:41,595
Rym: so as you know, cuz I talk about it a lot one of my main hobbies is skiing and The ski season also known is almost dying.

11
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:41,977
Rym: Yeah.

12
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:51,023
Rym: Yeah, Scott I still posit to you that what actually causes more serious injuries and deaths skiing or Biking.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,550
Scott: there's a lot more biking going on.

14
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:56,767
Rym: Oh, no, I mean I'm saying even per capita Skings.

15
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:04,239
Scott: pretty safe If you had everyone in the world ski and then everyone in the world bike With equivalent levels of skill.

16
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,760
Rym: I mean skiing is a high-skill thing.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,053
Rym: Most people who do it become reasonably skilled or they don't do it like.

18
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,820
Scott: how much biking goes on around the world?

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,074
Rym: Yes, how many people die biking in New York City on a annual basis?

20
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:15,596
Scott: less than 20?

21
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:19,553
Rym: Yeah Yeah, how many people die skiing at Hunter Mountain on an annual basis?

22
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:20,176
Scott: one mountain?

23
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:23,271
Rym: Yeah That mountains where all the New Yorkers go.

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,318
Rym: There's a ton of people there.

25
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:29,357
Rym: So as best I can tell there have been I think four deaths there in the last several years.

26
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:33,028
Scott: That's a lot For such a small number of people.

27
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:40,679
Rym: but compared to how many runs they do and also so I looked into those I was looking up some stats today for research for Emily.

28
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:50,880
Rym: of those four deaths in the last several years One of them was the lady who just fell off the ski lift like basically just fell off a building to the ground.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,426
Scott: Don't go ski lifts are dangerous.

30
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:52,948
Scott: Don't get on them.

31
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,991
Rym: No, they're not dangerous.

32
00:01:54,092 --> 00:02:05,388
Rym: It's actually a mystery how she fell off Because you you can't fall off a ski lift unless you want to fall off a ski lift or you make a Really really ridiculous and terrible mistake.

33
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:11,194
Scott: a lot of them seem really precarious except for the kind where it's like just a sky car Where there's like a ball that's called a gondola.

34
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:18,620
Scott: Yeah Those are safe, but the ones that just like a bench that comes up behind you they could just like knock you over.

35
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,368
Rym: Well, it knocks you over.

36
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:21,234
Rym: that's not gonna kill you.

37
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,020
Rym: It's just funny.

38
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:33,495
Scott: You could also get on to it and then just like lean forward and fall off There's a bar that comes down in front of you just like in a roller coaster Howdy, but at the bar like it's it's like that doesn't seem of some moving.

39
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:34,780
Rym: you reach up and you pull the bar.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,527
Scott: It's not hard a moving bench.

41
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,073
Rym: That doesn't sound all right.

42
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:39,438
Rym: Here's the here's Rym.

43
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,654
Rym: skiing aside You want to talk about the things that are dangerous and skiing that are.

44
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:43,680
Scott: and that thing?

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,859
Scott: I'm pointing out is that the lift is the least dangerous thing there and it's still a death trap.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,273
Scott: The least dangerous part is still a death trap.

47
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,300
Scott: people are feeling it.

48
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:57,035
Rym: But yet there are three other kinds of things that will take you up the mountain tree.

49
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:58,840
Scott: Oh a rope that moves.

50
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:00,379
Rym: Yeah, they're moving rope.

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:10,192
Rym: The funniest thing is the things I'm about to describe to you tend to only be used on beginner hills yet They are also the most dangerous and hardest to use.

52
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:11,537
Scott: Yeah, the moving rope.

53
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,440
Rym: It's called a toe rope.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,180
Rym: It's literally just a rope that's just spinning around spinning at high speed.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,108
Scott: It's like two pulleys and a rope.

56
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,373
Rym: and here's how it works.

57
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:25,000
Rym: You grab the rope and hold the rope And it just goes through your hands and you don't move at all and it burns your hand burns your hand.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,820
Rym: You have to grab it real tight and then you try to hold on to a real tight.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,306
Scott: Does it have knots in it to help you?

60
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,772
Scott: No, I thought has knots.

61
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:31,515
Scott: No, fuck you.

62
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:32,600
Rym: The toe rope sucks.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,050
Rym: Okay worse than the toe rope is something called a magic carpet.

64
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,035
Rym: What it's a conveyor belt.

65
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:41,028
Rym: ski onto it and just And you're just.

66
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,959
Scott: that seems like it'll just kill you when you fall down.

67
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,450
Scott: Well because those and you'll bump into everyone behind you.

68
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:47,419
Rym: so those are only used in two circumstances.

69
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,063
Rym: one You're all.

70
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:56,534
Rym: you're basically on this can uphill conveyor belt It seems like be okay for going flat but going up they go up but they go up like The bunny hill that kids learn to ski on.

71
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:57,358
Rym: that's only like 30 feet.

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,057
Scott: I guess you have to face sideways that you get them straight up.

73
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,706
Scott: Wouldn't you start sliding backwards?

74
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:03,749
Rym: No, it's like rubber.

75
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,813
Rym: Okay.

76
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,736
Rym: He's not gonna slide on.

77
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:06,980
Scott: that got snow on it.

78
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,746
Rym: No, it's doesn't this snow.

79
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,717
Rym: No, it's not always snowing 24/7 in the mountain.

80
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,320
Scott: Well, I guess you can't use it when it is snowing.

81
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:18,634
Rym: You can cuz it's moving and the snow will melt on it cuz it slippery piece of rubber is wet.

82
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,339
Rym: skis don't move.

83
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:34,009
Rym: the reason skis move on snow is Because they have a special material on the bottom filled with wax and the pressure of it on the snow actually melts this very thin Layer of water due to pressure and that's what allows you to ski.

84
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,998
Rym: if you can't make that happen your ski just sits there.

85
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:43,458
Rym: Mm-hmm anyway The magic carpet is a nightmare machine that traumatizes children.

86
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:46,148
Scott: Yes Obviously, I don't even need to see it to know.

87
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,800
Rym: there is a hybrid thing where there'll be a magic carpet with a rope.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,159
Rym: No, that leads to a faster magic carpet.

89
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:58,895
Rym: That magic carpet is moving at the same speed as a ski lift.

90
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:06,134
Scott: that doesn't slow down And it basically just swings in Slow magic carpet because you can't possibly start moving on.

91
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:08,467
Rym: the fast one takes you to a fast Switch.

92
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,694
Rym: it just pushes you on to a fast one And then the fast one is moving at the same speed of a ski lift chair.

93
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,668
Scott: that doesn't slow down not going anywhere near That.

94
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:21,600
Scott: yeah Those fucking suck as a ski and I put a rope next to it like an escalator has a handle that moves next to it.

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,280
Rym: Cuz that'll people will just mess that it's not moving at the same speed as the carpet.

96
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,479
Rym: But there's something else called a t-bar.

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,829
Rym: Imagine like a truck flying trapeze.

98
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,120
Rym: You just got a fucking grab and hold on to for dear life.

99
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,525
Scott: You mean you mean a death draft?

100
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,853
Rym: Yeah, those things are the worst.

101
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,600
Scott: grab on to get to the top let go.

102
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:47,935
Rym: Last time used a tee up toe rope was a pine knob in Michigan when I was a kid and last time I used a T-bar was once at Loon Mountain.

103
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:48,497
Scott: I can't.

104
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:52,015
Scott: it can't be legal Has to be phased out right as Bretton wood.

105
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:52,659
Rym: No, they exist.

106
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:59,240
Rym: They exist for morons in places that I don't want to go anyway.

107
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,756
Rym: The ski season just ended abruptly because it got like it's like 60 degrees right now here.

108
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,438
Scott: It's like 50 something.

109
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,197
Rym: It's 57 according to my phone.

110
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:08,600
Scott: It's cold.

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,027
Rym: 57 is not cold.

112
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:11,529
Scott: It's 54.

113
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,940
Scott: You're just old and it's cold.

114
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:20,160
Rym: It got real warm like crazy warm and there's a crazy warm for the for February.

115
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,829
Scott: I guess it's like it's slightly less cold.

116
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,678
Rym: It was warmer than this like two weeks ago.

117
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:26,320
Rym: That was weird.

118
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,086
Scott: It's one coat less cold.

119
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:29,612
Scott: It's still need a coat and head.

120
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:31,900
Rym: Ah someone in the chat pointed out the J bar.

121
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:33,940
Rym: I even fucking talking J bar.

122
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:43,000
Rym: There are other bars That are even worse than the T bar bar is basically mechanism to hurt people who think they want to ski.

123
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,080
Rym: I feel like there's a trap to reduce the number of people skiing.

124
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:48,089
Scott: You should be better, you know how to stay safe.

125
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,180
Scott: be a person like me who knows they don't want to ski.

126
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:56,960
Rym: So I went on that ski trip in New Hampshire and then suddenly it was late spring and everything melted like everywhere in the Northeast.

127
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,689
Rym: So I thought my ski season was over.

128
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:09,445
Rym: I got a notification Because there's this giant storm bearing down on the East Coast right now in New York and Massachusetts is gonna be torrential rain Up at hunter mountain.

129
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,892
Rym: It's gonna be like two feet of snow.

130
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:12,380
Rym: So I'm skiing on Saturday.

131
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:14,751
Rym: I'm getting like one more day on real snow.

132
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:15,554
Rym: It's gonna be amazing.

133
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:16,297
Rym: Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,145
Rym: So yeah, that's what I got.

135
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,576
Rym: That was my opening bit because you forgot what yours was.

136
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:23,107
Rym: I remembered Oh, is it something good?

137
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:24,232
Rym: No, no.

138
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:24,634
Rym: Okay.

139
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:25,417
Rym: Let's get right to the news.

140
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:25,879
Rym: What do you got?

141
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:27,623
Scott: What was my news?

142
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:43,993
Scott: Oh, so it's not super newsy and actually it's this great article that is somehow been locked by a password but I got an archived version of it and this person did a statistical sampling of Apple map versus Google map versus ways to figure out which one is the best.

143
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:52,480
Scott: it wasn't like some enormous enormous Sample covering a large amount of terrain and a large amount of uses, but it was pretty significantly.

144
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,130
Scott: You know, I mean not.

145
00:07:54,271 --> 00:08:07,995
Scott: maybe not statistically significant But it's like one person did all their trips switching up between the three and measuring them all based on various things And basically the conclusion they came to matches up with my anecdotal experience.

146
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,319
Scott: So I'm inclined to believe it.

147
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:17,072
Scott: And the the summer detail dr is if you want to get to do your destination most quickly use Google Maps.

148
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:23,153
Scott: if you want an accurate prediction from your Navigation app to help you arrive on time use Apple map.

149
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:32,159
Scott: and if thinking you'll get to your destination Quickly helps to ease your commuter anxiety use Waze which tells you you're gonna get there sooner than you're actually gonna get.

150
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,349
Rym: that Does Waze even still exist?

151
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,360
Rym: cuz isn't that data just in Google Maps now, right?

152
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,082
Scott: So I don't think so.

153
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:42,469
Scott: a lot of people I know are like oh my god Waze is so much better because it gives you This info about things.

154
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,839
Rym: but Google gives me the same info.

155
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:56,800
Scott: Well, no, it gives you info about additional things like it'll tell you if there's a speed trap or about that I'm saying is like it gives you this this extra detailed info about stuff that is kind of not necessary.

156
00:08:56,921 --> 00:09:00,399
Scott: Google just constantly tells you which way to go and that's all you need to know.

157
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,787
Rym: Well, no But Google also tells you some of the ways in for they included was things like it gives you the ETA when you'll arrive Based on current conditions on your entire route.

158
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:17,200
Rym: it warns you about issues and whenever there is an alternate route It shows it and gives you the option to switching to it and tells you what it'll what it'll do to your ETA.

159
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:22,750
Rym: Yep, and I have found cuz I'm I'm basically the driver for the crew when we go to places.

160
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:35,787
Rym: now because I rent the car cuz it's none of us own cars live in the city and I have found that over the last couple years Google directions at least have been like Shockingly accurate down to the minute.

161
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:47,915
Rym: I'll arrive at a place and every time they tell me to go away that my Knowledge of driving in New York City tells me is wrong Like for example heading north like going up to Albany or something very often.

162
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:52,852
Rym: It'll say yeah go into Manhattan Take go across Manhattan to New Jersey and then go north.

163
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,457
Rym: I used to balk at that.

164
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:57,480
Rym: now I just trust it and it has never steered me wrong.

165
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,848
Scott: Whatever weird road Google Maps says to go on.

166
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:06,744
Scott: I just do it without question and it's always right and it always gets me where I need to go as much as my Every time that happens.

167
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:19,428
Scott: I remember the days of the mid-2000s when we all fix we would use MapQuest and print it out Because we didn't have some smartphones and one of us if I was driving Scott was sitting next to me Literally like telling me where to go.

168
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:22,760
Scott: Google Maps came out and it wasn't as good as MapQuest.

169
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:24,488
Scott: It was garbage for directions.

170
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:31,032
Scott: Yeah, and we kept using MapQuest until eventually Google Maps became good sometime around like the iPhone time.

171
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:33,460
Scott: I think the smartphones really gave them the data they needed.

172
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,248
Rym: Yeah to not suck cuz you guys you don't.

173
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:42,087
Rym: you don't understand if you're young what it was like to drive Like driving to Otakon.

174
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:46,902
Scott: I mean there was MapQuest, you know 2000s.

175
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:50,197
Scott: imagine trying to drive somewhere that you've never been before.

176
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:57,007
Scott: and like 1988 you go to AAA Triptych which was basically manual.

177
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,237
Scott: MapQuest printed out a custom map just for you.

178
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:00,818
Scott: It was a member.

179
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:09,265
Scott: It was a little book of paper and you would flip it page by page and you would highlight where you've been so far Based on you.

180
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,311
Scott: look at this the strip.

181
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:19,180
Scott: you look outside you see what road you just passed You know how far to highlight and you turn the page as you go And once you finish the whole book and you've highlighted the whole road you've reached your destination.

182
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:24,928
Rym: So to give you an example of what this was like when Scott and I and many of our friends You drive to like Otakon.

183
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,880
Scott: The book was a narrow vertical book.

184
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:34,984
Scott: If you went off course at all You needed to plot a big map and the road atlas that you kept in your car in case you fucked up Where the fuck you were.

185
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:39,880
Scott: or ask for directions from a human being or buy a map at a gas station.

186
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:40,686
Rym: I have so many.

187
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:47,458
Rym: we could probably do a Thursday show on road trips Just like I remember situations where I'd be driving and I'm like Scott we're gonna run out of gas in like 20 miles.

188
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:59,969
Rym: The simple question of is there a way to get gas before we run out of gas Was an existential question.

189
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,780
Rym: and then the follow-up question of we got gas.

190
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,892
Rym: Where the fuck are we and how do we get back on the freeway?

191
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,298
Rym: That'll take us to Baltimore.

192
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:12,655
Rym: Mm-hmm I wrote my god the idea that I were on the way home from Baltimore.

193
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:19,049
Rym: Yeah that though Yeah That was the one where I turned off the AC because I was worried we're gonna run out of gas And it was on e.

194
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,780
Scott: we got off to go to a gas station.

195
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,805
Rym: It was closed.

196
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,520
Scott: the guy was in the gas station, but waved us away.

197
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:29,380
Scott: We got back in the highway and got somehow miraculously to the next gas station while still on.

198
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,824
Rym: We were at that point where the car was literally running on fumes like it was on e. it said e if I had turned The engine off.

199
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:36,610
Scott: I think I was driving.

200
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,421
Rym: I we were taking turns I forget.

201
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,932
Rym: all I know is if we had turned the engine off not confident.

202
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,278
Rym: We could have restarted the engine.

203
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,602
Rym: Nope Cuz.

204
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:52,698
Rym: when we refilled the tank cuz I know that car held 14 gallons of gas we put in like 13.8 gallons Like we filled it up all the way.

205
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:54,112
Scott: Then we were just fine.

206
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:59,719
Rym: So If you haven't noticed that my news is sort of a minor call to action.

207
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,797
Rym: but Politics is kind of fucked up in the US right now.

208
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:12,180
Rym: So if you don't live in the US this really doesn't apply to you But a common problem a pretty apparently even if you don't live in the US you can still influence our politics with your money.

209
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,943
Scott: So, please send it.

210
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:16,398
Rym: Oh, yeah, if you want to do the reverse Russia like help us out.

211
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,439
Scott: Apparently it's okay.

212
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:27,055
Rym: but anyway The specific thing I want to talk about is that especially if you're like urban living nerd a lot of the people listen to GeekNights.

213
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:38,360
Rym: a lot of our friends like us in particular as Invested as we are in politics Literally every election I can vote in is a landslide for the best possible outcome already.

214
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:43,595
Rym: Yeah, like if I call my senator like I call actually look all my representatives at every level.

215
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:48,188
Scott: All right, except for president are Democrats of awesomeness and I went and I checked.

216
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,637
Scott: I'm like are any of them like the not good kind?

217
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:51,219
Scott: because there are.

218
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:55,896
Scott: so And I know hunt they're all like if there was votes for like universal health care.

219
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:56,278
Scott: They would vote.

220
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:56,860
Scott: Yes tomorrow.

221
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,180
Scott: Yep, like my state's every single one of them even my city council person.

222
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:04,120
Scott: So it's like there's no point in getting involved in my local anything.

223
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:11,264
Rym: I called my state senator to be like, yeah, New York State universal health care and the response I got was I fucking Co-sponsored that.

224
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:12,670
Rym: that's my bill.

225
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,079
Rym: Yeah, so yes, I am for it.

226
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:20,039
Rym: so if you were one of those people who feels like you live in a place where you can't influence things.

227
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:26,298
Rym: a Good friend of ours is trying to change that and I've been talking to him a bit and I wanted to kind of.

228
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:30,880
Scott: I want To point you out some way somehow we can influence elections in other parts of the United States.

229
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,665
Scott: So how can we do this?

230
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:36,837
Rym: So in particular, I'll give you a very specific example, Texas.

231
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:38,322
Scott: Mm-hmm Text.

232
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:38,824
Scott: we none of.

233
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,592
Scott: I don't think I know people who live there.

234
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,560
Rym: Yeah, but I know a bunch of people live there.

235
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:52,439
Rym: We know someone who moved there specifically to try to organize political activism in Texas because While Texas seems to be a very red for non?

236
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,926
Rym: u.s scenes red means bad state in the u.s.

237
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:55,388
Scott: Only.

238
00:14:55,468 --> 00:15:04,012
Scott: but thing is even in places like the big cities like Dallas San Antonio all blue Cities are still not places that are red.

239
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,759
Scott: Yeah, even in Texas.

240
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:06,040
Scott: Yes.

241
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:14,480
Rym: So the interesting thing is that Texas Actually could very easily flip much more Democrat in the United States.

242
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:21,812
Rym: They're because voter turnout in most of Texas is actually really low It's true and the elections are closer than a lot of you realize.

243
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,017
Scott: that's very so.

244
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:27,840
Rym: the idea Is that if you do are not the kind of person who just has money?

245
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,073
Rym: Because if you have money you can literally just like send money to Texas Democrats.

246
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:33,980
Rym: Mm-hmm, but most of you can't do that.

247
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:39,000
Rym: And also I would argue that if you don't have a lot of money that is not how you should be spending your money.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,727
Scott: Let's spend it on food.

249
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:44,593
Rym: Yeah, so You feel strongly about politics in the u.s.

250
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,300
Rym: And you want to try to make a difference?

251
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,215
Rym: I'm gonna link to you to a bunch of websites that are trying to organize people like that.

252
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:56,837
Rym: people who live in blue states Live in cities don't have money to donate but have time to donate.

253
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:57,720
Scott: get to go to Texas.

254
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,406
Rym: No, you can do they.

255
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,108
Rym: basically they could.

256
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,817
Rym: these are sites that are legit like I check these out.

257
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:03,580
Rym: that will.

258
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:10,980
Rym: If you want to donate your time instead of your money to help do things like let this dude beat Ted Cruz.

259
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,510
Rym: So he's just out of government and fucked.

260
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:14,995
Rym: it's achievable.

261
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,260
Scott: So what do you do?

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Scott: Do you like call people in Texas on the phone?

263
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,245
Rym: So basically they'll let you can do.

264
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:33,549
Rym: set up your time and you can do like all the phone calls and data entry and all The work that needs to be done to try to help the Democrats win these elections in this red state If you don't live there and without having to donate money.

265
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:38,538
Scott: because again Scott's evil hacker brain immediately says go sign up for this and Do a bad job.

266
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:44,960
Scott: Scott's evil hacker brain also says go sign up for the opponent's system doing the same thing and do a bad job on purpose.

267
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:55,380
Rym: That may be true that may be possible But this kind of Activision sort of my broader point I'm gonna talk this more in future episodes is that in general in the u.s.

268
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:13,160
Rym: most people think that if they can't donate a lot of money, they can't do anything and And So few people actually do this kind of work That the idea of gaming this system doesn't seem to really exist yet like if ten GeekNights listeners sign up for this.

269
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,208
Scott: Hello, is this Rym House?

270
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:17,799
Scott: Please vote for Vlad in next election.

271
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:21,780
Rym: Cobra stan is best Cobra stan forever.

272
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:27,799
Scott: I'm calling from local party in New York, please vote.

273
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,119
Rym: Stephen AI see through anything.

274
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,331
Rym: So anyway, I'm gonna link you to a bunch of these things.

275
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,387
Rym: if you care about this stuff Please vote and you want.

276
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:46,533
Rym: if you want to try to influence politics doing stuff like this Has way more impact than the piddly amount of money you could part with.

277
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:47,595
Rym: we should call Russians.

278
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,016
Scott: Hello.

279
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,380
Scott: Is this comrade?

280
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,749
Scott: Please vote against Putin in the next election.

281
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,620
Rym: Yep, but specifically I am NOT American.

282
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:12,459
Rym: Texas you in your blue city can do things and some of these some of the things they need are things like Help translate things from English to Spanish Answer emails help with social media shoot and edit video.

283
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:13,022
Rym: Like.

284
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:17,760
Rym: if you want to make campaign ads for them, they will hook you up with the things you need to do that.

285
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:21,757
Rym: Mmm, this is the kind of stuff that nerds can fucking do if they don't have money make.

286
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,180
Scott: Yeah, if you're someone who's making funny YouTube videos, you can make funny campaign ads.

287
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:33,616
Rym: Yeah, like they'll hook you up with someone like if they need a video shot like it's not hard to make fun of Bad politicians that they're running.

288
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:35,365
Rym: Yes I mean like one of the.

289
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:43,520
Rym: you can rip their ass holes open real easily with your internet comedy skills And you if you feel like this doesn't like you feel like this is a Sisyphusian task.

290
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:49,000
Rym: The dude who's trying to kick Ted Cruz who is an evil shithead in the US out of the government.

291
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:54,019
Rym: He's neck and neck in the polls in Texas like This is possible.

292
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:56,491
Rym: So that is my funny videos.

293
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:03,899
Rym: gonna tip this I mean The elections were so close in a lot of these districts that something like that literally could mm-hmm.

294
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,748
Rym: And you know that we're we're not.

295
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,280
Rym: we're the opposite of optimists.

296
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,029
Rym: Shall we say it's got an eye.

297
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:11,980
Rym: you might be referred to as cynical.

298
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:19,658
Rym: I'm pretty I'm pretty invested in this actually being possible And I think my funny videos gonna do it.

299
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,640
Scott: But I hope that motivates you to make the funny video anyway, so I can laugh.

300
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,547
Rym: But check these things out.

301
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,737
Rym: This is the kind of stuff you can do that isn't just.

302
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,510
Scott: you should be all saying I'll show you Scott.

303
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,359
Scott: It's like yeah show me Go ahead.

304
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,800
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

305
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:43,680
Rym: So I have a specific moratorium for myself.

306
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:46,689
Rym: I will never much like the old Jack Thompson thing.

307
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:54,269
Rym: my thing of the day will never be related to steamed hams Ever again unless a steamed hams thing occurs.

308
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,355
Rym: that is so transcendentally better than anything that has ever come before Which I feel like is impossible.

309
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:19,035
Rym: however I found a steamed hams that was one of those technical memes, and it was something like every time someone says the word ham Generation loss occurs mm-hmm, and I realized that a lot of modern nerds have no idea what the word Generation loss means or the term generation loss

310
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:19,658
Scott: mm-hmm.

311
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:30,545
Rym: Generation loss is a concept from the analog days where if you make a cop if you have an analog thing And you make a copy of it it will introduce defects Artifacts.

312
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,440
Rym: if you keep making copies of copies.

313
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:38,776
Rym: that's what happens when your fourth generation copy of the key to your dorm room doesn't work anymore.

314
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:45,874
Rym: or the The VHS tape that was a seventh generation of a fan sub is literally unwatchable.

315
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:48,938
Rym: or the literal entire plot of the movie multiplicity.

316
00:20:50,142 --> 00:21:05,799
Rym: This video will explain to you in detail with examples What generation loss in the analog world was as it takes you through a VHS tape that is copied again and again And again, and it goes into some detail of the kinds of things that occur.

317
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:15,027
Rym: I can say that I have watched like literally watched entire movies that were fourth generation Lost copies.

318
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,439
Rym: I've watched movies to that level of quality.

319
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:25,175
Rym: once you get to about Generation 18 That's what the porn channels look like if you had cable in an era.

320
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:27,304
Rym: that is also by God also It shows you.

321
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:37,140
Scott: people in those days really you know Underestimated the quality that these media could exhibit because they rarely had first-generation stuff.

322
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:41,420
Scott: Yeah, first generation VHS is actually pretty damn good.

323
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:46,220
Rym: Yeah, in fact it is better than digital video was until like.

324
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:56,080
Rym: But the only other point I got is that this is analog and this is fascinating and you should watch this video to the end.

325
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,151
Rym: It's only like seven minutes long.

326
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:58,019
Rym: It's just really well done.

327
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,727
Rym: The same thing happens with lossy digital media.

328
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:07,923
Rym: take a JPEG rotate it 90 degrees a hundred times and your JPEGs fucked Mm-hmm.

329
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,775
Rym: So your thing of the day was the song you made.

330
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,080
Scott: All right, so Google?

331
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,486
Scott: It was a while ago.

332
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:19,179
Scott: Google had like a Google Doodle that let you sort of like be a DJ And it's pretty cool.

333
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:26,939
Scott: They've had a lot of actually Google doodles that involve music creation right where you could have a simple and limited interface and make music with it.

334
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,780
Scott: But today they actually released a site.

335
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,863
Scott: What's the name of the site?

336
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:37,360
Rym: song maker song maker dot Google or whatever music lab dot Chrome experiments dot-com slash song maker?

337
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,111
Rym: right Network slash block.

338
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:45,140
Scott: so it's basically Like a Mario Paint kind of situation, you know.

339
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:50,420
Scott: And it was pretty easy and you can make a song with it and I made a song that wasn't unlistenable.

340
00:22:51,183 --> 00:23:01,318
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting as you know as someone who's studied music formally for At this point because it's been so long not much of my life, but not a majority of my life.

341
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:09,240
Rym: at this point Your music is indeed listenable, but also by the technical definition naive and uninteresting.

342
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,940
Rym: Naive in the sense that I can clearly see what you were going for.

343
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,686
Rym: But because you lack the like knowledge of chord structure or like knowledge of melodic structure It's interesting to see the choices you made.

344
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,492
Scott: or I just did something really quick.

345
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:26,530
Rym: Yeah with no not much effort Yeah, but at the same time it's it's.

346
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:26,952
Rym: you're right.

347
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:28,158
Rym: It's not unlistenable.

348
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:34,320
Scott: you did Okay, anyway, but you the point is you can use this to a you can make a lot of music with it and combine it together.

349
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:47,173
Scott: you can even use your microphone to get some samples in there and You can save and share links to the music with other people and then they can load up the little music that you made and Such and such and that makes it pretty cool.

350
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,480
Scott: I think it's weird.

351
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,880
Scott: It's like it's so simple even almost less than Mario Paint actually.

352
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:57,517
Scott: But yet you could definitely get real stuff done with this, you know what and actually it sounds pretty good.

353
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:01,800
Scott: the audio The total ad hoc contest I make a visit they have there doesn't sound bad.

354
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:06,160
Rym: I'll make a forum thread and we'll do a mini contest over like the next month or so.

355
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,672
Rym: Whoever makes the best song in here they judge.

356
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,200
Scott: No, no, here's how we should do it.

357
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,730
Scott: All right, if your song is better than mine you win.

358
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:16,579
Scott: So almost everyone's a winner and your song is worse than mine.

359
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,555
Scott: shame It's almost no one should have shame.

360
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:25,660
Rym: All right Mine should be like the second worst, but I'll make a forum thread specifically for this.

361
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,740
Rym: I think we can have some fun in the forum with it in the better moment.

362
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,146
Rym: You should join the GeekNights forums.

363
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,315
Rym: pretty fucking awesome in there reduced.

364
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:32,697
Rym: We talked.

365
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:33,380
Rym: there's a lot of people.

366
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:33,984
Rym: There's a lot of.

367
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:36,540
Rym: there is too much activity in that forum.

368
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,123
Rym: It's kind of.

369
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,860
Rym: I'm still shocked at how much many people use our forum.

370
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,975
Scott: Community dot front row crew comm it's worth your time more than watching our.

371
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,320
Scott: we're listening to GeekNights.

372
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:49,917
Scott: A lot of people go to that forum and don't listen to you guys.

373
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:53,313
Rym: They're smart Yeah, and that actually I think the majority of the people in there.

374
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:58,073
Rym: don't lose the GeekNights smart people In the rest of the meta moment the GeekNights book club.

375
00:24:58,113 --> 00:25:02,700
Rym: I'm gonna update this Today or tomorrow because we did read the fifth seasons done.

376
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:03,885
Rym: You can listen to the episode.

377
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:05,935
Rym: We have a GeekNights book club.

378
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:07,120
Rym: You should read those books.

379
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,517
Scott: We've done a ton of books over the last 13 years, even though we're really slow to do each one somehow they've added up.

380
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:19,360
Rym: I am Rapidly burning through Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey, which is the current book up book club book.

381
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,460
Scott: Oh, no, I'm reading some spider-man come because it's oh no this translation.

382
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:28,035
Scott: And I really good if you've never started it, but then I read comics instead.

383
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:33,247
Rym: if you've never read the Odyssey You'll get into it just like you would a novel I think just the way it's translated.

384
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:40,733
Rym: and if you read the Odyssey in high school And you kind of vaguely remember what happened probably because of the way it was written.

385
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:41,696
Rym: It was kind of obtuse.

386
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:43,080
Rym: this translation.

387
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:52,359
Rym: It's very much like Athena's dragging this kid around making him do stuff and like the humor and the jokes and the references and it just.

388
00:25:52,379 --> 00:26:03,413
Rym: it Feels like a more natural narrative and if you had trouble like enjoying it in high school I feel like you may actually find enjoyment in it reading this translation.

389
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:05,199
Rym: I'm very impressed so far.

390
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:12,526
Rym: But a tiny aside if you're gonna read the Odyssey in our book club Read the introduction.

391
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:13,870
Rym: It's long.

392
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:14,995
Rym: You should read it.

393
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:17,344
Rym: If you don't read the intro That's all I read so far.

394
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:26,898
Rym: You're doing yourself a grave disservice because the introduction is Fascinating and very informative and very interesting in a shockingly short period of time from now.

395
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:34,505
Scott: It will be Pax East 2018. oh my god is a Fourth-day Pax.

396
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:36,530
Scott: the first four-day East Pax.

397
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:43,312
Scott: Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday sold out but fry Thursday no Friday and Saturday are sold out.

398
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:46,904
Rym: Thursday and Sunday are not sold out which you can't Just go on.

399
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:52,580
Rym: Thursday or Sunday if you are anywhere near Boston if you want to do an expanding brain meme.

400
00:26:53,122 --> 00:27:03,700
Rym: Friday and Saturday being sold out is the baby's first because Actually Friday Thursday and Sunday the first day and the last day of any given packs are the most powerful days.

401
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:14,200
Rym: Yep the first day of packs has keynote Q&A and it's a full day that goes till midnight and the last Apparently won't be very crowded and it's still a full packs as full as all the other days.

402
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:31,120
Rym: Yeah like getting the expo is no content difference between Thursday and Friday and Saturday at PAX other than what happens to be on the Yep and Sunday while it's shorter It has the omega-thon finale the closing ceremony of packs and shit's not that crowded.

403
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:33,251
Rym: You can see all the stuff you want to see.

404
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,120
Scott: I think Thursday is really the strongest day.

405
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,749
Scott: I don't know why it's not sold out.

406
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,180
Rym: Anyway, I think it's cuz most people want to go to packs for the whole weekend.

407
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:44,020
Scott: I think it's cuz you got expo help people and you got local people.

408
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,130
Rym: Also, a lot of people can take days off work for cons.

409
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:48,234
Scott: That's true.

410
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:49,037
Rym: Look at magfest.

411
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:50,080
Rym: people buy a four-day badge.

412
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,586
Rym: They only show up Saturday Sunday.

413
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:54,356
Scott: Yeah night point is we're doing a panel there.

414
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:57,065
Scott: It's not a. It's not a good time.

415
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,575
Rym: Sunday, April 8th 10 30 a.m.

416
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,800
Rym: The 40 tabletop games.

417
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,680
Scott: You must play man the mad time but a good panel.

418
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:04,397
Rym: The thing is we didn't.

419
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:08,600
Rym: yeah We did a trial run of this panel that we kind of threw together at the last second at magfest.

420
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:12,602
Rym: Not only did it completely fill the room, but I really liked it Right.

421
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:14,720
Scott: So the thing with this panel is it's a clickbait title.

422
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:24,440
Scott: You think it has clickbait content just like a BuzzFeed list of like good best board games, but actually As GeekNights does we bait and switch and what actually we do is it go down the list of games?

423
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:37,858
Scott: but what we're actually doing is exploring like 40 concepts of games and mechanics and Discussing those right and that is you know, you can get a wide view of the varied ways in which board games work.

424
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,151
Rym: Yep So we'll be there.

425
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:40,920
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

426
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:46,520
Scott: The panel will be good Probably be on YouTube at some point and you won't have to play 40 board games to find out we played them for you.

427
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,569
Rym: Frankly you don't want to play all those games.

428
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,780
Rym: some of those games aren't even that good or we didn't like them.

429
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,046
Rym: No, but they illustrate an important point.

430
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,452
Rym: Yes, and I'm changing the list.

431
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:58,260
Scott: I thought we'd there's no reason not to change it every time.

432
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:06,930
Rym: Oh, yeah, so easy, especially because I made that list over the course of an hour Like at magfest like trying to make the panel be ready.

433
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,210
Rym: Yep.

434
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:11,905
Scott: So the last thing is there's a lot of PC games right now It's PC game season.

435
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:15,380
Scott: Oh, yeah, so there's gonna be a lot of streaming on Twitch and YouTube.

436
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:25,488
Scott: so make sure to go to my YouTube which is just my username or twitch which is also my username or Rym's and we've got lots of streaming going on When we're not GeekNights in.

437
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:35,010
Scott: so if you're really bored You can watch me get mad at a poorly designed game Or the design flaws of an otherwise good game.

438
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,251
Scott: Well,

439
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:57,119
Rym: it's there's a debate when we do a Tuesday show between what is a design flaw versus what is the difference between a Game aimed at player mastery versus a game aimed at player exploration of mechanics, which is a Constant struggle for us because the latter is a type of game that we personally tend not to like.

440
00:29:57,741 --> 00:29:59,832
Scott: You want to explore make of Metroid Vania?

441
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,407
Scott: Yeah, but like this board I can actually be exploring the map not the rules.

442
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,212
Rym: like Spirit Island is a board game.

443
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:07,038
Rym: That is more exploratory than mastery.

444
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,689
Rym: focus Mm-hmm.

445
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:10,446
Rym: Anyway, that's it.

446
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:10,708
Rym: That's it.

447
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:12,579
Scott: I only played it once and I don't remember that much.

448
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:15,673
Rym: Well, we the whole point of review con is we're gonna do a show on it.

449
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,180
Scott: It's you waited too long.

450
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,478
Rym: I remember specific details about turn I took in that game like things I did in that game.

451
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:23,120
Rym: that happened.

452
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,400
Rym: How did you forget so much so quickly?

453
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:28,955
Scott: Because I didn't put it in my brain.

454
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:29,620
Scott: it's not that important.

455
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:31,995
Rym: It's the game where the white people are coming in ruining the island.

456
00:30:32,015 --> 00:30:34,820
Rym: I know I know that yeah Yeah, and they got their little houses and we're trying to burn again.

457
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,451
Scott: I remember that the generalness but I don't remember the details.

458
00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:39,379
Rym: You don't remember the powers and like that.

459
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,149
Scott: Anyway, no, I can't remember a single power.

460
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,672
Rym: Okay.

461
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:43,039
Rym: Okay who?

462
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,685
Rym: name anyone?

463
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:47,093
Rym: Odysseus had sex with?

464
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,669
Scott: Oh Seriously the witch.

465
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:52,524
Scott: okay, we turned it Frozen two pigs.

466
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:56,154
Rym: Yeah, what about not Calypso his actual wife, which probably happened?

467
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:56,796
Scott: What's her name?

468
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:57,397
Scott: Penelope?

469
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:57,658
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,514
Scott: Yeah Those are historic figures.

471
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:05,513
Scott: They're not remember Specific details from the Odyssey that I haven't read yet.

472
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:05,954
Scott: guy read.

473
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:07,279
Scott: Well, I read the pop-up book recently.

474
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:09,072
Rym: Yeah Oh, yeah the pop-up book.

475
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:10,529
Rym: Oh That did it.

476
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:12,464
Scott: So I knew those.

477
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,975
Scott: anyway the main bit the reason who's who's the main character the Odyssey?

478
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,300
Scott: Could it be Telemachus?

479
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:30,063
Scott: It's like Athena, yeah Polyphemus, it's not like a trick question where the you know, I mean, I don't remember the characters names from Fifth season that we just read.

480
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:38,517
Rym: uh, I actually forgot most of them to hot The hottest pirate captain to ever be in a media, but I don't know his name.

481
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:39,380
Rym: I forgot his name.

482
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,028
Rym: Okay, all I know is that he is the.

483
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:46,152
Rym: he is the most attractive character I think I've ever encountered in written literature.

484
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:46,634
Rym: I agree.

485
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:49,348
Rym: Yeah, so summer camp.

486
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,024
Rym: we I Reminded ourselves repeatedly.

487
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:56,638
Rym: We're gonna do a show on capture the flag, but that's a Tuesday show.

488
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:56,959
Scott: Mm-hmm.

489
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:03,220
Rym: But on a Thursday, there's a whole separate topic around that of camp like summer camp band camp.

490
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,790
Scott: Well, cuz the place I played the most capture the flag was camp.

491
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:07,556
Scott: Yeah, but it folds right in.

492
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:24,180
Rym: but I Because as someone who grew up in the Midwest summer camp as Scott envisions it as a lot of kids who lived in New York State and Connecticut and New Jersey and possibly Massachusetts envisioned it is not that common in much of the rest of the country.

493
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,739
Scott: Yeah, I didn't realize that when I was a kid, I thought like is everyone went to camp.

494
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:30,128
Scott: But apparently that's not.

495
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:36,066
Scott: I don't know what a lot of the other kids like in my local School in Connecticut.

496
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:43,057
Scott: I don't know what they did in the summer because like in the summer I'd go to camp and I wouldn't see any of them ever.

497
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:46,873
Scott: Yep I'm not so much like what were they doing growing up in the Midwest one?

498
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,440
Scott: I never want to ask them.

499
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,320
Rym: I never went to summer camp ever.

500
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,882
Rym: That was the thing.

501
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:54,920
Rym: that way one my mom asked once like you want to go to a summer camp and I was like why?

502
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,195
Rym: The fuck would I want to leave all my video games and all my friends behind?

503
00:32:58,436 --> 00:32:59,220
Rym: do I hang out with a bunch of kids?

504
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:08,067
Rym: I don't know far away from home Because our neighborhood just like the things Scott described doing in summer gave her things We just did every night in the neighborhood.

505
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:08,830
Scott: We didn't have.

506
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,877
Scott: you don't have hundreds of kids in the neighborhood.

507
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:11,399
Rym: We did.

508
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:16,188
Rym: Okay, I lived in a dense suburb But cars driving to the neighborhood.

509
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:18,620
Rym: Yeah, there was woods next to the neighborhood.

510
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:23,757
Scott: Yeah, you don't have expensive equipment in the stuff in the neighborhood like what we just take our lake.

511
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:28,757
Rym: a lake full of boats Lake full of but there were lakes full of boats fucking everywhere.

512
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:29,420
Rym: I lived in Michigan.

513
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,932
Scott: You just walk right up and boat just whenever the fuck dude.

514
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,700
Rym: Yeah, go to like anchor Bay and just get in a boat.

515
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,131
Scott: Did you have to drive there?

516
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:38,926
Scott: I bike there Like as a summer camp.

517
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:42,282
Scott: you wake up and walk and just you know your arts and crafts tent You got.

518
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:44,333
Scott: make a model rocket play D&D.

519
00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:45,640
Rym: Yeah, we all just made model rockets.

520
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,418
Rym: People went to the school and launched them on our own.

521
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,559
Scott: It's like archeries.

522
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,588
Scott: All the shit just going down.

523
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,219
Rym: if we want to do archery went to the YMCA and just did archery.

524
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,366
Scott: They just free archery at the YMCA.

525
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:57,229
Rym: Yeah, what do you think?

526
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:58,232
Rym: The YMCA is.

527
00:33:58,252 --> 00:33:58,794
Scott: it's free.

528
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:00,780
Rym: you pay like a trivial membership.

529
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,146
Rym: It's like cause it costs.

530
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:05,100
Rym: the cost of the YMCA is basically zero.

531
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:07,149
Scott: Not summer camp is where it's at.

532
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:19,051
Rym: but so as a kid interest from my perspective The only kids I ever knew of who went to something that I would call summer camp were Like I can fix little characters on TV.

533
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:20,819
Rym: Yeah, I can classify them as such.

534
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:32,438
Rym: Kids on shows and T like TV shows like salute your shorts or movies had summer camp Which always like a family one cuz I yeah the Adams family one cuz I'd never done that kind of thing.

535
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:35,179
Scott: Uh, so what did you think when you saw that in a movie?

536
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,408
Scott: Like what the for camp Krusty like?

537
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:38,119
Scott: he's like you watch that like what the fuck's going on.

538
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:42,739
Rym: The kinds of kids I thought went to summer camp when I was a kid were poor kids.

539
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:51,713
Rym: No rich kids go because a lot of the summer camps I knew of poor kids can't afford were Specific to poor families and were subsidized.

540
00:34:51,793 --> 00:35:04,120
Rym: and they were like kids who lived in Detroit would come upstate in Michigan and go to a special camp to experience that because they didn't get it living in the city and they Had there's reasons why the state was subsidizing them to go check this out.

541
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,042
Scott: Well, that is part of what camp is is you know, like city people would send their kids out into the woods during the summer Right.

542
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:11,966
Scott: Yeah, that's part of what it's.

543
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:20,599
Rym: the second class was all the upper middle-class kids Like their families sent into these really expensive fancy camps way far away even in other states.

544
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:22,009
Scott: It's other states,

545
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:39,680
Rym: but the only kids Were either the middle-class kids who didn't have any friends in the neighborhood like they like the kids that like no one was friends with would go off on their own to summer camp or The like upper middle-class kids that none of us ever Interacted with and didn't even go to our schools because I went to the private schools.

546
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,409
Scott: Right, so the camps vary a lot economically speaking, right?

547
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:48,776
Scott: So you had you know, and I've actually been to a wide Variety of camps economically speaking right.

548
00:35:48,796 --> 00:36:00,100
Scott: so that you know It's not like we're loaded with mad moneys like even when I went to the more expensive camps They would only send me for four out of the eight weeks total because it cost twice as much to go for eight weeks And it cost a lot thousand.

549
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:05,099
Rym: All I can think is I'm gonna lose four weeks of my idol summertime of playing video games.

550
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:08,535
Scott: No, you're kidding somebody was the way better than what you could do at home.

551
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:12,895
Rym: Ah I don't get based on what I did at home as a kid in the summer.

552
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:14,120
Rym: I don't feel like that's true.

553
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:19,300
Scott: Anyway, so you could Their summer camps arranged like they got day camps.

554
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:26,704
Scott: so they were like there were a few years where I just went to like this day camp where the state the school bus would Come and get me at my house Just like it was school.

555
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:37,819
Scott: take me to the local one of the other local schools Not the one I went to but a different one Right, and then there was a camp there and you could just instead of going to school You just did whatever the fuck you wanted.

556
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:48,319
Scott: So usually what I would do most of the time all I really remember doing is get there playing basketball for half the day eating lunch then go into a room full of Apple twos

557
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:48,399
Rym: and

558
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:52,939
Scott: Play an Oregon Trail or doing some logo programming for the other half of the day.

559
00:36:53,301 --> 00:37:01,851
Scott: But then it would only be like like not even like one and I go home and it was like, alright So that was like the lowest level of any.

560
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:05,826
Rym: so I went to a bunch of camps like that But those kinds of camps were like.

561
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:10,820
Rym: I went to a thing called Starbase, which was cheapo space camp.

562
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:14,545
Rym: Yeah, it was basically so it was Retrospect.

563
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:20,780
Rym: it was really more like young age military officer recruiting.

564
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:24,594
Rym: Okay, but because it was run it's at the Air National Guard Bay.

565
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:26,080
Rym: I grew up next to an Air National Guard base.

566
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:32,658
Rym: so like can we go there all the time and like fuck around with f-16s and like play in the simulator?

567
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:37,356
Rym: and like F-16s would literally fly over our houses all the time making noise and trouble.

568
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:38,059
Scott: that sounds healthy.

569
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:54,600
Rym: But as one of the things that that that Selfridge Air National Guard base did is they ran this program called Starbase Which was basically all the smart kids from the local schools would get invited And he'd be like a two or three week thing where we'd go every day come home every night.

570
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,844
Rym: That wasn't like a sleepaway thing.

571
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,589
Rym: and we do exercises like.

572
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,440
Rym: you're gonna learn how to do aeronautical navigation.

573
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:10,279
Rym: You're gonna learn how to like plan a travel mission though in retrospect I realized that the materials they were using like this is my adult brain looking back.

574
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:18,883
Rym: They taught us what literally World War two bomber navigators did to plan to like navigate Bombing runs.

575
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,932
Rym: Okay, but our runs were framed.

576
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:47,204
Rym: as we're gonna drop this package off to these people in this city Like it's like thinking back on what we were taught to do in that camp Kind of weird and fucked up but at the same time like we learned a lot of technical skills about aeronautical navigation and Space and it was like mini space camp coupled with military stuff, but they changed it later and actually they Specifically made it.

577
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,260
Rym: only poor kids from the city could go to it and none of us in the local town could go anymore.

578
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:56,379
Scott: Anyway, so the other kind of can the next level up camp wise which I've been to all these levels of camp, right?

579
00:38:57,581 --> 00:39:01,464
Rym: As as counselor and also as camp which I want to know in the chat Someone said that quote.

580
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:05,300
Rym: I've never heard such an American thing in this podcast, right?

581
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,431
Scott: Yeah, I guess I was wondering about like do other countries have?

582
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:11,000
Scott: I didn't feel like other countries had this right?

583
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:20,122
Rym: So the Wikipedia article implies that yeah, this is a very American and it's also a very Native American Appropriative.

584
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:20,523
Scott: Yes.

585
00:39:20,644 --> 00:39:23,212
Scott: It's like they're like half on a wanna write.

586
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:24,015
Scott: the nerd camp.

587
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,660
Scott: I went to was camp Watanka.

588
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:31,249
Scott: There was not a single Native American there Yet it was very Native American themed.

589
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,116
Rym: very quote from the Wikipedia.

590
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,200
Rym: United Kingdom.

591
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,046
Rym: There's a whole section on the United Kingdom for camps.

592
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,100
Rym: quote summer camps are not a main part of childhood in the United Kingdom.

593
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:42,288
Scott: I think it's an American thing.

594
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:47,050
Rym: Anyway, I still think it's like a mostly like Northeastern American thing.

595
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:51,429
Scott: I may be But I mean salute your shorts was screened all over right?

596
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,120
Scott: Yeah, and it's it's in popular culture across the whole country.

597
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,354
Rym: So it was a thing I knew about but it wasn't a thing I would do.

598
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:06,809
Rym: and the kids I knew who did it Were always the weird outliers anyway, so The next level up was like the day camp.

599
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:09,720
Scott: That's where you go away in the morning and then you come back home, right?

600
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:17,260
Rym: My brother did all day and I did a lot of that but it was all under the purview of like Cub Scouts Mmm, but it wasn't the wrong thing.

601
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:25,530
Scott: Well some of those, you know, I've been to a few day camps right expensive ones and cheap ones, you know and they vary in levels of qualities and and and right.

602
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,867
Scott: some of them are there as just like I have kids and I Work, I'm a working parent.

603
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:33,015
Scott: I can't leave the kids at home alone all day.

604
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:34,300
Scott: I will send them to a day camp.

605
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:41,360
Scott: It's right The day in the summer and then pick them up and then some of them are actually pretty fancy even though they're day camps.

606
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:46,420
Scott: They just don't let you sleep there and it's slightly cheaper than the sleepaway cam Yeah.

607
00:40:46,641 --> 00:41:00,960
Scott: But they're just as fancy or perhaps sometimes even more fancy because the money that they're not spending on like camping Cabins and food they're spending on like improving their sport fields and improving their activities, right?

608
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:12,180
Scott: It's like there are a lot of day camps or like the shit is actually way fancier than Sleepaway camps will have because you know, they're charging about the same but the cert, you know, they're budgeting differently.

609
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:27,570
Scott: And then you got the sleepaway camps which again range in quality based on how expensive they are and you know at the lower levels You've got like sleepaway camp and rusty shacks barely meeting the you know Barely, basically passing inspection and getting.

610
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:37,600
Rym: that's what camp was like one of the cab I can't like camp crusty one of the cabins next to where I was staying for band camp one year that no one was in Just fucking collapsed in the middle of the night, right?

611
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:46,812
Scott: and then at the high end you've got luxury camp which is like the cabins or palaces and The food is incredible and basically each kid wakes up in the morning.

612
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:53,786
Scott: It just does whatever activity they want all fucking day And it's just like, you know living in a woodsy paradise Commune place for eight weeks

613
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,492
Rym: now seems interesting because the only

614
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:56,696
Scott: tennis courts

615
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:59,624
Rym: like when I went When I went

616
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:00,185
Scott: ball

617
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:04,300
Rym: when I went on camps, it was usually literal camping which is kind of orthogonal to this.

618
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,269
Scott: Yeah, usually literal camping is like a component of sleepaway camp.

619
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:13,132
Scott: We're like, yeah, you're living in this cabin in a bed most of the time But then you'll be like, oh this week.

620
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:14,319
Scott: We're gonna go on a hike and camp.

621
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:22,599
Scott: Yeah, or this week, you know this weekend We'll go do this activity and you know, we did stuff like go to amusement parks Or you know all kinds of stuff.

622
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:34,820
Rym: But what I the only real camp I did that was sleepaway and in cabins and the kind of thing was band camp Which in the Midwest like a lot of people went to because marching bands were real big there and that was the thing.

623
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,760
Rym: So there were a lot of dedicated like summer camp looking places that were actually just for band camp.

624
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:59,813
Rym: So like every band would send their band there for like two or four weeks and they just imagine a summer camp like you're thinking But it has like 12 football fields like all over the place and like band shells and Otherwise, the food is awful and the cheapest possible rule you can imagine.

625
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:05,099
Rym: the facilities are just like dilapidated garbage like pooping in a hole.

626
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:07,954
Scott: I've had some pooping in a hole.

627
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:18,820
Rym: Yeah, but band camp was also hyper-structured and very military like literally Someone like some senior plays Reveille on a bugle at dawn.

628
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:22,840
Scott: We had we had Reveille blow on the PA system every morning.

629
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:36,120
Rym: Ours was a real trumpet or a bugle and you had to get up at dawn For inspection eat breakfast and then immediately to the field for drills and we literally just worked all day until the Sun went down.

630
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:41,815
Rym: We need the gruel dinner and then we'd have like two hours of.

631
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,702
Rym: you can do whatever you want time Meaning.

632
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:51,514
Rym: we'd play like bond in the cabin because old and I yeah Yeah, and then we'd have dinner and a dance.

633
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:58,308
Rym: every night They'd have like this dance party which I wanted nothing to do with and then the next morning at like 6 a.m We'd wake up and do the whole thing again.

634
00:43:58,328 --> 00:44:05,500
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it was just a grueling Difficult slog that left everyone physically and mentally exhausted by the end of it.

635
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,364
Scott: See summer camp.

636
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:10,360
Scott: see that if you're a kid that goes to summer camp, it's basically either heaven or hell.

637
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,408
Scott: there's not really a lot of in-between right.

638
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:17,066
Scott: so if some kids go there and like they're homesick or Like they don't.

639
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:18,960
Scott: they're just like, you know, they're socially.

640
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:26,342
Rym: When I was in high school and I went to space Academy Which is like the older kids version of space camp Holy shit did.

641
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:38,015
Scott: most of the kids who went to that like Freak out and cry and like couldn't deal with me and so friend or they don't get along or they're you know Bullying victims because I mean it's a place with a bunch of kids.

642
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,526
Scott: Yeah, right You're one of those kids.

643
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:41,992
Scott: then summer camp is like hell.

644
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,176
Scott: it's the worst thing ever.

645
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:52,149
Scott: Don't send me there again Right, but if you go there and you make friends and you enjoy the activities and you like doing the things that are at summer Camp it's heaven on earth.

646
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,260
Scott: It's like you can ignore society.

647
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:59,360
Scott: There's no fucking grades not you're basically cut off from the awful world, right?

648
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,973
Scott: You have this awesome culture of everyone getting along kumbaya for eight weeks.

649
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:04,197
Scott: Oh my god.

650
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:04,940
Scott: Everything's free.

651
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:07,190
Scott: You don't gotta worry about fucking money, right?

652
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:11,352
Scott: Everyone's just having a good time 24/7 You don't get to give a shit and it's the best.

653
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:25,916
Scott: and if I could go to live in summer camp I totally would but you can't Okay, so it's like that sort of thing and as someone who has counseled and been to summer camp many times I've experienced both the heavens and also the hells equally in different numbers.

654
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:30,210
Scott: those who I saw here is I guess I can't go forever which I could yell right.

655
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,000
Scott: so the things that GeekNights listeners will find relevant, right?

656
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,339
Scott: One year I went to a day camp.

657
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:38,960
Scott: This is the second time I had been to this particular day camp.

658
00:45:39,182 --> 00:45:46,300
Scott: The previous time was like a couple years ago And I only kind of got along with the kids who were at this camp who are my age, right?

659
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,046
Scott: They weren't really the nerdiest.

660
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:48,809
Rym: Yeah, right.

661
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:51,460
Scott: So I go to this camp is the first day there.

662
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:53,097
Scott: It's the second time I've ever been to it.

663
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:57,000
Scott: But the camp and here's the thing is about these camps when they're eight weeks.

664
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:00,774
Scott: If you're only gonna go for four weeks, you better go for the first four weeks.

665
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,320
Scott: Don't go for the second four weeks.

666
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:04,204
Scott: You're the new kid.

667
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:08,500
Scott: so I was the new kid even though I had been there two years ago, whatever.

668
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:15,940
Scott: And I show up and they've already got like a whole, you know That like the culture has already been established and I'm sort of like man.

669
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:19,360
Rym: You got to be there first to establish the culture exactly.

670
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,618
Scott: So like I'm sort of an outsider outcast person who's just appeared on this first day, right?

671
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,480
Scott: But you know, that's just the people that are like in my cabin.

672
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:33,340
Scott: So it's like my day was meh with them right, but what was actually a problem?

673
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:38,733
Scott: It was a day camp and on the bus to go there There was this one kid who was harassing like.

674
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:40,300
Scott: he wasn't like targeting me.

675
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:44,092
Scott: He was targeting everyone on that motherfucking bus like a Nelson Muntz.

676
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:46,158
Scott: He was like this kid was the Nelson.

677
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:48,585
Scott: is Nelson That ever Nelson?

678
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:49,327
Scott: right?

679
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:50,670
Scott: so bad, right.

680
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:53,678
Scott: and then we're basically waiting for the bus to go home.

681
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:59,069
Scott: right, I Attempted to strangle this kid to death.

682
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:00,975
Scott: people were cheering me on.

683
00:47:00,995 --> 00:47:02,280
Scott: Yeah, I did not succeed.

684
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:04,878
Scott: He was I guess a little bit larger than me.

685
00:47:06,102 --> 00:47:09,460
Scott: My friend was like, you know, my friend who was with me at the camp.

686
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:10,899
Scott: He was just a year younger than me.

687
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,759
Scott: So he wasn't like in my cabin or anything, but he rode the bus with me because we live close to each other.

688
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:17,899
Scott: Well, I think his comment was yeah that kid deserved it.

689
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:28,159
Scott: But yeah, I don't know if I got kicked out of the camp or quit but I only went to the care for one day that you Didn't go back.

690
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:32,203
Scott: My mom probably got my money back I imagine because she.

691
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:33,668
Scott: that's how she is see.

692
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:39,308
Rym: it's interesting because like the band camp dynamic because it's so structured There really weren't concerns like that.

693
00:47:39,368 --> 00:47:48,935
Rym: because even if there was a piece of shit kid who wanted to bully everyone You're literally busy the entire time and being judged and graded the entire time.

694
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:49,316
Scott: Yeah, there's.

695
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:52,400
Scott: no people are there just to have fun So someone ruining the fun is no good.

696
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,933
Scott: And then so here's the other thing GeekNights listeners will care about is the.

697
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,504
Scott: there's a camp I went to two times Sleepway camp.

698
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:00,388
Scott: It's in Pennsylvania.

699
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:01,454
Scott: I don't know if it exists.

700
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:02,600
Scott: I think it still exists.

701
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:08,038
Scott: It's a nerd camp called camp Watanka and it is science camp.

702
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:08,780
Scott: specifically.

703
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,309
Scott: It was also only boys, but I think there was another camp.

704
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:12,112
Scott: That was only girls.

705
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:13,236
Scott: That was like the sister camp.

706
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:18,924
Scott: It's W-a-t-o-n-k-a Right.

707
00:48:18,944 --> 00:48:24,920
Scott: I don't know if you can find it anyway But this camp was the nerdiest camps.

708
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,080
Scott: He is things that happened at this camp that made it the greatest, right?

709
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:34,780
Scott: So first of all, right imagine you take you have to choose to that you choose activities.

710
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:38,794
Scott: So like you have to choose two activities every two weeks, right?

711
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:40,700
Scott: So if you're there for eight weeks, you're doing all right.

712
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,516
Scott: You can choose the same ones again, but those are like supposedly beat.

713
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:45,380
Scott: There's like a short list.

714
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,139
Scott: Those are the educational sciences.

715
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:53,919
Scott: When you're not scheduled to be at a science you can do any of the activities that they announce on the loudspeaker, right?

716
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,791
Scott: But so the science is.

717
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:04,537
Scott: for example when I chose chemistry We threw sodium in the lake and had a uranium compound.

718
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:09,240
Scott: It wasn't pure uranium It's like uranium something I'd and pointed a Geiger counter at it, right?

719
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:13,326
Scott: And her to go click click click Right.

720
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:15,380
Scott: when I chose what else did I choose?

721
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,629
Scott: Oh, wait, I chose video and we made a zombie movie.

722
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,535
Scott: That was awful on VHS camcorders.

723
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:25,995
Scott: I chose Can't even remember what at the house I know in Starbase.

724
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:31,052
Rym: I chose fighter jet and I got to lick because there's such a kind of thing.

725
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:47,183
Rym: we got to choose and I literally got to spend like a Couple hours over the course of the summer all told in the actual military f-16 Simulator that they use for training and I got the like 101 training and how to fly an f-16 I chose.

726
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,289
Rym: I never successfully fucking landed that thing.

727
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:51,635
Rym: I crashed every time.

728
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,239
Scott: I chose computer science.

729
00:49:53,339 --> 00:50:01,632
Scott: twice I learned HTML with Netscape navigator gold Apple Macintosh like LC twos or whatever.

730
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:02,959
Scott: one of them was better.

731
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,360
Scott: It could switch to DOS and you pressed Apple enter and they played marathon.

732
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:16,788
Rym: Oh, so, you know, it's funny cuz I also played a lot of SimCity 2000 before I had a computer like I learned see I made a hangman in see - I think this is part of the like the area differences.

733
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:24,060
Rym: like in the Midwest least where I was the local middle school all Summer like twice a week had a computer club.

734
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,859
Rym: You could just go in and use the computers like and that like we did that like I'd go into the school like every day.

735
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:32,320
Scott: We had an external hard drive with all the games on it and it was a network.

736
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,833
Scott: So everyone was loading up the games onto their Macs from this one hard drive.

737
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:37,319
Scott: and the British guy who?

738
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,646
Scott: The visiting, you know counselor?

739
00:50:40,686 --> 00:50:43,054
Scott: right because a lot of camp counselors are from foreign countries.

740
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,860
Scott: They get like temporary summer visas.

741
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,327
Scott: They're a camp counselor easy job.

742
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:53,320
Scott: for eight weeks you get your room and board you visit the US for basically almost nothing.

743
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:54,237
Scott: It's a great deal.

744
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:59,700
Scott: If you are in a foreign country and want to come to the US for a summer that is actually still a great deal.

745
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,032
Rym: You can do probably way better than working like the boardwalk of.

746
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,276
Rym: yes, it's super great.

747
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:07,128
Scott: I highly recommend it Uh, but anyway, he was like.

748
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,755
Scott: I just always remember he's Australian.

749
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:09,740
Scott: I was in New Zealand.

750
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:12,040
Scott: He definitely was Australia or New Zealand.

751
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:19,196
Scott: Remember, it was definitely not UK guy because I remember him teaching us how to throw a football rugby style And he we couldn't catch it when he threw it.

752
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:19,700
Scott: It was too hard.

753
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:21,872
Rym: If you can't place the accent it could have been South Africa.

754
00:51:22,073 --> 00:51:30,268
Scott: No, it was definitely a New Zealand or Australia, but I remember him saying this hard He was so proud of the hard drive that they had.

755
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,080
Scott: Yeah, this hard drive is one gigabyte.

756
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:40,780
Scott: It was a one gigabyte external magnetic spinning disc that was plugged into the server Mac with like her the SCSI cable.

757
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,186
Rym: Oh my god, beautiful.

758
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:45,420
Scott: It had sim CD 2000 and all everyone save games on it.

759
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,480
Rym: It was like I remember the first time someone said they copied a CD to their hard drive and I called bullshit.

760
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:52,832
Rym: Yeah, I was like, there's no hard drive that big.

761
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:54,220
Scott: we didn't have a CD around there.

762
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:56,933
Scott: Other things that happened at the summer camp.

763
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,100
Scott: they would always after lunch.

764
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,780

766
00:52:03,893 --> 00:52:10,780
Scott: Yeah after Always after dinner at no other time of the day did they offer this activity on the loudspeaker?

767
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:17,320
Scott: But after dinner it was guaranteed to be adventure games behind the food at the picnic table.

768
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:22,839
Scott: Adventure games meant one of the following Magic the gathering with the cards you brought to camp.

769
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:26,957
Scott: Yep It's not like you could get more unless someone mailed you some which I brought my magic cards to.

770
00:52:26,997 --> 00:52:29,585
Rym: most of the camp They wouldn't mail us magic cards.

771
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:31,490
Scott: That's I'd be like mom mail more magic cards.

772

Scott: All right, or more D&D or Battle tech.

773
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:40,357

777
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,254
