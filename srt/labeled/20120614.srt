00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,630
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday, June 14th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,111
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:16,708
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight hats Cuz.

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,340
Rym: we couldn't think of anything better.

5
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:20,999
Scott: That's every episode.

6
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,207
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:30,364
Rym: So I got a funny story that I think relates to a funny story.

8
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:35,090
Rym: you had my uh My GoPro fucking fell off my bike while I was riding.

9
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,455
Scott: Yours is still in one piece.

10
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:39,567
Rym: well because I caught it in my hand and then it fell.

11
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,810
Rym: so I picked it up right away And it was fine.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,830
Rym: But the mount literally like I was riding and the mount just like Went whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa and before my brain could react the thing just fell like out of nowhere.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,296
Rym: Yeah, just cleaved in two.

14
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:53,630
Scott: Yeah mine alright, so broke in the exact same way.

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,770
Scott: Yeah around the same time yours broke, and I just I didn't even realize it was falling.

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,529
Scott: It was just like click click clickety clickety, and I was like whoa and I picked it up.

17
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,422
Scott: But then I got a new.

18
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:07,770
Scott: I emailed them And I was like hey that shit broke and they sent me a free replacement.

19
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:09,155
Scott: So I put the free replacement on.

20
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,544
Scott: that shit broke and I didn't even realize it.

21
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,669
Scott: I had to backtrack.

22
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:20,208
Scott: luckily I found the GoPro lying in the middle of the road about five blocks back on my route Going against traffic you know to search for it.

23
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:24,861
Scott: But the camera was completely destroyed like smash smash like Hulk.

24
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:30,929
Scott: well like it was in the shield right the black Clip on top of the shield that keeps the shield sealed.

25
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,536
Rym: We thought you knew what I was laughing at.

26
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:38,610
Scott: yeah that black clip was just shattered in pieces that I picked up off the ground.

27
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,850
Scott: Right yeah, the shield itself was mostly in one piece.

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,709
Scott: Just has some you know scarring on the back of it the the you know these.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,595
Scott: You know the back part that you.

30
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,219
Rym: but my camera gets smashed.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,665
Scott: the camera is in one piece.

32
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:55,676
Scott: the LCD part is Smashed the but there's no LCD.

33
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,902
Scott: Yeah on the front a little tiny one.

34
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:00,990
Rym: Oh, okay that thing it smashed the buttons.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:12,950
Scott: You can't press them right And like it doesn't from far away It looks like it's in one piece, but you get close to it, and you realize it's like bork right and basically It's non-functional.

36
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:14,695
Rym: So GoPro.

37
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:23,124
Rym: I want to point out the same mount that you sell broke three times in New York like biking around town biking.

38
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,330
Rym: this wasn't even a hardcore mount.

39
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,416
Scott: Yeah, this was not jumping off a cliff skiing or skydiving Wasn't even like jumping over curbs.

40
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,447
Scott: Yeah, this is regular old just biking around the city.

41
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,410
Scott: this mount breaks.

42
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:39,314
Scott: This is why I realized third-party companies are selling metal mounts Which I ordered.

43
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:40,498
Scott: so I'm like.

44
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:43,146
Scott: I email GoPro, and I'm like hey this time the mount broke again.

45
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:43,989
Scott: Which is bullshit I?

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,465
Scott: Want it, but my camera broke because your mount was faulty.

47
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:55,950
Scott: and they're like well We'll give you half off a new camera, and I'm like you should take him to small claims court or something just for fun.

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,950
Scott: I mean, it's like I can't because it's like the warranty.

49
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:58,556
Scott: I'm like.

50
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:06,499
Scott: I'm like I don't want to be that Indignant lady that I because I can't complain about the indignant lady and be the indignant lady true But at the same time there is a big difference in dignity.

51
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:14,066
Rym: indignant ladies that particular brand of person Will annoy everybody else around them and be in their way.

52
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,290
Rym: you can't get away from that lady.

53
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,801
Rym: It's not indignant lady if you're doing it on your own quietly.

54
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:20,927
Scott: I'm still bothering this customer service person.

55
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,930
Scott: It's not their fault, right?

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,247
Scott: They're not the person who made the shitty mount or decided the warranty policy.

57
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:29,047
Rym: if GoPro We just had a little thing that said like warning don't actually use this on a bike.

58
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:29,509
Rym: It'll break.

59
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,421
Scott: Yeah, this bike mount that we have pictures of using on a bike.

60
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,970
Rym: yes next to your purportedly indestructible camera Yeah, but anyway.

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:45,934
Scott: So I guess I bought the surf edition for half off to replace the one I had because at least that way I'll get some new accessories.

62
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:57,367
Scott: I didn't have before and they also offered me a free mounting accessory, so I guess I'm getting the wrist strap We could use that for that was the only Accessory that would be of any use that you didn't already own right, but here's what you got to do.

63
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:02,570
Scott: if you have a GoPro You know they only really show examples of this in these surfing examples.

64
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:10,918
Scott: But if you mount it to something and you're moving or at all you should also Tether it to that something with a rope.

65
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,570
Rym: or I do that when I ski because the thing is biking all right.

66
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:23,326
Rym: I can go back and get it though apparently in your case that didn't really work now, but If I'm skiing you're down a hill and it's now this camera is up the hill.

67
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,257
Rym: it is Basically impossible to go back up the turn.

68
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:29,869
Scott: this you have to turn 90 degrees sideways and go right left right like a ladder.

69
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,270
Rym: I can do a sort of fishbone thing where you're walking forward.

70
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:36,557
Rym: There's a couple of ways to do it But it's a pain in the ass sucks and it hurts.

71
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,743
Rym: and if I go all the way down and ski back up like at A real mountain all right.

72
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:41,449
Rym: It's been an hour.

73
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:47,802
Rym: Let's see if it's still there And if I can even find it and you got to stop before you get to it If you stop below it that I would cry.

74
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:48,747
Rym: I think I would just cry.

75
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,370
Rym: she's a grown man.

76
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,747
Scott: You could ask the ski patrol to help you get it.

77
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:58,306
Rym: Yeah, actually luckily one thing you could do is if you ever drop anything skiing not that you'll ever go skiing.

78
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:05,310
Rym: I get the impression Yeah, you can just basically if anyone's coming down the hill be like hey And they'll usually grab whatever you drop and give it to you.

79
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,894
Scott: That's not bad.

80
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,346
Rym: just the GoPro is kind of tiny.

81
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:13,349
Rym: usually It's like a ski pole and it's gonna be buried in the snow yeah, or a ski or something that they're picking up for me.

82
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:21,034
Rym: So yeah GoPro, I guess we could leverage our negative publicity machine Whatever that you know.

83
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:35,670
Scott: and the thing is it became a little more frustrating because the way they worded their customer service email was pretty Much like hey order a new one then tell us the order number, then we'll take half off right, so I'm like okay I did that and then I. and then they're like yeah, there was a miscommunication.

84
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:39,490
Scott: You actually have to sort of you know.

85
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:50,210
Scott: Send us a picture you receive and then we'll take you send you a coupon code a picture of my receipt you mean the email I guess and I'm like what the fuck you told me to do this.

86
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,716
Scott: And then they're like no and they sent.

87
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,730
Scott: I sent them the quote from the email that they originally say to that.

88
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:59,685
Scott: They sent the quote of the full email and actually the just the way their email was worded is.

89
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:03,661
Scott: there was a sentence later in The email that was like about the coupon code.

90
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:05,410
Rym: Oh, so you got owned there.

91
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,865
Rym: Yeah, but the poorly written, but it was poorly written, but it's not your thing on the forum.

92
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,350
Rym: read all the words.

93
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,943
Scott: It was yeah, or you're a dumbass you I guarantee.

94
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:17,841
Scott: if you would have gotten the same email You would have done the same stupid thing.

95
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:18,890
Rym: you know we hadn't talked about this.

96
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,919
Rym: You could have showed me the email and be like what do you do?

97
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,045
Rym: and we could have seen.

98
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:22,848
Rym: but now we can't.

99
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,315
Rym: cuz now I know it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:25,179
Scott: It's still.

101
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,710
Scott: the point is is that their mount broke.

102
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,510
Scott: They should have replaced the camera, which is a lot of money.

103
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:34,908
Rym: They shouldn't sell a mount that clearly doesn't is faulty and they know it's faulty.

104
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,790
Scott: if you go to reviews everyone says yeah this mount breaks.

105
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,415
Rym: I've done class action.

106
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:43,787
Scott: the Amazon the Amazon reviews for the metal mounts from the third-party company are like man.

107
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,348
Scott: this thing's overpriced But it works.

108
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:51,890
Scott: I'll probably just get it because I want to start like 60 bucks for like a metal ring with a stick coming out of it.

109
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,573
Scott: It's a bunch of bull.

110
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,301
Rym: Well if that's bullshit make your own.

111
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,764
Scott: I Don't know how to.

112
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,686
Rym: So I don't really have news per se.

113
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:04,250
Rym: it's Thursday.

114
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:10,947
Rym: You know the lounge your mom But we did go see Prometheus, so I guess I want to geek bite it a little bit.

115
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,579
Rym: all right You know what.

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,649
Rym: it was a pretty good movie.

117
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,727
Scott: Dude gets his guts ripped open his liver gets pecked and it they just keep this.

118
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:18,370
Rym: this is a movie.

119
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:26,088
Rym: This is the first time in my life There is an early scene with an automated surgery table and by God was that not Chekhov's surgery table.

120
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,375
Rym: everyone knew that I saw the thing.

121
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:36,281
Rym: I was like somebody's gonna have an alien Extracted from their abdomen with that thing within the bounds of this movie and sure enough Yeah, I don't even consider that a spoiler.

122
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:36,964
Rym: No.

123
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,530
Rym: There's an automated surgery.

124
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,230
Scott: That's pretty much the best scene in the whole movie.

125
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,019
Scott: That was the yeah the using of the checkup surgery.

126
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,984
Rym: the second best scene not to spoil anything is when one person asks another person to question and then that person is like oh, and then he answers it.

127
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:59,459
Rym: I Don't remember what seemed the whoa the question that we didn't understand And the way it was answered.

128
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,804
Rym: yeah, that was it was a good scene But the movie was pretty good.

129
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:04,830
Rym: the special effects were great.

130
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:10,990
Rym: I like how they use 3d in this movie because I've seen most 3d movies that I have seen.

131
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:19,650
Rym: Either have like the shit coming at you Or shrunk the audience or they're really just like it's shoehorned in and done poorly.

132
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,790
Rym: But Prometheus was actually filmed with 3d cameras, and it showed like it was like night and day compared to other 3d movies.

133
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,576
Scott: Yeah, but it was all right, but that's the thing.

134
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:33,342
Scott: it's like they didn't have anything coming at you right and at the same time You know they.

135
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:34,083
Scott: you know they didn't.

136
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,937
Scott: you know really go whoa 3d whoa, so it's like a lot of times You just don't even notice.

137
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,366
Rym: That's the best way to use 3d.

138
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,336
Scott: Have the 3d why then?

139
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:49,790
Rym: it's it's atmospheric like notice how now I could like focus on the foreground in the background And you got this really big sense of space.

140
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,190
Rym: There's a contrast between the wide open areas on the planet and the confined areas inside the depth of the tunnels.

141
00:08:55,511 --> 00:09:01,030
Rym: But it really shown every time there was a user interface to a thing like that was breathtaking.

142
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:05,610
Scott: I think what you really got to do to make 3d really have stuff come out at the screen?

143
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:07,916
Rym: No Because that's what you seem to be going for.

144
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,104
Scott: no see the problem with all 3d.

145
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:14,689
Scott: whether you got IMAX 3d Omnimax any kind of 3d movie right that we have now.

146
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:20,737
Scott: Yeah, is that even though there's some sort of depth perception you can tell that that's farther away That's sort of closer right.

147
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,330
Scott: It's still a two-dimensional image.

148
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,332
Scott: You can't like lean your head to the left and look behind a thing a little bit Right.

149
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:31,430
Scott: if they could make it do that somehow don't ask me how I don't even know is possible.

150
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:34,220
Rym: I don't really want that.

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,922
Scott: but see that's what.

152
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:35,544
Scott: but that's the thing.

153
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,688
Scott: is it's like it's.

154
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:40,759
Scott: you know It's not really 3d because it's still you're just.

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,841
Scott: it's really just this square and some pieces a rectangle and some pieces of the rectangle Are closer, but there's nothing behind them.

156
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:47,584
Scott: They're not round.

157
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:48,569
Scott: There's nothing behind them.

158
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:49,796
Scott: It's not really

159
00:09:50,138 --> 00:10:05,330
Rym: 3d, but at the same time you could argue that for most movies There's a camera angle and by giving people leeway to poke around in there Then now all those elements that previously in a screenplay don't have to be worried about have to be worried about Makes it harder for director to actually have like a unified vision.

160
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,050
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is right is how much can you really move your head in a movie, right?

161
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,441
Scott: It doesn't need to be.

162
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:17,630
Rym: you know, you want You want the televisions from that fucked up show that I've talked about.

163
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:21,550
Rym: I seem to the only person in the world who remembers this and watched it from my generation.

164
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:36,314
Rym: but our wild palms The plot of wild palms of the hologram other than being about Scientology is that they make a device that replaces TV that sits in the living room and the action just takes place in 3d in Your living room.

165
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,350
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't need to be the hologram in the middle of the room.

166
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:45,910
Scott: I just want it to be to really enhance that 3d effect is You know, there's like a ball on the screen if I lean my head a little bit to the left.

167
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:49,010
Scott: It should be like, you know, like my angle should change.

168
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,436
Scott: That can be done.

169
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:57,804
Rym: it can't be done right now for multiple people at the same time I know without everyone having active glasses as opposed to passive.

170
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,575
Rym: I know and by active I mean more active than anything.

171
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:03,290
Scott: But anyway, but I'm saying that I'm saying that's what would really make.

172
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:12,490
Scott: Like if 3d significantly, you know doing the subtle 3d The way it's done is probably the right way to use it without making your movie into an amusement park ride.

173
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,309
Scott: But what I'm saying is it's not really that much.

174
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:20,830
Scott: You know, it's like you can see it in 2d and be just fine because the 3d doesn't add that much.

175
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,550
Scott: But if it added that that little I got is I then it would be a significant.

176
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:34,119
Rym: I would disagree in that there are a few scenes in Prometheus that if they weren't in 3d would not have been nearly as breathtaking Especially when they turn on the HUD on the alien thing.

177
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,290
Rym: Hey, and well you you you once argued that aesthetics are meaningless.

178
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,315
Rym: So anyway But I like this.

179
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:50,641
Rym: movies like this that use 3d in this way are the kinds of movies that'll make 3d actually be just a Technology that's used or not used properly as opposed to a gimmick?

180
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:56,519
Rym: because for the last what 40 plus years It's been a gimmick every time 3d has been.

181
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,234
Scott: it was a gimmick for so many years right because our 3d Technology was sort of crappy.

182
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:05,062
Scott: right red and blue 3d doesn't really work that well.

183
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:07,669
Scott: now the 3d actually kind of sort of works.

184
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:07,909
Scott: ish.

185
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:13,171
Scott: That's the reason you know, and you can do it with these cheap plastic glasses, you know It's.

186
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,961
Scott: it's not that obtrusive like it used to be.

187
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,430
Rym: but in terms of you know Prometheus pretty good movie.

188
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:26,380
Rym: I liked it better than I liked Avengers, but not by that much, but and it raised good questions, but I There's a big discussion going on in our forums.

189
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,410
Rym: I've seen a lot of similar discussions around the internet.

190
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,093
Rym: I'm not arguing.

191
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:31,257
Rym: It's the greatest movie in the world.

192
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,830
Rym: It is by no means alien and aliens are both much better movie.

193
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,555
Rym: But for me the is.

194
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:44,235
Rym: there are things that you can legitimately complain about both from a semi-objective critical and from a taste like.

195
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:56,530
Rym: I liked or didn't like this standpoint, but the majority of the criticisms I've seen online are Basically bullshit like they're the criticisms of someone who didn't actually watch the movie or at least someone who didn't pay attention.

196
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:03,292
Rym: They'll complain about things that they'll say like I didn't understand X or why didn't make sense when actually it made Perfect.

197
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,539
Scott: people say the same things about anything.

198
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,946
Scott: That's sort of weird and ambiguous right.

199
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:13,245
Scott: instead of being just a literal Straightforward what you see is what you think they complain about her.

200
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:14,190
Rym: literal and straightforward.

201
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,646
Rym: They're like, why did the guy, you know giggle and mess around with the alien?

202
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:22,501
Scott: Well, he was high Something that wasn't explicitly stated right?

203
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,270
Rym: No, but I'm saying things that were pretty much explicitly stated.

204
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,869
Scott: We're also points of confusion, but I mean that you know, but I'm saying it's not.

205
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:45,030
Scott: There's a difference between explicitly stated as in oh, yeah There was a shot of the guy getting high versus you know The constant reminder for dumb people that is in a lot of media in the United States Like you show the guy hitting little guy and it says I hit you you little guy.

206
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,710
Scott: So there's no way you can miss it right as opposed to we watch a lot of animes, right?

207
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:59,902
Scott: You know, you watch your tenor and it's like yeah They showed it to you for like a second and if you weren't paying attention because you have no attention span You would have missed it.

208
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:07,054
Scott: and you know If you weren't actually, you know focusing on the action and looking at all the things on the screen You would have missed that.

209
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:12,155
Scott: so, you know because they didn't hammer it into people and they don't have attention spans They don't have focus.

210
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:20,530
Scott: They miss things that aren't repeated or Really focused on and highlighted with you know, big spotlights on them, right?

211
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,510
Scott: So any movie that doesn't have all those things or book or anything like that a lot of people just miss those things.

212
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,296
Scott: And then they say it made no sense.

213
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:32,090
Scott: Well, it made sense to me just like evangelical antenna make perfect sense to me.

214
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,394
Scott: I know exactly what's going on.

215
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,890
Scott: All right, there's no ambiguity like ooh, I can explain any scene.

216
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,130
Scott: I will tell you what's going on, right but a lot of people are like it makes no sense.

217
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,063
Scott: Well, there are things out there that make no sense.

218
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:45,110
Scott: These aren't them.

219
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,034
Rym: well, I guess that's my point.

220
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:49,349
Rym: the things that people say made no sense were actually the things that were the most obvious.

221
00:14:49,369 --> 00:15:01,808
Rym: and Peep I would have a lot more respect for these criticisms if they actually touched on the things that seem more legitimately Confusing or poorly done anything that's not perfect can be criticized which is everything.

222
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:07,244
Rym: So In general nerds I see peep nerds in general seem to mess up two things.

223
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:17,630
Rym: when they try to critique something that they like Or that they hate one They they confuse not liking a character with the character being well represented.

224
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:22,108
Scott: Well, I mean pretty much it's the same thing we've been discussing for 10 billion years.

225
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:31,630
Rym: They don't like Katniss in the book Hunger Games But really what they're saying is I don't like teenage girls and I don't want to read about what a teenage girl's doing Which is fine.

226
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,210
Rym: That means you don't like Hunger Games because you don't like that kind of story that kind of character.

227
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,207
Rym: But it doesn't mean that is not an accurate representation of that character.

228
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:45,146
Scott: Well presented I'm just saying this is the same thing We've discussed a billion years a billion times that people will never figure out and that will.

229
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:57,229
Scott: that is what separates People who can validly critique something and people who can't is people who can separate their personal feelings From their evaluation of a thing no matter what that thing is or what category it is.

230
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:06,190
Scott: You just go on the internet and you find people arguing about anything a video game a book a movie Right and people will 99 times out of a jillion.

231
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,200
Rym: Well, ninety nine point up in the ante on these numbers here.

232
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:22,129
Scott: Yeah the overwhelming majority of the time All you know almost a hundred percent of the time somebody if they like the thing they will argue the thing is good And if they don't like the thing they will argue that it is not good.

233
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:30,535
Rym: Well as funny as I remember when I said well cannot separate their personal and I said in the forum that Avengers was okay People acted like.

234
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:34,190
Rym: I told them that their puppy is a bad puppy and I'm gonna kill it and then I actually killed.

235
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:43,642
Scott: They have personal feelings for Avengers and therefore they you know got good feelings in their body when they watched the movie there You know, they had good emotions.

236
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:44,387
Scott: They found out.

237
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,654
Rym: Scott I gotta get a point of the way.

238
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:49,270
Rym: the way you present, you know, we're we have the same argument.

239
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:52,905
Rym: You present it in a somewhat more caustic fashion.

240
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,170
Scott: What's caustic about this?

241
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:54,831
Rym: I don't know.

242
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:55,815
Rym: you you you free.

243
00:16:55,835 --> 00:17:00,150
Scott: people watch people watch a thing or read a thing or whatever and they feel good.

244
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,616
Scott: It gives them good feelings.

245
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:02,781
Scott: It scratches their itch.

246
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:03,444
Scott: They like it.

247
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,188
Scott: They enjoy it.

248
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,203
Scott: Therefore they say that makes the thing good.

249
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,910
Scott: That is not the case, right?

250
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,869
Scott: Get good feelings watching.

251
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:16,942
Rym: You're making an unspoken argument that you are there for the urban edge.

252
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:17,905
Rym: that is no.

253
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:18,688
Scott: I'm making an argument.

254
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:34,023
Scott: The unspoken argument is that I have the ability to separate my From evaluating things and many people if they have that ability do not exhibit I'm smarter than everyone and you're all stupid.

255
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:36,838
Scott: a Lot of people most people are stupid.

256
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:37,683
Scott: Everybody knows that.

257
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:42,057
Scott: I'm just saying There is an ability that I have.

258
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:46,150
Scott: other people have not demonstrated to me that they also have this ability.

259
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:55,089
Rym: I'm just making a tangential point that this is why we can both say the same Argument in the same thread and people will disagree with you and agree with me even though we said the exact same thing.

260
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,570
Scott: So, how would you word that differently?

261
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,110
Scott: That is not but you but also say the same.

262
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,098
Rym: I would word it mostly the way I was wording it before.

263
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,050
Rym: talk a lot more about the ideas of valid invalid criticism of what?

264
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,141
Rym: They mean and what people get out of a movie without directly Impinging upon the perceived intelligence of the people.

265
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:13,285
Scott: but why what is that?

266
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:14,710
Scott: I didn't say anything of anyone's intelligence.

267
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,809
Scott: I just said there's an ability that I have.

268
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,430
Scott: Are you saying that like you're the one implying that if someone does indeed lack that ability that they are unintelligent.

269
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,093
Rym: I just don't coach.

270
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:25,662
Scott: you're making a logical leap there.

271
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:26,908
Scott: No, you are also Scott.

272
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:38,590
Rym: however, I'm pointing out that if you are arguing with other people or Discussing something in a Buzz Aldrin fashion for the benefit of other people You have to take into account the way they will likely interpret your words.

273
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:47,050
Scott: If they cannot interpret words properly Maybe that that is why they are upset because they have discovered the truth that they are less intelligent.

274
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,530
Rym: But at the same time that is if they were intelligent as they claim.

275
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,543
Scott: Right because you shouldn't be insulted by someone calling you dumb if you're not.

276
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:58,839
Scott: if you are dumb because then it's true You can't be insulted by the truth You should only be insulted if you're actually not dumb.

277
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,730
Scott: right and someone called you dumb then there's a reason to be insulted.

278
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:07,114
Scott: So if you aren't dumb you should be able to interpret those words properly Wouldn't you say so?

279
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,950
Scott: and if you interpreted those words properly, you wouldn't be insulted by them.

280
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:10,211
Scott: I

281
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:22,609
Rym: have no comment because I have a vested interest in maintaining my ability to convince people of the exact same things you want to without Hitting that shield or that barrier that you inevitably you're like a Klingon ship coming into an argument and

282
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:22,910
Scott: captain

283
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,302
Rym: What the fuck is that shields all the way up, right?

284
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:25,664
Rym: They see me.

285
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:26,830
Rym: They're like, oh crazy.

286
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:32,878
Scott: So I never actually said the people lack the ability You don't have to.

287
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:38,370
Scott: I say that the people have not Demonstrated their possession of this ability, right?

288
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,771
Scott: and if they get upset by that and make the logical leap to sit to that they don't have the ability and that therefore they Are dumb.

289
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:48,009
Scott: if they make that logical leap they are then not aren't they?

290
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,188
Scott: Admitting they don't have the ability.

291
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,200
Scott: perhaps however Simply by are they not wrecking?

292
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,676
Scott: and and the thing is they also Never make a movement.

293
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,970
Scott: They also never argue that I do not have the ability.

294
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,050
Scott: No one ever tries to do that.

295
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:09,034
Scott: They they never try to do that nor do they try to prove that they do have the ability or they don't even discuss that At all.

296
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:15,830
Scott: luckily, they just humbly admit It's like they silently admit that I'm right and then just say you're insulting me.

297
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:16,715
Rym: You have to come in.

298
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:19,110
Rym: No, you have to come in with the self-deprecation first.

299
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,636
Rym: You do something like like what you.

300
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:23,106
Scott: I have an ability who don't have.

301
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:29,584
Rym: no you need to come in Earlier with the I like initial D. Initial D is a terrible show.

302
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:33,977
Scott: Yeah, I come out with that all the time But I have the ability.

303
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:41,505
Rym: is that remember you have to frame the debate in terms of your own self-deprecation In order to make other people lower their shields and then you can worm the point in.

304
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:45,725
Rym: but anyway, I say to your good sir What is your news today Thursday in the lounge?

305
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,827
Scott: So finally Finally yeah, we got some big movement here, right?

306
00:20:50,410 --> 00:21:05,284
Scott: Cuz you know pretty much one of the number one things troubling especially nerd communities if not the whole internet community these days other than arguments on the internet exactly is the Accessibility of video programming particularly television programming.

307
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:05,826
Rym: Wait a minute.

308
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,858
Rym: Wait a minute You're just what is you're doing?

309
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:11,710
Rym: because I had my backup news of why everyone's pirating Game of Thrones.

310
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,821
Scott: Mine is related but not that news.

311
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:14,243
Rym: Okay.

312
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:14,705
Rym: Okay.

313
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:15,530
Rym: Anyway, go on go.

314
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,085
Scott: So, you know and it is the whole HBO thing with the Game of Thrones, right?

315
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,150
Scott: Let's tie the news together.

316
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,259
Scott: Okay, cuz we did.

317
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,348
Scott: we just talked about something else.

318
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:28,189
Scott: So fine, and you know, there's the Hulu and Netflix are gimped because the cable companies got a lock-in.

319
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:42,210
Scott: Yeah, like you can watch stuff on your Xbox or your PC But only if you have pay for cable and login with your cable login Like you can watch ESPN on your Xbox if you pay for ESPN on your cable Which is like well, but then what the fuck do I need it on my Xbox?

320
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:51,230
Rym: What's interesting is that he's letting me use my Xbox as a cable box But as we know, you know for that case, I would be perfectly willing to pay for just ESPN without cable, right?

321
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:58,806
Scott: And it's like oh, yeah, you can pay for just baseball but on your phone Which I did one or two years in a row when I got first got the iPhone 3g, right?

322
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,238
Scott: Yeah, you can't get Mets games.

323
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:02,343
Scott: who's gonna use the GPS?

324
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,329
Scott: you found out that you're in New York So we're gonna block all New York games.

325
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,540
Scott: It's like well then why the fuck did I pay 10 bucks for this app?

326
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,750
Scott: if I can only watch frickin Seattle Mariners and Milwaukee Brewers?

327
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:13,467
Scott: I only care about the fucking meds.

328
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,094
Scott: But you're using the GPS to figure out that I'm in New York and if I don't let you activate the GPS You won't let me watch anything.

329
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,045
Rym: Meanwhile, if I don't pay and I just do a pirate stream.

330
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,390
Rym: I can see everything just fine.

331
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,569
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, there's you know, there's this whole thing that you know, we everyone knows this topic, right?

332
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:39,220
Scott: Yeah So the Department of Justice finally is doing something my favorite department I know other than I'll call tobacco and firearms justice.

333
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,764
Scott: She's got a blindfold over eyes.

334
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:42,269
Scott: She's really good at magical drop.

335
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:46,398
Scott: No She knows how much things weigh.

336
00:22:46,418 --> 00:22:54,249
Scott: it always gets it even anyway, so What they're doing is they're going after, you know Comcast Time Warner, etc.

337
00:22:54,611 --> 00:23:03,709
Scott: But you know everybody saying hey We're gonna try to see if you're doing any antitrust business trying to gimp competition from Hulu Netflix, etc.

338
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:07,726
Scott: On purpose to you know, keep with your cable monopoly, right.

339
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,054
Scott: survey says Yes, right.

340
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:17,018
Scott: So cable is a monopoly right and it's sort of you know, it's one of the right and it's a local monopoly Monopoly in a local right?

341
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:17,742
Scott: It's a monopoly.

342
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:21,781
Scott: and the rule the law in the u.s Is not that you are not allowed to have a monopoly.

343
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,510
Scott: YKK has a monopoly on zippers.

344
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,938
Scott: They are allowed to have a monopoly on zippers right.

345
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:29,410
Scott: Microsoft Windows is allowed to have a monopoly on operating systems, right?

346
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:36,730
Scott: What is illegal is to use your monopoly power in one area to thwart competition.

347
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:43,110
Scott: Right, because if you have a monopoly on zippers like YKK does right if I tried to compete in the zipper department.

348
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:44,308
Scott: I'm gonna take them on.

349
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:54,910
Rym: They're not allowed to use the advantages they have of being the existing Monopoly like saying if you ever buy another zipper from another company, we're gonna not let you buy any YKK zippers again, right?

350
00:23:55,151 --> 00:24:02,166
Scott: So if there's a you know, Uniqlo wants to buy zippers from me, right YKK could be like well We're not gonna sell you any of our zippers if you buy theirs.

351
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:05,309
Scott: and you know They only want to buy some of ours and some of theirs and I'll do that.

352
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:08,286
Scott: Like when Intel was like Dell you got to buy Intel.

353
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:09,050
Scott: shit, you know, I'll do that.

354
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,163
Rym: Oh my god, that was right around the arrow when I really hated Intel.

355
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:14,565
Scott: or you know and Microsoft is like Windows You can't be like.

356
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,494
Scott: well We're gonna make sure.

357
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,649
Scott: we're gonna use our Windows monopoly to get Internet Explorer everywhere and I'll do that.

358
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:24,870
Scott: So basically what they're saying is hey these people with the cable monopoly are using their cable monopoly.

359
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:29,042
Scott: prevent competition Netflix Hulu etc.

360
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:37,270
Scott: No So the Department of Justice is investigating but most specifically they're investigating the bandwidth limiting, right?

361
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:46,210
Scott: It's like oh well If you have like an AT&T mobile phone the be using ABC's video app doesn't contribute to the bandwidth cap.

362
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:52,348
Scott: But using Netflix does giving your existing monopoly on you know an advantage of.

363
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:58,975
Scott: you know Alright, and this is what Comcast when they merge with NBC Specifically agreed not to do.

364
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,400
Rym: Yeah guys, so because

365
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:14,059
Scott: reality so that's why they're honing in on this one specific Usage, you know because that's one that they have on paper somewhere that they can really nail them on if they discover that it has In fact been done and you really much guarantee it has.

366
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:21,983
Scott: so let's see how big the balls of the Department of Justice are And maybe the FCC can bring back the a la carte cable and etc.

367
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:22,284
Scott: etc.

368
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:22,565
Rym: thing is.

369
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,276
Rym: a la carte cable is 15 years too late.

370
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,750
Scott: I'm just saying but we could maybe get right what they should have.

371
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:29,755
Scott: I don't even know why.

372
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,770
Scott: see I don't know why the cool cable companies don't do this, right?

373
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,819
Scott: We know why the stuffy ones don't do it right way.

374
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,970
Rym: name a cool cable company, right?

375
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,632
Scott: So we know why.

376
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:40,443
Scott: name one a cool cable channel cable company.

377
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:40,503
Rym: No.

378
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,190
Scott: No, I'm coming channels.

379
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:47,430
Rym: Okay, maybe a cool cable channel that isn't HBO or Showtime isn't Comedy Central is pretty cool, right?

380
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,257
Scott: Even though it's owned by Viacom which is not cool.

381
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:59,203
Rym: Yep, but cable sent Comedy Central itself is cool But I actually though my trouble with Comedy Central is that most of the programming for the last I don't know ten years I've not cared about.

382
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:10,780
Rym: no really only things I like on Comedy Central are South Park in the Daily Show and the Daily Show web app has Possibly the second most annoying advertising scheme in the world.

383
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:14,110
Scott: That's also broken but I'm saying is like look be comedy central.

384
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,670
Scott: It's already cool enough to let you watch South Park Daily Show just on their web.

385
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:24,914
Rym: I have a feeling that Daily Show and South Park are only there like that because those two particular shit No, not just those.

386
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:29,278
Rym: Yeah those shows the people who make them have a lot of Independent power and cash.

387
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:29,519
Rym: right.

388
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,910
Rym: Trey Parker and Matt Stone can basically go to comedy central.

389
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,510
Rym: They look we will fuck you if you fuck with them, right?

390
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:42,626
Scott: But anyway, I don't know why for example comedy central or some other cable channel that actually has viewers as opposed to the ones that Don't have viewers like time, right?

391
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,794
Scott: says go to Comedy central comm.

392
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:52,410
Scott: there's a video player right there and you can watch street live streaming Comedy Central 24/7.

393
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,061
Scott: It's the exact same thing that's on our channel on TV.

394
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:56,366
Scott: You don't need cable anymore.

395
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:57,250
Scott: Just come to our website.

396
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,615
Scott: Fuck all the cable companies.

397
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:03,230
Scott: and if every channel did that right independently one is better for the advertisers.

398
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:08,664
Scott: The problem is is this exact monopolistic antitrust practice?

399
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:13,220
Scott: is you know You have the companies that own the cable right?

400
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:17,150
Scott: cable vision also owns cable channels like MSG.

401
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:26,710
Scott: They don't want to just let you watch Ranger games on the computer because then you won't also You know pay them in a day, you know, they get the advertising from that which they already get on MSG.

402
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,342
Scott: but in addition They're getting money from you every month to pay for the cable vision.

403
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:42,070
Scott: if they they basically just Doing what we want them to do which is go to MSG comm watch Ranger games It's basically just throwing away all the money that they get from people subscribing.

404
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:47,654
Rym: Well, this is a problem that Sony has had for a long time that when you've got multiple You know, you're a big enough company.

405
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:48,839
Rym: to where do you have multiple arms?

406
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,689
Rym: any company in the modern world who was into both?

407
00:27:52,650 --> 00:28:06,289
Rym: distribution of content and creation of content that isn't just completely independent and Has these weird sort of conflict of interest within themselves where if one wing of the company as well It'll basically destroy the other wing of the company, right?

408
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:12,450
Rym: If I were the heads of these companies, I would be rapidly trying to spin off all the legacy stuff.

409
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:18,601
Rym: I would spin off the networks on their own and get the content creation Separate and I would stay on the content creation boat, right?

410
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:23,610
Scott: Well, see that's the one thing I don't understand Is that there's no one in any of these companies realize this?

411
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:24,936
Scott: This is the thing I don't get.

412
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:28,090
Scott: is that you know, there's only like six media companies really, right?

413
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:40,705
Scott: But you would think that if one company of the six went for it and said we're gonna sacrifice our old shitty Distribution business just let it Peter out right and we're just gonna put all our content online the modern way.

414
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:48,227
Scott: that that one Right, even though would have a temporary setback in revenues right of people bailing and just.

415
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:55,910
Scott: well, you know watching online Whatever right would gain favor from the people's of course, they would gain advertising money of the wazoo, right?

416
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,135
Rym: I actually said wazoo.

417
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:57,839
Rym: That's how much money.

418
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:03,649
Scott: I think they would gain money from people Just paying them for their shows directly, which is what people want to do.

419
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:06,920
Scott: You know the good shows at least right and three.

420
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:14,850
Scott: all of the other companies now would be at a competitive Disadvantage and that one awesome company would be getting newer better content.

421
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:20,646
Rym: So Scott, I think it comes That these are large companies right in any large company.

422
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:24,910
Rym: There's a lot of momentum Yeah, and there are people who carve out tiny little empires.

423
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:32,987
Rym: So the guy in the company who has a lot of power, but is his boat is completely tied To the old legacy.

424
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:39,427
Scott: shit It's a god if it has to come from the guys at the top who have the most power And the least vision in these cases.

425
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:45,736
Rym: Yep But anyway, I mean look I work for a small company and basically the heads of the company every day are like What can we do this crazy?

426
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:46,299
Rym: What should we do?

427
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,806
Rym: Let's fuck everything over and start.

428
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:48,650
Rym: Let's just go crazy.

429
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:51,279
Rym: They want they don't push it faster than I would push.

430
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,430
Rym: Meanwhile, the big, you know big companies, you know, I used to work at IBM.

431
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:04,098
Scott: Basically there is so much momentum but right but it makes you think these six seven media companies are competing with each other Theoretically, but they're also.

432
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,727
Rym: they're collaborating right.

433
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:19,850
Scott: only way This could still be clearly collusion which is also illegal because if there wasn't collusion Some of them would pick orange right and Cut out and be like, all right, we're gonna bail, you know, I don't think Viacom owns.

434
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:24,022
Scott: Time Warner owns cable NBC Comcast has regular kid.

435
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:24,805
Scott: I don't think Viacom.

436
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,230
Scott: I think Viacom just has content.

437
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,756
Scott: Do they own a cable operator?

438
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:28,800
Scott: I'm not sure.

439
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:29,382
Scott: RCN.

440
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:29,804
Scott: I don't know.

441
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:30,908
Rym: I don't think so, right?

442
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,470
Rym: So that's a separate show on this.

443
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:35,053
Scott: Research that.

444
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:35,695
Scott: but what you know?

445
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,082
Scott: one of them that only does content, you know.

446
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,610
Scott: could we know Fox News Corp has you know?

447
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:42,016
Scott: Cable and whatever right?

448
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:42,317
Rym: Yeah.

449
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:42,799
Rym: Well, look at this.

450
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:52,539
Rym: if I if if you didn't think about the corporate relationships HBO is probably the best position as a Thing that's owned by it's all my time Warner.

451
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:53,482
Rym: Yeah, but here's the thing.

452
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:54,064
Rym: HBO.

453
00:30:54,104 --> 00:31:01,628
Rym: if it were its own thing still It would be able to basically be the one that does that and they were probably the guy who runs HBO.

454
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,014
Scott: He's on video.

455
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,621
Scott: people have asked him this stuff and he's just.

456
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,510
Scott: he's the oldest thinking fuddy-duddy.

457
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,870
Rym: Well HBO is owned by Time Warner and Time Warner would get fucked if HBO destroyed the old model.

458
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:16,627
Rym: But I think HBO as a network could single-handedly destroy the old model.

459
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:17,210
Rym: possibly.

460
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:18,335
Rym: I think they're the.

461
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:19,720
Rym: I think they're actually the only ones who have.

462
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,569
Scott: that's the one that people are pushing for the most because they Have the show.

463
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,036
Rym: well that was the article I was thinking about.

464
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:31,007
Rym: talking about that I decided not to bother with because we had plenty of news that Game of Thrones is possibly the most pirated television show in history.

465
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:34,790
Rym: That's old news Yeah, but we talked about that before we only talked about it tangentially.

466
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,589
Rym: there's an article that really goes into like who's pirating it and why.

467
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:42,850
Scott: and People in countries who can't get it mostly people who don't want to pay for HBO.

468
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,966
Scott: And you know, there's no legal way to get it without paying for cable, but that's so much money.

469
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:47,790
Scott: It's not worth it.

470
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:48,826
Rym: Well, you can buy DVDs.

471
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:53,304
Scott: Yeah, you can't get the DVDs as soon as it comes out the day of the show comes out.

472
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:59,928
Rym: and the thing is, you know Six or seven years ago, we'd be a convention saying that live is dead because other than sports live was.

473
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:03,670
Scott: and yeah I mean, I'm the person who doesn't care I could like if I want to watch Game of Thrones.

474
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,616
Scott: I haven't watched it at all yet.

475
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:05,764
Scott: I downloaded the first season.

476
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:08,419
Scott: I'll watch it some time Eventually, I'll check it out.

477
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,225
Scott: cuz how can I not?

478
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:09,829
Scott: it's so hyped.

479
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,630
Scott: How can I not at least check it out, right, but I'm in no rush, but these people it's like they're obsessed.

480
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,090
Scott: They got to see it as soon as it comes.

481
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,410
Rym: Well, because it's remember when we were reading the Prince of Nothing in the crew.

482
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:26,390
Rym: Yeah, all the people who weren't reading it basically were shunned from at least half of our conversations.

483
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:28,744
Scott: I just whatever I read before I read it.

484
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:36,890
Rym: I remember everyone else who had read it in the first wave We'd be talking about and he stepped into the circle inscribed by his sword.

485
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,230
Scott: But meanwhile when I eventually got around to reading it, there was plenty of discussing.

486
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:44,261
Rym: That was only because there was a second simultaneous wave.

487
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,610
Rym: There is a certain social currency.

488
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,119
Rym: but you know in the old days remember there were no.

489
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:54,677
Rym: there more than many shows like Dick Van Dyke would be on TV and literally Everyone saw it.

490
00:32:54,838 --> 00:33:00,468
Rym: and the next day in the office in school Everyone had seen the same thing and had that to talk about.

491
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:03,779
Rym: now It's fractured but it's starting to come back and look at nerds.

492
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,730
Rym: ponies happens the next day every nerd who watch ponies talks about ponies.

493
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,193
Rym: That's true.

494
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:12,950
Scott: But you know while I can see that right person I'm not saying it's that important to you or me.

495
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,955
Rym: I'm saying that there is.

496
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:21,984
Rym: there is serious social currency in seeing something Early in the cycles that you can then discuss it and be part of the internet mashup free-for-all.

497
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:30,517
Scott: Let me insult people again indirectly About what if you're doing the spoilers thing and It's that you look at someone like me, right?

498
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,687
Scott: Um, well, I'm totally hipster in nerdy, right?

499
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:34,590
Scott: I'm reading things.

500
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,376
Scott: No one else is reading and watching things.

501
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:42,658
Scott: No one else is watching right and then when I come over I know you didn't watch every episode of running man.

502
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,923
Scott: I talked about it.

503
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:45,247
Scott: Anyway, right?

504
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,230
Scott: I'm just like whatever.

505
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,561
Scott: I don't need to talk about the thing that you've also seen.

506
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,250
Scott: I'll just talk about the thing that I seen.

507
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:55,247
Scott: Right, but if you if you seen something I haven't seen I don't mind.

508
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:58,099
Scott: if you talk about the thing I've seen it's actually more interesting Scott.

509
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:04,164
Scott: That's not even close to the argument I'm making but I'm saying it's more interesting if you talk about the thing I haven't seen.

510
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,449
Scott: so I don't need that.

511
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:07,356
Scott: Everyone has seen the same thing.

512
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:07,637
Scott: Let's see.

513
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:13,125
Rym: you say no Scott you say that but it's not if they're talking about the jargon of The thing that then it doesn't make any sense.

514
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:23,569
Rym: Mmm, possibly if it's a thing with jargon - all I'm saying is that for the majority of people and ours included There is social currency to being in with whatever the thing is.

515
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:27,010
Rym: So if it's good and you want to consume it you get more out of it.

516
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,987
Rym: It's kind of like buying the laptop on day one as opposed to day hundred if the price doesn't drop.

517
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:37,652
Rym: if you buy it On day one you got a better deal than on day hundred because otherwise you got a hundred less days and paid the same amount Of money.

518
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:48,456
Rym: you pay the same amount of time to get the media But if you get it when other people are in the getting there's more immediate like payback on that in the turf in the form Of social currency.

519
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:49,281
Rym: Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

520
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:54,089
Scott: That's a bigger calculation though Cuz you also got to wonder what other media could you have been consuming at that time, right?

521
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,121
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you say what what Scott?

522
00:34:56,143 --> 00:35:01,308
Rym: that's a bigger calculation About the entropy of the universe caused by my brain consuming the thing and the electrons moving around.

523
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:01,770
Rym: That's right.

524
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,729
Scott: It's like, you know, I could consume that right away and I get this bonus.

525
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,505
Scott: But that means I'm not doing this other thing and today is today.

526
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,850
Scott: who knows what's going on today?

527
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,580
Scott: That might mean not biking because it's good weather in the summer.

528
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:14,710
Scott: I'll wait till the winter to watch it, which is coming.

529
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:16,736
Scott: Look at how this works.

530
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:18,383
Scott: I see I can get the joke.

531
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:19,809
Scott: I haven't even watched one minute of the show.

532
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:21,530
Rym: Why is a winner a big deal?

533
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:27,190
Scott: I'm curious because there's a guy who says Winter is coming and that means it's gonna be cold and it's medieval time.

534
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,898
Scott: So it sucks when it's cold and that means it's gonna.

535
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:33,470
Scott: everyone's got to stay inside and be trapped with and have sex.

536
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:36,899
Rym: That's pretty much it except Winter last like 20 years.

537
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:39,620
Rym: Oh And it's a medieval war.

538
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,790
Scott: I thought it was only medieval world.

539
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:48,190
Rym: I didn't realize it was fantasy of a world where because of the way the planets work There's like five years of summer and then some number of years of winter.

540
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:51,182
Scott: Oh, see I thought see I was not aware that that it was.

541
00:35:51,302 --> 00:35:53,130
Scott: winter is coming is tickle a word?

542
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,377
Scott: I thought it was a only got this dragon.

543
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:57,824
Rym: It's Prince of Nothing, but other wizards.

544
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,794
Rym: Yes, but they're far away But they are there.

545
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:05,710
Scott: I see I thought it was just sort of slightly fantasy like sort of like King Arthur, right?

546
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,353
Scott: It's a little got.

547
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:10,110
Rym: it is and that everything the game show focuses on is the slightly fantasy.

548
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,027
Rym: But there's big fantasy like right on the edges like epic level D&D fantasy.

549
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:14,610
Rym: It's out there.

550
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,815
Scott: It's out there, but it's not where.

551
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:23,222
Scott: you know when it's coming Scott when winter comes in season four Wizards are gonna fly in on dragons casting spells.

552
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,370
Rym: I have no faith that the show is gonna go anywhere.

553
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,484
Rym: I know where the books have gone magic ring and the books aren't going anywhere either.

554
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,110
Rym: Anyway, it's gonna be wheel of time.

555
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:31,825
Scott: Let's move on.

556
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,220
Rym: So anyway things of the day.

557
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:44,960
Rym: So we were watching this video of a bunch of models falling over and it was funny.

558
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,899
Rym: It was funny, but it was also kind of sad.

559
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:55,780
Rym: So to get the taste out of our miles, we watch a video a bunch of guys Opening beer bottles in a manly fashion and it was actually a surprisingly enjoyable video.

560
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:59,507
Scott: They do a lot of repeats, but it's good But there were no actual repeats.

561
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:00,712
Rym: everyone was crook slightly.

562
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,800
Rym: So but it was like they were like three machetes.

563
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,384
Scott: What are you talking about?

564
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,673
Rym: They were differently shaped machetes.

565
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:05,600
Rym: They weren't the same machete.

566
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,363
Scott: I think I saw the same.

567
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,936
Rym: now you do them plus there was like monkey wrench other kinda wrench.

568
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:10,558
Scott: Uh-huh.

569
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:13,271
Rym: So here's a little fun like how some of them don't work.

570
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,180
Scott: here's a similar short and funny video.

571
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:26,240
Scott: This guy is in Russia, right and he pulls up next to some Russian police And he notices that the policeman in the car is not wearing a seatbelt and it's talking on his cell phone.

572
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:36,620
Scott: So he's like hey Hey and he yells at the police officers to roll down the window and he tells him hey put your seatbelt on and Turn the phone off right regulation number, whatever whatever.

573
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,589
Scott: And it's pretty funny.

574
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,020
Rym: look on the cops face because he can't.

575
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:43,228
Scott: It says in Russia police obeys you.

576
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:46,680
Rym: the policeman is just like I can't even yell at this guy.

577
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,930
Scott: It's like we get away with this in New York.

578
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:54,480
Rym: like hey, I would be actually kind of afraid to do that.

579
00:37:54,685 --> 00:38:04,140
Scott: I know right I really even that even if there was like a really nice cop if I saw him doing something like, you know It's like if he was had no seatbelt and he looked really nice and friendly was smiling.

580
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,346
Scott: I might maybe I could get away with like hey, man Dude, I had a seat belt.

581
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:10,908
Rym: thing is?

582
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:13,680
Rym: I take to heart the advice we got from that thing.

583
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:25,400
Scott: The thing is that smile could turn into a frown and like one flash of a second the rule number one of getting by in Life is if you can avoid it don't engage yourself with police officers or really low life people.

584
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:31,280
Rym: Yeah, we did a whole show crazy crazy bum when that crazy guy tried to punch me while I was riding my bike in Beacon.

585
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:36,895
Rym: Yeah Well, you know it's more simple.

586
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:42,256
Rym: never get involved with the police or Anyone who has nothing to lose or the perception of nothing to lose.

587
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:46,394
Rym: That's right All right, met a moment met a moment.

588
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:49,544
Rym: The book club book is 1 q 8.

589
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:54,640
Scott: for you teen 84 or you want to say it's uh, we're I'm about done with it.

590
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:57,369
Rym: I gotta read like the last hundred pages.

591
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,552
Scott: maybe yeah, maybe.

592
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:00,117
Scott: so it's pretty good.

593
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:00,860
Scott: It's a good book.

594
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,424
Scott: You should read it.

595
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:03,260
Scott: It wouldn't be the book club book if it was not good.

596
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,580
Scott: There wouldn't be hundreds of people reading on a subway every god damn day if it wasn't any good, right?

597
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,788
Rym: The thing is I'm a little.

598
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,840
Rym: I like it.

599
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,720
Scott: I mean it's long enough to wear that if it was just a fad.

600
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:19,970
Scott: People would like read the beginning and it you know and stop but people are like finishing it on the subway Which means they're you know, they're still reading it.

601
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:20,674
Rym: Well, how do you know?

602
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:21,900
Rym: you're watching people like finish it on.

603
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,984
Scott: I see what page they're on.

604
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:23,385
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:24,108
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:28,183
Rym: The thing is it's a book where I start reading like, okay Where's this going?

607
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:29,608
Rym: Oh crazy murder.

608
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,214

Rym: little people Little people ears.

610
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:35,749
Rym: What do they mean by little people?

611
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:36,451
Rym: What's up with the ear?

612
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:42,664
Scott: Oh little people little people two moons Little people.

613
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:43,708
Rym: that's right thing is?

614
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,347
Rym: it's one of those things where I kind of expected like oh little people will be Little people and then sure enough.

615
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,878
Rym: Yeah, somehow it's like what really.

616
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:57,731
Rym: yeah Our other new madam news Connecticut coming up real soon Mostly online.

617
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:58,617

618
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,668
Rym: Panelists or two bailed on me.

619
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,118
Rym: I'm gonna be filling in some extra panels.

620
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:04,160
Rym: Connecticut is gonna be awesome.

621
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,140
Scott: If you want to work at Connecticut and do like volunteer II whatnots you can talk to me or the Connecticut volunteer department.

622
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:21,860
Rym: I will say this though if you want to help out and you talk to us first and then them and you're cool We will make your job easy because I think you know We don't really need people to work incredibly long.

623
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:29,300
Scott: Basically, all we need is like two people on maybe two or three people at all times on shift Right and even at late night.

624
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,247
Scott: Maybe even less people.

625
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:38,588
Scott: probably like one or two people at night when there's less traffic just so that there is someone in the hallways and somebody checks on every panel to make sure it starts.

626
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:42,599
Scott: and if a panel has a problem they have somebody to ask for technical help.

627
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:48,973
Scott: and Yeah, I'm going to go into the panel room and say hey you have five minutes left Get out all that manage a line.

628
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,345
Scott: if a panel is really popular It is your chance to.

629
00:40:51,928 --> 00:41:00,699
Rym: actually you'll probably if you volunteer and help us out at Connecticut You will probably hang out with us more than you can at any other convention we ever go to and you'll put something on your resume.

00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:14,740
Scott: if you're farther away than that If you have to if you can't drive there in a day in a few hours, then it's not worth it.

670
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,308

Rym: I mean, alright, so 45 minutes later.

700
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:48,120
Rym: It's time to talk about hats.

701
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,400
Scott: That's good because I intentionally did that because we don't have that much to say about hats.

702
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,550
Rym: I feel like I could do a long show on hats.

703
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,780
Scott: Well, okay, so let's start with this, right?

704
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:57,606
Scott: I have no hair anymore.

705
00:44:57,686 --> 00:44:57,967
Scott: Really?

706
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:07,400
Rym: I have some hair but and I point out during the five borough bike tour You got one - you got eight sunburns on your head in the places where there are holes in your bicycle.

707
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,549
Scott: Yeah, I've corrected that now.

708
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:12,449
Scott: I Need a hat, but I can't find a hat.

709
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:22,349
Scott: That's a good style and every style of hat I see Either a isn't for me personally as my body doesn't matter My clothes don't match it like.

710
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:24,476
Scott: I would totally do like 20s 30s awesome hat.

711
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:31,480
Scott: But that would mean I need to wear 20s 30s suit maybe with the vest every day and you know what it's warm.

712
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:33,206
Rym: Oh, no, you got linen.

713
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:34,711
Rym: Linen is the key.

714
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:36,417
Scott: It doesn't go with that kind of hat.

715
00:45:36,497 --> 00:45:37,320
Rym: does a linen Jack?

716
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,220
Scott: No, the linen goes with like the straw hat, you know the Panama hat with the red white and blue.

717
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:47,240
Rym: There's a long tradition of Italian businessmen wearing these sort of like linen suits while they're going around.

718
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:49,059
Scott: The kind of hat you throw up in the air to parade.

719
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:51,226
Scott: That's not a good hat for me to wear either.

720
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,554
Scott: You know, you could wear what stovepipe.

721
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:55,040
Scott: not wearing a stovepipe.

722
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:56,486
Scott: It's not gonna look.

723
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:56,989
Rym: just do it.

724
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,740
Rym: No, just own it double down.

725
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:03,657
Rym: No, what's funny is when I was young like before I had long hair like I was just a punk kid.

726
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:11,108
Rym: like a really young I hated wasting time in the morning on things like Brushing my hair like.

727
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:12,313
Rym: I remember that was the thing like.

728
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,000
Rym: I didn't want to bother with stuff like that.

729
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,919
Scott: I definitely still don't want to bother with stuff like that.

730
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:19,092
Rym: So I pretty much always wanted to wear a baseball cap.

731
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,742
Rym: just because that meant I didn't have to do anything I wore it.

732
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:26,380
Scott: see we weren't allowed to wear a baseball cap in in school or we but we could wear the hallways.

733
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:30,680
Scott: So wait, so I didn't bring one to school and didn't wear one because I'd usually just lose it.

734
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,791
Scott: But when I get to high school the rule changed in high school.

735
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:37,340
Scott: in high school, you could wear it just not in class Right.

736
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:40,210
Scott: So in class, I just take it off and put it on the table.

737
00:46:40,712 --> 00:46:45,110
Scott: and I started like freshman year of high school Up through freshman year of college.

738
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,758
Scott: I just wore Mets hat every day.

739
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,769
Scott: None, they just always had the Mets hat on everywhere.

740
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:50,050
Scott: I went.

741
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,297
Rym: I pretty much wore baseball caps every time.

742
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:58,860
Rym: I was like going around Outside unless until when I was in 10th grade I got what I affectionately called the stupid hat.

743
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,176
Rym: It was this sort of like bucket hat like a sort of Panama style, but really crappy and smaller.

744
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:10,359
Rym: I Pretty much wore that up until I lost it at RIT all the time.

745
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:14,916
Scott: Yeah, I wore that Mets hat up till freshman year at RIT and then sophomore year.

746
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:15,900
Scott: I sort of just stopped.

747
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,749
Scott: I don't remember why.

748
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:19,840
Rym: of course RIT, you know I'll dig up a picture to link to for this episode.

749
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,836
Rym: But it's funny because right around my senior high school when I got to RIT, you know I had a bunch of like I wore a brown duster everywhere because it was winter.

750
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:38,360
Rym: in Rochester We're gonna one degree in freezing and a duster is not only a coat but it's also basically a portable bed and portable pillow and A portable backpack because I could fit everything I needed in the pockets.

751
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:39,924
Rym: So I would use.

752
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:44,824
Rym: I wear like pajamas under it and wear it to class and curl up in the library and use this blanket Or a bed or whatever.

753
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,171
Scott: It's the same thing that always happens.

754
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:54,700
Scott: right is if you're a freshman in high school You're a sport in middle school style for a while And when you're a freshman in college your sport in high school style for a while and then you grew out of it.

755
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:56,120
Rym: But the thing is in college.

756
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:58,098
Rym: I didn't do that in High school.

757
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:03,873
Scott: It was only really and then when you get out of college to the real world your sport college style for a while and then you Get turned into adult.

758
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:05,526
Rym: Yeah But I would.

759
00:48:05,546 --> 00:48:06,896
Rym: I got to you know.

760
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:12,348
Rym: at RIT I had the duster and I wore it a lot cuz it was cold and unlike the rest of my life I didn't have a car to just drive everywhere.

761
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:14,959
Rym: So I started wearing the duster all the time.

762
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:19,554
Rym: and What goes better with the duster than a Leather cowboy ish hat.

763
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:28,819
Rym: Yep So I was actually you know for a couple of years at RIT The majority of the people who saw me the majority of the time I had a duster and a cowboy hat on.

764
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,285
Rym: I looked And I had a huge mustache.

765
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:37,540
Rym: I look very different from how I do now in terms of style Mmm, I wore that cowboy hat like every goddamn day like every picture of me at RIT.

766
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,845
Scott: That's how you can always find a Rym.

767
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:39,648
Scott: It was easy to find.

768
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:45,239
Rym: The thing is no one brown stick walking around Yep, but no one could call me Tex cuz we knew a guy called Tex.

769
00:48:45,742 --> 00:48:47,633
Scott: Yeah that he's the only Texas I could say.

770
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,391
Rym: if anyone had called me Tex I think he would have killed me just to make sure.

771
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:55,713
Rym: maybe so one day I'm sitting in the RIT cafeteria, but I mean you didn't have a 10-gallon cowboy hat.

772
00:48:55,753 --> 00:49:02,162
Scott: It was more of like an Australian Outback kind of like I'm on the bush Wrangling horses.

773
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,586
Scott: Yeah, but darker brown.

774
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:10,646
Rym: and then you know, like crocodile Dundee looked a lot like what's-his-name's hat in Final Fantasy 8?

775
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,072
Scott: No, wasn't it Star Ocean?

776
00:49:12,353 --> 00:49:13,819
Rym: No Final Fantasy 8.

777
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:16,446
Rym: Whatever The sniper guy.

778
00:49:16,848 --> 00:49:18,035
Rym: I didn't actually play Final Fantasy 8.

779
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:18,960
Scott: Yeah, sort of like a Grit hat.

780
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:21,645
Rym: Yeah, the Grit doesn't wear a hat in Advance Wars 2.

781
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:22,648
Rym: That's true.

782
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,270
Scott: Yeah.

783
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:25,877
Scott: Anyway, actually you were very Grit style.

784
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,087
Rym: I was.

785
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,275
Rym: I was always kind of unshaven.

786
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:30,040
Rym: So I had that kind of Grit.

787
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,407
Scott: You didn't have the pointy G-gen beard though.

788
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:34,655
Rym: No, I had the epic mustache.

789
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:36,300
Scott: You know Grit and G-gen same actor.

790
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:43,794
Rym: I Got to say playing Advance Wars 2 again, Grit is hex.

791
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:45,080
Scott: I should go watch the Lupines.

792
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:45,765
Scott: I haven't seen.

793
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:47,459
Rym: I haven't caught up on them either.

794
00:49:47,962 --> 00:49:51,158
Rym: all right, so I wore this hat like all the time like that was just I was known as wearing that

795
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:51,439
Scott: hat and

796
00:49:52,781 --> 00:50:05,092
Rym: One day we're eating lunch or dinner or something in Gracie's the cafeteria and out of nowhere Someone from behind like like on this balcony like above where we were eating Grabs the hat off my head runs away and

797
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:05,152
Scott: I

798
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:06,498
Rym: look I'm dumbfounded like I can't

799
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:06,900
Scott: believe this.

800
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:12,933
Scott: Yeah, you think it's just like a practical joke like lol's got your hat, dude Like I can't believe this happened and I assume it's someone I know.

801
00:50:12,953 --> 00:50:14,680
Rym: and then our friend Greg looks at me.

802
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,219
Rym: It's like I think that guy just fucking stole your hat.

803
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,940
Rym: So you had to chase and I look up and the guy just keeps running like he's almost out of the cafeteria.

804
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,864
Rym: I'm like fuck.

805
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:26,160
Rym: so I get up and run and then like Greg follows me and like part of the crew to start following.

806
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:31,860
Rym: He's like this chain of people and I get outside and I and I the guy would have gotten away, but he stopped.

807
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,506
Rym: He's just walking and right behind him.

808
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:39,890
Rym: I grab his shoulder and spin around like give me my hat back and he was deaf Mmm, and he looks at me like I'm stupid.

809
00:50:40,232 --> 00:50:41,700
Rym: He's like what and I pointed the hat.

810
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,554
Rym: I'm like my hat and he doesn't want to give it back to me.

811
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:51,080
Rym: and I'm I'm debating threatening him when other people start to show up and suddenly got this posse behind me.

812
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,320
Rym: I'm like, give me the fucking hat back and I grab it from him and he kind of stands there.

813
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,040
Rym: But then he backs down and I walk back into the cafeteria like a hero and I resume eating.

814
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,859
Scott: No, even what I assume was it was not like a clapping or it was just like walking back in.

815
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:09,034
Rym: But I was a hero to me because I got your hero to you.

816
00:51:09,115 --> 00:51:10,139
Rym: only I still got that head.

817
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:12,809
Rym: But the problem is later the head shrunk.

818
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:13,833
Rym: It doesn't fit my head anymore.

819
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:17,864
Scott: I think your head grew Inflated.

820
00:51:17,925 --> 00:51:18,632
Scott: sense of self-worth.

821
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:21,844
Rym: I just couldn't believe.

822
00:51:21,884 --> 00:51:23,168
Rym: someone stole my hat.

823
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:24,754
Scott: Yeah off my head.

824
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:25,797
Scott: What would they want with it?

825
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:26,680
Scott: Were they dared to do it?

826
00:51:27,102 --> 00:51:29,432
Rym: No, it wasn't even someone I knew was a random deaf kid.

827
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:31,400
Rym: I never saw him again on campus.

828
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,159
Scott: Yeah, what else we gotta say about hats?

829
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:43,709
Scott: I like you know, you watch old movies you see everyone wearing a hat and you think yeah I wish you can go back to the days and everyone wear a hat and was styling but at the same time I can't even get there myself.

830
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:45,860
Scott: So he's got anyone else for not getting there.

831
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:50,880
Rym: No There's Derby style canes like when people have a walking cane and has like the thing you hold on to like the Johnny Walker label.

832
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,472
Rym: And there's alcohol and there's like a little hook on the front of it.

833
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:55,240
Scott: Yep, you know, that's what I had on.

834
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:58,394
Rym: You hang it over your arm and then you hang the hat on the hook.

835
00:51:58,414 --> 00:51:59,318
Rym: that way your arm is free.

836
00:51:59,458 --> 00:51:59,800
Scott: That's right.

837
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:05,420
Rym: I see more and more people like whenever them around the theater district or whenever I go to a show or something.

838
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,800
Rym: There's a lot of people sporting that kind of look again in New York.

839
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,980
Scott: Yeah at a formal event you could totally do it, but it's like to wear that every day is a expensive be warm.

840
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,079
Rym: Yeah, well expensive.

841
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:25,495
Rym: I'm already having the problem if I wear like a jacket like every day like I dress up nice and as a result now I own like 14 jackets and I get dry cleaning done constantly and it's actually really expensive.

842
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,060
Rym: and I've worn out two jackets.

843
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,869
Scott: Yeah, it's not just expensive to buy them right?

844
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:31,120
Scott: That's like a one-time cost a few thousand dollars.

845
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,492
Rym: Yeah, most people you own a jet.

846
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:33,440
Rym: you don't like two jackets.

847
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:37,460
Scott: You've got a dry clean haul that shit constantly instead of regular laundry.

848
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,765
Rym: Well, that's something I've learned.

849
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:43,490
Scott: cause just as much to wear the suit for one day as it costs for like a whole basket Of regular teeth.

850
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:51,547
Rym: when I was younger I never paid much attention to the formal attire other people wore but now because I wear jackets all the time I kind of think about it a lot more.

851
00:52:52,090 --> 00:53:03,740
Rym: and what's funny is like when I go to an event Like a convention like not a nerd convention, but a more business II convention You can pretty much tell someone's profession and income level based solely on literally the cut of their jacket.

852
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:13,530
Rym: Yeah And I gotta say when you see the guy wearing what is clearly the same jacket he order was prom complete with the hole for The button near at a professional convention.

853
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,520
Rym: That guy is still in college or fresh out of college.

854
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:17,930
Rym: He's like the low-level tech guy.

855
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:19,300
Rym: Maybe he's a coder.

856
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:21,069
Rym: It was forced to go there by his boss.

857
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,959
Rym: Yeah, that has never steered me wrong.

858
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,711
Rym: Lately I really haven't been wearing hats anymore.

859
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:30,930
Rym: Yeah, that's like I want to wear a hat But I just can't find.

860
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:40,904
Rym: what I don't get though Is that I see a lot of people in the city who are businessmen, but they're like a schlubby normal middle-aged But they're like 45 and they have like a normal job So they have to like.

861
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:47,980
Rym: they have to dress up as opposed to dressing up because they want to But they have to dress up in this boring like white dress shirt with a particular.

862
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,688
Scott: Why don't they go more style?

863
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:53,244
Scott: and if you have I had to dress up, but I didn't quit the job Which I probably.

864
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:53,486
Rym: what?

865
00:53:53,526 --> 00:53:56,580
Rym: why is it always be like the crappy white dress shirt, right?

866
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:58,700
Scott: It's like I wouldn't take the job in the first place.

867
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:04,405
Scott: But if I had to have that job where they force you to dress up and that's the job I had to me a white Dress shirt literally exists.

868
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:08,940
Scott: only you're paying the dry cleaning cost the same no matter how fancy the clothes are, right?

869
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,365
Scott: It's the jackets 250.

870
00:54:10,365 --> 00:54:12,895
Scott: It doesn't matter if it's a thousand dollar jacket or a $1.00.

871
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:14,040
Scott: Goodwill jacket, right?

872
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,423
Scott: Dry cleaning is the same.

873
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:16,526
Scott: I would get.

874
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:17,810
Scott: it doesn't need to be expensive.

875
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,105
Scott: I just be styling right as opposed to you know Shlubby.

876
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:31,638
Rym: Yeah, but those people almost a third of them on the subway are always wearing a Really?

877
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,992
Rym: Non-matching random baseball cap.

878
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:35,454
Scott: Yep.

879
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,200
Scott: I Don't know why But it bothers me even more than wearing the baseball cap.

880
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:40,481
Scott: Right?

881
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:45,700
Scott: is the people who get the baseball cap put the plastic in the back as opposed to the fitted hat, right?

882
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,884
Scott: It's like oh, are you kidding?

883
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:49,997
Rym: every baseball cap I ever owned had the plastic in the back.

884
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:50,740
Scott: Oh, it's awful.

885
00:54:51,561 --> 00:54:52,404
Scott: Oh, that's the words.

886
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:58,551
Scott: and it was even worse than that is when the entire back half of the hat is sort of that mesh That's only for talkers.

887
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,120
Scott: truckers and fishermen are the only people.

888
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:02,604
Rym: God, wait a minute.

889
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,854
Rym: You're the one now who's complaining about other people's fashion.

890
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:07,548
Rym: Oh Look at the hat she's wearing.

891
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:09,559
Scott: we're la de da can't wear that hat.

892
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,872
Rym: Yeah, where you're gonna complain about people wearing socks and sandals on the beach?

893
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:14,920
Scott: next you can do that from the beach.

894
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,426
Scott: I don't give a shit.

895
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:16,558
Scott: care about hats.

896
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:18,071
Rym: Care about hats.

897
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:18,780
Scott: hats are important.

898
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,832
Scott: You want your hat back because hats protect the head which is the important part of the.

899
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:23,620
Rym: but no helmets protect the head.

900
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:24,904
Scott: Helmets are hats.

901
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:25,847
Scott: once I've a helmets.

902
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:27,353
Rym: No, I think helmets is a separate show.

903
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:31,220
Rym: Okay, because I have a bunch of helmets You gotta squeeze out another episode.

904
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:49,368
Rym: I kind of want to get a formal hat but with long hair like I have to tie it back in a very particular way to wear a nice hat and because I have a atypically large head in terms of like measurements Off-the-shelf hats don't fit me.

905
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:49,890
Rym: Like I have to.

906
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,995
Rym: really I've just been a lot of money.

907
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:52,140
Scott: that is annoying right?

908
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,180
Scott: It's like, you know It's hats are one of those things with the more expensive when it's clearly superior.

909
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:03,825
Rym: Same thing with canes because I was thinking about getting a nice cane to only take when I go to like the theater like nice Jacket, you know pants cane.

910
00:56:03,845 --> 00:56:04,367
Rym: Thank you.

911
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,613
Scott: You should bring your little mustache the wooden.

912
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:09,360
Rym: Oh my god the mustachical that I love that thing.

913
00:56:10,185 --> 00:56:12,420
Rym: The problem is I looked at canes.

914
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:17,711
Rym: The cheap canes look like shit the nice-looking canes.

915
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:22,589
Rym: if they were I expected like alright if I'm crazy And I spent like 200 bucks.

916
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,038
Rym: I'll get the best-looking cane.

917
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:28,155
Rym: now Talk to thousand dollars right for a good-looking game.

918
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:29,120
Scott: Here's what you do Rym, right?

919
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:34,000
Rym: So the best-looking cane and guys if you want to make me a cane I'll be your friend forever.

920
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:39,400
Scott: Right, the best-looking cane in my opinion is the plain black smooth, you know thing that tapers to a point at the bottom.

921
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:44,936
Scott: Yeah, a little metal tip and then the metal handle at the top, you know That's sort of like the sideways handle that you can hang the hat on right?

922
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:45,540
Rym: So what do you want?

923
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,690
Scott: That's all you got to do.

924
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,500
Scott: It's so simple.

925
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,952
Scott: It's not doesn't have need to it doesn't need to be one of those ones.

926
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:51,680
Scott: There's all sorts of engravings on the metal.

927
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,262
Rym: I don't want that.

928
00:56:52,303 --> 00:56:53,206
Rym: I want very simple.

929
00:56:53,267 --> 00:57:01,540
Rym: I want black with silver tips and I Or and he's gonna be the right shape right or I want to really like sort of art deco style in one.

930
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,285
Rym: I saw one online.

931
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:06,255
Rym: It was a one-off custom cane someone made for a project.

932
00:57:07,097 --> 00:57:08,000
Rym: It was beautiful, right?

933
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:14,564
Scott: But anyway, they wanted like nine thousand dollars for we could make that cane Right really cheap.

934
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:18,780
Scott: Just get a piece of wood, you know, put it in the spinny thingy make it the right shape.

935
00:57:21,182 --> 00:57:23,711
Rym: No, that's not how you make anyway, but it doesn't.

936
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,615
Scott: it just has to look right.

937
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:28,078
Scott: you you lacquer it black You put them get the metal things and attach it to both.

938
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:29,105
Rym: now There's more to it than that.

939
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:31,480
Rym: if you just do that one that's not gonna be a super even coat.

940
00:57:31,842 --> 00:57:33,229
Rym: It's not gonna look nicely black.

941
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,557
Rym: You gotta get a wood and stain it.

942
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:35,120
Rym: You don't mean it.

943
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,890
Scott: No, if it's if it's spinning and you spray it black.

944
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,315
Rym: Well, you don't spray it.

945
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:40,559
Rym: you stain it or look like shit.

946
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,706
Rym: It's also gonna be matte not shiny.

947
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,509
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

948
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:46,717
Rym: You don't use spray paint for that.

949
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:47,420
Rym: That would look awful.

950
00:57:47,641 --> 00:57:50,754
Scott: You don't use spray paint, but you would spray the paint.

951
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:53,949
Rym: No, not with an air spray You don't use paint for something like that.

952
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,618
Rym: You've clearly never worked with a wood before.

953
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,540
Scott: anyway You can make it really easily and it would not cost you even close to ten.

954
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:03,790
Scott: You know ten dollars let alone thousand now.

955
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,860
Rym: It wouldn't it wouldn't have that certain level of polish.

956
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:13,725
Rym: It's kind of like how you see the guy wearing the suit now At least I do and you can tell like how expensive the suit is and or how nice it is Just by the cut.

957
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:16,340
Rym: like you see a cheap suit and you're like, wow, the lapels are really on.

958
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:23,885
Scott: I bet if I had the materials and enough extra materials to practice a few times I can and I could make Canes that look great.

959
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:26,980
Rym: I don't think you can make them cheaper than similarly.

960
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:35,638
Rym: No, the ones that are of that level of quality you're talking about are like 40 bucks But they kind of look like shit and they break.

961
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:38,658
Rym: What kind of wood do you propose to use?

962
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,542
Rym: Cheap wood.

963
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,692
Scott: Yeah, if it breaks, it's not a problem.

964
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:43,415
Scott: Just don't break it.

965
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:44,680
Scott: It's just gonna look good, right?

966
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,065
Scott: It's like the four dollar umbrella.

967
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:47,410
Scott: It's just gotta it works.

968
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,092
Scott: It gets you home.

969
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:50,060
Scott: The cane will get you to the theater and home.

970
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:50,666
Scott: It's all good.

971
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:52,159
Rym: I kind of want to get a top hat.

972
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,567
Rym: Alright, so get one to wear with tails at things.

973
