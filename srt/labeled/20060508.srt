1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,240
Scott: It's Monday, May 8th, one day before E3, I guess E3 already started, whatever.

2
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:23,980
Scott: This is GeekNights, and today we're gonna talk about P2P, but really we're just kind of rushed through it, so we can hurry up and talk about E3 tomorrow.

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,737
Rym: Let's do this!

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,602
Scott: Tomorrow is the first full day of the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2006.

5
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,539
Scott: It's actually started right now.

6
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:46,035
Scott: That means all the video game news in the entire universe is going to come out within the next 24 to 36 hours.

7
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:56,540
Scott: It's already begun, you can go to dig, but while I'm saying this, which is probably hours or perhaps even a day before you're listening...

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Rym: It is currently 9.37 PM in Rym and Scott time.

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,088
Scott: Eastern, so it's 6.30 in California, where the E3 2006 is happening.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,900
Scott: Already we're seeing such reports as microphones and speakers in the Wii controller.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,059
Rym: Yup, various Final Fantasy bits.

12
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:25,459
Scott: Final Fantasy XIII, two different Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles games, I think the Square Enix conference must be going on.

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,780
Scott: But it's getting really crazy up in here.

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Scott: WarioWare, there's a Time Magazine article of someone who played the Wii.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,970
Scott: WarioWare Wii, everybody.

16
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:37,480
Scott: WarioWare Wii.

17
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,779
Scott: It's only going to get crazier.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,980
Scott: Tomorrow, the episode of GeekNights you will listen to will have nothing but E3 stuff.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,277
Scott: Even the things of the day and the news, all the E3.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,039
Rym: Yup, and while we're not going to be at E3 actually covering it...

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,778
Scott: Because we suck.

22
00:01:54,281 --> 00:02:00,760
Rym: I can say with a fair amount of certainty that at least by the next E3, there's a decent chance we'll be there.

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,295
Scott: Maybe.

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,318
Rym: We'll pull it off.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,120
Scott: Yeah, the thing about E3 is that you don't really need to go because there's even a website now that's up.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,379
Scott: It's a BitTorrent tracker that is hosting only torrents, which are videos and audios of things going on in E3.

27
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,773
Scott: And all the videos are in HD.

28
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,339
Rym: So you can really see that nerd.

29
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:31,100
Scott: Yeah, the only thing you have to gain by going to E3 as opposed to just watching E3 on the internet or satellite feed... Is actually playing all these games a few months before they hit the shelves.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Rym: Well, and the general fun of being at a con.

31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,400
Scott: Yeah, of course it's crazy crowd- it's not a con, it's more of a trade show.

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,658
Scott: Yeah, but- That's the thing.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,180
Rym: Most people who seem to go and have a good time are the ones who go to the crazy after parties.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,639
Rym: And during parties.

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,880
Scott: The thing is, it seems like every single group that goes has their own separate party.

36
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:53,080
Scott: It's like I go to four or five different video game websites, and they all have their own separate party.

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,636
Scott: It's like, "We're having the E3 get drunk

38
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:56,119
Scott: party!".

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,435
Scott: "We're having the E3 get even more drunk

40
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:58,959
Scott: party!".

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,202
Rym: "Woooo!".

42
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,558
Scott: You know?

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,676
Scott: I don't know.

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,800
Scott: So, let's refrain from talking about E3 anymore today.

45
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:07,720
Rym: Yes.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,619
Rym: Though in other more horrible news, the trees in the Mid-Hudson Valley have decided to lay down a bombardment upon my nose...

47
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:23,900
Scott: I have been laid upon the same bombardment, yet I am immune, for I am superior genetically in all ways.

48
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,344
Scott: Yeah.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,860
Rym: Well, I have this Maisonneau line of allergies.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,280
Scott: So they just walked around through Belgium, is what you're saying?

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,780
Rym: Yeah, basically.

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,379
Scott: Way to go, Belgium!

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,560
Rym: I've got so much Benadryl and Sudafed and various other things that I had to sign little logbooks for to get that it's not even funny.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,319
Rym: And I've got a headache, and my nose hurts.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,819
Scott: Yeah, he's a druggie.

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,020
Scott: Some leaving his pills around the bathroom.

57
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,900
Rym: Yeah, that, uh, loratadine.

58
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,200
Scott: Yeah, I just, we don't have a phone, so I can't call for help.

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,640
Scott: So anyone who has a phone, just call, like, the drug whatever line and tell them that Rym is a big addict and needs to go to rehab.

60
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,980
Rym: Though also today, I actually had a doctor's appointment for that new job.

61
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,798
Rym: 'Cause I quit IBM.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Rym: I'm not, I'm just kinda screwing around at work now for the last two weeks.

63
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,260
Scott: Yeah, I screwed around at work today.

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,160
Rym: Actually, I'm doing more work now that I've told them I quit than I was doing before.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,465
Scott: Lol.

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,658
Rym: As they start panicking and asking me things like, "How do we do all that stuff you've been doing for the last three

67
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:14,939
Rym: years?".

68
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:15,820
Scott: Lol.

69
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,700
Rym: Though at least, I drove down to the city, 'cause I have to get tested for tuberculosis as part of the fact that I'm gonna be working in hospitals.

70
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,400
Rym: And I've got a little ball on my arm now that's full of tuberculin.

71
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:30,120
Rym: And as long as it doesn't turn big and red, I get the job.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,514
Scott: I'm gonna take this red marker tonight and go...

73
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:40,719
Rym: Yeah, and then I'll go in, you know, 48 hours from now, and the doctor will say, "You've got a bad case of

74
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,100
Rym: Sharpie.".

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:41,823
Scott: Lol.

76
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:44,520
Scott: Awesome.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,340
Rym: Though, interestingly enough, when I got to the city, my allergies disappeared.

78
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,819
Rym: I felt great.

79
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,079
Scott: 'Cause there's no trees there.

80
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,220
Rym: Oh, there are, just not whatever bastard tree lives up here.

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,180
Scott: Oh, there are, just aren't enough trees there.

82
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,139
Rym: Oh, well, anyway, we got some actual news, too.

83
00:04:58,886 --> 00:04:59,157
Scott: Okay.

84
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:00,798
Scott: So, Vim.

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,495
Scott: V-I-M.

86
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,360
Rym: The only text editor that real men use.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,180
Scott: Yeah, and not talking about the underwear company or anything like that.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,640
Scott: 'Cause I think there's an underwear company named Vim, isn't there?

89
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,880
Rym: There's also an underwear company named Rym.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,716
Scott: Yup.

91
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,119
Rym: They make pretty cool designer boxers.

92
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:18,759
Scott: Alright, we're gonna forget about Rym.

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
Scott: Vim is the V-I-enhance, whatever, text editor.

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Scott: It's a very, very important piece of software, whether you know about it or not.

95
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:30,494
Rym: Yes.

96
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,727
Rym: Even, not in terms of history, but in terms of usefulness.

97
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:40,478
Rym: now, you're guaranteed, no matter what Linux, Unix, whatever system you're on, V-I is in there if nothing else is.

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,440
Scott: Yup, no matter which computer in the entire universe you are using, be it-- Well, if it's a Unix, Linux, BSD.

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,659
Scott: Yeah, yeah, any Unix, Linux, whatever computer in the world has V-I or V-I-M on it.

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,396
Scott: I guarantee it.

101
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,020
Scott: Windows and, I don't know if Macs might have it pre-installed, but if they don't, you can install it.

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,140
Scott: Vim will work on any computer, anywhere.

103
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:09,400
Scott: It's completely free and completely available, and it works the same no matter what system you're using, guaranteed.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,804
Rym: We've talked about it before.

105
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,331
Rym: It's incredibly powerful.

106
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,500
Rym: It is, however, some would say, obtuse.

107
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,014
Scott: Yeah, it's not easy to learn, but it's easy to use.

108
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,300
Scott: Once you've learned it, you're awesome.

109
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:20,032
Rym: Escape colon WQ.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Scott: Yeah, we definitely had this discussion before.

111
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,877
Rym: Yeah, we did.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,618
Scott: There's an easy to use and easy to learn.

113
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,160
Scott: Vim is the not easy to learn, but easy to use text editor.

114
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,200
Scott: All it does is edit text files.

115
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,599
Rym: But it edits them real well.

116
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,052
Scott: And usually, it just edits source code for programming.

117
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,120
Scott: That's its primary function.

118
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,639
Scott: A secondary function is system administrating configuration files, which it does equally well.

119
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,348
Scott: Vim 7 came out today.

120
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,684
Scott: Previously, we were using Vim 6.

121
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:52,560
Scott: Vim 7 is light years beyond Vim 6.

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,479
Scott: Now, to someone who doesn't use Vim, you would open up Vim 7 and say, "This looks exactly the goddamn same

123
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:58,680
Scott: thing.".

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,724
Rym: Wait, it looks the same.

125
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:04,000
Rym: It's a big black screen with a little colon in the bottom left and a blinking cursor somewhere.

126
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,965
Scott: And that's how you know.

127
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,940
Scott: they didn't fuck it up when they switched to version 7.

128
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
Scott: Because it didn't change a goddamn thing.

129
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,940
Scott: What they did add are the following.

130
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,440
Scott: Number one, on-the-fly spell checking, all Microsoft Word style.

131
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,740
Rym: Ooh, that's something I've actually kind of wanted.

132
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Scott: Yeah, because Vim didn't have a spell checker, so you would occasionally try to write things in it and screw up.

133
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,780
Scott: And it sucked ass because there's no way to spell check.

134
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:32,160
Rym: Well, you could spell check by, you know, piping things through something, but not easily.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,799
Rym: Not in a way that non-nerds would know how to do.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,860
Scott: A canal is capable of printing multibyte text, so now you can Vim in Chinese, and Japanese, and Kanji, and Russian.

137
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,000
Rym: Yep, the net result of that is that they've added, I think, 50 languages.

138
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,380
Scott: They actually translated the manual pages into all those languages as well.

139
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,159
Rym: Whoa, badass.

140
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:58,100
Scott: And there's an internal grep, which is faster than the previous internal grep.

141
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:01,340
Scott: And it is portable, so it works on every machine.

142
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,455
Rym: Now you might wonder, why do I care if grep is fast or slow?

143
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,200
Rym: It's the text editor.

144
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,439
Rym: There are some big fucking text files out there.

145
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,380
Scott: And if you want to grep them, it could take you minutes to grep them.

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,826
Scott: If you know what grepping is.

147
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,617
Scott: If you don't know what grepping is, what are you listening to?

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,572
Rym: Well, I guess, ctrl-f-ing.

149
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,098
Scott: F3-ing.

150
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,043
Scott: Ooh.

151
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:24,160
Scott: No, it's actually forward slash regular expression forward slashing.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,488
Scott: Yeah.

153
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:35,840
Scott: Or, if you're awesome, g slash regular expression slash s slash slash regular expression slash g.

154
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:38,438
Rym: Okay.

155
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:39,740
Scott: R. Okay.

156
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,700
Rym: Yeah, Vim is awesome and it got more awesome.

157
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:44,100
Scott: Yep.

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,833
Scott: The last thing they added, you know how Visual Studio does that thing.

159
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:54,220
Scott: where, you know, you'll do like, you'll be typing some code and you'll do something like something dot whatever.

160
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,759
Scott: And then this big list will appear and you can just choose something out of the list.

161
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,159
Scott: It knows all the functions and you can just pick them instead of having to type them.

162
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,696
Scott: Vim has that now.

163
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,290
Rym: For what languages?

164
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:04,860
Rym: All of them?

165
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,031
Scott: A lot of them.

166
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:06,619
Scott: All the big ones.

167
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,698
Rym: All the ones we care about.

168
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:11,218
Scott: C, Java, Ruby, Python, you know.

169
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,179
Rym: Yeah, Python's what I really need.

170
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:13,600
Rym: Yeah.

171
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,460
Rym: Because I like Python and I use it, but I don't remember much about it.

172
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
Rym: Because I only use it to replace things that are obtuse to do in Bash.

173
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,540
Scott: This is really helpful for someone like me because I know the syntax and use of a lot of languages.

174
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,199
Scott: Like, I know the basic structures of a language and what type of language it is and how to use it.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,000
Scott: But I don't remember, like, the actual specific names of the built-in standard functions of a language.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Scott: Or the, you know, like in Ruby, I know how to use a block to do a certain thing.

177
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:51,960
Scott: I don't remember the actual name of the function that, like, cuts off the spaces at the end of a string.

178
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
Rym: But you know the function exists.

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,129
Scott: Yep.

180
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,137
Scott: So this can help me find it because I can, like, be like, "Was it 'chop' or was it 'chomp' or was it

181
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:00,819
Scott: 'schomp'?"?

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,818
Scott: You know, and I can try to type it in to see, you know, and I'll find it.

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,740
Rym: Now, I guess, I mean, the news we just gave, you either cared about this and said "woot" or you have no idea what we just said.

184
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:16,860
Scott: If you cared about this and said "woot," you are an awesome programming nerd of computer-ing.

185
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,360
Scott: If you did not, then you're not so awesome.

186
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Rym: Nah, nah, if you didn't, because, I mean, a lot of people don't, and I'll admit that I never used VI or Vim until I got to RIT.

187
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,059
Scott: I don't even know what it was before I got to RIT.

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,660
Rym: I used to use, I had Pico that I had used occasionally on, like, this crapo Linux box.

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,260
Scott: No, when I got to RIT, they told me about Vim, but they had, they told all the first year CS guys to use Emacs, which I used.

190
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:46,960
Scott: I didn't like it, so I used NEdit, which is a lot more like Notepad, but it had better colors and stuff.

191
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,020
Scott: So then I used NEdit for a long time, and NEdit's actually a lot better now than it used to be, and it's still kind of nice.

192
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,580
Scott: I kind of, you know, but then once I really got into using Vim, now it's like everything else is just whatever.

193
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,278
Rym: Yeah, when I was a freshman, they said "use Pico, VI is there, but that's for advanced people,".

194
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:06,456
Rym: and I thought, "Well, I don't know what either of those is, really, so I'm just going to use

195
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:06,556
Rym: VI.".

196
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,679
Rym: And it was tough, but then I learned it, and I realized how awesome it was.

197
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,934
Scott: Yep, once you learn, you know, important letters to press, like O, and Y, and D, and S.

198
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,020
Rym: Though, if you're, if you, I mean, I highly recommend anyone out there learn to use VI, at least minimally.

199
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:44,759
Scott: Yeah, it seems to be that a lot of people who try to use VI once, and they realize it takes a lot of learning, you'll see them post comments on, like, Digg and Slashdot, like, "If you don't want to spend the two years it takes to learn VI, just use, like, my awesome editor, SubethaEdit," which is, I guess is cool, I never actually used it, but a lot of people say good things about it.

200
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,019
Scott: Or they'll be like, "Yeah, if you don't want to bother learning all this crazy useless crap, then do

201
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:50,240
Scott: this.".

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,900
Scott: And then the other kind of posts are like, "Here are all the commands, oh my god, here's how to do that in one, you know, by pressing three

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,060
Scott: buttons.".

204
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:01,040
Rym: The way to learn VI, or anything complicated like that, is to learn the basics.

205
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,660
Rym: Be able to make a little quick file, and then save it, and then delete it, and that sort of thing.

206
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,532
Rym: Then, every time you're using VI, and you think, "Man, it'd be great if I could just do blah,".

207
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,940
Rym: stop, look up how to do blah, and then do it.

208
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,880
Rym: And you'll remember it, and you'll learn stuff real quick that way.

209
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,058
Scott: Yep, and a lot of people will be like, "Oh man, it takes, like, three years to learn

210
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:22,159
Scott: VI.".

211
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,735
Scott: "It takes, like, a week to learn VI, unless you're a

212
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:25,279
Scott: doofus.".

213
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,920
Scott: Well, it takes years-- You just have to actually do it.

214
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,860
Rym: It takes years to learn all the crazy tricks.

215
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,960
Scott: I don't learn all the crazy tricks, I just learn the ones that I actually use.

216
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,860
Scott: The ones that you don't use on a regular basis, just look 'em up.

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,940
Rym: I mean, all I really use on a regular basis, other than the basic basic basics, are, like, I do some substitutions, and, you know, find and replace type stuff.

218
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,920
Rym: Or copy pasting, or yank put.

219
00:12:49,282 --> 00:13:10,900
Scott: Yeah, just remember that whenever you're in, like, a notepad, or the next time you're doing something with text editing or word processing, and you have to, like, copy and paste something, like, a billion times, and then edit, like, a little tiny bit on each line, just think, if you were using VI, and you bothered to learn it, you could probably do that by pushing, like, five keys on your keyboard, and pressing enter.

220
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,237
Scott: Just so you know.

221
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:21,779
Rym: Plus, if you know VI at all, you'll never be in the situation of, "Oh, I gotta fix my box, but I can't load X, and I don't have anything that edits text except that VI

222
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:22,040
Rym: thing.".

223
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,880
Scott: Yeah, remember how you said VI is on every computer there is, or at least every Unix computer?

224
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:44,220
Scott: It's 'cause other word processes aren't, so if you're an Emacs guy, Emacs is kinda big and eh, you know, and if you don't learn how to use VI at all, you might one day be having to fix a configuration file on some Unix machine, and it doesn't have Emacs, or NEdit, or Pico, or Nano, or anything, but it'll have VI.

225
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,780
Rym: Of course, I had to fix the Unix machine once, where VI, I couldn't even get to work properly, because I didn't even know what terminal to set up.

226
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:52,600
Scott: Wow.

227
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,659
Rym: 'Cause it was this Unix machine, and it didn't use VT- But it had VI, though.

228
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,559
Rym: It had VI in it.

229
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,220
Scott: Oh, there you go, same, the thing is, you know.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,040
Rym: I couldn't even make the arrow keys work, I had to use JK and all that.

231
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,098
Scott: So even if VI is not your editor of choice, learn VI.

232
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,839
Scott: I know that VIM is infinitely better than VI, but some old-ass computers only have VI.

233
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,319
Rym: Now usually on a computer, if you type VI, it'll actually just run VIM.

234
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:16,100
Rym: Yep.

235
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,619
Rym: Very few people actually have VI.

236
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,519
Scott: New modern computers that you're likely to use, that's the case, and what we're talking about here is VIM7.

237
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,800
Scott: Not Vim, not VI, VI is kinda dead.

238
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,258
Scott: No one likes it.

239
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,977
Rym: Rightfully so.

240
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,677
Rym: Rightfully so.

241
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:35,800
Rym: Alright, so HP and Dell and Lenovo have decided to do something stupid yet again.

242
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,275
Rym: Great.

243
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:48,560
Rym: They have decided that, you know, DVI and the UDI or HDMI and VGA and that other one, all those standards of hooking monitors up to computers, they're all no good.

244
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,299
Rym: They're gonna make a new one.

245
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,316
Scott: What's wrong with DVI?

246
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,939
Rym: DVI isn't as DRMed as they'd like it to be.

247
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,836
Scott: It doesn't have any DRM.

248
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,319
Rym: And they claim that DVI doesn't have enough bandwidth.

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,660
Scott: DVI can have like a hajillion resolution with perfect.

250
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,300
Rym: Actually, DVI does max out at 1920 by something unless you use DVI-B, which actually a lot of cards don't support.

251
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,200
Scott: The best digital TV in the world doesn't go that high.

252
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,579
Rym: Oh yeah, but if you have a crazy monitor or something.

253
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,400
Scott: And people with crazy monitors get those things with the two DVI cables coming out.

254
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,540
Rym: Keep in mind, I'm just playing devil's advocate here, I'm just saying what they say.

255
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:33,960
Rym: Now the advantage of DisplayPort, which is what they're calling this bullshit, is that it's somewhat backward compatible with all those other standards.

256
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:35,152
Rym: Oh, that's good.

257
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,215
Rym: At least with DVI.

258
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,977
Scott: That's good.

259
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,180
Rym: But, you know, it has the DRM, and they say it has so much more bandwidth, it has almost not more bandwidth.

260
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,499
Rym: It like barely edges DVI out.

261
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:48,980
Rym: Uh, alright.

262
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,919
Rym: But they're gonna make it standard on all their new PCs.

263
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,620
Scott: Okay.

264
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,400
Rym: I don't know what they're trying to accomplish.

265
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:02,719
Rym: It's like, every time a format that has DRM in it fails, they make another worse format, assuming that somehow this one will succeed.

266
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,640
Scott: Didn't they notice that Apple is the one winning the music?

267
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:15,420
Scott: See, they were actually talking about this on some other podcast today, how Apple has DRM and so do all the other music stores online, right?

268
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,779
Scott: But the Apple DRM is really, they're like, "Okay, how can we put DRM without the customer ever

269
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,160
Scott: noticing?".

270
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:31,280
Scott: And if you don't know this DRM, and you don't try to do something like copy music, you know, badly, the Apple DRM will never, you'll never see it and it'll never get in your way.

271
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,240
Scott: All the other guys, the people who made that, didn't care about the customers, they cared about the record companies.

272
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,040
Scott: So that DRM just gets all in your way all over the place.

273
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,780
Rym: Yeah, like I got this little Sony recorder bit that I use to do interviews now at cons.

274
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:58,559
Rym: It's great, except for the fact that it has such horrible shit DRM, that the only way to get the files off of it is to boot it, boot my computer into Windows, run this horrible application that then gets the encrypted data off of this thing.

275
00:16:59,646 --> 00:16:59,858
Scott: Wow.

276
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,160
Rym: In a crippled format, nonetheless.

277
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,740
Scott: So now here's the thing, I can understand how you want to plug up the analog hole, right?

278
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:11,619
Scott: That's a good thing, I guess, from a DRM, if you're an evil bastard.

279
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:16,260
Rym: Except the analog hole really means, guess what, I have eyes, I can see it.

280
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,819
Rym: If I can see it, I can record it, fuck you.

281
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,520
Scott: Yeah, but here's the thing, who the hell right now is ripping movies by plugging in recorders to the DVI port?

282
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,980
Scott: They're not, because they've broken the DRM before that point.

283
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:39,100
Scott: You know, you're making a DRM where no one's bothering to go, assuming that your other DRM is like rock solid or will be rock solid.

284
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,500
Scott: It never will be, ever.

285
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:46,940
Rym: What I think their plan here is, that currently people have broken the first stage, the software-y DRM.

286
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,760
Rym: But they haven't really gone after the hardware so much, because they haven't had to.

287
00:17:51,240 --> 00:18:02,320
Rym: I think they want to get good hardware DRM out there and ubiquitous, and keep putting it out there so that when they finally make DRM that's harder to break, suddenly we're backed into a corner.

288
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,820
Rym: I'm not saying it's going to work, but I think that's what they're thinking.

289
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:11,777
Scott: It's never going to work, DRM will never, there will never ever ever be a DRM that hackers will not break if they want to.

290
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:12,780
Scott: Ever.

291
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:22,960
Rym: I mean, even if there were a magical quantum thing that could make actual DRM, you still have to output it to some form of analog, because you have speakers.

292
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,345
Rym: Speakers make sound.

293
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,740
Rym: If anything, I put a microphone in front of that speaker.

294
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,407
Rym: You can't stop that.

295
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,131
Scott: Ever.

296
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,600
Rym: Ever ever ever ever ever.

297
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,066
Rym: Why don't they get it?

298
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,576
Rym: The analog hole is just that, it's a hole.

299
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,700
Rym: It can't ever be filled.

300
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,779
Rym: They can just pump money into it, but it's still a hole.

301
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:46,139
Scott: I think like the way Cory Doctorow says it, is DRM is a security where you give someone a goodie, but you put the goodie in a safe and you give them the key.

302
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,280
Scott: But you kind of make it so that they can only open the safe, kinda.

303
00:18:52,161 --> 00:19:02,080
Scott: It's like if you give someone a goodie in a safe and you give them the key, because you have to, or else you're not actually giving them the goodie, they're going to open it and get it out of there no matter what you want.

304
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,060
Rym: I just think of that penny arcade with the ham sandwiches in the Safeway.

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,355
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

306
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:14,848
Rym: Thing of the day.

307
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:16,930
Scott: Thing of the day.

308
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:24,250
Rym: Alright, so my thing of the day, I discovered this today actually, even though I had other things lined up for thing of the day over the weekend.

309
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:26,649
Scott: Oh, we get a lot of things of the day.

310
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,430
Rym: I already have my thing of the day for tomorrow, but this is horrifying and hideous.

311
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:40,890
Rym: It's someone made a Super Soaker-like device, only instead of being shaped like a squirt gun, it's shaped like a giant alien penis-looking thing.

312
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,310
Scott: Wait, what?

313
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:45,049
Rym: It looks like an alien's phallus.

314
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,610
Scott: Wait, so it's a Super Soaker.

315
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:53,610
Rym: It looks like some sort of alien-type phallus instrument of depositing semen into unwilling human hosts.

316
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:00,090
Scott: So there's a Super Soaker that is shaped and designed like the penis of an alien.

317
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,750
Rym: Now, that alone would not be so bad.

318
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,170
Rym: I mean, alright, a cylinder is phallic.

319
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,370
Rym: I mean, I can see a thousand things in my room that are in some way phallic.

320
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
Scott: This microphone I'm holding right up to my face.

321
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:17,790
Rym: When I'm up in front of this room, does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?

322
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,210
Rym: Alright, no Family Guy jokes.

323
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,829
Rym: So, in addition...

324
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:26,990
Scott: Can I conduct with my penis?

325
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,430
Rym: To it being shaped like a penis.

326
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,589
Scott: Can I podcast with my penis?

327
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,027
Rym: You go right at it.

328
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:32,928
Rym: You know what it shoots?

329
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,590
Rym: It doesn't shoot water.

330
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,948
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up.

331
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,108
Scott: How can you... It says on every Super Soaker ever, "Do not put anything in here that is not

332
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:42,410
Scott: water.".

333
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,510
Rym: Oh, this one doesn't shoot water on principle.

334
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:53,230
Rym: In fact, the ad that is linked to in my Thing of the Day shows you that it in fact shoots a slimy liquid of some kind.

335
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,330
Scott: Wait, how the hell does it do that without clogging up the works?

336
00:20:56,653 --> 00:20:57,268
Rym: It's designed to.

337
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,448
Rym: It shoots some sort of goop.

338
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:03,070
Rym: It shoots a small stream of goop that flies out and covers things in goop.

339
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,809
Scott: Coming out of an alien phallus.

340
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:10,088
Rym: Now, the kicker is that the advertisement shows this one kid like, "Oh,

341
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:10,630
Rym: right!".

342
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,829
Rym: And he's holding this thing and he pumps it a bunch of times.

343
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,428
Rym: And then he starts shooting it.

344
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,650
Rym: And it cuts two shots of little children.

345
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:20,987
Rym: Shots?

346
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:24,205
Rym: Like, holding their hands up like,

347
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:24,466
Rym: "Ahh!".

348
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,930
Rym: And then this goop hits them all over the face, bukkake style.

349
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,601
Scott: And then he pumps it up more and shoots out more.

350
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,288
Scott: goop up from the alien phallus.

351
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,125
Rym: Oh my god!

352
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:36,549
Rym: It just doesn't get worse.

353
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:37,568
Rym: What the fuck?

354
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,730
Rym: I only see one possibility.

355
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,768
Rym: Normally I say, "Oh, I

356
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,850
Rym: see.".

357
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:43,830
Scott: I know the possibility.

358
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,790
Scott: What's that company that makes the Super Soaker?

359
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,430
Scott: What's it called?

360
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:47,909
Rym: Oh, I don't remember.

361
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:49,950
Scott: I forget the name of the company.

362
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:50,609
Scott: It doesn't matter.

363
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,589
Scott: The people working for that company and designing Super Soakers, you know what they are?

364
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,770
Scott: Pedophiles of the bukkake fetti.

365
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:58,939
Rym: As they are.

366
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,510
Rym: What I could envision is a designer who is angry at his job decided, "You know what?

367
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,161
Rym: Here's an idea for a toy,

368
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:06,889
Rym: bastards.".

369
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:09,888
Rym: And the clueless executive said, "Alright,

370
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:10,150
Rym: fine."

371
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,541
Rym: And made it.

372
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:13,610
Rym: I can't imagine any other scenario.

373
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:21,205
Rym: I can't imagine a human being on this earth over the age of nine who would not see that and think, "That's a penis shooting semen at

374
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:21,508
Rym: people.".

375
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,290
Scott: You pump it and then it shoots goop and it's an alien palace.

376
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,586
Rym: Oh my God.

377
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,950
Rym: It kind of reminds me of that Viking toy.

378
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,950
Rym: You know how SNL used to always have those fake ads for fake toys or fake things like Super Happy Fun Ball?

379
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:37,629
Scott: I guess.

380
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,769
Rym: There was an ad once for this Viking thing.

381
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,218
Rym: And they showed it like.

382
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,689
Rym: they put it in the living room and they turned it on.

383
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,849
Rym: And it's a Viking that basically just sprays red dye around the room.

384
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,449
Rym: What parent would let their kid play with this?

385
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:54,424
Scott: I don't know.

386
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,510
Rym: Though I used to have a squirt gun that shot disappearing ink.

387
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:58,709
Scott: Yeah, those are cool.

388
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,030
Rym: Yeah, until you ran out of the ink and then you couldn't buy anymore because the toy was already taken off the market.

389
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,606
Rym: That sucks.

390
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,329
Rym: That was awesome.

391
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:04,841
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,690
Rym: So do you have a thing of the day?

393
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:07,268
Rym: I sure do.

394
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,410
Rym: Does it involve pedophilia bukkake?

395
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,708
Scott: No, it involves violence.

396
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,369
Scott: Ultraviolence.

397
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:21,370
Scott: Yeah, so on Japanese TV, there was a video of this guy riding down a mountain on a bicycle.

398
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,810
Rym: Like downhill mountain biking?

399
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,830
Scott: No, it was a really weird mountain.

400
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,070
Scott: Like I think it was a volcano.

401
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,210
Scott: Except it was really smooth.

402
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,390
Scott: Like if you wanted to go really, really fast, there's no better place than this.

403
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,990
Scott: A perfectly smooth downhill kind of dirt.

404
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,270
Scott: You get a lot of nice traction.

405
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:46,845
Scott: And this guy was on a bike and he went down the hill and they recorded his speed at like 168 kilometers an hour at one point.

406
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,970
Scott: I was like holy shit, right?

407
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:53,109
Scott: And then I guess he slowly stopped after that.

408
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,709
Rym: Well, I can see that.

409
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:02,170
Rym: I mean, biking down the meager hills that existed in Michigan when I was a kid, I once got my bike up to about 50 miles an hour.

410
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:13,330
Scott: Yeah, so the next thing they show is this guy who's wearing this red suit with a helmet and he's all fancy-like and he's got a really fancy looking bike.

411
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,955
Scott: Like he's prepared to do this.

412
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,890
Scott: Like he's going to break a world record in how fast his bike is going to go downhill.

413
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,528
Rym: Yeah, like he was in this fancy kind of looking bike too.

414
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,755
Scott: Yeah, really fancy.

415
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:25,610
Scott: The kind that has like three plastic spokes in the wheels.

416
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,650
Rym: Yeah, like an actual downhill bike as opposed to the first guy who was just on some mountain bike.

417
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,016
Scott: Yeah.

418
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,038
Scott: The guy looks pretty buff too.

419
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:34,886
Scott: Like he's like grrr, I'm going to go get this.

420
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:35,670
Scott: Yeah, awesome.

421
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,329
Rym: Alright, Steve-O!

422
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:38,007
Scott: Steve-O!

423
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,779
Scott: So he starts going.

424
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,589
Scott: He's going pretty fast.

425
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,865
Scott: Whoosh, whoosh.

426
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,950
Scott: He gets to a certain point and then the frame of the bike just collapses.

427
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:56,410
Scott: Like the front wheel goes up and the part where the pedals are goes down.

428
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,579
Rym: Man, that's like a fear I've had as a child.

429
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:03,330
Rym: I was always densely afraid of the fact that my front fork would suddenly break and I'd be killed by the bike.

430
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,616
Scott: This wasn't the fork, it was behind the fork.

431
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:10,570
Scott: It was like where the fork, you know, reaches the handlebars like right in there.

432
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,009
Scott: It just went right in half.

433
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:13,990
Rym: That's a little too close to my balls.

434
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,414
Scott: It was way close to his balls.

435
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:20,470
Scott: So the guy, of course, flips over forward like a bajillion times.

436
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:25,290
Scott: And well, just watch the video and you'll see just how injured this guy gets.

437
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:33,250
Scott: He turns from a pretty dangerous looking dude, turns into an old, beat the shit out of old man in like a second.

438
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,690
Rym: I think the worst part is when his helmet flies off.

439
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,887
Rym: And you see that, wow, he's still, oh, ooh, oh.

440
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,558
Scott: And you see like parts of the bike I think hit him at the beginning.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,645
Scott: Oh, painful to watch.

442
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,450
Scott: Even more painful to be that guy.

443
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,250
Scott: He didn't die, but oh god, it's painful.

444
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:57,110
Scott: So if you would like to watch people in pain, I don't know, I don't like to watch it, but it's just so... It's like watching a train wreck.

445
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,615
Rym: You know what it's like?

446
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,490
Rym: It's like watching those owned compilations on Google Video.

447
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,434
Scott: Exactly.

448
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,889
Scott: This is the ultimate owned.

449
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:09,109
Scott: It's more owned than any of the owns I've ever seen.

450
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,756
Rym: I guess that is the difference.

451
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,609
Rym: I mean, look, this is a Japanese TV thing, right?

452
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,410
Rym: The guy got hurt and the cameras kept rolling and then they showed the horrible aftermath.

453
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:19,989
Rym: Wow, look, look at the consequences of what you decided to do.

454
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:26,150
Rym: Anytime in America when they're filming some sort of stunt and it goes wrong, they don't show you the aftermath.

455
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,189
Rym: They show you like a panned back shot of paramedics and that's it.

456
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:30,569
Scott: If you're lucky.

457
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:32,249
Rym: If you're lucky.

458
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:38,510
Rym: I don't know, I guess it speaks well that, yeah, if something bad happens, at least report on it or choke it.

459
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,350
Rym: Hey, don't try this at home, you'll die.

460
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:47,829
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if they make a show about someone jumping over ten school buses on a motorcycle and they mess up, that show doesn't actually ever make it to the air.

461
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,927
Scott: You'll just see like a news story about it.

462
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,469
Scott: It's when the guy, you know, so when you watch a show on some channel about some stunt, the guy always succeeds every time.

463
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:00,729
Rym: Well, unless it's a Fox show, World's Blankiest Blank.

464
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:03,268
Scott: World's Blankiest Blank.

465
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:12,790
Scott: We're going to do today's show on the history and whatnot of P2P file sharing thingies.

466
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:21,250
Rym: Yeah, a few people have asked about it and all the other topics you've asked about, we kind of went long in the news, so we don't want to spend a short episode on something big.

467
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:29,750
Scott: Yeah, we're not going to get too technical into exactly how they work or how you can use them or copyright or anything like that.

468
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,183
Scott: We're just going to talk about the history of P2P usage in general, the major networks, etc.

469
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:45,990
Rym: Yeah, because basically the two of us, we're from the generation that lived through the dawn of the MP3 age, like directly.

470
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,910
Rym: We got some of the first MP3s and we were along at every step of the way.

471
00:27:50,990 --> 00:28:03,170
Rym: And it startled me one day when someone at my work was talking about Napster and they had no idea that Napster used to be the thing, because they've only known Napster as that crappy Napster what it is today.

472
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:03,855
Scott: Really?

473
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,010
Scott: Wow, that wasn't until recently.

474
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:09,806
Rym: Yeah, well, people who really weren't hip with it, or people who were young, or people who didn't care, don't really know.

475
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:10,669
Rym: And it's kind of fascinating.

476
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,410
Scott: But it was all over the news back in the day when it was for real.

477
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,070
Rym: They didn't know what it was, or they didn't pay attention.

478
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,770
Scott: Okay, well, in the beginning there was two things.

479
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,050
Rym: Well, in the beginning there was MIDI.

480
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,395
Rym: Well, okay.

481
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,540
Scott: MIDI files were the beginning.

482
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,907
Scott: You could get them from websites, and Usenets, and IRCs, and FTPs.

483
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,875
Scott: That was the beginning of those four things.

484
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:40,667
Scott: Usenet, IRC, FTP, websites.

485
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:41,730
Scott: One, two, three, four.

486
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:49,430
Rym: Now, before Napster and peer-to-peer and all that, basically the only way to get MP3s, which were this elite thing.

487
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,628
Rym: I mean, they were, in that day, like Where's was in the late 80s, early 90s.

488
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,430
Rym: It was the thing that people would collect and seek out, and parter over, and fight with, and it was fun.

489
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,993
Scott: Yeah, there would be trades.

490
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:06,564
Scott: They'd be like, "Hey, I'll wait the 20 minutes it takes to send this to you.

491
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:08,869
Scott: if you wait the 20 minutes it takes to send that to

492
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:09,009
Scott: me.".

493
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:17,290
Rym: Or there were just blatant FTP sites where you'd log in, and they had ratios where for every 10 megabytes you uploaded, you were allowed to download one megabyte.

494
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:25,190
Scott: Yeah, a lot of IRC channels would have bots in them, and you could send files to the bots, and then they would send you things back.

495
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,980
Rym: And of course there were the MP3 sites, which would have thousands of links.

496
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:33,970
Rym: Maybe five of them would work, but you'd click on every goddamn one.

497
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,709
Rym: You didn't care what the song was, you'd download it.

498
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,650
Scott: That's right.

499
00:29:38,094 --> 00:29:39,989
Rym: I got some shitty music because of that.

500
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:48,070
Scott: I think I got one song that way, ever, because I just didn't care, and then I forgot to, what, you had to burn it or something?

501
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,082
Rym: Oh, you had to uh...

502
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,014
Scott: Scrape it?

503
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,947
Scott: What was the word?

504
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,820
Rym: It was MP3 cooked.

505
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,027
Rym: You had to uncook MP3s.

506
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:54,819
Scott: Yup.

507
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:02,550
Rym: Because back then, no one, no web server was set up to let you download MP3s, binary files.

508
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:06,290
Rym: So it wouldn't know mime types, it would just download ASCII.

509
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:13,770
Rym: So you'd get an MP3, you'd go to play it, and instead of music coming out, the godawful screeches of the damned would come out of your speakers.

510
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,945
Scott: Yup, yup.

511
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:20,610
Scott: The only way to fix it was- And Winamp would use your 100% CPU usage on your 486.

512
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,191
Rym: Yup, yup.

513
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:29,530
Rym: Or because you had an ISA sound card and an ISA network card, you couldn't play MP3s and download websites at the same time.

514
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:29,980
Rym: Yup.

515
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,970
Rym: But one day, Napster appeared.

516
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,949
Scott: Napster was god.

517
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,410
Rym: Now when it first appeared, there was about a two week period where I didn't know anything about it.

518
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,718
Rym: Like I heard of it, and I thought it was something stupid.

519
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,910
Rym: I thought it was like MP3 sites, but for the masses.

520
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,370
Scott: I heard the word Napster, I didn't know what it was, one day eventually I got around to using it, and holy crap.

521
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:59,209
Rym: Well one day in high school, this girl was sitting there and she said, "Napster is great, but half the songs I get don't sound right and it takes forever to download

522
00:30:59,229 --> 00:30:59,350
Rym: them.".

523
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,882
Rym: And I said, "Why are you using Napster?

524
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:02,847
Rym: Just go to FTP

525
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:03,209
Rym: sites.".

526
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,541
Rym: Then I got home and I thought,

527
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:06,186
Rym: "Huh.".

528
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,730
Rym: So I went on Yahoo, because back then that was what you searched with.

529
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,759
Scott: There was no Google then.

530
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:11,687
Scott: No Google.

531
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,629
Rym: I typed "Napster" and I saw this website, and I wasn't sure what to make of it.

532
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,890
Scott: Well, there was this protocol that they invented called OpenNAP.

533
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,869
Scott: Well, I don't think it was called OpenNAP.

534
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,301
Rym: It was called Napster.

535
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:25,210
Scott: It was called Napster.

536
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,666
Scott: Something like that.

537
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,830
Scott: Basically what it was, is you would run a server, which is a Napster server.

538
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,570
Scott: So it was still sort of a client server deal, which is how they were able to shut it down in the first place.

539
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:41,210
Scott: And the server had an IRC, and it let you chat with other people, and it let you send files to other people.

540
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:46,467
Scott: And you could say, "These are the files that I am sharing," or, "These are the directories I am

541
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:46,908
Scott: sharing.".

542
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:56,150
Scott: And people could search, and based on file names they could come up with files that other people were sharing, and directly download them from other people.

543
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:04,385
Scott: And you could say, "I will allow X people to download from me at once," and, "I will allow one person to download these many things from me at a

544
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:04,987
Scott: time.".

545
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:09,470
Rym: Now, it was very primitive compared to the peer-to-peer you're used to today.

546
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,530
Scott: Very primitive.

547
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,076
Rym: You had to do everything manually.

548
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,310
Rym: You'd find ten people who had the file you wanted.

549
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,710
Rym: You picked the guy who was probably the fastest.

550
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,518
Scott: And you couldn't just say, "Get from

551
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:19,881
Scott: everyone."

552
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,446
Scott: You picked one guy.

553
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,070
Rym: Now, searching was great, because most stuff was on there, unless you listened to any good music.

554
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,371
Scott: Well, no.

555
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:34,329
Scott: The thing about Napster was that even though it was so primitive, so many people were using it.

556
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,149
Rym: Because there was no fear.

557
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:37,474
Scott: Well, no.

558
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,620
Scott: It's not that there was no fear.

559
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,330
Scott: It's that you could find anything.

560
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,130
Scott: Because it was like the library of Alexandria when it comes to music and file sharing.

561
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,590
Scott: Everything you could think of was there somewhere.

562
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,390
Rym: Well, anything you could think of that was modern.

563
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:50,326
Scott: Oh, yeah.

564
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,698
Rym: You couldn't find old stuff.

565
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,710
Rym: You couldn't find a lot of foreign stuff right away.

566
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,630
Scott: You couldn't find old and foreign stuff, but anything that was ever really on the radio in America, you could find.

567
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:00,475
Rym: Yeah.

568
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:00,964
Rym: And really...

569
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,637
Scott: Type in Elvis, every Elvis song.

570
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:04,970
Scott: Type in Rolling Stones, every Rolling Stones song.

571
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:05,460
Scott: Just ding!

572
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:05,889
Scott: There they are.

573
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,730
Rym: And no one really thought about it, because no one was being sued.

574
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,610
Rym: Most people who used it didn't even think about it being illegal.

575
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,410
Rym: Especially since it was from this legit-looking company.

576
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,318
Scott: Yeah, people just did it.

577
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:18,345
Scott: Everyone was happy.

578
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:19,150
Scott: Everything was awesome.

579
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,230
Scott: At college campuses, it was insane, because everything was so fast.

580
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,200
Scott: You'd be like, "Song!

581
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,464
Scott: Song!

582
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:23,707
Scott: Song!

583
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:23,848
Scott: Song!".

584
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,170
Scott: And within a minute, everyone on the whole campus could have every single thing everyone else had.

585
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,250
Scott: It was crazy.

586
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,892
Rym: Yep.

587
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,410
Rym: And it ushered in a new era.

588
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,550
Rym: My MP3 collection quintupled every day.

589
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,714
Scott: It was the greatest.

590
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:36,999
Scott: Absolutely.

591
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,470
Scott: But then freshman year of college is, what, 2000?

592
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,605
Rym: Yeah.

593
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:41,932
Scott: 2001-ish.

594
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:47,410
Scott: They started to block it and filter it, and eventually they killed it off pretty quick.

595
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,329
Rym: Yeah, then it got sued and it went down.

596
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,608
Scott: Which sucked.

597
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,793
Rym: Of course.

598
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:55,150
Rym: Right about that time, the peer-to-peer revolution happened.

599
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,022
Rym: Because Napster itself wasn't that great.

600
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,069
Rym: It was just the first one.

601
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:04,950
Scott: Well, there was other ones that were about what Napster was about, but none of them had the people to actually be useful.

602
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,050
Rym: Well, because Napster came, it was the first one that took off, and the community was so big that that was it.

603
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,248
Rym: You didn't need to go anywhere else.

604
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,270
Rym: Of course, as time went on, other ones appeared.

605
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,170
Rym: And once Napster died, once we knew it was dead forever, all the other ones exploded.

606
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,215
Scott: WinMX came out.

607
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,380
Scott: Kazaa.

608
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,509
Scott: Nutella finally got some users.

609
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,681
Scott: You know, Limewire, which is I think also Nutella.

610
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:30,690
Scott: It got crazy go nuts.

611
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,110
Rym: Yep.

612
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:32,228
Rym: Then there was WinMX.

613
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:32,973
Scott: Oh, wait, wait.

614
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:33,679
Scott: Hotline.

615
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,790
Scott: Hotline was classic.

616
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,699
Rym: I totally forgot about Hotline, didn't you?

617
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,630
Rym: You ran that Hotline server for a while.

618
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:39,408
Scott: I sure did.

619
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,330
Rym: It was really popular.

620
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,449
Scott: We got lots of anime on that Hotline server.

621
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,050
Rym: Yeah, we basically, Scott set up a Hotline server at RIT, and we got fansubs and shared them.

622
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:51,949
Scott: Hotline was actually this really old thing.

623
00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:09,570
Scott: You would run a Hotline server, and people with Hotline clients could visit it, and Hotline servers had files that were shared and rules about sharing the files, and you could upload things to a Hotline server, and you could have a message of the day, and you could chat on the Hotline servers.

624
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,490
Scott: They had all kinds of... It was just a server you could connect to with the Hotline client and do all sorts of things on.

625
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,170
Scott: And mostly, people would go around looking for Hotline servers and download files from them and upload files to them.

626
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,630
Rym: Yep, it was real slick, it was real fun, and it slowly got shot down over time.

627
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,619
Scott: I don't know if it got shut down.

628
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,750
Scott: I think something weird happened to the company.

629
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,190
Rym: Not shut down, shot down.

630
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,201
Scott: Oh, it got something weird happened to the company.

631
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:33,530
Scott: It was a very strange situation.

632
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,770
Rym: Yep, and then it stopped being updated, and then there were holes in it, and then other better things appeared.

633
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,170
Scott: You know, we could probably use the Hotline model combined with the BitTorrent model in some fashion.

634
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:44,990
Rym: Yeah, the main problem with Hotline...

635
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,770
Scott: Also with the Waste model, somehow.

636
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,050
Rym: Is that all these early peer-to-peers were very open, because no one really worried about lawsuits.

637
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,849
Rym: If you were at a Hotline server, it was directly and easily traceable right to you.

638
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,340
Scott: Oh, you'd be able to just visit it.

639
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,190
Scott: You're running a server.

640
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,637
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,843
Scott: It's like, "Hello, come visit my server.

642
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:01,507
Scott: It's got good

643
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:01,890
Scott: stuff.".

644
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,350
Rym: Some people, a lot of them were password protected or secret.

645
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,146
Rym: Like, you had to know, "Oh, connect to this IP address with this

646
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:07,669
Rym: password."

647
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:11,969
Rym: Or, "Go to this website and prove that you're not evil cops, and then we'll let you

648
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,110
Rym: in.".

649
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:23,209
Scott: Oh, a lot of people would have things like, "If you want the password to my Hotline, go to this website, click on this thing, and then do this and that, and that way I get, like, five bucks whenever you do that stupid thing with an advertisement, and then you can get into my

650
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:23,530
Scott: Hotline.".

651
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,829
Rym: A lot of people made money that way.

652
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,763
Scott: A lot of people made money that way.

653
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:27,570
Scott: Scarily.

654
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:38,850
Rym: Now, these things were all great, but none of them really... Like, one would come up and it'd be great, and then eventually, either from lawsuits or technologically or just community-wise, it would collapse.

655
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:42,790
Rym: There's really no loyalty in the peer-to-peer world.

656
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,190
Scott: Nope.

657
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,897
Scott: People would go wherever the files were.

658
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:55,590
Scott: If anything weird started happening, or if the user experience started to suck, or if there were no new files, or if users started being assholes, people would just leave and go find some other way to get their files.

659
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:04,610
Scott: Whatever way was the easiest way to get files, people would go through any amount of hell to get that way to work, as long as the way itself was easy.

660
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:06,156
Rym: Of course, it's still kind of that way.

661
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,822
Rym: I mean, Supernova went down.

662
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,850
Rym: People just jumped to Pirate's Bay and never looked back.

663
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:10,411
Scott: Yep.

664
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,184
Scott: Nobody remembers Supernova now.

665
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:12,910
Scott: It's all Pirate Bay.

666
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,531
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,445
Rym: And Pirate Bay can't be taken down.

668
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,170
Rym: It's not illegal.

669
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,303
Scott: Yeah, there's Torrent Reactor, and there's Mininova, and there's a whole bunch of sites now.

670
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:21,868
Scott: They took out Supernova.

671
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:22,390
Scott: Ooh, big deal.

672
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:28,670
Rym: Now, anyway, peer-to-peer, because we just talked kind of wildly and openly about the history of it and no particular...

673
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,512
Scott: What do you want?

674
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:32,370
Scott: We're just trying to finish off this day so we can do our E3 day tomorrow.

675
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,830
Scott: Oh my God.

676
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:33,630
Scott: This day's a throwaway.

677
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,370
Rym: We've had so much breaking news for E3 during this podcast.

678
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,451
Scott: Doesn't matter.

679
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:47,330
Scott: Anyone out there who knows is reading all this stuff now, and they're just waiting because tomorrow we'll have insightful commentary as opposed to just information.

680
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:54,450
Rym: All I have to say, and I'm not going to say any specifics, but when I picture Sony now, all I picture is the biggest ha-ha guy in the world.

681
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,749
Scott: The biggest ha-ha guy in the world?

682
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,689
Rym: Because Sony's done.

683
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:58,508
Rym: Oh my God.

684
00:37:58,852 --> 00:37:59,530
Rym: Sony's done.

685
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:00,528
Scott: All right, anyway.

686
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:13,469
Rym: So, peer-to-peer, all it means is that, in the old days, when we were talking about FTP sites or websites, if you download a file, you connect to a server, and you download the file in one go, and that's it.

687
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,763
Rym: Peer-to-peer, everyone's a server and everyone's a client.

688
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,750
Rym: Everyone downloads from everyone.

689
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,090
Rym: No one person or client is better or more authoritative than another person or client.

690
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,957
Rym: Now, you might think, "Eh, but how does that work?

691
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,119
Rym: Because it could be insecure and

692
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:31,380
Rym: blah.".

693
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,110
Rym: Well, there's so many people that you can use algorithms to figure out who's good and who's bad.

694
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:50,879
Rym: If you're downloading a file from a bunch of different people and they're all downloading it from you, you can do various MD5-type checksum things, hashes, and see, "Hey, all the data from this guy is no good compared to everyone else's.

695
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:51,960
Rym: I'm just going to block

696
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,120
Rym: him.".

697
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:53,105
Scott: Yep.

698
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:57,779
Scott: They didn't actually add that sort of functionality for a long time.

699
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:02,150
Scott: In the beginning, there were a whole bunch of people, but you had to pick one guy.

700
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,070
Scott: It wasn't until much later where you could download something from multiple people at once.

701
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:14,930
Scott: And now, finally, we have BitTorrent, which is a whole bunch of people have different parts of the same thing, and then they all kind of pass it around until everyone's got the whole thing.

702
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,734
Rym: Even though it's funny how the revolution kind of became full circle in terms of the interface.

703
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:32,210
Rym: I mean, it went from going to sites, clicking on links, getting files, to loading special software, to loading crazier special software that was meta-software for all the other softwares, to going to websites and clicking on links for files.

704
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,658
Rym: Mm-hmm.

705
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,730
Rym: Only now, the links are awesome BitTorrent.

706
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,070
Scott: And that actually work every time, mostly.

707
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,878
Rym: Now, surprisingly, and I don't want to sound like the old man, "I was better back in the day,".

708
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:46,330
Rym: but there really weren't assholes and griefers in the early days of peer-to-peer.

709
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,670
Scott: No, it wasn't until the Kazaa days that there were assholes and griefers.

710
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:56,302
Rym: Yeah, I mean, if you searched for an MP3 and it was called "Elvis whatever," you were guaranteed to get Elvis whatever.

711
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,630
Rym: There was no chance of accidentally getting lesbian porn instead.

712
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:05,906
Scott: Yeah, even on the WinMX days, people would, you know, some people would say, "Hey, I don't want to let you upload.

713
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:07,490
Scott: They'd cancel you unless you traded with

714
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,630
Scott: them.".

715
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,317
Scott: But most people, you know, you click on a file, you'd get it.

716
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:17,110
Scott: Most people would keep their program open and online all the time, so you would just keep downloading until you got the whole thing.

717
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,910
Rym: But then, assholes appeared, and two, the recording industry decided to start flooding the networks with bad data.

718
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:30,030
Scott: And it seems that they're slowly shutting down all those peer-to-peer networks one at a time, except Bittorrent.

719
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,569
Rym: Yeah, because Bittorrent really can't be shut down.

720
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,729
Scott: Bittorrent is God.

721
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,550
Rym: I mean, very briefly, we can explain how Bittorrent works.

722
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,312
Scott: I already did.

723
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,082
Scott: One guy sets up a tracker.

724
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:42,688
Scott: I don't even think you need the trackers anymore.

725
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:43,230
Scott: I'm not sure.

726
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:46,005
Rym: There are ways to do trackerless torrents.

727
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:51,219
Scott: And you get these torrent files, and you download the torrent file.

728
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:56,289
Scott: The torrent file is just a description of where the real file's at and how to get it.

729
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,610
Scott: So you just download this little torrent file, and you run it with Bittorrent client.

730
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,548
Scott: The Bittorrent client looks at the torrent file, and it says, "Okay, that's how I'm going to get this

731
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:04,849
Scott: file.".

732
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:12,869
Scott: It goes around to the tracker, and the tracker says, "Okay, these are the people who have that file and are torrenting it right

733
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:13,090
Scott: now.".

734
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:20,910
Scott: And then you hook up with all the other people who are torrenting the file that you want, and it starts getting pieces from all those different people at once.

735
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:30,270
Scott: And as you collect pieces, if new people come around who don't have the pieces that you got, you give them the pieces that you got, and other people give you the pieces you don't got.

736
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:38,510
Scott: And if there's a whole lot of people doing the same file at once, you can get the whole file pretty quickly, because there's just so many people giving you pieces.

737
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,659
Scott: But if there aren't so many people, then it takes a long time.

738
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:47,070
Scott: If there's just one guy and you, you just directly download it from him really slowly.

739
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,170
Rym: Now think about the huge advantage of this for, say, someone like us, where we host files.

740
00:41:52,610 --> 00:42:00,310
Rym: Say we wanted to make a compilation of the first five months of GeekNights in one torrent, or one file, or one set of files.

741
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:07,410
Rym: If we just had it to download, every person who downloaded it would kill our server with a giant bandwidth bill, and we'd be fucked.

742
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:12,470
Rym: If we had a torrent, if one person downloads it, it's the same as if we had a normal file.

743
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,350
Rym: But if two people download it, ooh, we start saving bandwidth.

744
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:23,290
Rym: And if a thousand people download it, not only does it save us a ton of bandwidth, but it's actually faster for everyone else to get the file than if we were just hosting it correctly.

745
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,357
Scott: As long as everyone downloads it at the same time.

746
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:29,270
Scott: If one guy downloads it today and another guy downloads it tomorrow, it doesn't make a difference.

747
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:45,530
Scott: Unless the first guy, because what you can do with BitTorrent is after you finish downloading something, you keep the window open and you don't close BitTorrent, and then you'll keep giving pieces to other people who don't have pieces, but of course you already have every piece of the file so you don't need to get anymore.

748
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,990
Scott: You just keep giving and giving and giving to people who don't have it.

749
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,890
Rym: But it's a very good poor man's way of doing load balancing.

750
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,920
Rym: Say you've got a big file you want to share with people.

751
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:56,410
Rym: In the old days, you just had to buy a big pipe and big servers.

752
00:42:57,071 --> 00:43:05,650
Rym: Now, say you have three servers, or three places you can seed, you have those three places seed, and then the torrent file will start getting stuff from all three of those.

753
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,773
Rym: Thus balancing the load.

754
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:13,930
Rym: And then if you get crazy popular suddenly, you get a swarm, and then you're okay because now the swarm takes care of itself.

755
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:26,154
Scott: Yeah, if you're using BitTorrent as not like a shady one-man file sharing, but as a big corporation trying to distribute files easily, BitTorrent can work really well.

756
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:32,827
Scott: if you just set up like ten or twenty computers to all seed the torrents all the time.

757
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,570
Scott: Freakin' that's great.

758
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,950
Rym: Yeah, that's a really, really good way to balance load.

759
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,924
Scott: Especially if you put them in ten different places around the net.

760
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:41,990
Scott: Hey, we should start a company.

761
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:48,290
Scott: We'll just buy ten really big servers around the net, and we'll torrent your files from all these ten places at once.

762
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,720
Rym: You know, I was about to say the same thing.

763
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,010
Rym: That's a really good idea.

764
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,354
Scott: Yeah, there's like ten places around the country.

765
00:43:53,394 --> 00:44:02,070
Scott: Give us a file, we'll torrent it on all the machines at once, and then whenever anyone tries to get your torrent, it's guaranteed to be fast and wicked.

766
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,170
Rym: Plus, I see in the future, as torrent becomes more and more ubiquitous, because it has already stood up to the test of time.

767
00:44:08,673 --> 00:44:08,907
Scott: Oh yeah.

768
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:17,790
Rym: Things that are in some ways slightly better or slightly different have come up, and then immediately collapsed and disappeared because BitTorrent is just so... it's like MP3.

769
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,926
Scott: Well, most of the things that have come up to be like BitTorrent are... because BitTorrent was open source.

770
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:24,230
Scott: I think it is open source still.

771
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:37,330
Scott: And people seem to take the BitTorrent client and the BitTorrent server also, and they sort of remix it, or add a feature, or add a DRM, or change the way it looks, or something evil like that.

772
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,100
Scott: And they'll try to sell it, or they'll try to say, "You have to use our thing.

773
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,882
Scott: You can't actually...".

774
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:44,689
Scott: you know, when it's really just BitTorrent with their name on it.

775
00:44:45,191 --> 00:44:46,535
Scott: And all kinds of weird stuff.

776
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:48,881
Scott: So, yeah.

777
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:51,930
Scott: Nothing else has really done the same thing BitTorrent has done.

778
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,350
Rym: Yeah, or people have tried to do things better, but they didn't work as well.

779
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:56,253
Scott: Mmm.

780
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:01,530
Rym: I mean, the model of BitTorrent on a high level of how it works is pretty much rock solid.

781
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:09,650
Rym: They could probably do things on the low level to make it optimized better, but in terms of the concept, I think it's dead on, and I don't see anything usurping it anytime soon.

782
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,972
Scott: Nah, I don't think so either.

783
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:14,058
Scott: I mean, it's pretty much here to stay.

784
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:20,650
Scott: The music people and the movie people don't seem to be going after it, because the guy who runs it made that agreement with them.

785
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,650
Scott: They're gonna go out to the torrent sites, but I don't think Pirate Bay's gonna give up, which means they're pretty much screwed.

786
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,763
Rym: What Pirate Bay is doing is perfectly legal in their country.

787
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:31,390
Rym: They cannot go after Pirate's Bay.

788
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:38,229
Scott: The only way you can go after the BitTorrent people is if the ISPs continue to screw up BitTorrent.

789
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:41,517
Scott: Our ISP is relatively nice when it comes to BitTorrent.

790
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:47,730
Scott: They only do one little thing that's not so annoying to kind of hinder you from being a seed tracker guy.

791
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:54,149
Rym: Plus, even then, BitTorrent, it's very easy if you're a client to route around whatever they do to you.

792
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:03,590
Rym: Because, especially, I mean, BitTorrent uses different ports and there are different ways to set it up, but for people who don't know anything about networking, I do recommend Azureus as a BitTorrent client.

793
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,090
Scott: Ah, I just use the regular old BitTorrent client.

794
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,910
Rym: Well, the one difference is that Azureus, you can set one incoming port and tunnel it through your router.

795
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,829
Scott: You can do that with BitTorrent normal also.

796
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,190
Rym: Yeah, you said you couldn't before.

797
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,850
Scott: Yeah, you can.

798
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,889
Rym: Because I asked and you said now.

799
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:17,328
Scott: I said I wouldn't want to.

800
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:17,933
Rym: Eh?

801
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:21,789
Rym: Why would I want to if I- Anyway, Azureus is really easy to use.

802
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,923
Scott: It's Java, it's big and slow, and it's this giant freaking window full of crap.

803
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,470
Scott: The real BitTorrent client's a nice little window, it's happy.

804
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:30,670
Rym: Yeah, but I- It's simple.

805
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:38,370
Rym: People out there seem to like Azureus, and I've noticed people I offer BitTorrent to tend to prefer it or don't really like the normal BitTorrent client.

806
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,042
Scott: I don't know why, maybe it's because they didn't like the older BitTorrent client.

807
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:44,050
Scott: They don't realize the new one doesn't suck as much.

808
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:44,724
Rym: That might be.

809
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:56,270
Scott: The other thing is I notice a lot of people who are using the Azureuses and whatnot, they seem to be wanting to cheat the system or have more control over BitTorrent than you're supposed to.

810
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,963
Scott: They'll be like, "Ah, I want to use this so I can not upload as

811
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:01,224
Scott: much.".

812
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:02,929
Scott: It's like, "No, you should upload as much as you

813
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:03,129
Scott: can.".

814
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:06,819
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of connection you're on.

815
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,969
Rym: If you're on a symmetrical cable connection where you're-.

816
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,270
Scott: Well, the regular BitTorrent client has one slider, and you slide that slider to what your connection is, and that's it.

817
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:22,580
Scott: These other clients, they have things like, "Don't share it all for this file," "Do this for that one,".

818
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:27,490
Scott: and it's all these extra controls that make it more complicated that really don't need to be there.

819
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,395
Rym: Yeah, but it's nice to have them there.

820
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:32,930
Rym: People don't seem to use them that often except for a handful of assholes out there.

821
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,437
Scott: Yeah, but I know it's the most- I don't know.

822
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:36,862
Scott: I just don't see the point.

823
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:38,547
Scott: It's like, "What are you going to use them,

824
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:38,788
Scott: never?".

825
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:40,076
Rym: Yeah, you never know.

826
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:41,470
Rym: It depends on what's your situation.

827
00:47:42,253 --> 00:47:46,650
Scott: What kind of situation could it be where you would need more controls than what the regular BitTorrent client gives you?

828
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:52,521
Scott: If you've got a weird- Name one thing that Azureus has that the regular BitTorrent client doesn't that you need.

829
00:47:53,744 --> 00:47:54,005
Scott: Nothing.

830
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:55,950
Scott: Or MicroTorrent, nothing.

831
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:03,943
Scott: Yeah, so there's not much more we can really say about P2P without going into super technical whatnots.

832
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:07,770
Scott: So, E3 tomorrow, woot!

833
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:17,560
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

834
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:20,150
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

835
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,040
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

836
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:28,148
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

837
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:28,950
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

838
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,017
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

839
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:35,602
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

840
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,050
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

841
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:47,000
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

842
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:50,870
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
