00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,426
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 26th, 2017.

2
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,151
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,355
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:18,606
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight Castlevania On Netflix.

5
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:19,552
Scott: The not anime.

6
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,719
Rym: The Netflix one.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,937
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,793
Rym: So my whole life, I don't like wearing shoes.

9
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:37,053
Rym: Like that's just a thing I really would rather does not have shoes on but at the same time I don't want the bottoms of my feet to be covered in poop, shall we say.

10
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:39,140
Scott: I just don't like wearing uncomfortable or painful shoes.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,479
Scott: So I always wear the most comfortable shoe.

12
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,629
Scott: I don't wear an uncomfortable shoe ever.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,825
Rym: But the most comfortable kind of foot covering is Probably the sandal.

14
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,311
Rym: The high quality sandal.

15
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:51,400
Rym: I'm a big fan of wearing the sandal.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,252
Scott: The most comfortable shoe covering is a sneaker that is extremely squishy and light.

17
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,260
Rym: But that is not optimal if it's hot outside.

18
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,333
Scott: I don't really have a problem of overheating feet.

19
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:03,680
Rym: It's so much more comfortable.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Rym: Like if I'm wearing sandals, I could even get away with wearing pants instead of shorts.

21
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,070
Rym: That's how profound a difference that is.

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,973
Scott: I don't have this problem.

23
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,600
Rym: Also, the sandal is just chill.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,507
Rym: It's airy, your feet are hanging out there.

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,234
Rym: They get tanned like the rest of you.

26
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,378
Scott: I don't have this problem.

27
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,824
Rym: Anyway, I really like sandals.

28
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:22,040
Rym: I'm really particular about my sandals because I don't like flip-flops.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,723
Rym: I think they're...

30
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:26,958
Scott: No, I hate any any sandal where the thing goes between your big toe and your next toe.

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,010
Rym: But that's because it literally is like a glove on your foot.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,552
Scott: No, no, no.

33
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,740
Scott: A toe shoe is fine at least in that regard.

34
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:33,840
Rym: It's a glove on your foot.

35
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:46,793
Scott: If you are using this Spoke that goes between your big toe and your second toe as a means of keeping the shoe on the foot It means you sort of have to squeeze those toes together a little bit.

36
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:49,905
Rym: You have to walk with a weird game Which I read articles there.

37
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:54,800
Rym: there is evidence that walking long distances and flip-flops causes specific harm, right?

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,261
Scott: There is it.

39
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,990
Scott: well to you, you know, a podiatrist wouldn't recommend it, right?

40
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,997
Scott: Yeah, it is not comfortable.

41
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,961
Scott: It is Painful.

42
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:08,720
Scott: A flip-flop is pretty much only an emergency device to cross a short distance on a hot sand and then remove them.

43
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:17,140
Scott: Or to like go out to a garbage chute Sure, like walk out into a hallway to go into a shower that might have a fungus in it.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,480
Scott: Perhaps a shared locker room type environment shower because pool shoes are kind of garbagey.

45
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,810
Rym: I used to use pool shoes and those are not great.

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,099
Scott: I don't know if they make those anymore.

47
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:36,013
Rym: If there is a place in the world for Crocs to exist it might be that shower situation Yes, but no other situation.

48
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:36,920
Rym: No other situation.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:50,697
Rym: but anyway My issue is that I want if I wear sandals I want my foot to be basically completely exposed But it has to have the three straps two in the front and one around the heel.

50
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,820
Rym: It doesn't go around the heel.

51
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,573
Rym: It's worthless because you still have to walk weird to keep them on your foot.

52
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,980
Scott: See I don't have this problem.

53
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,888
Scott: I have the sandal with just two straps.

54
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:00,057
Scott: I don't like it, but it is right.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,552
Scott: Essential there are many sandals that do not have the third strap.

56
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,800
Scott: that will like fall off your foot, right?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Scott: Yeah, the point is no matter what the mechanism I know I don't care about a specific mechanism or whatever But it has to be a saddle that is securely remains on your foot on its own So that you do not have to adjust your walking or your foot position.

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,765
Scott: You can just walk the same way.

59
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,814
Scott: you walk in a tied shoe.

60
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:30,500
Scott: Yep, right and This is why I like the three straps and my two strap just stays on just fine.

61
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:34,180
Rym: I can walk normally in it But so the difference is I can walk in the two straps just fine.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,820
Rym: But if I run or something comes up if there's a chance it'll pop off.

63
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,732
Rym: I guess try to run it in your sandal.

64
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:41,737
Scott: There's a possibility.

65
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,047
Rym: with the straps You can just run.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,643
Rym: But anyway, I bought some Birkenstocks because they seem to be like the only brand that hipster brand three straps Sandals anymore.

67
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,228
Scott: You can buy them from funny a brand.

68
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:54,432
Rym: Yeah, so no on Zappos.

69
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,000
Rym: They're there were almost no three strap sandals.

70
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,786
Scott: Anyway, like not I'm sure them.

71
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,035
Rym: so five years ago in April.

72
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:05,775
Rym: So a little more than five years ago I bought some Birkenstock sandals with the three straps hipsters.

73
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:12,380
Rym: only today Five plus years later have they worn out enough to where they are no longer wearable.

74
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,313
Scott: Aren't they supposed to last like a lifetime or whatever?

75
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,199
Scott: They have some kind of warranty.

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,269
Scott: Isn't that why the hipsters are all into them like?

77
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,728
Scott: I don't know they were just they were break them in over the course of Years like like why?

78
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,596
Rym: no, they broke in basically immediately.

79
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,320
Rym: They were fine.

80
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,636
Scott: It's that get last forever your whole life.

81
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,240
Scott: You wear this way.

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,345
Rym: I never encountered any that.

83
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:30,671
Rym: but I basically I buy.

84
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:38,117
Rym: they could be blues brother on me like every part of them failed at once and I look cuz I could have gotten before.

85
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,240
Scott: I like Because you wanted to buy a new sandal.

86
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,788
Rym: No, actually I don't like new sandals because I like the like.

87
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:48,132
Rym: collected grease of my foot over five years makes it like like it Perfectly is formed to my feet.

88
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,264
Rym: Yeah, no, but They blues brother.

89
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,460
Rym: They completely fell apart and I looked it would cost me from even like one of those crap.

90
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,869
Rym: Oh cobblers in like a subway station 40 or 50 bucks to resold them.

91
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,640
Scott: Aren't you supposed to take into the actual Birkenstock company?

92
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,043
Rym: I don't know.

93
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:05,027
Scott: you have like award.

94
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,272
Scott: There's like a thing they do there.

95
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,120
Scott: It is like that's their mystique or whatever.

96
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:08,723
Rym: I've never.

97
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,833
Rym: I didn't even think I I didn't encounter that.

98
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:12,160
Rym: I just I had these sandals.

99
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:15,939
Rym: I wore them out because I used the hell out of this and googling five plus years.

100
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,564
Rym: so cobblers like 40 50 bucks to Resole them.

101
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:27,539
Rym: but I can just buy brand new ones for only a little bit more than that and thus get around all the issues The fact that I've beaten the heck out of out of the years.

102
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:31,579
Rym: So I think I'm gonna buy new sandals every five years for the rest of my life.

103
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,638
Rym: Maybe when I'm old it'll be ten years because I won't walk around as much.

104
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:34,960
Rym: We'll see.

105
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:39,420
Rym: So anyway, it's Wednesday, it's comic day, it's not sandal day.

106
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,814
Rym: We already did an episode on shoes a long time ago.

107
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:42,880
Rym: So what's your news?

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,652
Scott: there was tons and tons of huge news from the San Diego comic.

109
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:52,733
Rym: like Matt Groening is doing a new show and Ready player one like people are flipping out about how bad that thing is.

110
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,560
Scott: I mean, it was so weird, right?

111
00:05:54,881 --> 00:06:00,020
Scott: I it felt like when ready player one was a new hot thing that we were the only ones going.

112
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,109
Scott: But now everyone's going in.

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,535
Rym: Well, I think what happened?

114
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,499
Scott: everyone learned from us.

115
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,286
Scott: Is it where they were the?

116
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,440
Rym: someone else described this in detail in a Twitter conversation?

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,760
Rym: But to summarize because I think they're dead on it most it became really popular because it was in that loot crate or whatever.

118
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,820
Scott: Is that really the reason it became popular?

119
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,771
Rym: This I haven't been able to verify.

120
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:30,324
Scott: really evidence of this I have Back, we're like living in Beacon even and like some, you know listeners told us to read this and I heard it was one Of those things, you know You know how I do that.

121
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:36,371
Scott: when I see something getting lots and lots of buzz and people can't shut up Then I go and check it out like Madoka Magica.

122
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,240
Rym: That's why we check that out exactly people.

123
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:49,079
Rym: I read the whole goddamn book way back that I Think I mean I quit in the middle of Dragon's Gold Serpent silver chimeras copper and yet you finish this.

124
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,789
Scott: I mean, it was very easy and quick to read.

125
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:00,068
Scott: it took me like a couple days, but Scott it diminishes the soul Not really At least now no one can tell me all you haven't read it.

126
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:00,309
Scott: I could.

127
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,340
Scott: now I can I can freely swing Scott stick of judgment.

128
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,171
Scott: And anyone who says did you even read this?

129
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:19,097
Rym: I'll say yeah read the whole fucking thing Piece of garbage, but basically what they said was that When it suddenly got really popular The only people who were talking about it were the kinds of people that it was aimed like.

130
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:24,631
Rym: the demographic It was perfectly suited for Were the people who were doing all the reviews and all the talking.

131
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:32,075
Scott: the impression that I had back when I read it in those Days when is getting buzz was that everyone in the world seemed to be in freaking love with this thing except me.

132
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,645
Rym: and then now Regular people tried to read.

133
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,192
Scott: look at Twitter now, and it's pretty much.

134
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,897
Scott: I have seen just only negative.

135
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,344
Scott: I've not seen a single Positive comment.

136
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:51,698
Scott: the only positive comment is I was I was talking to a nerd that I am Only slightly acquainted with in person, and I was like yeah, that sucks.

137
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:52,280
Scott: They were like why?

138
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,879
Scott: And then that same person also.

139
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:04,384
Scott: I think they subscribe to loot crate and also That's two strikes.

140
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,140
Scott: and also we went to the Lego store, and I ogled like that Apollo rocket and didn't buy it.

141
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,680
Scott: They actually bought like three Lego things one of which is ninja go You know actually it's really good.

142
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:20,160
Rym: I haven't been to the Lego store in a long time cuz I think I would just start buying Lego.

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,367
Scott: The only I was at the Lego store.

144
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:27,751
Scott: the only thing you want at the Lego store is the Saturn 5.

145
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,824
Scott: It's only $120.

146
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:31,770
Scott: the problem is it will not fit in your apartment.

147
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,100
Scott: you need to find someone else to keep it for you.

148
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:43,525
Scott: But it functions perfectly like the little Lander pops off turns around and docks the other way All the stages.

149
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,954
Rym: if I had a three-bedroom apartment there'd be a room.

150
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,508
Rym: that was the rabbits and Lego room And that's all they'd be in there.

151
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,798
Scott: a rabbit's Lego.

152
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:49,999
Scott: safe.

153
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,460
Rym: I think we're average actually have a hard time biting Legos cuz they're real, but they're real powerful.

154
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:56,972
Scott: I'm not worried about hurting the rabbit.

155
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:57,234
Scott: I'm worried.

156
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:57,758
Scott: We're hurting Lego.

157
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:00,987
Rym: The Lego would be up on tables.

158
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:09,253
Rym: I think my train table it falls down and then I feel I mean rabbits are experts at biting things.

159
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,460
Rym: I feel like they could bite them and come out unharmed.

160
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,126
Scott: We'll see.

161
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:14,840
Scott: you want to swallow them But basically yeah.

162
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,240
Rym: But when I gathered there was this wave of people like all the early waves of people who were reading that book.

163
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:32,754
Rym: We're like the kinds of people who would love that completely non introspective like regurgitative Pablum aimed at the most pandering of panders the people who go woo.

164
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,300
Scott: when the woo game happens at a convention.

165
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,634
Scott: I mean there's no who wait in line for swag in the packs dealers room.

166
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:38,538
Rym: There's that screenshot.

167
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,429
Scott: someone keeps waiting line for an anime con dealers room to open.

168
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,660
Rym: this screenshot has hit my feed easily 40 times.

169
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:56,421
Rym: Covers to comic books and it's just like one page for ready player one and it's just literally lists of proper nouns from Wikipedia from the 80s Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,934
Rym: Also as people pointed out like none of that stuff was things that like women made.

171
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,300
Rym: it was no like black music.

172
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,460
Rym: It was just like white boy music like there.

173
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,882
Rym: There's a lot.

174
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:16,668
Rym: there's so many problems with ready player one and I think just recently because the movies being made People who aren't that Demographic looked at it and said what's going on in here?

175
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:17,570
Rym: What's this?

176
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,780
Scott: Yeah, the funniest thing is the people distributing that.

177
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:28,912
Scott: that I guess tirade of About porn that the author wrote.

178
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:30,197
Rym: Oh, I didn't.

179
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:36,100
Scott: I saw that You know, basically reminding you what kind of person the author of ready player one is.

180
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,299
Scott: Which is disgusting.

181
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:44,275
Scott: Anyway, so Yeah, anyway, here's some real news from San Diego comic-con.

182
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:47,265
Scott: So back in the day There was vertigo comics.

183
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:52,920
Scott: right vertigo comics is a was a an imprint which means it's really DC Comics.

184
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,860
Scott: It's the same exact, you know company.

185
00:10:55,382 --> 00:11:00,400
Scott: But they put a different label on it because this ain't Superman and ain't Batman, right?

186
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,299
Rym: It's other stuff can't scare the Superman people away, right?

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,089
Scott: So they just put a different label on it and it's managed by.

188
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:14,600
Scott: it has different its own editor its own staff and stuff and They work separately right with their own label, but money wise their own the same part of the same company.

189
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:19,745
Scott: so vertigo still exists, but The thing is back in the day.

190
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:26,233
Scott: the editor of vertigo the person in charge was this woman and Karen burger burger burger I don't know if the G is hard or soft.

191
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:35,334
Scott: It doesn't matter And she was responsible for publishing Many of the greatest American comics ever.

192
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:35,675
Scott: right?

193
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:45,539
Scott: we're talking V for Vendetta We're talking Sandman preacher fables fucking Why the last man?

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,123
Scott: Like fucking everything.

195
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,408
Rym: it's good stuff in here right?

196
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:51,460
Scott: vertigo comics was like the greatest, right?

197
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,025
Scott: It's like you.

198
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:57,879
Scott: if vertigo came out with a new book Like I would just get issue number one just to see what it was because if they're publishing it's probably something good, right?

199
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,320
Scott: So what happened is I don't there's some drama or whatever.

200
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:09,356
Scott: she was kicked out and or left and she she disappeared and Since then vertigo has just been like publishing nothing like.

201
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,000
Scott: they still exist.

202
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,879
Scott: they still put books out, but a lot of them are just reprints and garbage that no one really cares about.

203
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,631
Scott: and Like they're still in the catalog, but they're effectively.

204
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,196
Scott: they may as well be dead right.

205
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,560
Scott: it may as well not exist anymore.

206
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,405
Scott: That's sad times right.

207
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:31,971
Scott: but image comics since then has been publishing all the good shit like the sagas and the Descenders of the world right.

208
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:39,100
Scott: things that may have been Vertigo in if they had been published 10 and 15 years ago are now all at image, right?

209
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,549
Scott: But this gives us a problem because without vertigo There's not really a lot of competition for image.

210
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,205
Scott: right you got Marvel in DC or doing underwear perverts only right Japan.

211
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:52,675
Scott: those publishers are in a different country.

212
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:59,518
Scott: that IDW which used to do good stuff is now sort of like only doing licensed stuff right.

213
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:08,220
Scott: ponies Transformers yeah, I chose they just got Sonic the Hedgehog from Archie which and actually that stuff is generally actually pretty good.

214
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:09,972
Rym: But it's not this kind of calm.

215
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:15,754
Scott: that stuff raised IDW from being sort of an indie tiny publisher to being like big-time publish.

216
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,920
Rym: Yeah, right actually I really want to read mask.

217
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
Rym: Sure, I just haven't yet.

218
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,192
Rym: I've been busy go for it.

219
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,418
Scott: They'll probably trade soon.

220
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:30,611
Scott: Yeah so all anything that's like a licensed nerd property that's not owned by Disney or Warner DC is over at IDW.

221
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:31,033
Scott: right.

222
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,639
Scott: all the Hasbro things all that stuff.

223
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,513
Scott: So the only other really big American comics publisher.

224
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:43,975
Scott: You know that's the super big right There's like some medium-sized ones like boom and stuff or your mouse guards and things like that.

225
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,480
Scott: like you know what whatever.

226
00:13:46,083 --> 00:14:05,177
Scott: But you know is Dark Horse and Dark Horse is mostly doing mangas Hellboys, I think they have like alien Buffy the Vampire Slayer Those sorts of things right and they just sort of quietly over there on the side You know doing their thing not getting a lot of attention, but now big dudes.

227
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:17,663
Scott: Karen Berger Who ran vertigo back in the day has signed up with Dark Horse and they're gonna make Dark Horse burger books first of all Totally deservedly.

228
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:21,095
Scott: She just gets her name on the fucking job right what that that means?

229
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,587
Rym: seal of approval slash Endorsement, right?

230
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,600
Scott: So this is actually not new news.

231
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:32,717
Scott: We knew this is coming like some months ago But now at Comic Con they actually announced the like the initial books that are coming out.

232
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:37,996
Scott: So they got Hungry Ghosts by Anthony Bourdain the cover alone.

233
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:42,880
Scott: All right, the chef Anthony Bourdain, which is I guess I know that that's the name of a famous chef.

234
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:44,239
Scott: I don't know anything else about it.

235
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,420
Scott: I just know that that is the name of a famous chef person and it's about food.

236
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,239
Scott: But yeah, you can tell by the cover.

237
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,811
Scott: The only name on the cover that I care about is Paul Pope.

238
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:59,553
Scott: like one of my favorite artists of all time He like he doesn't do a lot of stuff like anything he does.

239
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,080
Scott: He's like Midas touch of artwork.

240
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:05,899
Scott: And now that you can tell his artwork from like 10 miles away like no one draws like him anywhere.

241
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,630
Rym: Is that just him Maya from my eccentric family?

242
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,460
Rym: I don't know with his our ramen shop in hell.

243
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:23,777
Scott: The other thing that is interesting is The seeds right by and the senti and David Aja, so I know who David Aja is.

244
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,365
Scott: That's a familiar name I've heard before right?

245
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,291
Scott: So that's gonna be really interesting.

246
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,340
Scott: You've got this thing called the originals, right?

247
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:39,699
Scott: So the originals is has the artists from Watchmen not Alan Moore Who's probably who know what the hell he's doing?

248
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:42,948
Scott: Rolling around it's a mud somewhere.

249
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:50,696
Scott: I don't know One of those retired and retired do who knows what he confirmed.

250
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,819
Rym: he's retiring from comic books last year.

251
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,417
Scott: sure, whatever No one cares your old man.

252
00:15:56,001 --> 00:16:03,755
Scott: But Dave Givens the other Watchmen guy is starting a series called the originals and the cover looks like Fucking Watchmen art because it's the same fucking guy.

253
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:09,914
Scott: Yep You got this thing Madahari, I guess it's about the real Madahari.

254
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:10,840
Scott: I don't even know.

255
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:18,772
Scott: and this other thing called Incognito Renaissance, which looks like mafia do incognito.

256
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,124
Rym: It's a very specific period thing I couldn't tell from.

257
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,111
Scott: it's hard to read that word that I've seen.

258
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,531
Rym: this one in particular has been getting a lot of buzz in My feed lately.

259
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:28,139
Scott: I don't know.

260
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,084
Scott: I'm just looking at the knee like.

261
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:38,840
Scott: I don't know who Matt Johnson and Warren police are but that doesn't matter Because I know Karen burgers, I'm gonna buy all of these books issue number one to see which ones are legit.

262
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,839
Rym: So we basically just outlined a bunch of GeekNights episodes that are coming up.

263
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,107
Scott: Yeah, pretty much any.

264
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,019
Scott: well, we'll probably do one episode all number ones.

265
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,728
Scott: Oh, yeah, and then so forth right.

266
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:51,780
Scott: and then like when I'm sure these won't be the only books this imprint publishes.

267
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:57,438
Scott: Right these they're gonna figure out which ones succeed which ones fail which ones are limited which ones keep going forever, right?

268
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,356
Scott: And new ones will come up.

269
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,451
Scott: But this is like, you know comic book publisher to watch.

270
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:08,836
Scott: if it has this name on it from Dark Horse It's worth at least checking it out.

271
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,965
Rym: Yep Just the covers all these alone.

272
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:12,769
Rym: I'm interested.

273
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,888
Rym: if I saw these at some comic-con and I didn't know anything I'd probably pick them all up.

274
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:17,434
Scott: Mm-hmm.

275
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:23,219
Rym: So really quick news because this this like shockingly happened and I saw Twitter freaking out about it.

276
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:29,952
Rym: I guess United Airlines Just randomly started telling people trying to fly home from San Diego.

277
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:32,760
Scott: comic-con isn't United Airlines the one like every airline?

278
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:41,760
Scott: Yeah, every single airline has bad stories about it in the news all the time But United is the one with the most bad and most frequent bad story.

279
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,660
Rym: Well, so I would say that spirit is still a worse airline by every measure.

280
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,668
Scott: I mean probably but it doesn't.

281
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,135
Scott: it's not in the news for being.

282
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,400
Scott: it's just generally bad.

283
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,980
Rym: But I've been boycotting United for most of my life because but majority of the times I try to fly with them.

284
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,633
Scott: Yeah, we're like Spirit Airlines is just generally shitty.

285
00:17:58,674 --> 00:17:59,900
Scott: That's like taking a Greyhound bus.

286
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,104
Scott: It's just generally shitty.

287
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:06,360
Scott: but United has specific horrific incidents that are frequently newsworthy.

288
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:20,714
Rym: but in this case, they basically started telling people that the TSA said you can't check comic books and you check bags and That was egregious enough to even the TSA Which is an organization that I despise with literally every fiber of my being.

289
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:26,062
Rym: even they were like No, that is not true WTF.

290
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:39,454
Scott: this is probably just one relatively low-ranking employee doing a thing at that one Airport in San Diego from you know just like meh just Because who knows why they thought of doing this, but they just did for whatever reason.

291
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,307
Rym: all these nerds showed up at the airport And I have sort of that.

292
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:45,055
Rym: there's a buried lead in this story.

293
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:51,740
Rym: I'll get to in a second Mm-hmm, but I guess a buried barb is a better a better way to put this but all they had all these signs.

294
00:18:52,041 --> 00:19:01,400
Rym: comic-con attendees remove all books from check bags and A lot of people go to comic cons buy a lot of fucking books literally like bring extra luggage and fill.

295
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,348
Scott: That is nothing but books.

296
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,633
Scott: Yeah hundred percent book.

297
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:09,135
Rym: My barb is simply Why are you buying so many comics at a comic-con?

298
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,040
Rym: They're not cheaper there.

299
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,140
Rym: This isn't like Silver Age Silver Surfer at Wizard World from a discount bin.

300
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:20,240
Scott: Well, the thing is actually if you actually unless you're getting weird exclusive signed, I guess but how many?

301
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:26,640
Scott: So if you're the kind of nerd who like is like you're only care about comic books.

302
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,981
Scott: You don't.

303
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,712
Scott: and you like the floppy shitty kind right or even the trade paperback kind.

304
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:48,990
Scott: if you go to comic conventions and you're buying stuff that isn't brand new and Is Super old or rare, but it's just sort of like, you know Like a trade paperback that came out two years ago, and then they made too many copies and didn't sell them all.

305
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:57,090
Scott: It's like if you try to buy those online They're not gonna be like two dollars, but at the convention, there's some comic store that's dealing there.

306
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,397
Scott: That's just oh my god, please.

307
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,891
Scott: I want to get rid of this inventory and they're selling it for $2.

308
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:13,390
Scott: Yep, so if you buy a large quantity of that stuff You can reach an economic point to where the price of your comic-con badge the travel the hauling and if you're actually gonna read It all of course.

309
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,774
Scott: So but I'm in the play.

310
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:16,419
Rym: I can spin that back around.

311
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:24,033
Rym: if you had to fly to get to San Diego comic-con That threshold is significantly higher Mm-hmm.

312
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:29,254
Scott: You have to save at least the $50 that you Extra checked bag.

313
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:34,688
Rym: also books ain't light and there's limits on how heavy bags can be.

314
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,052
Scott: indeed I was.

315
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,443
Scott: it's probably cheaper for the $50 of the checking bag.

316
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:40,948
Scott: You could probably spend $40 at the FedEx.

317
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:50,204
Rym: so my only guess is what actually happened here is that Someone maybe was trying to troll comic nerds and worked at United.

318
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:57,707
Rym: That's possible purposefully Misinterpreted a TSA guideline to do this to cause havoc for the lulls.

319
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:58,410
Rym: That's my guess.

320
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,178
Scott: Oh, there's definitely possible.

321
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:08,670
Scott: There are lots and lots of incidents where Individual employees have the power to do something but they're you know, the thing happens.

322
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:15,589
Scott: It's you know No one knows no one outside knows why or how or who and it's just like it causes a bigger deal.

323
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,282
Scott: then You know any that the person who did it thought would it would cause.

324
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:21,290
Scott: now right and then he's just like oh shit.

325
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,507
Scott: And then once it becomes a deal the coal company finds out about it and now you're fine.

326
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:34,166
Rym: Yeah but anyway things of the day what he got?

327
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:39,887
Scott: so Hockey comes in many varieties and we enjoy almost all of those varieties.

328
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:45,465
Scott: the field kind The deck kind that guy he's okay.

329
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:50,261
Rym: the ice kind Yeah, roller hockey is the only hockey I played any serious amount in my.

330
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:54,956
Scott: so it's rather difficult for a normal person To play a lot of these kinds.

331
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,170
Scott: right ice kind is the hardest even though it's the most common.

332
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,643
Scott: Not only do you need to know how to skate but you need a venue.

333
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:02,030
Scott: you know how to skate backwards.

334
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:04,521
Scott: You need to have ice I need to have equipment.

335
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:06,470
Scott: It's like it's a rich person's game.

336
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,794
Rym: No I would argue polo.

337
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,650
Scott: skill wise I guess polo is more expensive because you need a fucking horse and a horse cost more than hockey.

338
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,776
Scott: equipment skill wise has to be maintained.

339
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:21,177
Rym: ice hockey is way easier than roller hockey because roller blades like that not really designed for that playing that sport.

340
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:24,090
Rym: the way hockey gets played doesn't work the same way, but anyway.

341
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,318
Scott: But roller hockey is least eat a more accessible.

342
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:27,643
Scott: if you want to just try.

343
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:29,350
Scott: you see roller blades are cheaper.

344
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:31,302
Scott: You don't need ice you know right.

345
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:32,429
Scott: you know the equipment is less.

346
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:46,609
Scott: It's a street right, but the point is almost all varieties of hockey except sticks no regular shoes on feet and nets with a ball is Really inaccessible right so?

347
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,430
Scott: There was a type of hockey that I just discovered today.

348
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:59,696
Scott: I want to play this real bad I'd never seen before and this type of hockey is a little bit less accessible than The other kinds.

349
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:00,297
Scott: right.

350
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,925
Scott: then say just ball feet and whatever.

351
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:15,376
Scott: I'd have to buy a few things But it is not out of the reach and does not most importantly does not require any skills of skating or rolling or anything like that And this is soap hockey.

352
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,801
Rym: it requires balance.

353
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:21,342
Scott: basically make a giant Rectangular slip and slide.

354
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:24,455
Scott: you know a slip and slide is rectangular But it needs to be wider than that.

355
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,562
Scott: right a big wide slip and slide.

356
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:35,630
Scott: and rather than having water rushing down it You make it flat and cover it in soap liquidy soapy water, so it's fucking slippery as hell.

357
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,020
Rym: And then just try to play hockey with that.

358
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Scott: you put two tiny nets balls and plastic sticks And you get out there, and you play hot and you fall on your ass as Grover Just pointed out ankle injury the game.

359
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,630
Scott: Yes, it is ankle injury the game, but that's fine.

360
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,429
Scott: Oh, I'm fine with ankle injury the game.

361
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:54,453
Scott: I am.

362
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,162
Scott: I am just not as let's safer than skiing.

363
00:23:57,423 --> 00:23:58,687
Scott: it's even safer than I can in this.

364
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,555
Rym: I would argue This is way less safe than skiing.

365
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:13,163
Scott: listen the chances of being injured doing this way higher than skiing probably higher than skiing Safely I agree, but if you have an injury skiing You're probably going to break a leg or crack your head open.

366
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:18,427
Scott: if you have an injury With the almost guaranteed injury of doing this is like spraying your ankle.

367
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:18,950
Scott: big deal.

368
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,602
Rym: I feel like cracked heads are a real possibility.

369
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:22,184
Rym: lost teeth.

370
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:23,854
Rym: I Fight.

371
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,668
Scott: I think those are really unlikely.

372
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,418
Rym: Running on slick surfaces swinging sticks around I think you sort of shuffle.

373
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:34,240
Scott: if you try to run.

374
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,485
Scott: It's not gonna go well for you.

375
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,889
Rym: I still want to play it.

376
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,554
Scott: Absolutely would play this.

377
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:45,368
Scott: if anyone wants to donate a big flat lawn doesn't mind it getting ruined by soap and being covered and trampled upon.

378
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,775
Scott: And I'll go.

379
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:51,368
Scott: I'll get the nets and sticks and balls and Amazon if you take care of the rest.

380
00:24:51,388 --> 00:25:22,670
Rym: so I've been following a lot of different YouTube channels talking about like archaic technology mostly from the 60s 70s 80s and Tech mode is pretty good, but this video is really interesting because there's an area of technology I've been very interested in myself lately and that is Think about a task that you do today with computers basically and then realize that The task itself was done by professionals before computers were widespread and then try to figure out how the hell they did it.

381
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:28,710
Rym: Like how did a sound board work before you could just have like wave files on a computer?

382
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,268
Rym: like how did a DJ just make a particular sound play suddenly by hitting a button?

383
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:42,239
Rym: and The answer is for many cases from the 60s through the 90s have lots of tapes Yeah, but even though some tapes aren't that accurate.

384
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,117
Rym: They don't have like cue points at least cassette tapes Don't like standard cassette tapes.

385
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,530
Scott: No, they had fancy tapes like DAT tapes and shit.

386
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:50,758
Rym: No, so DAT tapes didn't solve this.

387
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,730
Rym: they use something called a broadcast cart machine.

388
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,443
Rym: Okay, and the tapes are spooled the same way.

389
00:25:56,504 --> 00:26:02,930
Rym: that eight tracks are All right, and the base of the main reason these were important was that they'd play forever.

390
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,312
Rym: You never.

391
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,990
Rym: you could not rewind them, but you could always play them forever in a loop.

392
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,680
Scott: Oh, it would go back to the beginning.

393
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,210
Rym: Yeah, you know how that works.

394
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,730
Rym: You ever see like an endless tape and what how those work?

395
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:13,721
Rym: Yes, so cuz all eight track.

396
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,050
Rym: you realize eight tracks are all like this, too.

397
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,442
Rym: You could never rewind an eight track.

398
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:21,910
Rym: You can only play forward Yep, and eight tracks actually did have eight tracks and there was a predecessor the four track.

399
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,870
Rym: I had an eight track system that I played with a lot as a kid and I kept repairing because it broke.

400
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,123
Rym: So I actually know a lot about eight tracks.

401
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:36,735
Rym: But anyway Broadcast cart is the way like if you were at an event or you were a DJ and you needed sounds and jingles and things To be able to be queued up.

402
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:41,837
Rym: the difference between any other tape mechanism of the era Was that it could be.

403
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:49,305
Rym: it could start playing and stop playing nearly instantly Which is not like ever trying to pause a VCR at the at an exact spot.

404
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:50,409
Rym: It's actually real hard.

405
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:53,450
Scott: So did you like preset it with start and stop points or something?

406
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:01,074
Rym: You can manually start and stop it and it's like instant and it also has a mechanism for the machine queuing up The next sound.

407
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:03,061
Rym: that's on the tape couldn't you also?

408
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,410
Scott: I mean, this is probably not the best way to do it.

409
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,438
Scott: But it's possible right.

410
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,910
Scott: just it says this tape is a loop.

411
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:16,509
Scott: You get a really short tape that plays a tiny loop over and over and over again and it's always playing and you just turn It down on the mixer and then when you want to hear it, you just mix it up and mix it down.

412
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,429
Rym: I mean, yeah, I've you can die.

413
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,410
Rym: Oftentimes at an event you'll do a loop track like that.

414
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,896
Rym: And this the one that.

415
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:29,602
Rym: so in this video they have a giant track tape that he finds That's like super super long and he basically when it's really long.

416
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,938
Rym: He repairs it to figure out what the hell was on it Mm-hmm and the machine to play it.

417
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,010
Rym: Yeah, this channel is all about having the machines for this nonsense.

418
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,316
Rym: Okay, but yeah, that is the thing that some people would do.

419
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:49,789
Rym: but this is a really interesting video talking about the very like Challenging problem of doing that kind of thing before computers existed that we got to just take for granted now.

420
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:53,967
Scott: Hmm I guess you could also do it with vinyl if you knew the exact spot to put the needle.

421
00:27:53,987 --> 00:28:01,610
Rym: you put it Take it off real fast But you have to be really skilled Ah, but also vinyl doesn't really start playing immediately cuz you're gonna get that scratch noise when you put the needle down.

422
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,638
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you would that's right.

423
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,406
Rym: Yeah, no one use vinyl for that.

424
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,450
Scott: They have nowadays.

425
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:19,884
Scott: I've heard that there are some record players that will use a laser and not a needle to like optically read the Record, so I learned about basically means it's a CD at that point Except worse quality because vinyl is not actually that high fidelity.

426
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,430
Rym: Jesus do not even fight me.

427
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,840
Scott: I don't understand why people are so hyped on vinyl.

428
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,888
Scott: even still I keep seeing like in my Twitter feed.

429
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:27,790
Scott: occasionally Someone's like, oh man bought new vinyl.

430
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,734
Scott: I'm like what the fuck.

431
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:34,154
Scott: and if and if your argument is you're like a record company starts producing more vinyl It's like people it's garbage.

432
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:39,830
Rym: if you're into the cool old technology like the weird old tape stuff is way more interesting.

433
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,428
Scott: This is cool, but we're not gonna buy any of these ever.

434
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:54,361
Rym: Though also, uh, I would point out that the end run of analog cassettes like the height that technology got to before they're obsoleted by CDs is Nearly indistinguishable from CD quality.

435
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,687
Rym: if you got like Dolby s going on.

436
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:59,939
Rym: Mmm It's just the CDs sort of displaced that too quickly.

437
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,401
Rym: Mmm.

438
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,947
Rym: But anyway, I digress otherwise them at a moment.

439
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:06,615
Rym: the book club book is The fifth season season.

440
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,902
Scott: so not winter not spring not summer not fall.

441
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:10,748
Scott: What smart other season.

442
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:15,965
Scott: smart is a month Season another season the fifth season by nk jemisin.

443
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,610
Scott: It's like the hottest shit fantasy novel going on and I'm gonna read it as soon as I've finished reading about that.

444
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,079
Scott: They're unholy consult.

445
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,750
Rym: Yep, and there's nothing but games.

446
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:30,770
Scott: They are perpetuating in the arc of Gogara in the shadow of Golgothar off.

447
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,629
Rym: The arc of man is having knives used on it.

448
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,174
Scott: That is how it be.

449
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:44,097
Scott: that is happy quite literally princes of not much and less Horses being broken left and right man.

450
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:48,970
Scott: He who breaks horses is actually broken less horses than everyone else in this book so far.

451
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,376
Rym: Yeah, I'm disappointed.

452
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:58,069
Scott: not one horse broken by the official horse breaker But many horses broken by others who wouldn't even know how to break a horse.

453
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:04,070
Scott: They're mere mere amateurs compared to the true master of horse breaking.

454
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:11,076
Rym: Otherwise the next convention we're gonna be at is Pax West Mothership packs the real the ticket.

455
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:14,266
Scott: I just remembered I in my bag over there in the other room.

456
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:18,560
Scott: I have Tickets to the real pack.

457
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,450
Scott: Oh they came the badges not the stinking ones.

458
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,663
Scott: You don't need the ones you need very badly badges.

459
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:27,228
Rym: Yes, you definitely need badges.

460
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:27,850
Scott: That's right.

461
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:29,376
Scott: They are in the mail.

462
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,239
Scott: They have arrived.

463
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,210
Scott: don't lose them because you're not using them for a few more weeks.

464
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:39,470
Rym: But we will be there on Sunday, which is the third of the four days.

465
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:48,517
Rym: We're gonna be there on all of the day But we will be there on Sunday doing a panel on rage quitting and butthurt rage and all those sorts of topics And I think it'll be fun.

466
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,070
Rym: It's gonna be awesome and also something very important.

467
00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:02,276
Rym: Yeah, also one of our friends and listeners of the longest time the row row is Literally was a listener who when we said hey, we're gonna be at a PAX Isn't that cool?

468
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:15,790
Rym: back in 2008 where we were still you spring chickens She picked us up at the airport didn't serial kill us and drove us to our hotel and now after so many packs is She has been accepted as the Omega knot.

469
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:24,946
Scott: So that means we're gonna be going to every not just the final omega-thon round as usual But every round unless row loses we're making sure we'll just be going to the last round.

470
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,030
Rym: like I'm gonna make a shirt.

471
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:27,370
Scott: We're gonna make a lot of shit.

472
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,550
Scott: So you should if you want to see us come to the omega-thon round and also help us cheer for a row.

473
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,192
Scott: So she win.

474
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,558
Rym: so let's get right.

475
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:37,750
Scott: as I mean that would make this packs like even more epic than usual.

476
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,739
Scott: It's already like up a level, but she win.

477
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,282
Scott: that's like up.

478
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:44,705
Rym: Well think of it this way if she wins One that means that I'll she'll go to PAX Australia.

479
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,550
Scott: We're all gonna go to back.

480
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,161
Rym: So yeah, but to the the after packs feast.

481
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,621
Rym: while it will not be in the most wonderful bathroom that we've ever seen it'll be somewhere.

482
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:58,184
Scott: and Imagine we'll go to the fancy restaurant instead of the regular restaurant.

483
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,890
Scott: We'll go to the fanciest place we can find.

484
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,413
Scott: Yeah, it'll.

485
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:06,943
Rym: it'll be a feast of celebration like a place that caused mad money Mad money the meat.

486
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:07,728
Scott: That's right.

487
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:09,684
Rym: So yeah.

488
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:23,586
Rym: So if you didn't hear Netflix made a four episode TV series animated of Castlevania 3 is it Castlevania 3 really curse of Dracula?

489
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:24,690
Rym: you didn't did it.

490
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,310
Scott: I thought it was just Castlevania generic.

491
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:35,309
Rym: So you didn't notice a la card and Sifa The only person we didn't see that we need to see to make it fully Castlevania 3 is grant and I assume he's gonna be there.

492
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:36,416
Scott: I thought the next season.

493
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,341
Scott: I thought they can't.

494
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,633
Scott: a la card isn't until like PlayStation He should.

495
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:41,543
Scott: did you ever play Castlevania 3?

496
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,467
Scott: I didn't beat it.

497
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:43,532
Rym: Did you ever?

498
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,625
Rym: did you ever get a character other than Trevor Belmont?

499
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:47,589
Scott: I don't think so.

500
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:57,349
Rym: You realize the whole shtick with that game was that you run into Sifa a la card and grant Depending on the routes you take through Dracula's castle.

501
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:07,290
Scott: and I think I had to go back and play Castlevania 3 because All I know about Castlevania 3 is a. it's a lot like Castlevania 1 style not Castlevania 2 style.

502
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:08,055
Rym: Oh, there's a big it.

503
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:10,109
Rym: actually it's a kind of a hybrid of the two.

504
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,389
Scott: There's a big hullabaloo about the audio in that game.

505
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,796
Scott: Japanese cartridge had a much better Soundship and better.

506
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:20,630
Scott: amazing incredible music considering was an NES game.

507
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,450
Scott: Yeah, and the American cartridge had crap music by comparison.

508
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:32,730
Rym: So Scott although pretty good by comparison to other crap NES games You can play as all these different characters and there's different ending.

509
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,360
Scott: I guess I'm gonna go emulate and beat Castlevania 3.

510
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,946
Rym: then I don't think you will.

511
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:37,830
Scott: you don't think I will.

512
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:43,090
Rym: Castlevania 3 how hard could it be might be the hardest Castlevania that was ever.

513
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,816
Rym: It cannot be.

514
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:46,874
Rym: Castlevania 1 is also.

515
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:52,330
Scott: I'm gonna play the Japanese version because I want that better Japanese version is easier by most accounts.

516
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,334
Scott: I just want the better audio.

517
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:55,423
Rym: What uh, uh, well your emulator do that.

518
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:55,985
Scott: Yeah, why not?

519
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:59,379
Rym: Well, you sure will Yeah, make sure your emulator supports that weird chip.

520
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,564
Scott: It will definitely support it.

521
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:01,788
Scott: What year is it?

522
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,926
Rym: Anyway, I can't believe you did.

523
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:17,290
Rym: So yeah This is literally one of the first times in human history That a television show or movie was made based directly on a video game and it was good.

524
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,746
Scott: Why did they choose?

525
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,714
Scott: Castlevania 3 specifically.

526
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:26,053
Scott: so I was not say Symphony of the Night or Aria of sorrow or any of the other Castlevania.

527
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,943
Rym: so I thought there'd be a short answer to that question.

528
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:33,138
Rym: It turns out there's a very Long answer to that question.

529
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:36,610
Scott: should we answer this long question or should people just go to the internet and read it for the?

530
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,541
Rym: If you want me to tell you I'm literally on the Wikipedia page.

531
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:41,121
Rym: Just read it.

532
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:50,330
Rym: But this summarize it the The production of this Castlevania series had a long and torturous path.

533
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,657
Rym: There's no upside down castle yet.

534
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:57,978
Rym: Yeah.

535
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,344
Rym: Yeah this came out in 2017, right?

536
00:34:59,364 --> 00:34:59,484
Rym: Mm-hmm.

537
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:07,182
Rym: so I'm just gonna read the first sentence of the summary of how this came to be and you'll see why it's hard to summarize.

538
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:20,695
Rym: quote in March of 2007. ten years ago Frederator Studios acquired the bravest warriors acquired the rights to produce an animated film adaptation specifically of Castlevania 3.

539
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,521
Scott: why does this have anything to do with this current?

540
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:24,709
Rym: because that is where this current thing came from?

541
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,837
Scott: It's not a completely brand new deal Like this up the old remains of this.

542
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,539
Rym: this Literally, you know hard it was for this to get made.

543
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,113
Rym: it got stuck in development hell like twice All right.

544
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:50,690
Scott: Anyway, so this new this Castlevania 3 animated adaptation looks a Lot like what people would say is anime even though we know there's no such thing as look like anime because anime comes in

545
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:59,273
Rym: Evoke that especially if you look at stills from it that very specific feeling of late 80s and early to mid 90s Violent away views.

546
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:03,305
Scott: It looks like vampire hunter D or demon city or ninja scroll.

547
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,110
Scott: It looks like those anime style.

548
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,116
Scott: That's the visual style.

549
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:18,384
Scott: It has right but it is written by Warren Ellis a Credible great writer author of many works such as trans metropolitan fell Next world, what else is he written?

550
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:18,928
Scott: That's really good.

551
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:20,909
Scott: Those are the big ones that I can think of.

552
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,885
Scott: Yeah But Warren Ellis is usually if you see his name on something that means good writings are here.

553
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:27,490
Rym: read this comic and it was general.

554
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:34,506
Rym: It was a pretty big International production involving a ton of different studios and production companies and people

555
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:43,268
Scott: but not Japanese people Which is why it is not anime, but it doesn't matter if it's anime or not It's an animated work and I don't really give a shit about if it's anime or not.

556
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:51,270
Rym: Yep Though I will say while the stills so so heavily evoked those 90s OAVs as does the story and the violence.

557
00:36:51,932 --> 00:37:06,706
Rym: But and I had this very specific and odd reaction as soon as I was watching it a few minutes in I Really was reminded of the way a on flux was Animated in terms of like the way the camera would move and the way the characters

558
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,810
Scott: not if you mean not a lot.

559
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:14,192
Rym: Yeah It doesn't move much and there's just the way the faces looked in the way the characters sort of look past each other instead of At each other.

560
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:19,890
Rym: so I got this really strong like rain or a on flux vibe just from that.

561
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:29,128
Scott: Yeah and the dialogue is all that like very stilted like only saying what needs to be said sort of feels like there's a like a Millisecond too much pause in between people talking to each other.

562
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:33,340
Scott: and yeah But the thing is.

563
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,889
Scott: that's the way those 90s things like Ninja Scroll felt when they were dubbed.

564
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,917
Rym: This feels too easy.

565
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,624
Scott: This is original English language.

566
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,090
Scott: This isn't some Japanese thing.

567
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,713
Scott: That was right.

568
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:46,830
Rym: This is but if it feels like watching the dove of vampire hunter D, right?

569
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,036
Scott: It's a little bit.

570
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,888
Scott: the voice acting is a little bit better than that.

571
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:53,095
Scott: There's like if one of the voice actors like a famous person, right?

572
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:53,656
Scott: What's his name?

573
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,059
Rym: Oh Richard Armitage.

574
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:55,820
Scott: Yeah that guy.

575
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:57,934
Rym: Yeah, the voice acting is good.

576
00:37:58,155 --> 00:37:59,700
Rym: However, the script is a little bit.

577
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:13,357
Rym: People say fucking piss a lot for just because yeah Like it was it feels like the kind of language that some dubs of those old anime OAVs Is.

578
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:15,410
Scott: the original dialogue isn't translated.

579
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:27,570
Rym: however, I was reading this interview with the producer of Castlevania and It's very telling what they drew from because basically the anime seems like the person medium for Castlevania.

580
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,781
Rym: You mentioned ghost in the shell and ninja scroll and other interviews.

581
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:33,550
Rym: what anime creatively informed this series?

582
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,048
Rym: And the answer is and I quote vampire hunter D was an early reference.

583
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:44,289
Rym: Yeah space pirate Harlock for the use of color Oh Berserk as an example of what to do.

584
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,227
Rym: There's a lot of berserk going and the CGI reboot as an example of what not to do.

585
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:55,329
Scott: Yeah Yeah, no, there's definitely a lot of berserk going on in this year in this year show for sure.

586
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,439
Rym: Uh, I really liked it.

587
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,706
Rym: I mean we're gonna talk about it in depth.

588
00:38:58,746 --> 00:38:59,570
Rym: It's only four episodes.

589
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,676
Scott: So it's four short episodes.

590
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:02,318
Scott: just watch it.

591
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:03,542
Scott: yeah, it's not.

592
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:13,187
Scott: I'm not gonna say it's like it's not great, right but it's like if you have Netflix and you're a nerd and you're like a vampire or you like anime or you like violence or you like.

593
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,219
Scott: it's like it's worth Your 80 minutes of your life.

594
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,645
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's not that long.

595
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:18,830
Rym: I enjoyed the hell out of it.

596
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:21,109
Scott: I didn't enjoy the hell out of it, but it was like, all right.

597
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:26,410
Scott: So the plot is basically if it was, you know, if it wasn't Castlevania, it might have been like man.

598
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,240
Scott: So spike speak, I think the fact that it is Castlevania puts it over the phone.

599
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:39,609
Rym: and tonight spike Spiegel reincarnated as Trevor Belmont Fine meets a wizard girl and they go into a dungeon to wake up Ellen Chazar from Escaflowne.

600
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,523
Rym: You go fight Dracula exactly.

601
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,330
Scott: That is the plot.

602
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,961
Scott: Well, the actual plot is that Dracula was Dean his usual self.

603
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,730
Scott: his castle reappeared once every whatever number of years.

604
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,567
Rym: Dracula's a chill dude.

605
00:39:51,052 --> 00:40:04,559
Scott: Relatively well, I mean he's not super chill He's an evil vampire dude But he's not like destroying the world or anything Right, and then some lady comes to visit him because she heard that he's got mad science Which he does because he's like fucking immortal and he knows shit.

606
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,958
Scott: that beginning scene is my favorite scene and in the dark ages People don't know shit, right?

607
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:10,910
Rym: Yeah, she shows up and she's like the peasants are all dumb.

608
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:18,216
Scott: Castle is like a fucking cave of wonders full of awesomeness and she's like she convinces Dracula like hey Let me have your science.

609
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,765
Scott: and he's like, alright, you're hot.

610
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:20,590
Scott: I'll go with it.

611
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,430
Scott: Yeah, cuz I'm still a dude even though I'm an immortal, dude.

612
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,889
Rym: Well also it was interesting because she shows up and she's clearly not afraid of him.

613
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,319
Scott: She doesn't know she's a woman of science.

614
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,450
Scott: He doesn't know that Dracula is all like vampire and shit.

615
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:38,457
Scott: She just thinks he's a rich old you know dude who lives in a castle full of science.

616
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:43,796
Rym: and that aspect of it is really interesting because there's like a big part of the plot.

617
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:50,210
Rym: is that Dracula vampires because they're long-lived have science they have light bulbs and things.

618
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:59,710
Rym: Yeah, and it's cool how like Trevor Belmont remembers all the you know The knowledge of his family and he talks a lot like did you see those strange implements and blah blah blah, right?

619
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,353
Scott: That's the.

620
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,150
Rym: that's the legend of what's inside Dracula's castle.

621
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:08,310
Scott: But the world is clearly in a dark age has much lower technology than the vampires.

622
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,769
Rym: I mean, it's what 1400s right people in Wallachia.

623
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,284
Scott: It's like the towards the end of the Middle Ages in the United States.

624
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:18,049
Scott: Yeah in the real world Europe.

625
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:27,247
Rym: Now here's the real question does Dracula's castle Travel through time such that that is that precursor technology is actually his future technology?

626
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:31,053
Rym: did vampires independently invent electricity?

627
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:41,370
Scott: and all this because they live a long time and they're bored or Live a long time and they're bored because if it was time-traveling he'd have like, you know Internet in his yes Or was there a precursor?

628
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,709
Rym: Civilization and the memory of that is all that remains.

629
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:46,094
Scott: Also think.

630
00:41:46,154 --> 00:42:00,306
Scott: part of it is that in the past there were times when Dracula's castle appeared because it's reappeared so many times that there have been times when it's appeared that you know Dracula has had like, you know, huge armies or slaves or who knows what.

631
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:01,330
Scott: we're building things.

632
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:06,108
Scott: Yeah It's like the castle was made at some point by a whole bunch of people that Dracula had forced to build.

633
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:12,090
Scott: he didn't build it By hand on his own but the very beginning of this he was a king right his account at least he had people.

634
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:20,494
Rym: But it seems like in that initial little bit because this like this whole backstory is like a minute of screen time Right just to set the stage.

635
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:28,901
Rym: because and I'm glad they did it because if you don't give some sort of reason Dracula's just this like bad bad guy.

636
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:32,335
Scott: I mean like Symphony the night where it's like What is a man?

637
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,117
Scott: a pile of secrets?

638
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:34,161
Scott: Hahaha Dracula?

639
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,225
Scott: All right now try to kill me.

640
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,510
Scott: the ends like go go go.

641
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:38,468
Scott: It's like why I don't you know anything about you.

642
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:52,659
Scott: It's like all right, I guess I have to kill Dracula cuz he bad he Dracula yep, but uh from the first like 10 minutes this show Dracula Kind of justified not fully justified by.

643
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,542
Scott: so the issue it right.

644
00:42:53,562 --> 00:43:01,090
Scott: So what they do is they basically give Dracula a Refrigerator reason for being evil, right?

645
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:04,879
Scott: They take his wife murder his his wife.

646
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:06,243
Scott: So now he mad right?

647
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,089
Scott: It's the old fridge scenario.

648
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:10,976
Scott: No It's like all right.

649
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:14,650
Scott: You have your reason you're you're you know, but also rope reason.

650
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,946
Rym: But the church drag that murdered his wife way more evil than Dracula, right?

651
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:26,696
Scott: The difference is though is that Dracula's vengeance cuz he's so powerful is Way over the top.

652
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:28,804
Scott: It's like yeah, not only is he taking it out on the church.

653
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,149
Scott: He's killing all humans.

654
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:31,774
Scott: Kill all humans.

655
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,304
Rym: It implies that he's only gonna kill all the humans in Wallachia.

656
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:35,870
Scott: That's pretty much all humans.

657
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:38,242
Scott: No, it doesn't feel like there's anything outside of.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,146
Scott: will I get in this?

659
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:41,950
Scott: in this Joe I mean there has to be the whole world.

660
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:42,753
Rym: I mean, I don't.

661
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:46,287
Rym: I don't know how closely the castle in your world is set in the world.

662
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:55,844
Rym: Yeah But basically he even gives them a sporting chance though He comes back and he's like I'm gonna fucking kill you all in one year.

663
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:58,050
Rym: So leave or make your peace.

664
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,858
Rym: I'll be back and the bishops like.

665
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,576
Rym: he's not coming back and it's not really a spoiler But there's this great coming back.

666
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:09,290
Rym: exactly when he said he would where the bishop is literally giving mass and he's like.

667
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:19,090
Rym: Dracula said Almost one year ago to this very moment that he would come back and kill us in one year and we're still alive.

668
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:23,846
Rym: He didn't come back and then the sky starts raining blood and a whole bunch of vampire hunter.

669
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:25,090
Rym: D happens all at once.

670
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,337
Scott: Dracula's like here.

671
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:26,679
Scott: I am.

672
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,469
Scott: I promised I'm here.

673
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,178
Scott: Listen I was you know, yep.

674
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:32,262
Scott: I'm Dracula.

675
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:32,724
Scott: I got time.

676
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,029
Scott: a year for me is like a second.

677
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:35,575
Scott: That's like.

678
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:36,542
Scott: I'll be back in a minute guys.

679
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:41,007
Rym: I'm gonna pee and come back but it basically takes all the like.

680
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:55,861
Rym: the formal story that like could be gleaned from Castlevania 3 takes those bits and pieces and gives them just enough interesting context to drive the story forward without Like ruminating too deeply on the details of the lore.

681
00:44:55,901 --> 00:45:02,589
Rym: like it you get impressions like the Belmont family Are all like mysterious and have powers and the shit.

682
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:08,290
Rym: You're the only one left and because the the church turned on them to the church basically fucked everything up in this.

683
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:14,710
Scott: Well, that seems to what always has another trope right is like there's a there's a some good people's but they're like.

684
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,569
Scott: You know their job is to fight the evil.

685
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:24,916
Scott: But now the evil has been gone for so long that now those they seem like crazy be like the mandate and the prince of Nothing exactly.

686
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:26,122
Scott: It's the same exact thing.

687
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,213
Scott: So basically the mandate Belmonts here.

688
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:42,907
Rym: Actually, it's very close to that because the Belmonts like the speakers and the vampire It's a. so the speakers the Belmonts and the vampires all know how the world works and are smart and then the regular people Don't know shit.

689
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,787
Rym: The church is actively evil and regular people are the dumbest beings who have ever existed.

690
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:52,140
Scott: other medieval peasants Yeah, but it's not fair to them.

691
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,868
Scott: They didn't have opportunity for education.

692
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:54,390
Rym: That is true.

693
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:56,729
Scott: But this show really single school in this show.

694
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:04,050
Rym: This show really goes out of its way to hammer into your head how dumb the normal people are in this world, right?

695
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,949
Scott: I mean, well, the first thing is this science lady who comes to Dracula's castle and she's like yo.

696
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,817
Scott: People in this world are really dumb.

697
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:10,902
Scott: They won't listen to my science.

698
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,790
Scott: If only I could science them I could save them.

699
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,579
Scott: Yeah, cuz they're also Dracula's like.

700
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,645
Rym: alright science away.

701
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,961
Scott: Yeah Everyone's so done.

702
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:32,590
Rym: There is a scene That because the show is only four episodes It's a high percentage of the total dialogue spoken and it is a long debate about the logistics and punishments for sheep-fucking.

703
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:42,750
Rym: yeah, and Like that scene you think it's gonna be a joke and it just keeps going and going and they they're really talking about this.

704
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,670
Scott: Is that the one in the tavern?

705
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:51,737
Rym: Yeah, yeah with with the really ugly guy the less ugly guy the stringy ugly guy and the bartender who looks like the bartender from Cowboy bebop the tavern scene.

706
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:53,826
Scott: I think only exists to introduce Trevor, right?

707
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:54,750
Scott: He's the quiet guy.

708
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,840
Rym: I think it also exists to introduce the culture of those peasants.

709
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,462
Scott: Yeah, he's the.

710
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,047
Scott: he's the quiet guy.

711
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:01,090
Scott: It's all these tropes, right?

712
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:06,230
Scott: He's the quiet guy sitting in the back of the tavern not saying anything, but he makes all these vehicle faces all the time.

713
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:10,607
Scott: All the disgruntled peasants make a ruckus in there.

714
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:15,623
Rym: Yeah But He really like he'll almost it.

715
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:22,167
Rym: it doesn't really hurt the show But sometimes he makes kind of a stereotypical anime face and that doesn't really fit.

716
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,657
Rym: the rest of the way The face is usually drawn.

717
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:25,099
Scott: Yeah.

718
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:29,333
Scott: But anyway, the highlight of the show for me is Actually the action scenes.

719
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:34,829
Scott: Oh, so sword fight the most sort for animation and most of the show is middling.

720
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,569
Scott: to average There's a few times where it sort of looks kind of man.

721
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,079
Scott: You know a little weirdness and the way things move.

722
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:57,342
Scott: during times when things don't move much they move a little bit They move weirdly right but when there's action scenes They put in like super effort into them to where they're not quite as good as like say the fight in episode one of cowboy Bebop or something like that where it's like majestically animated.

723
00:47:57,362 --> 00:48:02,065
Scott: they're close, but it's still like a wow Situation like the one where they takes the dude's eyeball out.

724
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:05,044
Rym: Oh that whip You said you said something.

725
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:05,910
Rym: cuz you watch it before me.

726
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:09,119
Scott: I specifically remember this one part where he was.

727
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:24,070
Scott: it was a shot of Trevor and he was whipping right now And it was showing basically him from his shoulders up his arms in his head And that was the whole taking up the whole frame and he was whipping like with both hands whip whip whip Right or it looked like he was whipping with both hands.

728
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:35,330
Scott: It might have been one hand whipping back and forth and I could tell that for like one second of animation His whipping movement looped like three times and I was like, how long are they gonna loop this whipping animation?

729
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:44,090
Scott: and then as soon as I thought that at the speed of thought it changed to a Different whipping loop and then changed to a third different whipping loop.

730
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:49,668
Scott: So they normally someone doing cheapo animation would have had one loop of whipping.

731
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:50,370
Scott: now, right?

732
00:48:50,670 --> 00:49:02,583
Scott: They animated three different ways of whipping right for like three seconds like whip whip whip whip whip whip and then a different whip whip whip and I was like Oh, they actually like it could tell like ooh, it's visually interesting.

733
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:03,726
Scott: What is happening?

734
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:03,987
Scott: Yes.

735
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:04,950
Scott: He's just whipping.

736
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,745
Scott: There's nothing happening in the story other than violence to like the there's.

737
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:11,670
Rym: so there's a bunch of vampire hunter D Like things getting kind of have violence.

738
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,055
Scott: But like this applies.

739
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:15,844
Scott: this same principle applies to all of the action scenes.

740
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:16,667
Scott: with like especially.

741
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,510
Scott: we just fight in Alucard.

742
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:25,729
Rym: Well when he fights that dirt priest right away and he's be whips to knock the dagger out of his hand Yeah, and then you see the guy dude's finger just like land next to the dagger and you're like, ooh.

743
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,430
Scott: And then he think he makes a funny comment about the thing.

744
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,935
Scott: Yeah, he does if I remember correctly then he whips the other guy's eye out and he's like, well, yeah I was when he whipped the eyeball.

745
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:35,541
Scott: I was like, oh pie may steal your eyeball.

746
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:35,822
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:39,215
Rym: Oh, I think the best fight though Was the Alan Shehzar fight?

748
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:42,630
Rym: Yes, because that because the way Alucard moved was great.

749
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,714
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean and his sword is Appropriately weird and right.

750
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:51,050
Scott: he moves in a way that is appropriate for him to move and he also floats around a lot.

751
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:51,633
Rym: Yeah,

752
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:54,751
Scott: you know, it's like ooh, they didn't just make him, you know do boring stuff and

753
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,318
Rym: I also like how it did they

754
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:57,463
Scott: do as he needs to be,

755
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:06,810
Rym: you know, how Dune has the that the moment of There's a conflict that would be boring in any other thing and then the characters just talk and then the situation is resolved.

756
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,595
Scott: He just talks to Alucard and is resolved.

757
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:08,936
Scott: Yep.

758
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:10,100
Rym: It's like Alucard's like.

759
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,043
Rym: I'm not Dracula.

760
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:12,166
Scott: I'm Alucard.

761
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:14,695
Scott: Yeah, okay I'm the son of Dracula.

762
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,282
Scott: Oh and I want to kill him.

763
00:50:16,402 --> 00:50:21,137
Scott: Are you know, I guess I'll believe you because You don't look like Dracula to me.

764
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:25,637
Scott: You're not killing me and biting me right now Which Dracula totally would.

765
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:26,621
Scott: he would just kill us right now.

766
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:28,228
Rym: So I don't he might not.

767
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:30,578
Rym: No, it depends we did.

768
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:32,288
Rym: I don't think we've personally pissed Dracula off.

769
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:36,689
Scott: I'm pretty sure if someone went to visit Dracula at that time when he was pissed.

770
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:40,504
Rym: You don't visit Dracula right after the church murdered his wife.

771
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:41,529
Rym: You can't let him be.

772
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:44,193
Scott: They're gonna visit him.

773
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:46,722
Scott: they're just gonna visit him with like whips and crosses and holy.

774
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:47,404
Scott: I like how all.

775
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:48,086
Scott: that's another thing.

776
00:50:48,488 --> 00:51:01,230
Scott: they usually When you have something based on a video game you sort of shoehorn the game mechanics into it In an awkward and kind of Blair way like a whip is was probably the lowest.

777
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:02,950
Scott: I'm having a whip as his weapon.

778
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:08,234
Scott: Okay, right, but it's not like he didn't whip a wall and have a meat come out But like which he's not.

779
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:11,830
Rym: ops that was guarding Sifa cuz that have that's in the game, right?

780
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:13,015
Scott: That's perfectly fine.

781
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,390
Scott: But the example was actually the holy waters in the game.

782
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:15,954
Scott: It's not like.

783
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:23,170
Scott: it's not like it would have been lame if he Hit a candle with his whip by accident and found a holy water behind it in a vial and then threw it.

784
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:24,928
Rym: Find some wall meat right.

785
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:29,387
Scott: that Super lame corny hackin eatin bad instead.

786
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:29,890
Scott: what they did?

787
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,333
Scott: He's like.

788
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:33,334
Scott: there was a point at which he was like you Priest man.

789
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:37,490
Scott: go get water from the well and bless it and bring it back and then he tossed it on something.

790
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:46,969
Scott: It's like I don't seen where he's worked in the holy water from the game to make it still, Castlevania But not in a way that's corny and video gamey in a way that just makes sense.

791
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:52,437
Scott: You're if you never played Castlevania, you wouldn't think anything of it wouldn't be awkward Hadn't played Castlevania?

792
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:55,570
Scott: and a dude hits a candle with his whip and holy water comes out.

793
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,997
Scott: You're just like.

794
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:56,670
Scott: what the fuck is this shit?

795
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:02,011
Rym: But it also draws from the fact that like in the in the story itself or a guy finds a meat in a wall of A house.

796
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:04,819
Rym: the Belmont family knows things.

797
00:52:04,879 --> 00:52:08,970
Rym: their primary power is their knowledge and their bloodline which hasn't really been gotten into yet.

798
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,614
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if it'll get into that.

799
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:11,056
Rym: We'll see.

800
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,479
Scott: Castlevania bloodlines.

801
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,224
Rym: See you get some Simon Belmont.

802
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,508
Scott: Oh, yeah the best one.

803
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:19,485
Rym: Yeah Yeah, Simon might be the most powerful Belmont.

804
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:23,239
Rym: until the new era I was reading I was really is Richter stronger.

805
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:24,683
Rym: I don't know.

806
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:25,244
Scott: I don't know any.

807
00:52:25,285 --> 00:52:27,110
Scott: I don't know enough about Castlevania lore.

808
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,629
Scott: I just played Castlevania games.

809
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:36,230
Scott: I haven't played all of them, but like I don't know the lore because I don't pay attention to that I just kill Dracula every time and explore his castle.

810
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:38,690
Scott: I know the horn it for as evil as drag.

811
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,616
Scott: I know the three.

812
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,619
Rym: I played as a kid when I was obsessed with this stuff, which is Played on the DS.

813
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,109
Scott: I don't know the lore of and I played him.

814
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:54,071
Scott: Well those I Was I know nothing about are like the GBA ones which I tried to play and couldn't and just because of technology reasons couldn't Get.

815
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:54,833
Rym: I am confident.

816
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:56,901
Rym: You will not beat Castlevania 3.

817
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:58,226
Rym: I never beat it in my whole life.

818
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:01,663
Rym: Really we Gonna be alright Zelda too hard.

819
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:05,930
Rym: I can do it whenever the weather's bad like in the next several like whenever we feel it.

820
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:12,850
Rym: Let's both live stream ourselves playing Castlevania 3 and idly and just see who like if either one of us beats it Because as a kid I never beat it.

821
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,453
Scott: I mean I'll use.

822
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,664
Scott: you know if I could use save states and cheat if I have to.

823
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:16,730
Rym: I won't use save states.

824
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:17,815
Rym: That's too much cheating.

825
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:19,725
Scott: The thing is when you die you go back to beginning, right?

826
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:21,835
Rym: Uh It's a hard game.

827
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,582
Rym: It's a real hard game.

828
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:24,727
Scott: It can't be that it's.

829
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:25,530
Scott: it's beatable.

830
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,305
Rym: It is I would say it's like five times harder than Castlevania 1.

831
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:30,610
Scott: I'll watch a speedrun and copy it.

832
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:37,202
Rym: Oh, yeah, I just watched a speedrun of it and Jesus The Japanese version I think I can be.

833
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:38,329
Scott: I can beat the Super Nintendo one.

834
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:41,989
Rym: I think the Super Nintendo one because he can dangle dangly.

835
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,736
Scott: My favorite move whip dangle.

836
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:46,381
Rym: I like the Super Nintendo one.

837
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:50,012
Rym: I feel like as many three is a way way harder Hmm.

838
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:53,204
Rym: I I usually tried to get grant cuz.

839
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:57,422
Rym: I did better as grant I think but Grant will see you probably in the second season.

840
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:06,186
Rym: Uh say if you enjoy Ultra violence like vampire hunter if you like 90s violent animes if you like vampires.

841
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:09,460
Scott: if you like Castlevania Then you have and you haven't.

842
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,289
Scott: I wouldn't pay for Netflix just for this.

843
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:15,225
Scott: I would pay for Netflix for this and little which academia TV that I haven't watched yet.

844
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:15,526
Scott: Yeah.

845
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:20,975
Scott: Yeah, definitely but um, I Wouldn't buy Netflix just for this.

846
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:26,146
Scott: but if you have a Netflix and this is probably worth your 80 minutes of your life You know, yeah

847
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,033
Rym: and I why you're

848
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:27,957
Scott: eating dinner or something

849
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:33,664
Rym: and it's go we literally watch it while we were eating dinner and I Will because they already got they already renewed they're gonna do.

850
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,629
Rym: it's three parts.

851
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:39,244
Scott: So three episode parts at the end of the fourth episode you're it's not.

852
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:42,155
Scott: the end is definitely like oh, okay There's a lot more to do.

853
00:54:42,256 --> 00:54:43,845
Scott: It's almost like the first four episodes.

854
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:44,570
Scott: is really the intro?

855
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,690
Scott: Oh, yeah, it doesn't even get into the meat of anything.

856
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,146
Scott: You don't even go to Dracula's castle, which is the most disappointing part because that's it's Castlevania.

857
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,190
Scott: It's not Dracula Vanya.

858
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,600
Scott: Yeah, it's like I want to see castle action.

859
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:56,710
Scott: I care about the castle more than care about any of the characters.

860
00:54:57,352 --> 00:55:01,526
Rym: I really I really want to see a la card bust out though because he had the best dialogue.

861
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:07,550
Scott: I think yeah I want to see them like go into like different rooms of the castle and fight all crazy different shit like a room with floating.

862
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,293
Scott: But that's it.

863
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:16,750
Scott: If it keeps up at this room with like some you know, all the different crazy bosses within the castle There are only eight more to see the mess with the Frankenstein monster.

864
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:21,130
Rym: So eight episodes at this pace should be definitely be worth watching.

865
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,451
Scott: I would.

866
00:55:21,471 --> 00:55:28,621
Scott: if I were them what I would do is I'd have them get to the castle in one episode and then the remaining Episode should be monster of the week within the castle.

867
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:30,348
Scott: and then the final episode Dracula.

868
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:31,772
Rym: now They hinted.

869
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:43,687
Rym: it appears that the first one they tried to just be like set up does the exact story of Castlevania 3 But they didn't commit to ending the way Castlevania 3 ends.

870
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:46,458
Scott: Well, I mean Castlevania 3 ends.

871
00:55:46,498 --> 00:55:47,101
Scott: Congratulations.

872
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:47,683
Scott: You were the winner.

873
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:48,687
Rym: you killed Dracula.

874
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:49,250
Scott: Good job.

875
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:50,618
Rym: So maybe they will manage.

876
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:52,489
Rym: maybe Dracula, but it'll actually end.

877
00:55:52,972 --> 00:56:04,710
Scott: I'm pretty sure it'll end in such a way that gives you a nice Closing and leaves it open to there where they can make another series Either based on another one of the games or directly continuing from this and making up some new stuff.

878
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,200
Rym: I would like to see them because I like this enough to where.

879
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:15,790
Rym: as long as the next eight episodes are as good as this It'd be cool if they just started doing short vignette series like that from different eras.

880
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,797
Scott: Do with Castlevania because you don't.

881
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:22,263
Scott: Dracula's castle only appears once every whenever.

882
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:23,827
Scott: yeah, so there isn't like.

883
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,614
Scott: you don't have to follow Continuity.

884
00:56:25,634 --> 00:56:28,430
Scott: you have to make the continuity be like the continuity.

885
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:30,297
Rym: You must have moto style continuity.

886
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:33,950
Scott: There's so little connection between the different ones because there's so much time between them.

887
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:34,790
Scott: It's like alright.

888
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:41,893
Scott: well, it's a new person named Belmont and the only people that are still alive are like a la carte and Dracula and Dracula's castle appeared.

889
00:56:41,914 --> 00:56:42,516
Scott: you have to kill him.

890
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:42,696
Scott: There's.

891
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:46,670
Scott: everything else is brand new every time and the castle changes every time.

892
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,720
Scott: Yeah, it's like alrighty, then I guess you don't need to.

893
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:53,153
Scott: and it's like, you know, the vampire people are so old They don't remember.

894
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:55,846
Scott: they don't have to bring up anything that happened in like a previous one.

895
00:56:55,907 --> 00:56:56,610
Scott: It doesn't even matter.

896
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:59,449
Rym: I feel like Simon's quest could actually turn into a really good one.

897
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:05,930
Scott: Well, I think the problem with a lot of the first one and Simon's quest is that there's not a lot of characters.

898
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:14,642
Scott: It's pretty much a Simon on a lonely man quest and really hard to turn the lonely person quest Into any sort of TV or movie.

899
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,010
Rym: this one Castlevania 3 specifically has the team up.

900
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,210
Rym: Yeah, because we know there's gonna be one more person on the team when they find grant.

901
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:26,310
Scott: That's why it's hard to make like a Metroid movie because it's like, you know, and you make a movie like alien.

902
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,383
Scott: You need to have all these people around Ripley to die.

903
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:30,949
Scott: She doesn't just start out alone.

904
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,522
Rym: Yep, Chris Castlevania 2 at least he goes town to town.

905
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:38,170
Rym: It could be like every town has its problem.

906
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:39,355
Scott: Yes, you can do that.

907
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:42,166
Scott: Yeah, but he's gonna be you pick up friends.

908
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:43,110
Scott: Can we leave up stuff?

909
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,628
Rym: Yeah, but you could set it up to where he picks up friends and none of them make it to the next town.

910
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:46,990
Rym: like hell.

911
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:53,930
Rym: When he comes out of the north everyone everywhere he goes he picks people up in town and he's the only survivor at the next town.

912
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:55,135
Rym: That's how I'd do it.

913
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:56,079
Scott: Not bad.

914
00:57:56,622 --> 00:58:01,869
Rym: But yeah, you know terrible nights curse having.

915
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,597
Rym: But no this thing like it's really simple.

916
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:05,640
Rym: It's really short.

917
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:06,904
Rym: It's well done.

918
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,690
Rym: I enjoyed the hell out of it.

919
00:58:09,556 --> 00:58:11,189
Rym: I think my mom would actually really like it.

920
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,469
Scott: My mom she I guess she didn't tell me turn it off.

921
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,870
Rym: Who suggested that I watch vampire hunter D when I was a kid, my mom loves vampires more than you know.

922
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:21,593
Scott: Yeah, we do.

923
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:24,327
Scott: I only casually like enjoy a vampire because you know, I'm a nerd.

924
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:24,950
Scott: I like a vampire.

925
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,538
Scott: My mom loves a vampire shit.

926
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:31,964
Rym: She like and rice book reading, you know I read interview with the vampire and that's the only one that I read.

927
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,090
Scott: I didn't even read that one.

928
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:34,418
Rym: It was pretty good as a book.

929
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:35,444
Rym: The movie was not great.

930
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:36,310
Rym: The book is pretty good.

931
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,947
Scott: I tried to read the actual problem.

932
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,107
Scott: I tried to read the actual Dracula once and I only got like a few chapters in.

933
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:45,690
Scott: yeah And then I read something else and then I forgot that I was reading Dracula.

934
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:49,421
Rym: But I mean this is what I like as a kid.

935
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:57,919
Rym: if you'd shown this to me when I was in fourth grade I want to love the shit instead of vampire hunter D. Yeah, I would have been so obsessed with this you would.

936
00:58:57,939 --> 00:59:01,272
Rym: I would have dressed up as Trevor Belmont in Halloween Like I would have gone.

937
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:02,697
Rym: this would have been.

938
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:07,353
Scott: the senator is definitely a younger Scott who fucking loved the shit out of like say Ninja scroll.

939
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:09,925
Scott: Yeah, who now is a sort of like man and just girl.

940
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:21,370
Rym: but vampire hunter D I still really enjoy even though come vampire hunter D unlike this Doesn't actually have a conflict because vampire hunter D is the story of oh, no, there's a problem.

941
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,774
Rym: How will D surmount it?

942
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,841
Rym: D wins because he's more powerful.

943
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:26,967
Rym: Oh, no, they trap D. What will he do?

944
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:30,141
