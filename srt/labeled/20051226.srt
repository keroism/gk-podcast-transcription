1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,617
Rym: It's Monday December 26th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:20,420
Rym: tonight We finish our ongoing series on how to build a new computer talking about video cards cases power supplies that sort of thing.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,077
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,548
Rym: So we're back from the holidays.

5
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:26,772
Scott: It's not like we went anywhere.

6
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:32,982
Rym: Yeah, it was a fairly uneventful Christmas Festivus Hanukkah Kwanzaa Etc.

7
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:33,585
Rym: etc.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,300
Scott: is it actually Kwanzaa yet or isn't Kwanzaa like some different day?

9
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,728
Rym: I don't know when Kwanzaa is.

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,887
Rym: all I know is they made us they told us about it And we celebrated it in Catholic school of all places.

11
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:45,920
Scott: really yeah the guy who invented the holiday came to RIT once.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,947
Scott: I didn't go see him, but the fact that there was a guy who invented the holiday That's still alive tells you a lot.

13
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,499
Scott: Yeah, not insulting Kwanzaa or anything.

14
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,395
Rym: Though uh we had some nice Hanukkah food just today.

15
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:02,290
Rym: We just got home Christmas Eve.

16
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,260
Rym: we had some excitement.

17
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:08,929
Rym: You know we're doing our typical lay around play video games and relax type holiday, and we're gonna go out to eat.

18
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:16,209
Rym: and Scott in his infinite wisdom while I'm putting on my shoes is Poking at our security system now.

19
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,764
Scott: It's not a security system that we use or have it's just.

20
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:28,203
Scott: this house has an alarm and Sensors and motion detectors and things and a control pad from the previous Occupants.

21
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:30,069
Rym: yeah two nuns who were paranoid.

22
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,036
Rym: we'll talk about them some right, but we didn't.

23
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,388
Scott: we don't pay for the contract So they don't provide us a service or anything.

24
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,215
Scott: It's there not doing anything.

25
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,540
Rym: I wouldn't even know the code for the thing.

26
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,516
Scott: Yeah, it just sits there.

27
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:46,775
Rym: so Scott is poking at it and He must have hit some combination of buttons because the fucker went off.

28
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:48,060
Scott: I can't believe it went off.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,306
Scott: It's we're not paying for it.

30
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,451
Scott: How the hell does it supposed to work?

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,737
Rym: It was so loud.

32
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:52,380
Rym: We screamed.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,507
Rym: It was painful like ah oh god.

34
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,972
Rym: Yeah, usually.

35
00:01:55,992 --> 00:02:04,080
Scott: I'm the one who will always avoid using the telephone But I opted for the job of calling the security company in the telephone rather than go near the alarm.

36
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:15,710
Rym: Yeah, so I go into the kitchen And I see the box where this painful noise is coming from and I cover one ear And I got like my shoulder on the other ear and I get on a chair And I pull the thing off the wall and unscrew it.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,619
Rym: I look inside and it's blasting sound at me.

38
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,299
Rym: There's all these wires and circuits.

39
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,700
Rym: So I just grabbed the circuit and ripped it until all the wires came out and it stopped making noise.

40
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:25,668
Scott: That was a great relief.

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,880
Rym: Yeah until we heard that there was another noise.

42
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:33,156
Scott: Yeah, there's a siren on the side of the house like an air raid siren.

43
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:34,140
Rym: this thing was loud.

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,100
Rym: It was louder than the one in the house, and I couldn't just go outside and cut the wires.

45
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,158
Rym: I didn't want to go outside and hear that sound let alone try to find a wire on the side of the house.

46
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:47,180
Rym: that wouldn't Kill me hmm, so I go and find the like metal control box to the alarm system.

47
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:56,599
Rym: I unscrew it and I pry it open and there's all these wires and circuits in there And I'm not thinking so I grab a screwdriver And I go to just start unscrewing all the contacts and I feel a little shock.

48
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,814
Rym: I pull back and then I realized there's 120 volts in there.

49
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:05,659
Rym: mmm dangerous Yeah, and we didn't have any implements and the noise is loud, and we're look running around.

50
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:05,980
Rym: What do we do?

51
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,502
Rym: What do we do?

52
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,836
Rym: and Scott has failed to call the security company?

53
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:10,840
Scott: Yeah, they weren't there.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,633
Scott: I mean it was Christmas freaking Eve and obviously they're not a real security company like ADT Whatever that has people on call 24/7.

55
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:24,940
Scott: This is just some schmoes local So there was no one there and leaving a message wouldn't have really helped because I needed someone that second.

56
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:33,540
Rym: So I took an oven mitt and then I took some scissors And I cut wires in this control box one by one until the noise stopped and the control box went dead.

57
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,282
Scott: And it worked.

58
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,429
Rym: and then the police knocked on the door.

59
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:37,714
Scott: I guess it's still.

60
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,580
Scott: the security system was somehow active.

61
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,935
Rym: Yeah, well what we learned is that we I mean there's a phone line in the house.

62
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,340
Rym: every house has a phone line.

63
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:46,446
Rym: We don't pay for it.

64
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:47,030
Rym: We don't care.

65
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,935
Rym: There's nothing plugged into it.

66
00:03:47,955 --> 00:04:02,398
Rym: We all have cell phones But no matter what even if you don't pay a dime to the phone company by law if you call an emergency number Like if you just plug a phone into a deadline and call 9-1-1 by law the phone call will get through yep.

67
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:08,900
Rym: So our security system to fight it being inactive or whatever called 9-1-1 and the police came to see what was up.

68
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:10,586
Scott: Well at least they came.

69
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,068
Scott: that's cool.

70
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,420
Rym: Yeah, finally they came real quick.

71
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,012
Scott: Yeah quicker than I ever expected.

72
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,119
Rym: so he comes in.

73
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,140
Rym: well He's at the door, and I explained what happened, and I offered to let him look around.

74
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,136
Rym: I'm like here's where I cut all the wires on the alarm system.

75
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:24,960
Rym: Here's the speaker.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,537
Rym: I pulled out of the wall, and he's like yeah, this happens, and then he left.

77
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,147
Rym: yeah He was pretty cool, so if we had been robbers We just got away with the crime of the century.

78
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,664
Rym: because this cop came into a house the alarm stopped going off while he was Standing on the porch.

79
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,970
Rym: He sees two guys.

80
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,120
Scott: They've cut the one of them wearing a coat.

81
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,784
Rym: Yeah, we were both like dressed in coats because we were like right and then as soon as he left He was writing his report in his car.

82
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,329
Scott: We drove away to go eat out.

83
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:48,851
Scott: Yeah.

84
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,299
Scott: Yeah, cuz you're running away with loot or anything.

85
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,891
Scott: It kind of pissed though because I mean we had.

86
00:04:55,313 --> 00:05:02,422
Scott: we don't have a telephone and 9-1-1 and a cell phone isn't so great because you have to kind of like talk to people and so you get the local Guys.

87
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:12,338
Scott: if I would have known that we had you know a 9-1-1 button in the house Like I would have liked to know that and I would have liked to keep it.

88
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,727
Scott: now It's just dead and we lost the 9-1-1, but yeah I'm afraid that we never knew we had.

89
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:21,175
Rym: I'm really afraid to reconnect all the wires cuz I'm afraid it might just start going Off as soon as I reconnect it.

90
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,031
Scott: yeah I'm afraid it might shock us.

91
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:29,778
Rym: like just to get you the the Scope of this I cut the power and it kept going off because it had a battery backup inside of it.

92
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,087
Scott: mmm At least it's really secure.

93
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:33,393
Scott: I mean it has a phone line.

94
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,040
Scott: That's pretty much always there.

95
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,880
Scott: It has a battery so if you cut the power you still can't break into the house.

96
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,991
Scott: You know that's a pretty good security system as far as I'm concerned.

97
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,535
Rym: Yeah, so these paranoid nuns.

98
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,617
Rym: They they got the best.

99
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,883
Rym: yep And we're not.

100
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,571
Rym: they're not like joking or calling nuns.

101
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:55,050
Rym: our house was actually occupied by two Like super Catholic something nuns before we got here.

102
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,855
Scott: Yeah, it's a renting house.

103
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:58,440
Scott: You know they don't own the house or anything.

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,569
Scott: They just they were renters, and then they left.

105
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,553
Scott: so now we're the renters.

106
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:05,577
Scott: Yeah, which is pretty good Because they didn't really mess up the house or anything.

107
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,968
Rym: yeah That was beautiful except for one mysterious stain that we kind of hide with furniture.

108
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:13,660
Scott: Hey, whatever Purchase the nuns with their candles.

109
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,738
Rym: But other than that that was our main Christmas story.

110
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:21,439
Scott: Yeah, and it sounds like Christmas to me.

111
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:29,590
Rym: Yeah Elizabeth shade better than my previous Christmas last year when I tried to fly back home to Detroit for the holidays And I failed to do so

112
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,191
Scott: Mmm

113
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:41,824
Rym: through no fault of my own you know I got a flight home, and I went to Stewart Airport and They first they call me the night I'm gonna go to the airport at night, and then they call me they're like your flight was canceled.

114
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,854
Rym: come in tomorrow We've got a flight for you.

115
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:44,517
Rym: Whatever.

116
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,682
Rym: I show up the next day.

117
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,570
Rym: They're like yeah your flights late You're gonna miss your connection.

118
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,676
Rym: Great tell you what.

119
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:57,409
Rym: we'll put you on a cab for free and send you to Newark Airport Which is like an hour and a half away, and that's like a hundred dollar cab ride.

120
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,296
Rym: Whatever they send me in a cab.

121
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,139
Rym: it gets stuck in traffic.

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,143
Rym: I missed that flight.

123
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,990
Rym: They put me on two more flights.

124
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,504
Rym: The one the one comes late, and I would have missed the standby.

125
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:12,490
Rym: the next one comes And then there's a blizzard and it's grounded and then they sent me in a cab all the way back to Stewart.

126
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,170
Rym: I had to pay $12 in parking and then I went home to my box my little studio apartment and went to sleep.

127
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,470
Scott: It can't be worse.

128
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:28,430
Scott: I don't know which Christmas it was but I was basically in Rochester in colony all low and everyone else had gone You know to their homes for the holidays, and I didn't go anywhere.

129
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:33,825
Scott: And I think I just went to like the Chinese restaurant alone sat at home playing games.

130
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:40,409
Scott: Wasn't so bad, but yeah, it's worse than at least you had some excitement even it was terrible.

131
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:49,450
Rym: Yeah, it was actually cool because when an airport screws you the airline well if an airline screws you the airport's real sympathetic.

132
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:50,810
Rym: So they put me in the lounge.

133
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,569
Rym: They gave me free drinks pretty much all day, so I spent my Christmas sitting in Newark Airport's executive lounge drinking gin and tonic.

134
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,473
Rym: Wasn't so bad.

135
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:04,090
Scott: No you know I never got in those lounges, but this is jet blue really doesn't have a lounge.

136
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:09,052
Rym: Yeah, well I would never go into a lounge if I had to pay for it because I looked and those drinks are like eight Bucks each.

137
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,866
Scott: yeah, well, it's usually the lounge isn't like something you go in.

138
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,957
Scott: it's like Special travelers can go in there.

139
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,110
Scott: usually yeah like depends on which airline and what the lounge is and whatnot yeah?

140
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,066
Rym: They're mostly for business travelers and like pilots and all that crap.

141
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:25,802
Scott: yep But yeah, I've never actually had a problem flying ever.

142
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:26,765
Scott: I've never had a delay.

143
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:27,950
Scott: I've never had a cancellation.

144
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,017
Scott: I've never had anything.

145
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,869
Scott: I've arrived early in some occasions.

146
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:35,822
Scott: I'm just real good at flying and I always fly only when it's good to fly.

147
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:40,739
Rym: well that you also fly between like major Easy airports for nice airlines like jet blue go.

148
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,710
Rym: yeah, I'm flying from anywhere in the East Coast to Michigan.

149
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:49,368
Rym: No one freaking flies there, there's all the direct ride, it's like 500 bucks to fly from our airport to Detroit.

150
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:53,090
Rym: yeah Luckily my family is bit by bit moving out of Detroit.

151
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:58,670
Rym: It's actually cheaper and faster to fly to Arizona to visit my mom than it is to fly to Detroit to visit my dad.

152
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,956
Scott: Well to Arizona you go.

153
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:01,799
Rym: Yeah in January.

154
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:03,485
Scott: I'm gonna go there then bring in Michigan.

155
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:03,887
Rym: Hey.

156
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:04,610
Rym: I like Michigan.

157
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:06,789
Scott: Arizona warm Michigan cold.

158
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,217
Rym: Michigan's real hot in the summer.

159
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,022
Rym: just real cold in the way.

160
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,389
Scott: everywhere is real hot in the summer.

161
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:14,000
Rym: ah No, there's some places where it's not hot in the summer.

162
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:18,296
Scott: all right, Antarctica, you know Quebec isn't so hot In the southern Quebec.

163
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:20,425
Rym: It's not that it's not as hot as it could be.

164
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:26,841
Rym: you know uh Newfoundland the Territories up north in Canada those aren't places people live.

165
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:33,075
Scott: people live out there Eskimo Canadians not real people.

166
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,684
Rym: yeah, so we don't really have any news.

167
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,374
Rym: we figured you guys read news Yeah, and care.

168
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,490
Scott: It's the holidays, so there isn't too much big news going on.

169
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:50,803
Scott: You know the big news will start again probably in the new year when you know People have done releasing all the holiday stuff and whatnot.

170
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:55,045
Scott: then the new year will come around and then People will get back to work, and then news will happen again.

171
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:55,990
Rym: I mean news happen.

172
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,954
Rym: It's just there wasn't anything.

173
00:09:56,994 --> 00:10:02,417
Rym: we really the only thing we really had planned to talk about anyway that we saw was the fact that Jack Thompson's in the news yet again.

174
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:07,798
Rym: Yeah, well really yeah the whole Take two stock incident.

175
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,903
Scott: Oh that was like a week ago.

176
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,874
Rym: Yeah, we didn't talk about it Did?

177
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:14,589
Rym: we were gonna talk about it on the show that got canceled last week.

178
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:16,858
Rym: Oh, we're gonna talk about Jack Thompson.

179
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,865
Rym: We were gonna talk about something.

180
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,350
Rym: I can't read my writing and something else.

181
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,253
Rym: I can't read my writing.

182
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:22,879
Rym: oh and speed limits.

183
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:23,922
Scott: Oh good.

184
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:26,110
Scott: We can all we can have a whole show on speed limits.

185
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,893
Scott: It just yeah, we'll hold that off until later, but I actually I made a news story But I'll talk about it.

186
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,658
Scott: Maybe tomorrow cuz it's video game day.

187
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,728
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely a video game news video game day.

188
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,879
Rym: Yep and Coming up what we were gonna do, but we missed it.

189
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,983
Rym: Just didn't do an episode.

190
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:46,409
Rym: is we've recently watched Four or five and six of Star Wars again.

191
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:52,270
Rym: Oh, yeah And I got to say the blood is boiling for Star Wars all over again, and we're gonna have a lot to say.

192
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,989
Rym: We're gonna do a whole show.

193
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,807
Scott: There's nothing I like better than a whole bunch of spaceships in space shooting at each other really.

194
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,840
Rym: oh, yeah, all right It's a trap trap trap.

195
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:01,884
Rym: That's no moon.

196
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,109
Rym: It's a trap trap.

197
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:07,470
Scott: You know if you watch those again, and you actually like pay the freaking attention.

198
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,777
Scott: There's so many just traps.

199
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:10,840
Scott: all though.

200
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,069
Scott: It's just really the thing is just a trap trap.

201
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:14,410
Rym: pretty much.

202
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,157
Rym: Oh Star Wars over and over again.

203
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,020
Rym: Oh, no.

204
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:17,643
Rym: It's a trap.

205
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,089
Rym: someone is our only hope.

206
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,933
Rym: oh There's another trap.

207
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,178
Rym: well someone is our only hope.

208
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,766
Scott: I mean look let's go to that cloud city.

209
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:25,128
Scott: Oh, no.

210
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:25,690
Scott: It's a trap.

211
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,595
Rym: You hear the words.

212
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:28,799
Rym: You're our only hope.

213
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,490
Rym: at least seven times in the three movies.

214
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,921
Scott: Yeah, we should count all six movies.

215
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,729
Scott: how many times someone says hope?

216
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:42,110
Scott: How many times someone says trap or a trap is set or a trap is triggered?

217
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:43,811
Scott: You know.

218
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:57,766
Rym: so the one benefit of the fact that we didn't do a show for one extra day is that we've got quality things of the day.

219
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:04,189
Rym: Because every time the equality things the day yeah I mean Scott's thing is kind of weird and just go with it.

220
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:05,397
Rym: Just trust us on this.

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,329
Rym: and my thing is just I just thought it was funny.

222
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,262
Rym: So we'll do Scott's first.

223
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,375
Scott: all right, so There've been flash games before.

224
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:24,549
Scott: I mean everyone plays the flash games right, but there's one kind of game Where you don't really win or lose, or you know it's not like you don't have to pay money.

225
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,749
Scott: even It's pretty much just like this sandbox.

226
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,998
Scott: You know we're kind of like.

227
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:33,657
Scott: you can just do whatever you want here and there and yeah like games are like Oh, there's a village.

228
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:34,603
Rym: You can poke at it.

229
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:41,856
Scott: Yeah, and This one in particular is just Really really great for some reason.

230
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:42,699
Scott: I can't explain.

231
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,482
Scott: It's in Java.

232
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,869
Scott: actually it's not flash, but it might as well be flash.

233
00:12:45,889 --> 00:13:01,878
Scott: and basically you have sand water salt and oil and They're pixels, and they kind of fall down from the top of the screen, and there's also the name Kuji Which is a little baldy guy?

234
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:03,165
Rym: I usually get rid of him.

235
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:03,990
Scott: I usually get rid of him.

236
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,290
Scott: He's not so interesting, but basically you can change the rate at which these things fall from the sky.

237
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:14,886
Scott: You can speed or slow down time, and you can also draw other things.

238
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,829
Scott: you can make walls Which are pretty much?

239
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:29,027
Scott: Invincible and you just draw walls and you can change the size of your pen that you draw with from one pixel two pixels four pixels 64 pixels like you draw a little light copy wall, and then the sand falling down fills it up and then overflows.

240
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:33,563
Scott: yep and You can use a spout.

241
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:38,370
Scott: if you use a spout It's like drawing water, but it stays there and water comes off of it.

242
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,510
Scott: So it's kind of like a. just you draw something and water just comes out of it like whoa.

243
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,310
Rym: Or you can draw a plant and a plants like a wall, but it grows into water.

244
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:53,930
Scott: Yeah, so if you have a plant it's just as green stuff, and if water touches it it pretty much turns into plant.

245
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:59,960
Scott: You can draw Sarah Cera Which is kind of like this ceramic wall.

246
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,430
Rym: right, but it'll burn, but it'll burn slow.

247
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,378
Scott: Yeah, the wall isn't.

248
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,714
Scott: walls are invincible But ceramic.

249
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,748
Scott: if you set it on fire with the fire hit that I will scoot soon.

250
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,190
Scott: explain.

251
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,317
Rym: Yeah, fire is great.

252
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,228
Scott: fire is the most fun in this whole thing.

253
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:19,090
Scott: It'll slowly slowly burn so you can do interesting things with it as opposed to oil which burns quickly.

254
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:22,889
Scott: Yeah, oil if fire gets near oil it just goes crazy with fire.

255
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,556
Scott: Fire obviously is fire.

256
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:30,733
Scott: you just draw fire, and then if it catches on to things that are flammable It'll ignite.

257
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:35,870
Rym: now this game is basically just a physics engine a very simple one sitting there, and you can poke at it.

258
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,210
Scott: Yeah, it's basically pixel based.

259
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:40,890
Scott: I think it actually you know goes across all the pixels and figures out.

260
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,537
Scott: Okay, this pixel touch that.

261
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:43,681
Scott: now this you know it's just.

262
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,850
Rym: I don't know why it's just so utterly amusing.

263
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:48,142
Rym: I sat there for like an hour just playing with.

264
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:51,537
Scott: I made a system where The there would be.

265
00:14:51,557 --> 00:15:04,430
Scott: I set the oil there's an oil falling from the top of the screen And there's fire at the top of the oil right and there's some Spouts of water under it right and there's a wall and closing the whole system.

266
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:10,329
Scott: So you have is you have oil that falls down, but some of the oil sets on fire and some of it keeps going down.

267
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:16,270
Scott: Then you have water just filling up slowly and then I start some plant.

268
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:27,615
Scott: So you have this thing just filling up with plant because the water turns into plant and Eventually the plant gets all the way to the top where the fire is At the top of the oil.

269
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:35,197
Scott: so all the plant just sets on fire and turns to nothing and it fills up with water again But the fire doesn't get all the plant.

270
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,866
Scott: so the plant grows back and sets on fire.

271
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:38,950
Scott: It's just perpetual motion.

272
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:42,209
Scott: I met something that's just one of the great things you can do with it.

273
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:55,164
Rym: Yep I made a bunch of walls and I basically made an oil lamp where there's fire burning at the end of this lamp and Like at the top and then there's a little loopy like a reservoir where oil collects and then the like oil is constantly refilling the lamp So it never runs out.

274
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:56,934
Scott: It's pretty fun.

275
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,400
Scott: You can just do crazy stuff.

276
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,037
Rym: I mean the salt really doesn't do anything But it's still fun to watch it flow around.

277
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,850
Scott: Yeah, the sand couldn't put out fires and the water can put out fires.

278
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:21,729
Scott: It's like I would make like a ceramic thing and have fire come up under it And then when the fire burnt through the ceramic the sand and the water would fall out and put the fire out But then that water would touch some plant that would grow and hit some oil that was on fire.

279
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:22,625
Scott: Oh my god Do it again?

280
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,154
Scott: Okay, oh.

281
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,464
Scott: and the one other thing in this game is an eraser.

282
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,716
Scott: you can just erase things and There's the question mark.

283
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:35,498
Scott: if you use the question mark, it just makes the game go crazy But like this fractal all over the place.

284
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:36,382
Scott: I don't know the point of it.

285
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:37,406
Scott: It's kind of silly.

286
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:42,144
Rym: Yeah So just seriously go to this site try it.

287
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,269
Rym: it'll look weird.

288
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:47,650
Rym: Trust us if you're not amused within 30 seconds, then you'll get your money back.

289
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,957
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not even a game.

290
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:51,008
Scott: just start playing with it and see what happens.

291
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,084
Scott: You know be way cool is that they made this for the DS of the stylus man.

292
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:56,007
Scott: That would rock.

293
00:16:56,068 --> 00:17:00,966
Rym: Ooh Yeah, that'd be real good if I was just bored like on a train for five minutes.

294
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:16,988
Rym: Yep So my thing this is just someone's blog and I just thought it was cool because it's basically this Russian guy as far as I can tell writing about how Russians actually drink vodka and How to drink vodka without getting drunk.

295
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,645
Scott: Because yeah Russians actually do drink a shit ton of vodka.

296
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,770
Scott: That's not like some stereotype.

297
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:29,169
Rym: Yeah, cuz I mean a long time ago The tradition was that a lot of times the water supply wasn't that safe and vodka was safe.

298
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:33,489
Rym: So you drank vodka to get your water, but you didn't want to get drunk because you had to do work.

299
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:40,209
Rym: So Russians came up with a lot of ways to not get drunk but still drink a lot of vodka.

300
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,901
Scott: now Does this work with non vodka?

301
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,090
Scott: or is it vodka specific?

302
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,651
Rym: I don't know.

303
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:50,639
Rym: I mean part of it is that there are genetic predispositions and that people who drink a lot tend to have high Resistances to drunkenness.

304
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,910
Scott: Well, that's the same thing with anything I mean if you eat a lot of percocet eventually doesn't work and you have to take more and more.

305
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:02,682
Rym: I mean some of this stuff is kind of yeah, and some of it's silly and some of it's pretty officious But basically it's just.

306
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:03,409
Rym: it's a really cool.

307
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:08,239
Rym: here's how to not get drunk and It also talks a lot about the traditions around vodka.

308
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:20,683
Rym: and like if you go to a Russian party and the Russians are drinking vodka It's it not only tells you how much vodka you're expected to drink socially But how to politely not drink too much vodka and get drunk and sick.

309
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:21,666
Scott: That's good.

310
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,870
Scott: No one ever wants to get sick.

311
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,797
Scott: I at least I don't want to get sick.

312
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,889
Rym: I don't know many people who drink specifically to get sick.

313
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,430
Rym: Mmm, I know I want to drink to get drunk, which I'm not a big fan of.

314
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:41,808
Scott: Yeah It would be pretty interesting to see what of the things the Russians do which ones are scientifically actually helping you not get drunk and which ones aren't and if there was a way to learn from that.

315
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:45,286
Scott: to like just Make like a thing you drink and then you could.

316
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:46,471
Scott: you know You like.

317
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:52,559
Scott: drink one of these things we invent and then drink a drink of vodka and then drink one of these things We invent and you won't get drunk.

318
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,210
Rym: a lot of it's just common sense.

319
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:01,650
Rym: They say like drink shots, but always eat things between every shot and that's why I'd like a traditional Russian drinking party.

320
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:02,615
Rym: They'll have these.

321
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,539
Rym: I can't pronounce the word.

322
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,283
Rym: It's a Russian word.

323
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,590
Rym: that kind of means appetizer.

324
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,244
Rym: There's a little salty things or caviar things and between every shot.

325
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:13,496
Rym: You're supposed to eat a whole bunch of appetizers And you're supposed to eat while you're drinking.

326
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:15,623
Scott: and now what do you get full though?

327
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:16,706
Rym: I don't know.

328
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:19,598
Rym: I don't think you ever do Mmm, it's a Russian party.

329
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:20,081
Rym: What do you want?

330
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:20,845
Scott: I don't know.

331
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:31,104
Scott: Oh Those the Russians In Soviet Russia Yakov Smirnoff makes you Yeah, oh, we're supposed to like, you know say something of an inside joke.

332
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:32,350
Scott: Does that count as an inside joke?

333
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,154
Scott: Yeah, I try to think about it.

334
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:38,110
Rym: in Soviet Russia something something's you is not an inside joke.

335
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:44,277
Rym: That is a far cliche that grew out of a terrible Terrible terrible Soviet comedian like.

336
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:50,718
Scott: there's a guy called Yakov Smirnoff and he is a comedian and he has his own Like place that he does comedy at.

337
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,430
Scott: he doesn't do comedy at other places and you can go to the place.

338
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,433
Scott: There's a website.

339
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,216
Scott: just search for it.

340
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,038
Scott: It's not hard to find.

341
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,486
Rym: his jokes are all of the same format.

342
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:12,349
Rym: in America Something something's you or something you something something in Soviet Russia something something you Yep, like in America you eat beef or beef but in Soviet Russia beef eats you.

343
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:18,790
Scott: Yeah Only they're actually somewhat funny because they relate to Soviet Russia and their things that in Soviet Russia actually happened to you.

344
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,670
Rym: Yeah, basically he is the Jeff Fox worthy of Soviet Russia?

345
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:22,593
Scott: I don't know.

346
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:26,890
Rym: Jeff Fox worthy is but I'll let that Fox worthy was the ya might be a redneck if bla bla bla bla.

347
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:27,779
Scott: I know that guy.

348
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,123
Scott: Yeah The other the previous joke where I said, oh those Russians.

349
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:52,829
Scott: Yeah, there's a. there's a song called Ra ra Rasputin, you know Rasputin the Russian guy who you know did the Queen and well allegedly Yeah, but anyway There's a song and at the end of the song the the guy goes, oh those are.

350
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,610
Scott: We'll talk more about that in the future.

351
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:03,050
Rym: Yeah, because it's it's part we've been searching for a Russian song that we can't find for a long time.

352
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,538
Scott: Yeah, we'll let that one stay a mystery for a little while longer.

353
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:05,959
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,849
Rym: Yeah in the meantime, but you know what that Rasputin He was Russia's greatest love machine.

355
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:20,730
Scott: All right for the past two Mondays We've done our how to build a computer and how to properly purchase a computer and now we're going to continue.

356
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:24,259
Rym: This is part three of three Of three.

357
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,210
Scott: well probably of three.

358
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:33,382
Rym: Yeah I don't think we're gonna need to do another one on this because every other topic beyond building a computer is Really another series like networking.

359
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,210
Rym: Yeah building servers and all that.

360
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,950
Scott: Yeah, this bit is really all the parts and which ones to buy and what they do.

361
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:45,313
Scott: Maybe we could do one in like actual construction instructions, but you can get that on the internet It's not yeah I mean seriously.

362
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:50,270
Rym: you plug the things that fit into the holes and you can't plug things in wrong because they won't let you.

363
00:21:50,631 --> 00:22:00,542
Scott: yeah, the hardest part is the BIOS and then you just take the book that comes with the motherboard and you read each item and You say do it tells you you should set this to this.

364
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,388
Scott: if you have this you should set this to this.

365
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,509
Rym: if you have This and you call the direct the BIOS is when in doubt don't touch it.

366
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,644
Rym: Yeah, if you don't know what something does leave it alone.

367
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:09,390
Rym: It'll work fine.

368
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,337
Scott: Yep, you only read that you really have to.

369
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:14,990
Rym: change is make it work faster, but that's a topic for another day.

370
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,758
Rym: That's really not a big part of this.

371
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:18,445
Rym: That's like post building the computer.

372
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:23,019
Scott: Of course today the first thing that talk about is what video card do you get?

373
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:31,338
Rym: and There are basically four broad broad broad arbitrary categories of video cards From bottom to top.

374
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,805
Rym: They are no name.

375
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:36,137
Rym: video cards Middle of the road what?

376
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:37,121
Rym: basically no name.

377
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:46,219
Rym: crap video cards normal video cards gaming video cards and professional video cards And those are very broad obtuse.

378
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,503
Rym: Don't worry about them categories.

379
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:48,868
Rym: That's just how I like to think about it.

380
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,728
Rym: Yep Don't buy a no name video card.

381
00:22:52,333 --> 00:23:03,390
Scott: well, all right a No-name video card is something like it only can do 2d graphics or it Doesn't even have a 3d chip or it has a 3d chip in it.

382
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,815
Scott: You've never heard of like one of those.

383
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:06,482
Scott: like it's not Nvidia.

384
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:07,385
Scott: It's not ATI.

385
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:08,630
Scott: It has something else on it.

386
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:16,174
Rym: Yeah like it's a video card that came with like a Dell dimension and it has a weird name and It's not an Nvidia and it's not ATI.

387
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,276
Rym: It's just something weird.

388
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:25,190
Scott: All those video cards are really good for our Computers that don't really need a display like a server doesn't really need to show anything on the screen.

389
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:36,312
Scott: maybe it'll show some text on the screen, you know, or You just use the terminal and at the most it might have a 2d gooey But it doesn't have any fancy graphics or anything like.

390
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:37,638
Scott: then you can use one of those.

391
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,279
Scott: you don't care You just need a video card to boot the computer.

392
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:44,957
Scott: But if you actually want a hat a desktop computer, you need another.

393
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:45,639
Scott: you need something better.

394
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:56,992
Rym: yeah, and Honestly, there's a. there's a. basically there's a big war going on between ATI and Nvidia when it comes to the two middle categories Of video cards, which is all you're really looking for here.

395
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:02,919
Rym: Yep, and To not be partisan by an Nvidia don't buy an ATI.

396
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:05,992
Scott: Well, see the thing is is hardware wise?

397
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:16,140
Scott: looking only at the chips themselves it's kind of a tough call because The ATI chip is pretty powerful and pretty cheap and the Nvidia with its wide array of chips are pretty powerful and pretty cheap.

398
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,311
Scott: And you can compare them on any given day.

399
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:23,096
Scott: and one guy will have a better Top of the line and one guy will have a better middle of the line.

400
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:30,359
Scott: and you know Just considering how many pixels it can push without in optimum conditions and how good the graphics it can do.

401
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:39,420
Scott: You know, you really have to look at a whole bunch of different, you know Stats and charts to figure out which one is the best and they're pretty much equal.

402
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,319
Scott: Yeah It's just don't even think about it because it doesn't matter.

403
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:49,000
Scott: The reason you should get Nvidia is because it works in Linux and ATI doesn't work in Linux for crap.

404
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:51,879
Rym: Not only that ATI has trouble in Windows sometimes.

405
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,540
Scott: Yeah, the ATI drivers are really really really really really had more really shitty as fuck.

406
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:04,699
Rym: Yeah that we can't stress enough how poorly written and poorly executed the ATI drivers are.

407
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:09,317
Scott: I mean that's like Nvidia is kind of a good company like they.

408
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:10,140
Scott: they want them.

409
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,953
Scott: They they're putting stuff out for Linux.

410
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:12,800
Scott: that is really good.

411
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,700
Scott: But they won't open source the driver which makes a lot of the crazy open source zealots mad at them.

412
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:22,220
Rym: But at the same time they make it easy to incorporate their driver into a Linux distribution.

413
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:26,832
Scott: Yep And the thing is is they the only reason they don't open source the driver?

414
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:30,879
Scott: at least some people at Nvidia have said the only Reason they don't open source the driver.

415
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:32,604
Scott: So ATI doesn't see it.

416
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:38,340
Scott: because if ATI sees it then ATI and video be pretty much equal as long as ATI doesn't see that.

417
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,742
Scott: Well, how?

418
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:41,493
Scott: what makes the Nvidia driver so fucking awesome.

419
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:48,600
Rym: I use the word fucking a lot here But I guess we can't stress it enough, yeah, I mean seriously Nvidia has a unified driver.

420
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:50,386
Rym: They have one driver for every card.

421
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:51,008
Rym: Mm-hmm.

422
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:56,450
Rym: There are rare rare rare exceptions to that and you won't run into them Yep, because they don't make those cards anymore.

423
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:07,195
Rym: Yeah, like I ran into it my computer I'm recording this show on now has a GeForce 2 GTS Which is this it was the $400 top-of-the-line awesome video card in the year 2000.

424
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:12,340
Rym: Mm-hmm Now it's a piece of crap and Nvidia's dropped support for it.

425
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:16,120
Rym: So I had to use an old version of the driver because they just dropped it from the new driver.

426
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:19,819
Rym: Mmm, I guarantee this won't happen to you anytime soon if at all.

427
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:26,680
Scott: The other thing you have to realize is that Nvidia is just a chip maker and they make drivers to support their chips.

428
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:35,009
Scott: ATI makes chips and cards and drivers and the only way you can get an ATI chip is if you buy a card that is made by ATI.

429
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:46,619
Scott: you won't find like a bit or aces or Who else gain word or light on or any of those companies making a video card with an ATI chip on it?

430
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,599
Scott: There's only ATI makes cars of ATI chips on it.

431
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:54,240
Rym: But my g-force 3d labs made that and before that some other company made my Nvidia.

432
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:58,619
Scott: Anyone who wants to make a video card with an Nvidia chip on it can do so.

433
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:05,100
Scott: So that just helps you out because now you have all these different people competing on price and Nvidia just doesn't care.

434
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:07,559
Scott: They make plenty of money because they're selling chips to all these people.

435
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:13,836
Scott: It's just you have to you can you know get people to fight over which is gonna be the cheaper cheapest?

436
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:23,260
Scott: geforce fx 9000 which what you know is it gonna be this company this company who's gonna make a better card Don't want to get a card that has more RAM less RAM.

437
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:29,584
Scott: you know you have so much more choice more competition better for the consumer and It's just great.

438
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:38,016
Rym: Yeah, and even though there's all these different kinds once again You don't need to worry about the driver Because some companies put out their own driver for like say 3d labs.

439
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:42,151
Rym: when I got my video card They put out their own driver for my geforce car.

440
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:47,775
Rym: Yep, however the geforce Nvidia driver the one that Nvidia puts out worked just fine.

441
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:48,760
Rym: In fact was better.

442
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:55,760
Scott: Well, actually the thing is is I had a diamond viper v770, which is the first tnt2 card that didn't suck.

443
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,439
Scott: Well, it was that really the first tnt2 card that was worth buying at all.

444
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:02,300
Scott: Yeah, and it came with a diamond driver.

445
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:11,599
Scott: But I realized later that all those drivers that have the same brand as the as the card manufacturer are really just the Nvidia driver in disguise.

446
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,378
Scott: and it's the Nvidia driver from whatever time they released your card.

447
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:33,540
Scott: and If you use the Nvidia driver from the Nvidia website, not only does it work better Because it is definitely absent of any buggy code that the video card manufacturer might have put in But it's more updated because the one from the video card manufacturer is never gonna really update.

448
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:43,054
Scott: The Nvidia one is updated and while they have no guarantee and there's all this fine print It's great and you can use it no matter who made your card and it'll work perfectly.

449
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,529
Rym: Yep, and They're often putting out improvements.

450
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:53,318
Rym: They whenever they release a new Nvidia driver They always add stuff like this card is now faster or the drivers now smaller or something cool.

451
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:57,645
Scott: Mm-hmm and while you may be thinking and What do they know?

452
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,216
Scott: my ATI driver works fine, I'm never gonna use Linux.

453
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:00,899
Scott: what do I care?

454
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,869
Scott: Windows Vista is cut right now.

455
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,020
Scott: You gotta look at the situation at this point in time.

456
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,745
Scott: XP is the current windows.

457
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:10,129
Scott: Vista is coming out.

458
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,920
Scott: Vista is gonna have DRM and other stuff that won't let you pirate it.

459
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,394
Scott: It'll be really hard to pirate probably not impossible.

460
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:17,400
Scott: I don't think that'll ever happen.

461
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,695
Rym: Yeah, but even if you pirate it's gonna be hard to get updates.

462
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:20,420
Rym: You're gonna have trouble.

463
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:26,128
Scott: You're gonna have trouble downloading and listening to your own mp3 collection Like if you thought XP was hard to pirate.

464
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:27,171
Rym: Oh my god.

465
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:29,920
Scott: Yes Vista is not gonna be this great thing.

466
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,127
Scott: It's probably gonna be like the first windows.

467
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,090
Scott: That isn't monopoly.

468
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:37,563
Scott: So you're probably not gonna want to upgrade to that Which me.

469
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:43,700
Scott: and eventually one day they'll stop supporting XP and it'll just be impossible to use it without getting a million viruses.

470
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:46,600
Rym: I mean Windows 2000 is already barely supported.

471
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:52,279
Scott: Yeah, and we're talking years down the road because computers last five six years at least mine do you know?

472
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,772
Scott: You're gonna probably go to Linux or Mac or something.

473
00:29:55,973 --> 00:30:06,720
Scott: and if you're planning and going to Linux Unless ATI all of a sudden comes out with a working good Linux driver sometime between now and then You can't go wrong buying an Nvidia.

474
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,670
Scott: You can always jump to Linux in case something happens.

475
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:14,248
Scott: if you want to throw a Linux live CD in to fix your computer It'll work a lot better.

476
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:16,460
Rym: Yeah, if you want a dual boot you have to use Nvidia.

477
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:25,997
Scott: Yeah and people were talking about things like game CDs that would just boot off the CD and play and If those are based on Linux, you're gonna need an Nvidia or you know it.

478
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,324
Scott: Cuz I'm a video card.

479
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:30,650
Rym: We're not kidding ATI's drivers.

480
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,358
Rym: Just half of them just won't even work in Linux.

481
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:35,385
Rym: They're buggy They're huge.

482
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,198
Rym: upgrading them can just prevent your computer from booting.

483
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:43,240
Scott: Yep I mean I have an ATI in my laptop from work and I don't do 3d with it at all.

484
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,297
Scott: I mean, sometimes you play Quake 3 at work and it works.

485
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:53,290
Scott: fine Sure But the actual interface of doing things in the driver like setting up multiple monitors It's just painful and it doesn't work, right?

486
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:57,772
Rym: I mean we had a computer downstairs We call it div affectionately and it's connected to our TV.

487
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:04,239
Rym: and we had this ATI pretty good video card with an S video out on it and we just stuck it in the box belt Linux on it.

488
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:12,540
Rym: and Then we discover that in Linux There is actually no way in the world to make that computer output video on the S video.

489
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:20,502
Scott: Wait, so then I plug my laptop from ATI into the TV and it kind of worked kind of shiddly Like.

490
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:21,690
Scott: I really couldn't make it go.

491
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,300
Scott: and this is with the ATI video card.

492
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:29,078
Scott: So then we bought like a $30 geforce 4 crap video card popped it in.

493
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:29,620
Rym: it worked immediately.

494
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:38,566
Scott: We didn't have to do anything It just it worked properly and it wasn't because of who made the video card It was because it was an Nvidia video card.

495
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:43,400
Rym: now you hear a lot of things like steam and all these valve games.

496
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:47,295
Rym: They they say they're back in ATI and they always see things like oh ATI.

497
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:48,499
Rym: It'll work right here on ATI.

498
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:50,287
Rym: Yep, don't worry about that.

499
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:51,472
Rym: The cards are the same.

500
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,160
Rym: You're not gonna notice a significant difference.

501
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,760
Scott: Yeah, you'll see sites that you know, the sites with all the benchmarks for all the gamers.

502
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:05,624
Scott: They compare like how fast it is and sure if you have a game that was written for DirectX and for ATI If you have an ATI and it's working Well, it's gonna be.

503
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:10,884
Scott: you're gonna get a few more FPS with the ATI card then with the equivalent Nvidia card It's gonna be that way.

504
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:15,660
Rym: but they love a lot of times they imply that it's not gonna really work if you don't have an ATI card.

505
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:18,096
Scott: Yes, it works just fine.

506
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:23,675
Scott: with the Nvidia You'll just have a few FPS less and if you really care about those FPS extra you got a problem.

507
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:35,935
Scott: I Mean, is it really worth the you know, the extra trouble and the self-limiting just to get you know a few extra Frames in a game that you don't even notice because they're above your vertical sync and because

508
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:40,320
Rym: a long time ago it mattered I mean back in the day when you would want 20 frames per second was good.

509
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:44,760
Rym: You could like overclock your video card and get 25 and it was a huge improvement huge improve.

510
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:48,365
Rym: But if you're getting a hundred and now you get a hundred and eight That doesn't mean.

511
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:52,350
Scott: and even if you're getting a hundred if all of a sudden you get two hundred It doesn't mean anything.

512
00:32:52,592 --> 00:32:52,874
Scott: you never.

513
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:53,559
Scott: you don't see that.

514
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,048
Rym: Yeah, in fact, usually you can't.

515
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:00,569
Rym: I don't know how many of you realize but in most games There is something called a vertical sync.

516
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:06,050
Rym: you want to turn vertical sync on if we can Yeah, though you usually in old games like in the quake two days.

517
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:08,779
Rym: Most people turn it off because you couldn't handle it.

518
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:15,699
Rym: Basically all it does is your monitor refreshes a certain number of times per second and a certain time.

519
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:21,776
Rym: Yes Vertical sync ensures that the video card updates in tune with your monitor, right?

520
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,245
Rym: It's more complicated than that But that's basically what it is.

521
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:30,649
Scott: So basically my monitor will update the picture on itself 75 times every second right now.

522
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:39,415
Scott: Normally my video card will just churn out a billion billion frames and When the monitor updates it'll just display whatever frame happens to be there at the time.

523
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,895
Scott: and the other frames You know, they kind of get displayed.

524
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:52,800
Scott: It's complicated but if you set vertical sync The video card will display one frame for every time the monitor updates and it'll be perfect and in sync and there's no flickering.

525
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,993
Rym: and it's all the other half of this that really meant that.

526
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:59,225
Rym: that just the part that makes the Performance difference is that vertical sync.

527
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:04,663
Rym: when you don't have it the game itself will not sync itself up vertically because it's just updating as fast As it can.

528
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,939
Rym: so if you like say it's quick and you look up really quick.

529
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:12,693
Rym: The textures might tear so it's hard to you have to see a picture of it.

530
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:19,600
Rym: Maybe I'll find a googling but basically the Horizontally because it's called vertical sync, but it affects how things look horizontally.

531
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,357
Rym: You'll see things kind of like jaggy like they won't be lined up for a second while you're looking around.

532
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:31,800
Rym: Yep But the thing is regardless of that You can't see FPS greater than your monitor can display.

533
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:38,299
Rym: Your monitor is probably not refreshing more than maybe 120 times a second at most if you have a really really good monitor.

534
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:38,539
Rym: Yep.

535
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:58,319
Scott: So what it comes down to is if your monitor is a 75 frame a second monitor If you're putting out more than 75 frames a second on your video card Those frames are basically useless and your video card is better than you need it to be and you could probably just turn up The graphic image quality to lower the frames a bit and you would have a better experience.

536
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:02,049
Rym: Now to wrap up just because we've been talking about video cards a lot.

537
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,257
Rym: We've thrown a lot of information at you.

538
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:15,145
Rym: Mm-hmm basically, if you're a multimedia designer or 3d designer or something for your job buy a professional video card if you can like an Oxygen or whatever matrix.

539
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,589
Rym: Yeah matrix is good.

540
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:19,116
Rym: If you do 2d matrix is King.

541
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:20,078
Scott: I don't know.

542
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:20,720
Scott: They're still King.

543
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,660
Rym: I haven't looked at the last time I checked but that was over a year ago as many years ago.

544
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:35,660
Scott: Yeah, but if you're doing like if you're working at like a 3d animation place You're gonna need some one of these crazy like quadro something something cards that are just insane.

545
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:38,473
Scott: I mean you could use them for gaming, but they're not made for that.

546
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:39,739
Rym: They're may really won't help you out.

547
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,405
Scott: Yeah, they're made to just render videos really really quick and make model, you know All that kind of stuff.

548
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:55,280
Rym: but for normal use a general rule of thumb Even if you're a gamer even if you're a fairly hardcore gamer if you're the hardest core gamer You're just gonna spend 800 bucks and buy the newest video card.

549
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,378
Rym: Whatever if you're smart buy the second best video card on the market.

550
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:03,831
Rym: Yeah Like literally look at what the most expensive awesome normal video card is.

551
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:09,294
Rym: go back one or maybe two steps and you'll save four or five Hundred dollars and it'll be almost as good.

552
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,622
Scott: Mm-hmm I'm always.

553
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:14,619
Scott: it's kind of like video cards seem to follow the same price scale as CPUs.

554
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,020
Scott: Like the number one g-force will be crazy out of control.

555
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,428
Scott: The one under it would be like half that price.

556
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:24,281
Scott: the one under it will be half that price and then it starts to taper Off.

557
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,411
Scott: like the next one will only be 20 bucks cheaper.

558
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,500
Scott: The next one will only be five bucks cheaper.

559
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,109
Scott: The next one is only a dollar cheaper.

560
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:35,459
Scott: So that's the point at which okay It's worth it to spend 25 bucks and go up three steps.

561
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:41,187
Scott: the one last thing though is Nowadays you can get.

562
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:49,139
Scott: I don't know how common it is, but a while ago you could get Nvidia Enforce motherboards that had video cards in them.

563
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:54,600
Scott: That's what I have for my parents and it's a great way to save a crap ton of money.

564
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:58,460
Rym: Yes, remember you can always add a video card later if you need a fast one.

565
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,908
Scott: Yeah And basically you have a video card in the motherboard.

566
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:04,797
Scott: that is a geforce 4 and it works just fine.

567
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,020
Scott: for normal computing.

568
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:12,299
Scott: You have to sacrifice you have to get more RAM because you're gonna use your RAM as the video card RAM and this kind of configuration.

569
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,740
Scott: But you can save a lot of money if you don't actually want to do 3d games really much at all.

570
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:25,439
Scott: You know, if you maybe you're gonna do a tiny 3d game like the Sims or something, you know Then it'll work just fine.

571
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:33,220
Rym: And for this point in time again once again You might notice we tried to avoid saying specific video cards because that a month from now would be completely different.

572
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,677
Rym: Yep, but if you don't play the new games like half-life 2 basically, that's really the only game.

573
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:40,749
Rym: Mm-hmm crap $30.

574
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:45,134
Rym: geforce 4 MX whatever will be more than you need.

575
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:51,907
Scott: Yeah, like counter-strike Yeah That'll play the crap out of counter-strike 1. if you want to play counter-strike source You might need a geforce FX.

576
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,512
Scott: maybe at least sixty.

577
00:37:53,552 --> 00:37:55,800
Scott: six hundred seems right at this point in time.

578
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,028
Scott: Yeah, sixty six hundred is probably.

579
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,477
Scott: is it the normal great card that you can play?

580
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:01,019
Scott: half-life 2?

581
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,891
Rym: just fine Just buy the second or third best card and you'll be fine.

582
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:04,394
Rym: Yep.

583
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:07,169
Rym: Don't buy the number one card You really really don't need it.

584
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:08,396
Rym: You're not gonna get that much out of it.

585
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:10,767
Rym: a month from now You'll see that card for $200 less.

586
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:14,040
Scott: Oh, there's also something now that's become popular again called SLI.

587
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,773
Scott: Or you combine two video cards together to sort of double whatever.

588
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:19,977
Rym: It's silly.

589
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:21,000
Scott: Don't do it.

590
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:22,024
Scott: I mean the.

591
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:27,451
Scott: the logic is that you can buy a card now and then later When you know the new card.

592
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,180
Scott: to get a new card would be so expensive.

593
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:32,814
Scott: Instead you can just buy another one just like your old card and tie them together.

594
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,220
Scott: It doesn't really work.

595
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:37,972
Rym: Yeah two video cards are not twice as fast as one video card.

596
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:49,498
Scott: in reality this system if you Do just normal 3d stuff is actually slower because the overhead of the two cards communicating with each other is Makes it slower than just having one card.

597
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:56,959
Scott: But if you are doing crazy 3d stuff like an ultra super awesome brand new game It will help you out.

598
00:38:57,361 --> 00:39:03,780
Scott: But it doesn't help you out at all when you compare it to how much more it costs to buy two video cards.

599
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,667
Scott: So just forget about it.

600
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:06,691
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's.

601
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,920
Rym: even if you're a program just don't even consider it.

602
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,593
Rym: Don't just pretend it doesn't exist.

603
00:39:10,794 --> 00:39:12,624
Rym: anyone who does it We're just gonna make fun of you.

604
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:13,928
Scott: buy it if you play.

605
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:17,360
Scott: only if you play PC games all day every day all night.

606
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:21,433
Scott: And the newest PC games maybe if you do play PC games for a living buy this.

607
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,906
Scott: Yeah, otherwise forget about it All right.

608
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:38,755
Rym: the end of video cards, yep No, since we talked about video cards so much we'll do a quick bit on displays, you know monitor Splat screen CRT, whatever Because a lot of people neglect it and we don't consider it when we consider the price of a computer.

609
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,270
Rym: because generally you buy a new Computer you don't need a new monitor monitors.

610
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:42,954
Rym: Don't go bad.

611
00:39:43,074 --> 00:39:47,676
Scott: as long as they have a monitor You might not have one you might not have any computer or you might have an old crap monitor.

612
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:48,460
Rym: You gotta buy a new one.

613
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:52,918
Scott: Yeah, and the monitor goes in a separate upgrade scale from the computer.

614
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,534
Rym: Yes I mean I've upgraded my computer once in the last five years.

615
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:57,780
Rym: I upgraded the motherboard whatever.

616
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:03,520
Rym: I've had the same monitor since the year 2000 and it's kicking strong and I'll probably use another five years.

617
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:11,540
Scott: Yep, I had the same 17 inch CRT longer than the first computer that I bought with it But I used it for like one or two more years into the newer computer.

618
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:15,480
Scott: Then I got an LCD screen, but I didn't get rid of the CRT.

619
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,767
Scott: I just had two monitors and then eventually when I got a job and real money I replaced the CRT.

620
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,916
Scott: now I have two LCDs, but they're real nice.

621
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,436
Rym: LCDs They're real nice.

622
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:35,859
Rym: But we're not gonna go into depth on all the different statistics and numbers that are associated with all the different kinds of displays Because that would be a show in itself and we'll do a show on that one day.

623
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,348
Rym: But we just want to do a quick overview of like.

624
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:41,820
Rym: basically your choices are a CRT or a cathode ray tube.

625
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:53,700
Rym: You know, that's a normal monitor a monitor with a big glass and it's huge and heavy or an LCD liquid crystal display the little flat screens Yep, just like laptops, but not because they sit on your desk.

626
00:40:54,601 --> 00:41:01,390
Rym: Now basically unless you have a reason to or if you're really trying to save money You can get a 17 or a 19 inch CRT

627
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,075
Scott: for like a hundred bucks real

628
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:10,179
Rym: cheap and we're talking a good one Mm-hmm, and the only real downsides of them are that they're big and they're heavy

629
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:17,529
Scott: if you had a lot of desk space and you don't really care and You know you want to save a lot of money.

630
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:21,806
Scott: get like a 19 inch CRT 17 inches a little small these days.

631
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,512
Scott: get a 19 inch CRT run it at 1280 by 1024 and you're good to go.

632
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:29,950
Rym: Yeah, and if you want to get an LCD Basically, you have to consider right now.

633
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,359
Rym: Are you a gamer or not?

634
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,795
Rym: Mm-hmm, if you want to play games, you have to get a low latency.

635
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:35,217
Rym: CL this LCD.

636
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:36,682
Scott: Yeah You want it.

637
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:40,736
Scott: they visit you'll see a number called the refresh rate and it'll be measured in milliseconds.

638
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:45,700
Scott: if you're gaming You need at least 12 milliseconds or less.

639
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,565
Rym: Otherwise, you'll get ghosting.

640
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:57,580
Scott: Yeah ghosting mate basically means that when you're playing the game you things will like kind of not disappear Immediately and you'll see like kind of like this shadow when things move kind of like a motion blur.

641
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,322
Scott: That's nice.

642
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:02,955
Rym: You have an old Gameboy like the original Gameboy or an old game gear.

643
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:03,557
Rym: Mm-hmm.

644
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:04,419
Rym: That's ghosting.

645
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,040
Scott: Yeah, cuz those were very very low refresh rate LCD screens where you know a pixel would move.

646
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,479
Scott: Let's say in Tetris the block would move down, but you'd still kind of see the old block because it didn't disappear.

647
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,219
Scott: yet There's a ghost of the old block where it used to be.

648
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:20,386
Scott: So that's what why it's called ghosting.

649
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:24,199
Rym: and the only other main factor is there's active matrix and passive matrix.

650
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,886
Rym: Mm-hmm You want active matrix?

651
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:29,140
Scott: No one really pays attention to that anymore because all the monitors are the good kind.

652
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:34,802
Rym: Yeah But watch out if you see a monitor that looks too good to be true and it's huge and has a low latency and it's Cheap.

653
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:37,155
Rym: check and see if it's a passive matrix.

654
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:42,280
Rym: Yeah somewhere You don't want that passive matrix is what is on old crappy laptops.

655
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:55,900
Scott: Yep Now if you don't really care what your screen looks like you can get lots like I got my grandma this I had no name brand like Southeast Asian random crap LCD screen and you know what?

656
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,019
Scott: It didn't have any dead pixels and it works and I had speakers built in which is good for my grandma and it was.

657
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,682
Scott: it Was just great.

658
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:05,957
Scott: But if you actually care get a name brand get.

659
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:12,703
Scott: it'll be a brand You've heard of like viewsonic sony samsung L I guess LG Phillips.

660
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:14,028
Scott: I think you know.

661
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:21,261
Scott: don't get like Rose will or CTX or random guy Cuz.

662
00:43:21,823 --> 00:43:26,880
Scott: yeah odds are you're not gonna have a nice warranty and there might be dead pixels and all kinds of bad things.

663
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,234
Rym: Just don't skimp on the monitor because that's the primary way you enjoy your computer.

664
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:39,487
Rym: Mm-hmm and a bad monitor I mean if you like if you sit down a computer that has a crappy worn-out monitor and it doesn't look right The computer feels slower.

665
00:43:39,528 --> 00:43:42,419
Rym: just it does not actually slower, but it feels crappier to use.

666
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:46,520
Scott: And don't hurt your eyes and don't underestimate the importance of the monitor.

667
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:49,272
Scott: I had a computer and I was using that 17 inch CRT.

668
00:43:49,312 --> 00:43:57,470
Scott: and sure, I used that 17 inch CRT with my old crap video card and I upgraded to the new a whole new computer.

669
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:05,216
Scott: and You know, it didn't really make that much of a difference graphically Even though I had upgraded from a TNT to to an FX 5900, which is just huge.

670
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:18,190
Scott: That's like three or four generations of video card upgraded and sure I had more FPS But it wasn't that much better as soon as I bought that new LCD That made more difference than all the video card in the world could have.

671
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:21,760
Scott: so don't underestimate how important the monitor is.

672
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:27,393
Rym: All right, we're running long as we tend to on this topic.

673
00:44:27,493 --> 00:44:33,520
Rym: great but uh burners Peripheral drives floppy drives we can do this real quick because it's real simple.

674
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:42,536
Rym: Yep back in the day used to have to buy a Plex store because Plex store made the best burners in the world and Other burners would fail to burn CDs you to throw them out coasters.

675
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,058
Scott: It was bad.

676
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,374
Rym: nowadays It doesn't matter buy a cheap one.

677
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:45,959
Rym: They all work.

678
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:48,848
Scott: You can just go on Newegg and for like 30 40 bucks.

679
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,573
Scott: You can get a DVD burner.

680
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:57,200
Scott: Just make sure that it supports DVD DL which is a dual layer DVDs.

681
00:44:57,401 --> 00:44:59,913
Scott: That means you can burn like these super big DVDs.

682
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,279
Scott: They can hold a whole movie on them.

683
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,770
Rym: Yep, if it does DL odds are 90% of the time.

684
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,936
Rym: Well 99% of the time it supports everything else you want to.

685
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:12,693
Scott: yeah plus minus RW CDs CD RW you can put CDs DVDs whatever.

686
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:14,659
Rym: just make sure it says DL dual layer.

687
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,519
Scott: Yep Oh and one note is that all DVD burners?

688
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,340
Scott: Technically usually start out region-free and they will set themselves to a DVD region.

689
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,931
Scott: You know once you put a DVD in them or Windows does something.

690
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:35,400
Scott: if you use Linux or if you do things properly Or you have a piece of software you can keep your DVD burner set to region zero to watch any movie you want.

691
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:40,878
Scott: So if you want like to watch foreign movies pay attention to that before you make your DVD burner work.

692
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:46,510
Rym: Yeah, and In regards to other drives, I mean External hard drives.

693
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,720
Rym: Yeah, if you use them you use them.

694
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,615
Rym: If you don't you don't that's not really something we care to talk about but floppy drives.

695
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:52,177
Scott: You don't need them.

696
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,815
Scott: Don't bother You just don't need a floppy drive anymore.

697
00:45:55,855 --> 00:45:56,640
Scott: It's completely useless.

698
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,731
Rym: Floppy drives are really just completely useless drivers.

699
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:04,649
Rym: you get on the internet now you save files So you have absolutely no reason to get a floppy drive.

700
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:14,080
Scott: if you really need something that does what a floppy drive does Which is read and write to something without wasting a bunch of CDs and move files around physically get one little USB keys.

701
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,236
Rym: Yeah, I mean there you can get a 512 megabyte one for like 10 bucks 20 bucks.

702
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:26,400
Scott: I got a 512 megabyte one for 20 bucks on sale at Staples and that's about dropping rapidly.

703
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:30,300
Scott: Yeah, they're dropping pretty quickly as flash gets cheaper All right.

704
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:42,888
Rym: Now we're getting to two components the last two main components and these may seem like afterthoughts But as particularly one of these is perhaps the most important decision you'll make And one of the most difficult.

705
00:46:42,948 --> 00:46:43,853
Rym: Yes the most difficult.

706
00:46:43,893 --> 00:46:45,180
Rym: the case in the power supply.

707
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,139
Scott: Now the case is that box that your computer goes in.

708
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,180
Scott: I mean you could if you wanted to just have a computer sit out on your desk on like a static-free mat.

709
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:54,894
Scott: You know, we've had one.

710
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:59,460
Scott: all did that Yeah, and plug all the pieces together and just have it wide open sitting there.

711
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,359
Scott: but you really probably want to put the computer in a box to make it look like a computer.

712
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:05,589
Rym: and Basically, you want to look online.

713
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:06,737
Rym: you want a case that'll hold.

714
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:09,287
Rym: first of all You probably got an ATX motherboard.

715
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:11,335
Scott: if you didn't what the hell you got a mini.

716
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:12,600
Rym: you might have gotten a mini ATX.

717
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:17,400
Scott: Mini ATX are the ones that are designed for those tiny tiny cases that are all cute and small.

718
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:22,379
Rym: So look at the motherboard you picked out and then see if it says mini ATX or ATX.

719
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:26,233
Rym: Make sure the case you buy says mini ATX or ATX.

720
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:27,658
Rym: Otherwise, it won't fit.

721
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:34,080
Rym: Yep But if it says that it'll fit guaranteed that is an industry standard that no one deviates from except old broken bells.

722
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:37,596
Scott: And if it doesn't fit then you probably bought a really crap case.

723
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:41,231
Rym: Yeah Now basically just look online.

724
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:41,975
Rym: look at Newegg.

725
00:47:42,156 --> 00:47:42,860
Rym: look at the case.

726
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:47,460
Rym: Make sure it looks nice because the ones that look nice don't cost that much more than the cheap crap ones.

727
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:54,068
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can get the really crazy riced out ones, which I don't think are so pretty but they're like Really cheap.

728
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:54,732
Scott: It's weird.

729
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:57,145
Scott: Yeah But you have to look.

730
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,818
Scott: when I look at a case the first thing I look at is what material it's made out of.

731
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,995
Scott: Plastic cases usually really cheap and crappy.

732
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:04,538
Scott: They're gonna break.

733
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:08,720
Scott: Steel cases are usually real heavy real quality.

734
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:12,973
Scott: Usually not all the time, but they might have sharp edges that'll cut you.

735
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:15,340
Scott: Yeah, they're unpleasant to work with and they're heavy.

736
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,653
Rym: I mean, I have a three foot tall.

737
00:48:17,673 --> 00:48:18,719
Rym: It's a little over three feet.

738
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:24,186
Rym: old-school steel reinforced gray Full tower case.

739
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:26,954
Rym: it weighs like 60 pounds.

740
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,660
Rym: Yeah, not full of sharp bits.

741
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:31,310
Rym: It's painful to maneuver in there.

742
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:32,736
Rym: My cables are a mess.

743
00:48:33,198 --> 00:48:38,240
Scott: Mm-hmm What I look at is I always want to buy an aluminum case because aluminum is light.

744
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:44,387
Scott: those cases usually cost a little more but it's worth it and You want to if it's not like a crap.

745
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,053
Scott: Oh weird brand aluminum case.

746
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:47,077
Scott: It probably won't cut you.

747
00:48:47,117 --> 00:48:47,800
Scott: It's well made.

748
00:48:48,422 --> 00:48:48,903
Scott: You know this.

749
00:48:48,984 --> 00:48:53,960
Scott: it comes with all the right screws quality parts, you know, aluminum is good get aluminum.

750
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:55,839
Rym: I mean basically just look on Newegg.

751
00:48:56,463 --> 00:48:59,859
Rym: It's pretty obvious what cases are crap and which ones are good just by looking at him.

752
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:07,970
Scott: Yeah, you can look at something and be like hey that looks like you know something from the weird crap gamer rice store And you can look at something else and go.

753
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,320
Scott: Wow, that looks real slick.

754
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:09,822
Scott: Look at that.

755
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:14,300
Rym: your main choice is do you want a mini tower a mid tower or a full tower?

756
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,331
Rym: Mm-hmm, and basically if you don't know you want a mid tower.

757
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:18,772
Rym: Yep.

758
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:21,200
Rym: There's really no reason to get anything else mini tower.

759
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:25,020
Rym: You probably have room for everything you need unless space is a huge consideration for some reason.

760
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:38,280
Scott: Well, if you have if you know that the only thing you're gonna have in this computer is like one DVD ROM and one hard Drive and you know just the normal basic computer then a mini tower is all you need.

761
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,920
Scott: But if you ever think that you might add something to it, the mini tower might not hold it all.

762
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:47,450
Scott: So a mid tower is probably a better choice.

763
00:49:47,811 --> 00:49:59,069
Rym: if you're not sure about your future and don't bother with a full tower I have one because back I mean I have a lot of hard drives in this computer because it's old and I do weird stuff Unless you're building a file server or something.

764
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:00,875
Rym: You don't need a full stop full tower.

765
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:02,200
Rym: You'll never fill it.

766
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,545
Rym: It'll have all these empty space.

767
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,453
Rym: You'll have long cables stretched to their limit.

768
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,080
Rym: You'll never be able to move the thing around.

769
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,482
Rym: It'll weigh a ton Mm-hmm.

770
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:16,251
Scott: and anyone who talks about air circulation with the full tower being better or whatever Don't don't listen to whatever they're saying though.

771
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:16,993
Rym: Cooling is key.

772
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:18,880
Rym: Make sure going is important with fans.

773
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:23,979
Scott: Yes, it has to be case that comes with the fans But I recommend you get a case with big fans.

774
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:28,340
Scott: Big fans are better than little fans or better than more little fans.

775
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:32,780
Scott: Yes You'll often see a case that has like in the back like two normal fan holes.

776
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,499
Scott: You're better off getting one giant fan.

777
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:42,320
Scott: The giant fans are rare, but they spin slower and they push more air per spin.

778
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:48,271
Scott: So you end up getting is you get something quieter that keeps your computer just as cool if not cooler?

779
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:57,619
Rym: and Despite all the crazy things you see you basically just need one intake fan in the front One exhaust fan in the back and your power supply will have an exhaust fan inside of it.

780
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,040
Scott: Yeah, and your CPU will come with a fan if you buy a retail CPU.

781
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,237
Rym: Yep, if you add your video card will have a little tiny fan on it.

782
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:12,918
Rym: Mm-hmm If you buy a crazy crazy fast computer like and you overclock it or something stupid You might get the blowhole on the side.

783
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:17,235
Rym: That is not necessary in any situation that any of you will probably ever be in.

784
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:19,245
Scott: there might be a hole in the top a Hole in the top.

785
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:20,919
Scott: that exhaust is sometimes good, too.

786
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:26,059
Rym: Yeah, they're not always because then that might draw exhaust away from the power supply Yep.

787
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:35,818
Rym: And the other rule of thumb is that you want more exhaust if you either want the fans to be equal meaning you want the same Amount of air being pushed in as is pulled out.

788
00:51:36,622 --> 00:51:41,519
Rym: But if there's gonna be a discrepancy you always want more air being pulled out than being pushed in.

789
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:46,938
Scott: Yep, because basically all the parts of your computer make heat and the air in your computer case gets hot.

790
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:57,398
Scott: now If you just take the panel off the side of your computer and leave it wide open You know, you don't have to worry about that because the air just comes right out Which is in some cases worse because you get less optimal airflow Yep.

791
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:11,870
Scott: but if you have fans that work properly the hot air will be pulled out of the computer pretty easily and new cool air from your room or cooler air from your room will be pulled in and That keeps your computer running nicely.

792
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:18,033
Rym: So just remember always at least equal or more exhaust than intake Mm-hmm.

793
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,829
Rym: That is the primary rule of cooling and it'll serve you well.

794
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:28,890
Rym: Yep If you want liquid cooling or something Buy a case that has it and get people to do it for you because it's actually very difficult to do without ruining everything.

795
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:35,562
Rym: Yeah, it's not really worth the effort and my opinion and as you're crazy We're gonna do one final bit here because I know that we've gone long.

796
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:41,089
Rym: but the power supply Mmm, I know I've said I can't stress this enough too many times in the show.

797
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:42,755
Rym: I cannot stress enough.

798
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:44,862
Rym: do not skimp on the power supply.

799
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,347
Rym: a bad power supply can destroy your entire Computer and it won't be covered by warranty.

800
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:51,749
Scott: Yep Well is the thing about a power supply?

801
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:52,613
Scott: What it is?

802
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:57,530
Scott: is there's the electricity from the wall and there's a wire that goes from the wall to your computer.

803
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:01,908
Rym: The power coming in is AC and it's often dirty or at least not perfect.

804
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:04,540
Scott: Yeah Anyway, that wire goes not.

805
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,143
Scott: where does it go?

806
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:11,810
Scott: It goes into your power supply Which is this little metal box and then on the other end on the inside of your computer?

807
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:19,479
Scott: Coming out of this little metal box are a bunch of crazy wires and those wires go to your motherboard They go to your CD roms.

808
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:20,765
Scott: They go to your hard drives.

809
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:21,850
Scott: They go to your video cards.

810
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:27,889
Scott: sometimes they go to each part of your computer to provide power to make things go.

811
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:35,389
Scott: and that power supply box converts the power from the wall into the power your computer gets.

812
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:42,810
Scott: and If you have a lot of things in your computer, you need a power supply that can provide a lot of power.

813
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:43,973
Rym: Now the other.

814
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:49,470
Rym: the problem with this is that almost every power supply manufacturer in the world lies.

815
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:53,850
Rym: They lie outright and the wattage you see on a power supply is bullshit.

816
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:55,877
Scott: Pretty much almost all the time.

817
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:59,229
Scott: the wattage on the power supply really doesn't mean so much.

818
00:53:59,872 --> 00:54:07,938
Rym: Now they would be fine if the industry was good and the wattage on the power supply meant how much power it can output Because then you would just buy what you needed.

819
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,030
Rym: and most computers don't need more than about 300 watts of actual power.

820
00:54:11,555 --> 00:54:12,242
Scott: Yep, or 350 really?

821
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,358
Rym: You need like a 500 watt power supply to cover your 400 watts of use or your 300 watts of use.

822
00:54:21,812 --> 00:54:25,785
Scott: It's always good to have even if it they're not lying because sometimes they're not.

823
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:30,600
Scott: it's good to have Power supply that can put out more power than you're using.

824
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,750
Scott: because then if you decide you want to add three hard drives You won't have to buy a new power supply.

825
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:38,778
Rym: not only that but the failure mode of a power supply.

826
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:52,250
Rym: the way it happens is basically the more the closer you are to the Peak output of the power supply the more it wears out the more likely it is to fail and the dirtier power It's gonna send to your motherboard a power.

827
00:54:52,471 --> 00:55:00,336
Rym: And the more power supply fails the more it's gonna send spurious voltages to the motherboard which will cause your computer to crash Reboot randomly.

828
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:01,963
Rym: It'll destroy RAM sticks.

829
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,470
Rym: It might destroy a hard drive.

830
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:11,073
Scott: Yep There is one saving grace and that is if you try to take more power out of a power supply modern

831
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:11,435
Rym: power a

832
00:55:11,696 --> 00:55:23,022
Scott: modern power supply meaning the past ten years or so Yeah, then if you try to take more out of it, then it can put out Let's say I plug in ten hard drives into an old 300 watt power supply.

833
00:55:23,043 --> 00:55:26,532
Scott: It just won't turn on it won't work and It won't.

834
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:30,990
Scott: it's really hard to figure this out because it never tells you what's going on because it doesn't really have that ability.

835
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:35,175
Rym: Yeah, you basically have to sit there with a voltimeter to find out Yeah But you're on you don't?

836
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:38,670
Scott: you check over the inside of your computer and everything looks just fine?

837
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:49,026
Scott: And if you push the power button and nothing happens It's probably the power supply is either dead or it's refusing to turn on and what you should try to do is unplug as many things as you can.

838
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:53,124
Scott: Just run the bare minimum parts of your PC and see if it turns on.

839
00:55:53,425 --> 00:55:57,118
Rym: or if you work with a lot of computers I recommend buying a power supply tester.

840
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,327
Rym: You can buy it like Circuit City or an tech.

841
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:00,210
Rym: They're like ten bucks.

842
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:01,213
Rym: They're just a thing.

843
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:08,890
Rym: you plug into that wire coming out of the power supply and you unplug everything else and you turn it on And it applies a load between two pins.

844
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,673
Rym: Well, you don't care.

845
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:12,262
Rym: basically if the light turns on the power supply works.

846
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:14,370
Rym: if the light doesn't turn on your power supply is dead.

847
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:16,601
Scott: Yep, I really didn't care about the power supply.

848
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,250
Scott: It wasn't an important part of the computer for me.

849
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:25,030
Scott: I just took whatever came with the case Because you can get cases that include power supplies and usually that might be a good idea, you know.

850
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,990
Scott: But anyway, I had one that came with the case and I didn't even think about it.

851
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,371
Scott: It worked.

852
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:38,833
Scott: and then one day I pushed the power button on my computer wouldn't turn on and it took me forever to realize Oh, the power supply is just bad it died And it just.

853
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,980
Scott: that was not something I thought about.

854
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:50,030
Scott: but now I think about it a lot and I bought this crazy power supply In my current computer, it's like blue and shiny and has fans and it's like 400 something watts.

855
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:56,305
Rym: Yep Now having way too much Having way too many things that your power supply can't power is fine because it won't start.

856
00:56:56,787 --> 00:57:11,760
Rym: the most dangerous Situation you can be in is if you have just enough power because then every time the power supply burps it's sending bad voltage to your motherboard which stresses the capacitors and the power regulation circuits on the Motherboard and it's gonna ruin your computer.

857
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:13,226
Rym: Yeah, like really we're not kidding.

858
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:20,010
Scott: Mm-hmm So you want to have more power supply than you need and you don't want to buy something cheap and crappy.

859
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,969
Rym: So buy a name brand that comes in a nice box.

860
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:28,188
Rym: We're not gonna name brands because actually good brands come and go and the markets pretty volatile.

861
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:33,350
Scott: Mm-hmm You can always kind of trust actually the ones that you get in a box at like CompUSA.

862
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:38,868
Rym: Yep, those are usually pretty reliable even like the crap CompUSA brand ones are pretty good.

863
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:43,023
Scott: Yep, and Usually what you can tell is if you try to turn your.

864
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:51,755
Scott: another thing you can tell is I remember I had a computer where I thought that all you needed was a 300 watt because I still didn't realize what was going on.

865
00:57:52,667 --> 00:58:01,590
Scott: and You know, I would push the button on the computer and it would just be like deep deep, but it wasn't a RAM error It was just some other beep error that I didn't know anything about.

866
00:58:02,252 --> 00:58:08,328
Scott: That was because they didn't have enough power supply to turn the computer on and the motherboard was like hey I'm getting power but not enough.

867
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:11,806
Rym: Now there are crazy things you can do.

868
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:18,530
Rym: you can get multiple power supplies modular power supplies redundant power supplies But that's very difficult to do in consumer PCs.

869
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,936
Rym: So we really can't talk about it.

870
00:58:20,157 --> 00:58:20,940
Scott: You don't really need that.

871
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,760
Scott: Anyway, just get one good power supply.

872
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:31,862
Rym: Yes And if you work it like if you're one of those people who has a million computers around the house and you're always fiddling with Old computers have an extra power supply around Mmm.

873
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:34,031
Scott: extra power supplies are very good to have.

874
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:43,890
Rym: Yes, because if your computer dies and you're panicking It's very nice to plug in a different power supply and see your computer boot because then you know It's just my power supply.

875
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,955
Rym: My computer's okay.

876
00:58:45,136 --> 00:58:45,820
Rym: Thank the gods.

877
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:47,364
Scott: Yeah, that's that's.

878
00:58:47,544 --> 00:58:52,577
Scott: one good thing about the power supply is if the power supply dies your data is still safe.

879
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,025
Rym: most likely I mean worst case scenario.

880
00:58:55,085 --> 00:58:59,400
Rym: if a power supply dies, it usually destroys itself physically so that it can't hurt your computer.

881
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:05,780
Rym: Yep, but cheap power supplies or if they fail spectacularly will probably destroy your motherboard or processor.

882
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,700
Rym: Usually they destroy RAM before they destroy anything else or CPUs sometimes.

883
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:14,940
Rym: Yeah, CPU is actually the last thing to go because I deal with this a lot at work.

884
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:20,159
Rym: It'll destroy the RAM and the power regulation things on the motherboard before it does anything else.

885
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:23,220
Rym: Mmm, if it destroys the CPU you were fucked anyway.

886
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:30,439
Rym: Yeah But even if it destroys a hard drive the data is probably still there and it's really rare for a power supply to actually hurt a hard drive.

887
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:34,738
Rym: But still don't skimp Don't skimp don't skimp.

888
00:59:36,762 --> 00:59:43,599
Scott: If you're not sure how much why did you need go look online and see what other people with similarly powerful computers are getting?

889
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:50,122
Scott: and If you can't find that out just call the people who make your motherboard on the phone and be like, hey What kind of?

890
00:59:50,343 --> 00:59:53,936
Scott: or call whoever you're buying the parts from and say hey, what kind of?

891
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:54,880
Scott: uh, you know?

892
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,469
Scott: How much power supply do I need for all this stuff?

893
00:59:58,212 --> 01:00:00,480
Scott: and someone will probably be able to make you a good recommendation.

894
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:12,242
Scott: Because Seriously, like the 600 watt power supplies the crazy ones You really only need those if you're like the crazy gamer with the two video cards and the five hard drives and the two burners And whatnot.

895
01:00:12,323 --> 01:00:27,220
Rym: Yep, and if you really want to get crazy and build a computer with a ton of hard drives or something weird You can just have two power supplies and there are ways to do that It's I'm not gonna explain how to do it now because you have to do some wiring But you can do things like that if you really want.

896
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:34,206
Scott: Yeah, the trick is to find a case in a motherboard that support that and usually those are like the server motherboards that take two Processors and all that.

897
01:00:34,347 --> 01:00:36,278
Scott: but yeah, that's not a desktop computer.

898
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:36,640
Scott: Who cares?

899
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,271
Rym: so That those are basically all the main components and we've gone long.

900
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,835
Rym: So we're just gonna stop here.

901
01:00:44,156 --> 01:00:45,600
Scott: Yeah, Joe just one last sentence.

902
01:00:46,387 --> 01:00:47,519
Scott: You need a keyboard and a mouse.

903
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:52,265
Scott: Get a keyboard you like a USB keyboard Wireless if you really want to.

904
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,355
Rym: probably QWERTY because we were gonna do a whole show on this.

905
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:56,820
Rym: but don't bother with Dvorak.

906
01:00:57,181 --> 01:00:59,549
Scott: Well, you know unless you're already a Dvorak guy.

907
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,555
Rym: Yeah, but there are there issues.

908
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:04,025
Rym: Yeah, I am very Sour.

909
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:04,308
Rym: All right.

910
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,479
Scott: I thought I was only say one sentence.

911
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:20,046
Scott: Then buy a mouse that feels comfortable on your hand and is also USB wireless if you want to yep, and make sure it has all the buttons you like to use and then plug everything in and turn your computer on and It'll work if you do it, right?

912
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:23,579
Rym: Yeah, we really got to work on these ending the podcast gracefully.

913
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,008
Scott: Well, that would be a graceful ending wouldn't it?

914
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,855
Rym: Oh it would but too late.

915
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:28,317
Scott: I ruined it.

916
01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:39,072
Rym: Haha And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

917
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,000
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

918
