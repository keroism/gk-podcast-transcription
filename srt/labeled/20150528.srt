1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,284
Rym: It's Thursday, May 28th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:10,666
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:14,539
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,700
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight on the GeekNights Book Club.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,158
Rym: Watership down.

6
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:22,171
Scott: Land.

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:22,700
Scott: Car up.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,268
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,910
Rym: So yeah, we'll be real brief on the news and all the like, you know, stuff that won't make sense 20 years from now to get right into the book club part.

10
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,470
Rym: But stuff's happening, you know, usual stuff.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,070
Rym: But I'm gonna try to make a vow to you guys this summer.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,990
Rym: We've been known for the last several years, talking a lot about biking in the city.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:55,210
Rym: I am going to try to tell not one anecdote about some fixie guy that I run afoul of for the entire summer on GeekNights.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,690
Scott: Did you run into a fixie guy today?

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,056
Rym: Well, I didn't bike today.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,070
Rym: But yesterday.

17
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:03,580
Scott: It's not summer yet.

18
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:04,910
Scott: Oh, he's got you.

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,592
Rym: All I'll say is this.

20
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:17,710
Rym: The second funniest thing in the world is fixie guys having to walk their bike up a not that steep incline because they literally cannot bike up those inclines.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,549
Rym: Like, that's pretty funny.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,950
Scott: The third funniest thing is when they stand up and go "huh, huh, huh" and get up the incline.

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:29,050
Rym: And the fourth funniest is when they do that to pass you and they look back at you, like see how much faster I am, and then you just pass them because they slow down.

24
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:40,510
Rym: But the funniest thing that many people don't always realize, because some people have fake fixies, is that a real fixie bike, a fixed gear bike, cannot coast.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,570
Rym: So the pedals are always moving, like a kid's tricycle.

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,050
Scott: Yep, if the wheels are moving, the pedal is moving.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:57,950
Rym: So those people, not only do they walk their bike up the Williamsburg Bridge, but then they have to walk it back down because they literally cannot bike down the hill.

28
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:00,949
Rym: It is so beautiful to behold.

29
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:02,569
Rym: Yeah, okay.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:11,750
Rym: Yeah, so I'm going to pointedly, I ran afoul of a fixie person who was walking the bike down the hill but still in the bike lane, blocking the bike lane.

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,729
Rym: So I dinged at him and he jumped on his bike and chased after me to yell at me.

32
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:25,949
Rym: And I looked back at him and I basically said something to the effect of "It's a shame you're in a children's bike or you might be able to catch

33
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:26,149
Rym: me.".

34
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:31,450
Rym: And then I biked off and he yelled again a whole bunch, but then I never saw him again.

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,570
Rym: That is my last fixie story for the entire of this summer.

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,687
Scott: He's going to tell a story about "I've got a one-speed

37
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:37,950
Scott: next."

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,590
Scott: A non-fixed one-speed.

39
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:55,030
Rym: The next time I bump into a fixie person who's not a fake fixie, like they just have a single gear bike, and they antagonize me, I guess I can impinge upon their hipster cred by disparaging the fact that they have a fake fixie.

40
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,809
Rym: That they're a faux fixie biker.

41
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,510
Scott: You know, the thing I don't understand, right, so I had a coworker and he was asking about, he wanted a bike and he's asking, right?

42
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,951
Rym: They're like a Trek 7.3.

43
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,490
Scott: I say the same thing I say to everyone.

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,909
Scott: It's got to be comfortable, otherwise you're not going to ride it.

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,249
Scott: You have to like it, otherwise you're not going to ride it.

46
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,330
Scott: It should have brakes and it should have some number of gears.

47
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,550
Scott: Even three gears is enough in the city, right?

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,970
Rym: Yeah, the hub gear is okay.

49
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,350
Scott: It's going to get you up the hill, right?

50
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,790
Scott: If you don't care about biking, that's enough.

51
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,425
Scott: I mean, 10 is more, I don't even, I have like 21 combinations.

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,130
Scott: Most, some of them are identical effectively because it's the same ratio, but I don't use even a fraction of all of those.

53
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,370
Scott: I use mostly like maybe six different combinations, right?

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,570
Scott: Like three speeds for different hills and three speeds are going fast and normal.

55
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,330
Scott: It's pretty legit.

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,390
Scott: So that's what I told him, but it's like, you know, he's one of those people who's like worried, like it's got to be perfect.

57
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,050
Scott: Like, so everything I'm like, you know, I'm just like, yeah, you know, some bikes have comp gears and some of them have regular.

58
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:54,549
Scott: He's like, oh no, which one did I get?

59
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,670
Scott: And I'm like, it just doesn't matter.

60
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,391
Scott: You know what it is?

61
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:04,390
Rym: Remember way back there was that Ted talk on if you give someone too many choices and they're not good at living, then they'll be less satisfied with any choice.

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,771
Scott: Right.

63
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:10,270
Scott: It's like, he really just needed to make sure, like, you know, every option he knew about, it's like, you felt like you had to make the right one.

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,490
Scott: And I'm like, it doesn't matter what you want.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,369
Rym: I bump into that a lot and I actually figured out a good way around it.

66
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,610
Scott: So here's how you tell people about these options.

67
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,132
Rym: No, no.

68
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:19,355
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,950
Rym: Here's what you tell people like that.

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:28,830
Rym: And I've learned when I give advice to never offer all that information I have about, oh, there's four different kinds of breaks instead.

71
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,030
Rym: What I write is I ask them a couple of questions, like what kind of biking do you want to do or whatever.

72
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,130
Rym: And then I sort of say, yeah, like I'm a bike expert.

73
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:40,629
Rym: You want get this bike with this break option and this thing.

74
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,369
Rym: Just just make the decision for them because you know what?

75
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,509
Rym: Otherwise, they're never going to buy a bike.

76
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,050
Scott: Right.

77
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:51,610
Scott: But one thing that really bothered me was he's like, I'm thinking about getting a one speed, you know, because it's so simple.

78
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,054
Scott: Wow.

79
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,450
Scott: And I'm like, it seems to me.

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,490
Rym: I'm thinking about getting a 486 because it's so simple.

81
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,650
Scott: That's what I'm saying is people were like, for some reason with bicycles, there's this attitude of we want simplicity.

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,253
Scott: Right.

83
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,389
Scott: It's like simplicity is a good thing.

84
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,470
Scott: Yeah, like a derailleur.

85
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,110
Scott: And I'm like, oh, well, why don't you go use an Apple, too?

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,849
Scott: Because it's a lot simpler than that MacBook.

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:11,930
Rym: Why don't you have a dumb phone?

88
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,969
Scott: Why don't you go get a model?

89
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,690
Scott: Why don't you get a model T Ford?

90
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,509
Scott: Because it's a way simpler than the other car.

91
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,250
Scott: Right.

92
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:28,550
Scott: And it's like, I think the problem that bicycles have, the reason people want them to be simpler is because if you look, people like an Apple compared to, say, a PC.

93
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:28,998
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,410
Scott: It's not because it is simpler.

95
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,570
Scott: It's because the complexity, they can't see it.

96
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,030
Scott: If you made a MacBook with a transparent case so you could see all the bullshit inside, people would be like, fuck that noise.

97
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,026
Scott: They wouldn't like it.

98
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,350
Scott: It's because a bicycle cannot hide its gears.

99
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,552
Scott: Right.

100
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,529
Scott: Because it doesn't look.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,309
Rym: No, I think I think it's much simpler than that.

102
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,010
Rym: I think it's like when an old person sits at a computer and says, I can't computer.

103
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:58,710
Rym: And they don't even look at the screen because I would say.

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,350
Scott: But this person hasn't even looked at anything.

105
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,904
Scott: It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,570
Scott: For some reason, when it comes to bicycles, they prioritize simplicity.

107
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,429
Scott: But when it comes to other things in life, they don't.

108
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,970
Rym: Next time someone does that, ask them a simple question and be a jerk to make sure they answer it.

109
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:25,810
Rym: Ask if they know how to shift gears on a bike, because I am really convinced that the vast majority, like 95 percent of the people biking in New York City, if the gears shift from one gear to another, it's entirely by accident.

110
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,236
Rym: And they have never used those shifters.

111
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:34,050
Rym: because if all they know is if they move the shifter a little bit, the gears start making a bunch of noise and they're worried they're going to break it.

112
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,930
Rym: I'm pretty sure people stay in whatever gear the bike was in when they got the bike.

113
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,370
Scott: There's a lot of people like bicycling Reddit who like one speeds and like fixies, despite clearly knowing how gears work and how to use them.

114
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,699
Rym: Oh, those people are a special kind of moron because they always make the same arguments.

115
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,650
Rym: They always say it's easier to repair and maintain, which isn't true at all.

116
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,681
Scott: Well, I mean, it is true in the sense that, yes, you will have a problem with the derailleur.

117
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,204
Scott: that is a good one once every 20 years.

118
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,882
Scott: So there'll be one in time in 20 years.

119
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:09,050
Scott: your bike won't break if it's a one speed.

120
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:10,929
Rym: I used to mountain bike.

121
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:15,730
Scott: It's an inconsequential, insignificant difference of reliability.

122
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:23,309
Rym: In the thousands and thousands of crazy miles I've done on bikes over the years, I have never had a problem with a derailleur.

123
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,170
Scott: My bike has 4000 miles on it and has more gears than are necessary, and it has no problem.

124
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,150
Rym: I've had problems with the brake line snapping, which, oh, the same thing can happen to a fixie.

125
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:37,709
Scott: I had to replace the tires and make the brakes tighter and change the brake pads, and that's it.

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,095
Rym: I've had to replace tires before, but you know what?

127
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,961
Rym: The people who want that simplicity, they always have the rims.

128
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,950
Rym: They're actually super complicated and difficult to get the tires off and replace.

129
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,250
Scott: Well, they don't do it themselves.

130
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,649
Rym: Well, if they're not doing it themselves, why do they care about the simplicity?

131
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,061
Scott: Because they just have these stupid ideas.

132
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,609
Scott: Like, you know, I don't know.

133
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,308
Rym: Yeah, it's weird because I see so many fixies.

134
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,670
Scott: Is it the same attitude that makes them not want to eat genetically modified food?

135
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:10,270
Rym: But I also see so many people who don't have fixed gear bikes but ride them like they're fixed gear bikes and never change gears ever or don't know how to change gears.

136
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:20,830
Rym: Which, actually, that sentiment, many people that we know, it has been revealed over the years that despite biking a lot, they had no idea how gears worked on bikes.

137
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,555
Rym: So, I don't know what to do about that.

138
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:24,619
Rym: And it's not car stuff.

139
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,150
Rym: I mean, I knew how gears worked on a bike long before I knew cars had gears.

140
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,830
Scott: I knew how gears worked on a bike in fifth grade.

141
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,110
Rym: Yeah, I got my first geared bike.

142
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,172
Scott: It had a 10-speed bike.

143
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,658
Scott: It had two in the front and five in the back.

144
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:39,807
Scott: And I said, "Ooh, there are things on here that my previous bike didn't have.

145
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,347
Scott: What do they

146
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:40,529
Scott: do?".

147
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,921
Scott: And someone told me, like, I clicked them and nothing happened.

148
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,487
Scott: And they're like, "You have to click them while you're

149
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:45,828
Scott: moving.".

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,740
Scott: So, I started moving and I clicked it.

151
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,269
Scott: And I said, "Oh, I understand

152
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,350
Scott: now.".

153
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,792
Scott: Clicking?

154
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:52,094
Rym: Really?

155
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,210
Rym: Because back then, most bikes had a continuous lever shifter.

156
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,578
Scott: It was, but it still clicked, right?

157
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:03,390
Scott: It was a lever that moved from top to bottom, but it would actually stop as you moved it.

158
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:04,228
Rym: That's kind of fancy.

159
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:05,428
Scott: Whatever.

160
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,977
Rym: Mine did not click.

161
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,950
Rym: Mine was just a continuous, like, whoop, whoop.

162
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,850
Scott: It's like you would push it from one to two and it was slightly smooth, but when it got to two, it would stop a little bit.

163
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,797
Rym: So, anyway, in the, what?

164
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,200
Rym: Okay, I just got a weird email.

165
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,461
Rym: Anyway.

166
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:24,190
Rym: So, in the news, something interesting happened.

167
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,950
Rym: And it's interesting enough for I actually want to talk about it on a Thursday on the lounge, even though it's a Book Club episode.

168
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,320
Rym: Sure.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,173
Rym: The U.S.

170
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,410
Rym: state of Nebraska, which is traditionally pretty conservative.

171
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,569
Scott: It's basically a place they grow corn.

172
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:45,810
Rym: Just abolished the death penalty and commuted all the sentences of everyone on Death Row, which was 10 people, to life sentences.

173
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,710
Scott: If it's so conservative, why would they do such a liberal thing?

174
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,336
Rym: So, this is where it actually gets really interesting.

175
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:58,690
Rym: Not only did they abolish it, but the Senate in the state, the state only has one legislative body.

176
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,954
Rym: It's the Senate.

177
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,519
Rym: It's majority Republican.

178
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:04,770
Rym: The Senate voted to abolish the death penalty.

179
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,406
Scott: What was the vote?

180
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,647
Rym: The governor vetoed it.

181
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,765
Scott: And the Senate undid?

182
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,529
Rym: The Senate overrode his veto.

183
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:13,308
Scott: Okay.

184
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,870
Rym: Which is already getting a little bit crazy.

185
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,456
Scott: Yeah, that hardly ever happens.

186
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,810
Scott: Especially, I'm guessing the governor is also Republican.

187
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,952
Rym: So, yeah.

188
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:26,410
Rym: And also, the governor seems to be a really, really shitty person.

189
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,649
Scott: Which governor is not a shitty person?

190
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,530
Rym: Should have been Zephyr Teachout.

191
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,673
Scott: It's not.

192
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:35,906
Scott: I'm saying which existing...

193
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,808
Rym: Zephyr Teachout was running for governor.

194
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,669
Scott: Which governor of any state ever was not a piece of shit.

195
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,875
Rym: So, here's what Mr.

196
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:48,110
Rym: Ricketts said when they overrode his veto to a huge degree.

197
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,989
Scott: They should just put him on Death Row.

198
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:59,310
Rym: My words cannot express how appalled I am that we have lost a critical tool to protect law enforcement and Nebraska families.

199
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:07,970
Rym: While the legislature has lost touch with the citizens of Nebraska, I will continue to stand with Nebraskans and law enforcement on this important issue.

200
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,350
Rym: The only people in the state who are for this are cops, and this governor, and a handful of Republicans.

201
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,822
Scott: Why are these other people against it?

202
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,190
Scott: That's the only important question.

203
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:24,229
Scott: This is the first conservative state that has done this since, like, the 70s.

204
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,615
Scott: You keep talking about meaningless bullshit.

205
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,664
Scott: Why are these people voting against?

206
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,030
Scott: what is their party line?

207
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,276
Rym: So, this is how it's fucked up.

208
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,890
Rym: The Democrats were against it because they're against the death penalty.

209
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:42,208
Rym: Some of the Republicans are also against the death penalty, and because it's state-level politics, you can get away with having an opinion like that.

210
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:42,850
Rym: Like, it won't matter.

211
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,629
Scott: But, why are they against it?

212
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:51,450
Rym: Well, some of them, I've been getting to that, like, the Democrats are just against the death penalty fundamentally, like, for philosophical reasons.

213
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,730
Rym: The rest of them are against it because it's too expensive, and they're trying to reduce government spending.

214
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,609
Scott: That's fine.

215
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:21,970
Rym: And one of them said one of the, like, it's horrifying the way he said it, but he basically said that he's in favor of the death penalty, but Nebraska just isn't getting its bang for its buck when it comes to executing people, so we should save the money and just not even try to kill people anymore.

216
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:29,970
Rym: He used the phrase "not getting our bang for our buck" in reference to the death penalty.

217
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:40,430
Rym: So, part of this seems to be about the fact that the companies that make the drugs they use in lethal injection are basically not making them anymore.

218
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,270
Scott: But aren't those people, like, bribing the government to make them be pro-death penalty?

219
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,772
Rym: No, so basically, no, they're not.

220
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:56,350
Rym: They don't want, like, a lot of the ways we use, like, the chemicals we use to execute people, the people who make them won't sell them to a state that has the death penalty.

221
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,750
Rym: Because they don't want it to be used for the death penalty.

222
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:03,390
Scott: Aren't chemical manufacturers generally pretty conservative?

223
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,569
Rym: No, not this kind of stuff.

224
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:06,087
Scott: Okay.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:21,490
Rym: So, they don't actually have current certified versions of the chemicals to do it, so they have to change their laws to come up with a different method, and it's all just so expensive, so the Republicans were against it for financial reasons and not for human reasons.

226
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,750
Scott: Alright, well, whatever.

227
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:28,090
Rym: They have logistical difficulties with lethal injections, and I don't think they have their electric chair anymore.

228
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,916
Scott: Yeah, I'm surprised.

229
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,070
Scott: Why don't they just switch to hanging or guillotine?

230
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,788
Rym: Because they'd have to change their laws to do that.

231
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:43,610
Scott: But it's like, you know, a guillotine is actually, like, a good thing, in a way, not because it's good to guillotine people, or kill people, right?

232
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,470
Scott: But because the people who, if you're killed by a guillotine, it's actually, you know, a painless way to go.

233
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,869
Rym: Well, that's debatable.

234
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,449
Scott: As long as it's a very nice and sharp one.

235
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,369
Rym: Wasn't there that famous old experiment during the French Revolution where the guy was awake for, like, 20 seconds?

236
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,530
Scott: It's gotta be a sharp one.

237
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,008
Rym: No, his head was awake for, like, 20 seconds.

238
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:13,070
Scott: You could also do the method where you have a boulder and you crush the person's head, anyway, but it's also good because it's so gruesome, it forces the horrible people who support the death penalty to, like, be face-to-face with how horrible it is.

239
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,648
Scott: Here's the problem.

240
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,689
Scott: So that they can't, so that they, you know, they're forced to not be for it.

241
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:22,489
Rym: Being face-to-face with it might just go back to medieval times where kids cheered in the street and threw tomatoes at the dancing guy.

242
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,390
Scott: I don't think modern people could stomach.

243
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,430
Rym: Modern people are not different from medieval people.

244
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,263
Scott: As soon as they saw one, they'd be like, "Ah,

245
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:31,969
Scott: shit.".

246
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,927
Rym: No, but then they see ten, 'cause, you know...

247
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:40,170
Scott: Also, the law, you know, when it comes to, like, you know, executing people, right, in the United States, nobody's forced to look, right?

248
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,689
Scott: It's like, sometimes they'll let you look if you want, but nobody's forced to look.

249
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:52,530
Scott: If there was a death penalty, like, you couldn't just not have it, which is the right way to go, certain people should be forced to see it.

250
00:14:53,010 --> 00:15:05,409
Scott: Anyone, the lawyer who was prosecuting the person, let's say it was a murder trial and, like, your relative got murdered and you were, like, pushing for the murderer to get the death penalty, you should be forced to watch.

251
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,049
Scott: Any politician who voted for the death penalty to be, like, legal should be forced to watch every time.

252
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,689
Scott: And if any of those people aren't there to see it or closing their eyes, then they don't do it.

253
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:25,570
Rym: There's a quote from the article, "Across the country, efforts to execute criminals in death robes stalled in the face of backlash against the death penalty in liberal states and logistical difficulties with the drugs.

254
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,190
Rym: Many states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs, as European manufacturers...".

255
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,890
Scott: Oh, European manufacturers!

256
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,328
Rym: "...setting moral and ethical objections have refused to sell them to prisons in the United

257
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:37,609
Rym: States.".

258
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:38,143
Rym: Texas?

259
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,890
Scott: Aren't there American manufacturers?

260
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:40,714
Rym: No!

261
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:43,709
Rym: And the few that are have the same problems.

262
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:49,390
Rym: Also, it's hard to find doctors who are willing to violate the Hippocratic oath and kill people like that.

263
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,920
Scott: There were doctors doing it?

264
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,230
Scott: I thought it was just, like, executionists.

265
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,229
Rym: No, there's so many laws about it.

266
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:54,623
Rym: The hangman.

267
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,030
Rym: Yeah, so, at least lethal injection.

268
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,530
Scott: Isn't it someone's job to be the hangman?

269
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:07,790
Rym: Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state, only has enough drugs to carry out one more execution.

270
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:08,450
Rym: Alright.

271
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:09,849
Rym: And they can't get more.

272
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:25,850
Rym: So, the death penalty is actually, like, at this tipping point where the US might end up abolishing it completely, partly because liberal states are banning it on human reasons, and equally partly because conservative states are finding it too expensive to keep doing it.

273
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,670
Scott: But it's like, here's the thing I understand, right?

274
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:32,310
Scott: It's like, can't imagine Obama for all of his, you know, whatevers, right?

275
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,242
Scott: He probably doesn't support the death penalty.

276
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:35,530
Scott: I don't imagine he does, right?

277
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,730
Rym: It's probably a state issue.

278
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:39,249
Rym: Remember, Congress has to do it, not him.

279
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,049
Scott: But, no, he could just pardon anyone who's on death row.

280
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:43,409
Scott: Oh, yeah.

281
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:45,568
Scott: If I was the president, that's the fuck I would do.

282
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,850
Scott: And then you know what would happen?

283
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:53,745
Scott: They'd be like, that person murdered 20 people, and I'm like, well, I'm not going to murder one person, so pardon or don't kill them.

284
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:54,470
Scott: That's your choice.

285
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,214
Scott: I'm going to pardon them.

286
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:55,898
Scott: I'm about to sign it.

287
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:56,361
Scott: Fix it.

288
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:56,904
Scott: Fix it.

289
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:57,588
Scott: Pardon.

290
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:57,930
Scott: It's too late.

291
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,710
Rym: So, interestingly, two things I learned a while ago that I just thought of recently.

292
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:04,282
Rym: You cannot pardon someone before they've been convicted.

293
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:05,530
Rym: Not relevant here.

294
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,069
Scott: Obviously.

295
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,910
Rym: But the reason for that is you could pardon a hit man.

296
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:19,589
Rym: So, anyway, but in terms of the pardoning stuff, politically it would destroy the Democrats.

297
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,270
Rym: It turned into a Willie Horton all over again.

298
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,507
Scott: I don't know what Willie Horton is.

299
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:25,589
Rym: You should learn about old politics.

300
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,808
Scott: I don't need to know about that.

301
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,290
Rym: Anyway, you got any short news before we talk about rabbits?

302
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,035
Scott: I do have news.

303
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,150
Scott: So, here's some actual interesting thing, right?

304
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,510
Scott: Is that FIFA, who is known to be, the people who run soccer worldwide, have known to be wicked corrupt for a long time.

305
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,130
Scott: And their extreme corruption is bringing the World Cup to Qatar, or however you want to pronounce it, Qatar.

306
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:46,590
Rym: I say Qatar.

307
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,330
Scott: I say Qatar, but everyone else seems to be saying Qatar.

308
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,619
Scott: I don't really care.

309
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,246
Scott: Sorry, Qatar.

310
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:59,870
Scott: Anyway, so, yeah, there's all sorts of horrible slave labor type conditions to build soccer stadiums there.

311
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,658
Scott: And there's all kinds of other issues.

312
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,630
Scott: like no one can play soccer in a desert.

313
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,747
Scott: It would suck.

314
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,769
Scott: And you would probably just pass out on the field.

315
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,310
Scott: Because you had to play soccer for like 90 minutes straight without stopping.

316
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:14,250
Rym: Now, no one knew about this except people who pay attention to things in the world.

317
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,087
Rym: Until John Oliver was like, "Hey, look at

318
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:16,249
Rym: this.".

319
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,308
Scott: But that was like a year ago.

320
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,630
Scott: And the thing is, I knew about it even before then.

321
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,310
Rym: Well, because you pay attention to stuff.

322
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,730
Rym: Well, you pay attention to inconsequential stuff.

323
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,570
Scott: It's even more corrupt than the Olympic Committee.

324
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:32,668
Scott: So, the US, some justice department or whatever, actually was like, "We're going to go and get these corrupt FIFA

325
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:32,930
Scott: people.".

326
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:34,140
Scott: And they have a case on them.

327
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:35,109
Scott: But they had to get them.

328
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,770
Scott: Apparently, they were in Switzerland.

329
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,890
Scott: And Switzerland, despite usually not doing this kind of thing, arrested them in extraditism.

330
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,470
Rym: Actually, Switzerland will happily do it.

331
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,990
Rym: The only thing Switzerland won't extradite for, specifically with our treaty, is tax stuff.

332
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,291
Scott: Yep.

333
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,830
Scott: So, if you evade US taxes, you can go to Switzerland and they will not send you to the US.

334
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,330
Scott: Exactly.

335
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,490
Scott: You can just stay in Switzerland as long as your visa is there.

336
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,950
Rym: But if you run FIFA, they will totally send you back to the US.

337
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,512
Scott: Sure.

338
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:04,714
Scott: So, I guess they were having won at soccer enough recently to make them want to... But here's the thing.

339
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,990
Scott: Number one, they didn't go after the chief dude, Blatter.

340
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,309
Scott: It's like, why not?

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,830
Scott: And two, if you're so good at getting corrupt people, why didn't you just arrest every congressperson?

342
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:14,909
Scott: Because they're all corrupt.

343
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,248
Rym: Because the congresspeople are the ones...

344
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:18,386
Scott: At least 99% of them are.

345
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,808
Scott: Congresspeople didn't say, "Go start this investigation and arrest

346
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:24,110
Scott: FIFA."

347
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,450
Scott: They're not getting anything from this.

348
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:53,848
Rym: I actually think that this thing is going to be used by people as a campaign thing, because I think people in the US government have realized that, if shows like John Oliver's thing actually do rile people up, if you take the issues that don't affect you or your constituents in any way, and you risk nothing politically by acting on them in some fashion, or at least supporting or saying you support it in some fashion...

349
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,057
Scott: But this is just an action by police.

350
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,650
Scott: This is an action by any congressperson.

351
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,292
Rym: Who drove that?

352
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:00,735
Rym: Who started that?

353
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,690
Rym: Who's the person who started the investigation?

354
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:06,610
Scott: Pretty sure it's been going on for a while.

355
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,629
Scott: Probably going on longer before John Oliver said anything about it.

356
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:10,944
Scott: Maybe.

357
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,809
Scott: It takes a long time to build a case like that.

358
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,238
Rym: So let's see who ordered the report.

359
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,130
Rym: See who ordered the investigation.

360
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,370
Scott: I mean, someone's going after the congresspeople in New York State, too, right?

361
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,710
Scott: They've had like five corrupt people in a row going down or whatever.

362
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:34,509
Rym: Well, the problem in New York State is that we generally, in the US as a whole, we put the foxes in charge of henhouse security, and then we also put the foxes on the missing chicken investigation committee.

363
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,969
Scott: But it's like someone out there has the capability to find people who are guilty of bribes, corruption, etc.

364
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,769
Scott: Yeah, Batman.

365
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,036
Scott: And arrest them.

366
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,590
Scott: That person just did it.

367
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,370
Scott: So why doesn't that person who arrested FIFA arrest all the congresspeople?

368
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,950
Rym: Because they arrested foreigners and people who don't actually directly contribute to our bribe system.

369
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,889
Scott: But just do it anyway.

370
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:00,750
Scott: And then, like if I was, say, the Attorney General of the United States, I would do that.

371
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,750
Scott: And then I would run for president.

372
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:03,727
Scott: You know what happens, Scott?

373
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,546
Scott: Saying, "I put all the bad congresspeople in jail.

374
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:05,809
Scott: Vote for

375
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:05,890
Scott: me.".

376
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,717
Rym: You're going to run for president?

377
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,050
Rym: It's not going to work out like Dave.

378
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,529
Rym: It's going to work out like Bullworth.

379
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:10,470
Scott: That's fine.

380
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,840
Rym: You gotta be a spirit.

381
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:12,750
Rym: You can't be no ghost.

382
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,449
Scott: It'll be awesome.

383
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,890
Scott: Also, you know, even though I would go down, shit would be fixed, because all those corrupt people would be on the not-death row.

384
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,349
Scott: Or they'd be on the death row if they voted for it.

385
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,248
Rym: So one last thing.

386
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:29,149
Rym: If you live in New York, you probably know about Manhattanhenge, and if you don't, you might think this is a cool thing to do.

387
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:30,710
Scott: It's not cool.

388
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:37,350
Rym: There are some times in the year where the sunrise and sunset line up with these avenues on Manhattan Island.

389
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,662
Scott: This happens in other cities as well that have grid-like street structures and also tall buildings.

390
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,370
Scott: The sun will occasionally line up with the road.

391
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,190
Rym: Here's the problem.

392
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,608
Rym: Someone noticed this once a long time ago, and people were like, "Ooh,

393
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:53,869
Rym: cool.".

394
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,649
Rym: There's a few places in the city where you can get a really good view.

395
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,025
Rym: People would go and be like, "Oh, that was

396
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:58,269
Rym: cool.".

397
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,189
Rym: And then it became an internet thing.

398
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,650
Rym: And now, on those days, if you go to-- It's only twice a year, right?

399
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:03,830
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:19,689
Rym: If you go to Tudor City and tried it anywhere near one of those streets on these days, there's a million tourists fucking blocking the street and-- All these photography people lining up with tripods and shit that they don't have permits for.

401
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:20,579
Scott: And you know what?

402
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,290
Scott: Yeah, occasionally-- Like news trucks, people standing on top of the news truck with cameras.

403
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,030
Rym: Occasionally, you get a really good sunset.

404
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,130
Scott: Twice a year, everyone does this bullshit.

405
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,230
Rym: But it's not better than a normal awesome sunset.

406
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:33,430
Rym: The sunset is not really that different.

407
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,170
Rym: So, look at these pictures.

408
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,009
Rym: That is literally the best this event could ever be.

409
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,830
Rym: Never fucking come to this island and try to look at it yourself in person, I swear.

410
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,404
Scott: People are starting to be like, "Oh, go to Queens and look across the whole

411
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:45,866
Scott: island.".

412
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:46,681
Scott: Yeah.

413
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,470
Scott: Why don't you go to Jersey and watch the sun rise?

414
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,248
Scott: No one's doing that.

415
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:51,610
Scott: Right?

416
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,350
Scott: Yeah, because you don't want to go to Jersey, do you?

417
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:04,220
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

418
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:05,659
Rym: Got a thing?

419
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,600
Scott: It's the simplest thing, but the quality is so high.

420
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,480
Scott: This man is excellent at imitating various animals.

421
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,480
Scott: Watch this video and listen to him imitate the noises various animals make in an expert fashion.

422
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,959
Scott: I applaud you, good sir.

423
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,560
Rym: I'm glad this man has almost a million views.

424
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,258
Rym: I'm very happy for this man.

425
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,760
Scott: He deserves more than his million views.

426
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,939
Scott: Let's give him some more views.

427
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,540
Rym: So, right now, the Stanley Cup is in its final stages.

428
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:31,800
Scott: No, it's not.

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,339
Scott: It's one game away from its final stage.

430
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,499
Rym: There is two stages left.

431
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,878
Scott: There's eight stages.

432
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,020
Scott: Final stages.

433
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,619
Scott: Potentially eight stages left.

434
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:49,620
Rym: The next two teams to win a game of hockey go on to the Stanley Cup, and the next team to win five games wins Lord Stanley's Cup.

435
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,400
Rym: One of the teams that is do or die in getting into the final four win set is the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.

436
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,113
Scott: Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, we're the Mighty Ducks of

437
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:01,657
Scott: Anaheim.".

438
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,998
Rym: So, you might be thinking to yourself, "Hey, wasn't that a Disney

439
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:06,299
Rym: movie?".

440
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,919
Rym: It was two Disney movies.

441
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,520
Scott: It was more than two, wasn't it?

442
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,619
Scott: Three or four Disney movies?

443
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:11,278
Rym: I don't know.

444
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:12,279
Scott: It was many Disney movies.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,920
Rym: I saw the first two movies in the theater.

446
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,958
Rym: I'll say that.

447
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,588
Scott: Whoa.

448
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:17,252
Rym: You didn't see D2?

449
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,240
Scott: I saw them at home.

450
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,620
Rym: I saw Mighty Ducks in the theater.

451
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,120
Scott: Blockbuster or some shit.

452
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:29,700
Rym: The plot of D2 is they all forgot how to skate and hockey inexplicably the next year.

453
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:30,438
Scott: Pretty much.

454
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:37,159
Rym: So, you might think like, "Well, wouldn't it be funny if the Ducks of Anaheim were named after the

455
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:37,480
Rym: movie?".

456
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,179
Rym: Well, they are.

457
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,679
Scott: They were.

458
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
Scott: They didn't exist until very recently.

459
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,278
Rym: They were created what, '92?

460
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:42,960
Scott: They're owned by Disney.

461
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:43,640
Scott: Disney owns it.

462
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:44,742
Rym: I think '92.

463
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:45,930
Rym: that was set up in the expansion.

464
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,480
Scott: Yeah, the NHL made expansion teams.

465
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,339
Scott: They said, "Hey, we're making brand new teams.

466
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:51,911
Scott: People can

467
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:52,097
Scott: buy."

468
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,180
Scott: And Disney bought one and named it the Ducks.

469
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,019
Rym: So, Disney made a hockey team.

470
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,239
Scott: Unapologetically.

471
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,424
Rym: Called the Mighty Ducks.

472
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:01,072
Rym: that actually had a pretty good mascot, which then they changed it.

473
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:03,480
Rym: so it's not that awesome Disney mascot they used to have.

474
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Rym: But their first game in 1993, the first game that this hockey team played.

475
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,758
Rym: This is a team that has a chance to win Lord Stanley's Cup this year.

476
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:27,040
Rym: Put forth in an actual hockey game on the ice for a live audience for 15 fucking minutes this shameless and ridiculous display.

477
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,200
Scott: It's basically Disney on Ice.

478
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,139
Scott: It's Disney on Ice.

479
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,900
Scott: It's right near Disneyland so plenty of performers are available to do this.

480
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,999
Rym: But it's, what's his name?

481
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,560
Rym: The Candelabra from Beauty and the Beast.

482
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:38,400
Scott: That was what was hot at the time.

483
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,175
Scott: Skating around.

484
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,480
Scott: That was what Disney was doing when this team was created.

485
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,080
Rym: They rewrote a bunch of Disney songs to have derpy lyrics about dreams of power plays.

486
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,060
Scott: Because they only bought the team to promote Disney shit.

487
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,860
Scott: They didn't, right?

488
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,019
Scott: That was the original intent.

489
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,340
Rym: Some Gary Glitter and a weird albino guy trying to pump up the crowd.

490
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,580
Rym: And this is amazing to see.

491
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,160
Rym: So Anaheim Mighty Ducks, all I say to you and fans of your team is to remember your shame.

492
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,480
Scott: Well this is why New York sports teams are the best.

493
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,780
Scott: Even ones I hate, like the Yankees, well I guess the Jets are shameless.

494
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,720
Scott: But even the Yankees, if you go to a Yankees game, there's no mascots, there's no dancing homo, there's no bullshit.

495
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,139
Scott: You go there and you're there to watch the fucking game.

496
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,760
Scott: You cheer at the game, you boo at the game.

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,304
Rym: What about Mr.

498
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:27,131
Rym: Met over at the Mets?

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,424
Rym: Mr.

500
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:29,338
Scott: Met is special.

501
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,260
Scott: Even Philadelphia, who I hate the most, the Philly Phanatic, gets an exception as well.

502
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,414
Scott: Because the Philly Phanatic is perhaps, while it pains me to say it, the most talented and quality.

503
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,740
Scott: Jim Henson designed mascot.

504
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:46,857
Scott: And most talented, etc.

505
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:48,665
Scott: Except Mr.

506
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,100
Scott: Met, who just bashed his head in with a baseball anyway.

507
00:26:54,582 --> 00:27:00,560
Scott: All that kind of performance distraction shit, they call it fan appreciation stuff in the business.

508
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:09,120
Scott: Because you run a sports team, especially a baseball team, people come to your games, they might not be a big, huge fan.

509
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,280
Scott: And baseball is pretty boring, especially compared to other sports.

510
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Scott: They're gonna be pretty bored if all you have is baseball.

511
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:23,060
Scott: So you need all this shit to keep kids entertained, to make it seem like a family-friendly place, and your team is losing and the game is meaningless, why would you come here?

512
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,080
Scott: Kids come with birthday parties, right?

513
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,939
Scott: So you do a bunch of bullshit to spice it up.

514
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,520
Scott: And mostly people do that bullshit at minor league sports.

515
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,140
Scott: Because minor league sports, nobody gives any fucks at all.

516
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,160
Scott: Look at this barren field of fucks that they give.

517
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,893
Scott: It is empty, low, right?

518
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,379
Scott: So you need even more fan appreciation shit.

519
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:52,126
Scott: At a New York Rangers game, where every ticket is 100% sold out and costs $1500 because someone cares that much about hockey, you don't gotta do shit.

520
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,178
Scott: No ice girls, no nothing.

521
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,260
Scott: No bands, no mascots, no nonsense.

522
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:01,300
Scott: Just play fucking hockey, we're gonna watch it.

523
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:13,539
Rym: Anyway, to move on, watch this, remember it, and remember that in the modern era, big companies, when they do a thing, we expect really high production values, and we usually get them.

524
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,840
Rym: This has really low production values, and it's from the end of that era.

525
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,200
Scott: The production value looks lower than you think it is, because A, the technology of the 90s is lower.

526
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,220
Rym: No, you didn't watch it.

527
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,220
Scott: The camera quality is lower.

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Rym: No, forget it, I'm not talking about any of that stuff.

529
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,800
Rym: The quality of the skating, the quality of the choreography, on that level, it's really sad.

530
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:43,460
Rym: The albino guy who climbs up on the Zamboni, he kinda can't even do it, and he can barely work up the crowd.

531
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,420
Rym: He's not better than the kinds of people who emcee the cosplot at a convention.

532
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,780
Scott: Well, I mean, someone who gets a job doing the, I don't know, what's the bear hoedown thing at Disney World, right?

533
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:02,440
Scott: I mean, that person can sing and dance better than we can, but if they were really good, they wouldn't be there.

534
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,640
Rym: Yeah, but they might be on the ice at a hockey game.

535
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:19,800
Rym: Just, in general, when you watch things from the 80s and 90s that were live performances, there's this impression that they did it for the audience at the time and never expected that people would know about or watch it again.

536
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:29,219
Rym: And the science and the craft of making really crass advertising things has gotten way better in the last 20 years.

537
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,559
Scott: Uh, sure, whatever you say.

538
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:36,839
Rym: Yeah, look at the production values of some publicity stunt now compared to one from the 80s or 90s.

539
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,859
Scott: Looks the same crass shit to me.

540
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,836
Rym: Yeah, but it's more well-crafted crass shit.

541
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,598
Scott: Sure, if you say so.

542
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,128
Rym: It's definitely better done.

543
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,499
Rym: It works better, probably, too.

544
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,414
Rym: In the meantime, we are back on iTunes.

545
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:50,260
Rym: Go subscribe.

546
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,802
Rym: Also, review us on iTunes, because the last reviews are from, like, 2006.

547
00:29:57,802 --> 00:29:59,920
Rym: Because no one uses iTunes anymore, apparently.

548
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,391
Scott: Alright, well now it is a very important time.

549
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,600
Scott: There's a very important meta moment happening, right?

550
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,560
Scott: Our long-running yearly book club episode is happening.

551
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,348
Rym: Wow, yeah, I guess you... God, what book did we read?

552
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,471
Rym: How long has it been?

553
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,655
Rym: When did we announce this book?

554
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:16,600
Rym: Like, eight months ago?

555
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:17,860
Scott: It was too long.

556
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,660
Rym: I can find out exactly.

557
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,040
Scott: Well, when we discuss the book, we'll discuss why it took so long to read.

558
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,378
Rym: I guess you just can't read?

559
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:36,059
Rym: Okay, September... no, October 20th, 2014 is when we announced this.

560
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:38,926
Rym: So, not a year.

561
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,920
Rym: Didn't take a full year for you to read this book about rabbits.

562
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:43,040
Scott: Okay.

563
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,939
Rym: But it took you a long time, from October to the end of May.

564
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,320
Scott: Now, there are many reasons that it took that long, but I finished it today because I was on vacation.

565
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,938
Rym: Great, let's see if I even remember it.

566
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:54,779
Rym: Get this out of the way.

567
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,459
Rym: Because I read it, like, a week after we announced it.

568
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,700
Scott: But more importantly, there is the next book club now that you may begin.

569
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:04,760
Rym: Oh, yes.

570
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:13,000
Scott: So, I was hanging out in a Barnes & Noble because I had to go to mentoring near Union Square and I had to kill some time between work and... right?

571
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,075
Scott: So, I was walking around the nerd book section, looking at the nerd books.

572
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:18,219
Scott: You know, like you do.

573
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,265
Scott: Not buying any.

574
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,200
Scott: Maybe taking a picture of one or two for Amazon.

575
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,556
Scott: Yeah.

576
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:26,176
Scott: I think I saw that Patrick Rothfuss had a new horrible book of some kind.

577
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:27,440
Scott: I took a picture, sent it to Rym.

578
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,651
Scott: Like, "Hey, did you know this

579
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:29,077
Scott: existed?".

580
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:34,760
Scott: And I was looking around and, of course, there's a big old display for the Games of Thrones, right?

581
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,619
Scott: And I'm sitting there thinking about the Games of Thrones and I'm like, "Eh, this is really popular lately, but I've known about this way before it was

582
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:42,040
Scott: popular.".

583
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,580
Scott: Because I've been hanging out in nerd book sections of borders in Barnes & Noble for, you know, since high school, right?

584
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:57,900
Scott: And there are many, many series of fantasy novels that are in the section of nerd books and sci-fi novels that are ridiculously big and nerds know about them.

585
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:06,400
Scott: But apparently non-nerds didn't know about Games of Thrones until a TV show existed, even though I knew and didn't care about it forever and still don't care about it.

586
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,879
Scott: But that's the way it goes.

587
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:16,898
Scott: So then I start looking around and I'm seeing all these other fantasy series that are pretty much in the same spot that Games of Thrones was in before.

588
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:17,780
Scott: there was a TV show.

589
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,784
Scott: Like, I know about it.

590
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:20,647
Scott: I know about it.

591
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:21,970
Scott: All nerds know about it.

592
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,120
Scott: It's a big time nerd series, right, that's super famous among nerds.

593
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,204
Scott: But normal people give no fucks.

594
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:29,087
Scott: They don't even know.

595
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:29,668
Scott: it's a thing.

596
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,960
Scott: If a TV show was made about it, it would probably be a big fucking deal, right?

597
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:45,280
Scott: And I'm like, huh, you know what, despite me knowing about most of these fucking things, right, and they're being super notable and whatnot, I really haven't read most of them, right?

598
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,849
Scott: I'm reading Prince of Nothing, which isn't even known among the nerds, right?

599
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,593
Scott: I'm not reading, I don't know.

600
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,240
Scott: Alex usually reads most of them, right?

601
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:56,924
Scott: So then I'm like, well, you know what, I need another book club book.

602
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:10,380
Scott: What is the biggest and most famous of these that I have not read and as a nerd probably should have read at least some of, at least one page of, right?

603
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,507
Scott: Because, I mean, I've read more than one page of Harry Potter.

604
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:16,600
Scott: That's probably the first one, but that one's known by non-nerds, so it doesn't count, right?

605
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,467
Scott: What is the one that is where Game of Thrones was?

606
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,171
Scott: Now, I found that one.

607
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:24,580
Scott: It was very easy to find after walking around for about two seconds.

608
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,435
Scott: And I said, do I really have to, is that, as soon as I saw it, I was like, that's the one.

609
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:32,180
Scott: There's no question that that's the one.

610
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,900
Scott: But then I looked at it and I said, I really don't want to pick this because it has a problem.

611
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,239
Rym: Uh, what kind of problem does it have?

612
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,050
Scott: It has a problem of many pages.

613
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,700
Scott: The many page problem.

614
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,199
Rym: You give me shit about Dumas, you bring this garbage to me?

615
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:50,171
Scott: It has a Dumas level of pages, in fact.

616
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,160
Scott: I don't know if it's quite Dumas level of pages.

617
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,080
Scott: And I said, man, I really don't want to read that many pages.

618
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,086
Scott: But at the same time, there was an equal force.

619
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:04,100
Scott: that said, but you're a nerd person, you must know what is written on at least the first book of these pages.

620
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:05,025
Scott: At least.

621
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,820
Scott: Otherwise, what kind of nerd are you?

622
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:15,520
Rym: Yeah, cause I totally in no way regret reading the, uh, Kingkiller Chronicle, Captain Nice Guy's penis adventures through sex land, the fedora legacy.

623
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:23,860
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter because if you have not guessed it already, I have selected for whatever consequence may befall me for making the selection.

624
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:24,858
Rym: Hop on pop.

625
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,583
Scott: I'm going to do it anyway.

626
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:32,159
Scott: The book club selection is, dun dun dun dun dun dun, you're going to insert a drum noise?

627
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:42,974
Scott: The first book of Robert Jordan's wheel of time, the eye of the world.

628
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,076
Scott: It is 782 pages long.

629
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:50,000
Scott: It is the most famous of nerd book series.

630
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,210
Rym: There's a heron blade.

631
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,159
Rym: I know that.

632
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,973
Scott: I don't know what that is, but I don't care.

633
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:54,880
Scott: Is it like a heron spear?

634
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,560
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

635
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:00,548
Rym: Here's what I know, Scott.

636
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:04,660
Rym: I do not think you or I will like that book.

637
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,523
Scott: That is fine.

638
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,854
Scott: It is so famous and nerdy that it must be done.

639
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,440
Scott: We don't have to read the whole thing.

640
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:19,620
Rym: The rationale for that is that one, most of my friends in high school who really liked this book were insufferable human beings.

641
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:20,900
Scott: Uh, that's possibly true.

642
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:27,700
Rym: And the people I knew in high school who were chill told me these books were bullshit and I shouldn't read them.

643
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,295
Scott: I believe it.

644
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:30,539
Rym: This is what you're doing to me.

645
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,578
Scott: That's what I'm doing.

646
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,780
Rym: I'm pretty sure one of our friends was recently talking about like misogyny in these books too.

647
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,465
Scott: I believe it.

648
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:37,860
Scott: Why shouldn't I?

649
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,900
Rym: Okay, I don't see the word misogyny in the Wikipedia page.

650
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,079
Scott: Why shouldn't I believe it?

651
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,410
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,160
Scott: But it is a ridiculously famous and popular series of nerd books.

653
00:35:47,743 --> 00:35:47,944
Rym: Great.

654
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,999
Rym: Now we get to learn all about Tellaronryoid.

655
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,245
Scott: We only have to read the first one.

656
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:57,540
Scott: We don't have to read any of the other ones unless for some reason our expectation is different.

657
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,936
Rym: Scott, it's 300 and something pages.

658
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:01,740
Rym: Well, it's book zero.

659
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,428
Scott: Book zero is not the one.

660
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,540
Scott: It is book one.

661
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,060
Scott: 782 pages.

662
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,069
Scott: That is the one.

663
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,859
Scott: What is the name of it?

664
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,760
Rym: The Eye of the World.

665
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,063
Scott: That's the one.

666
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,960
Scott: It's time to read Wheel of Time.

667
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,020
Rym: Scott, I spent my whole life up to this point knowing this book existed and actively avoiding reading it.

668
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,902
Scott: There you go.

669
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,249
Scott: That makes it even better.

670
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,460
Scott: We can give Rym a taste of his own medicine.

671
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,020
Scott: What medicine have I, what book have I ever suggested that wasn't good?

672
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,280
Scott: The medicine is Rym finds out that something annoys you and then he repeatedly does it even though you tell him to stop.

673
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,378
Scott: So you're trying to avoid this book, I'll make you read it.

674
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:41,920
Scott: Even though I might have to suffer as well.

675
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,079
Rym: You might indeed because it's been a while since I visited my friend LeCompte.

676
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,437
Rym: LeCompte de Monte Cristo.

677
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,420
Rym: And his magical revenge machine.

678
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,360
Scott: And also, we keep picking books for Book Club that we, you know, at least one of us likes, right?

679
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,440
Scott: That has some positive quality to it that is known in advance.

680
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,960
Rym: Yeah, like the Kingkiller Chronicle was so positive.

681
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,859
Scott: I'm just saying.

682
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,679
Rym: Wait, you picked that one too, right?

683
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,620
Scott: Uh, for a similar reason.

684
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:10,020
Rym: That reason is not panned out so well.

685
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,824
Scott: No, it hasn't.

686
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:14,020
Scott: If it doesn't pan out again, it'll be the last time I ever use that reason.

687
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,540
Rym: Because the only thing I can say about the Kingkiller Chronicles, had I not read the second book, I would have still thought of it as an okay fantasy book.

688
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,160
Rym: The second one confirmed all my suspicions.

689
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Scott: I bought the second one and didn't read it thanks to your warding away of danger.

690
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,104
Rym: But then you don't see him.

691
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:31,899
Rym: go to the land of the gods and seduce the goddess of sex.

692
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:33,058
Scott: I don't need that.

693
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,800
Rym: Yeah, but that is a minor bump on his journey.

694
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:45,240
Scott: Also, I've looked at the covers of these Wheel of Time books, and there are way more dragons and swords and that sort of action.

695
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,960
Rym: They look exactly like the covers to all the Forgotten Realms books.

696
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,180
Scott: Right, kings and wizards and all that good shit.

697
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:53,919
Scott: So, Kingkiller Chronicles didn't have enough of that.

698
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:54,669
Rym: Yeah.

699
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,700
Scott: It had more wizard school and less kings and emperors and wars and shit.

700
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,968
Rym: What about The Prince of Nothing?

701
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,600
Rym: It's just a picture of a guy, usually.

702
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:06,420
Scott: Yeah, that doesn't have enough wizarding and dragoning either.

703
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,879
Scott: I mean, it has some, but not enough.

704
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:13,760
Rym: A couple days ago, I looked online to see if ArtScout Backer has any progress on the next book.

705
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,400
Rym: And I noticed that someone had linked to me a while ago that there's a wiki about The Prince of Nothing.

706
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:20,420
Rym: Like, a really good one.

707
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,620
Scott: Yeah, it's been there for a long time.

708
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,600
Rym: And I never actually went to it, but they'd warn me, "There's derpy art there, but don't look at

709
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,660
Rym: it.".

710
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,214
Scott: There is, yep.

711
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,678
Rym: So, I went there yesterday, and I saw that art.

712
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:34,698
Rym: Oh, my gosh.

713
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
Rym: That makes Wesnoth look like a triple-A game.

714
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,440
Scott: Well, Wesnoth has improved a lot since you've played it.

715
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,293
Rym: All right, Wesnoth from the early 2000s.

716
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,473
Rym: Good guy.

717
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:52,080
Scott: All right, so, let's talk about the not watery, the dry up ship.

718
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,601
Rym: What?

719
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,165
Rym: Watership down?

720
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,220
Rym: They literally, they get on a ship in the water.

721
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:55,977
Scott: They do.

722
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:01,520
Rym: That is like, you think, you know, a book that has a name like that, like, you don't really think about it too much.

723
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:06,180
Rym: And then literally, like, the climax of the book is just that.

724
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,592
Scott: Yup.

725
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,680
Scott: I mean, I saw that coming, anyway.

726
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,700
Rym: If you have not listened to the GeekNights Book Club before, we're going to spoil the book.

727
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
Scott: We haven't done one in a while, it's understandable.

728
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,140
Rym: We are assumed, the point of the book club is that you already read the book.

729
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,760
Scott: You've got to be in the club, which means you've read the book.

730
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,880
Scott: If you haven't read the book, you're not in the club, so why are you here?

731
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,680
Rym: So, we're not going to waste any time explaining what happens in the book, telling you who the characters are.

732
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:34,720
Rym: You probably read the book like eight months ago, like I did, and you might forget who Clover was or something.

733
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,040
Rym: But, we're reviewing the book, not the movie, not the TV show.

734
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,099
Scott: I didn't even watch the movie, I didn't even know there was a TV show.

735
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,040
Rym: Yeah, the movie apparently is really good.

736
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:44,814
Scott: It might be.

737
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:52,720
Rym: It's one of those animated movies that's sitting on the shelf, it's like, Disney playtime, Armageddon, plague dogs, this.

738
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,920
Rym: It's one of those movies that parents would get for kids and not realize is actually pretty serious and scary.

739
00:39:58,223 --> 00:39:59,760
Scott: Like Fern Gully, but even more.

740
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,080
Rym: Well, way more.

741
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,900
Rym: I mean, you read this book, like imagine that animated, like all that violence and death.

742
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,578
Scott: Like straight up?

743
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:05,952
Scott: Yeah.

744
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:06,580
Scott: Oh, nice.

745
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:15,260
Rym: In fact, the movie kind of takes it a little more violent and bloody, and you get a lot of animations of Fiverr's terrifying visions.

746
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,140
Rym: So, I picked this book, one, because Emily and I have rabbits now, and I know a lot about rabbits that I did not- If you had pet mice, were you going to pick Redwall?

747
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:27,500
Rym: I'm not a fan of- Mouseguard?

748
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:42,919
Rym: The most important thing to think about, why Watership Down I think is interesting to pick as a book club book, and why I think nerds and people in general should read it, is that a lot of people do stories of animals, but they're anthropomorphized- Like Mouseguard.

749
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,959
Rym: Yeah, like Mouseguard.

750
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,359
Scott: Not that Mouseguard is bad, it's amazing, but- It is amazing, but there's a lot of that.

751
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,260
Rym: But Watership Down, they're just rabbits.

752
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:00,040
Rym: Other than making up a drama and dialogue, they don't do anything that rabbits could not do.

753
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:08,110
Scott: Right, this is the thing about this book that I think is the most positive thing about it, is that somehow it has- Who's calling me now?

754
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:09,019
Scott: You can't call me now.

755
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,000
Scott: On the one hand, it's a fantasy novel, right?

756
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,120
Rym: Yep, it's a hero's journey.

757
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,719
Scott: It's a straight up fantasy novel.

758
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,500
Rym: Well, it's a hero's journey or a stranger comes to town, depending on what direction you're looking.

759
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,640
Scott: It follows the same sort of plot structure of fantasy novel.

760
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:31,360
Scott: There's the kingdoms, and there's wars, and there's adventures, and there's heroes, and battles, and all these kinds of things.

761
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,180
Scott: On the other hand, it's totally straight up real biology of rabbits.

762
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:46,780
Scott: You learn how rabbits actually do, real rabbits actually do in the wild, and they frequently explore and make plot points of true facts about rabbits.

763
00:41:46,920 --> 00:42:08,440
Scott: Like, yeah, rabbits, this is how they make babies, and this is how they eat, and this is the kind of things they like, and only the lady rabbits dig, and a rabbit that was taken care of as a pet is not really good to go out in the wild, and all these things actually matter for the plot, and you learn about rabbits at the same time, and if you already know about rabbits, the fact that those things are true is sort of like, ooh, they incorporated this thing I know.

764
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,380
Rym: It also means, it doesn't explain everything.

765
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,039
Scott: Sort of like when you read a book about something involving computers, and the computer parts are actually true, like, ooh, SSH, it's real.

766
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,840
Rym: But also, knowing a lot about rabbits, there's other things you can read into and pick up on that aren't necessarily apparent.

767
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,239
Rym: Lots of neat little stuff.

768
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:36,420
Rym: And it's pretty real, too, like the one rabbit, when they escape on the ship at the end, gets hit on the back just because they go into that bridge, and she just dies because that happens to rabbits.

769
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,600
Scott: Yeah, they were going pretty fast in the stormy river.

770
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:50,640
Scott: I mean, if I was on a boat, think about you're in a little rowboat going down a river, it's raining, it's going kind of fast, there's a bridge, right, you duck, and the top of the bridge hits you in the back, that's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

771
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,120
Scott: And if you're a little, tiny, weak, tiny rabbit, that's not good.

772
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,538
Rym: Yeah, but it's interesting, too, how the story has, like, when they're traveling.

773
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:06,620
Rym: in the beginning, the book does a good job of making it seem like an extreme distance, an extreme amount of time.

774
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,140
Scott: Well, occasionally they reference real locations in the real world.

775
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,959
Rym: Oh, it's set in a real place.

776
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:17,100
Scott: Right, so if you know those locations, You can go look up a map of, like, Then you'll see exactly how far it is, and it's not that far.

777
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,780
Rym: Like, here's a picture of Nuthanger Farm.

778
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,738
Scott: Like, it's maybe three miles, right?

779
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,520
Rym: That's the farm, right there.

780
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,820
Scott: Like, the distance I think, I think I should say in the book, the distance between Watership Down and Efrefras, or whatever it is, is like three miles.

781
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,639
Scott: So, not too far.

782
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:39,496
Rym: It also does a good job of doing the proper noun stuff, because there is a fine line between "here are proper nouns" and...

783
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:43,400
Scott: Okay, well, actually, you know, I mean, it does an okay job, right?

784
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:44,500
Scott: So, in terms of...

785
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,997
Rym: It's not Tolkien.

786
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,740
Scott: Right, in terms of proper nouns, they use proper nouns the way a fantasy novel does, which is cool.

787
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:55,600
Scott: And they also use proper nouns to refer to things that the rabbits see but don't know, right?

788
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:02,199
Scott: So, like, the rabbits don't know what a train is, and they don't know what train tracks are, so that's the iron road, right?

789
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:07,740
Scott: Or, you know, the sun, they don't know about the sun, or the fact that it's a star, right?

790
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,900
Scott: So it's Frith is the sun, right?

791
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,300
Rym: Yep, they have their mythology.

792
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,460
Scott: Right, there's a rabbit mythology, which is awesome.

793
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:24,520
Scott: But, on the other hand, you know, the positive part about that is it brings you into the world of the rabbit, where it's, like, things the rabbits know and things the rabbits don't know, which is good.

794
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:28,855
Scott: But, when the rabbit says "iron road," well, how does a rabbit know iron?

795
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:30,080
Scott: and has a rabbit know road?

796
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,979
Scott: If you're a pet ant, it's gonna bother you.

797
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,460
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, I think that was partly because, like, the author is very open.

798
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:49,800
Rym: Unlike a lot of books we might talk about, the author of Watership Down was 100% open about how the book was written, why he wrote it, who he got to help him do his research, like, when he learned about rabbits, everything.

799
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,940
Scott: So, you can pretty much say-- Wasn't a rabbit person to begin with who knew all this stuff, right?

800
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,440
Rym: Well, yeah, he knew a little bit, but he got some people to give him, like, check stuff out-- Feels like a rabbit expert advising, yeah.

801
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,992
Scott: This book was only written in the '70s.

802
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,879
Scott: It wasn't that long ago.

803
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:03,220
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:03,939
Scott: It's not that old.

805
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,521
Rym: You know, that's the thing.

806
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:11,480
Rym: It's not that old, and yet, it seems like a lot of people we know, especially artists, really, really, really strongly remember this book.

807
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,920
Scott: Well, I mean, I put it on the same level in terms of popularity in our culture as, like, Last Unicorn, right?

808
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:21,800
Scott: I hear about it pretty much, like, just as often in nerd circles.

809
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:29,540
Scott: So, you know, I sort of pair them together because they both have, you know, animals, and they're both bugs with movies.

810
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,682
Rym: I guess what I thought the language did.

811
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:43,460
Rym: well, like, you're right, the iron thing, but at the same time, the author, like, Richard Adams was really clever in this one point that the whole book is from the perspective of the rabbits, and it's done-- Not the whole book.

812
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Scott: Well, yeah, you get-- There are chapters here and there from different perspectives.

813
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:52,509
Scott: You get the outside perspective of, like, what the doctor did at the end and all that, but-- You get other perspectives in a chapter here and there.

814
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,596
Scott: Wasn't there a bird chapter also, maybe?

815
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:55,860
Scott: I'm trying to remember.

816
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:57,939
Rym: Do you remember any character's names?

817
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,060
Rym: I'm curious about that because you just read this book.

818
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,600
Scott: I remember-- Well, yeah, I just read it today.

819
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:02,739
Scott: I read it eight months ago.

820
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:10,820
Scott: I mean, most of the character's names are, like, not human names, like, Hazel's the main rabbit, and then, like, the thing is, some characters have multiple names, right?

821
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:17,240
Scott: Like, Bigwig, he has, like, two other names that he has, right, which sort of also mean the same thing, you know?

822
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:33,420
Scott: So it's, like, characters in multiple names, and then there's the best character, which is the, basically, Rabbit Moses, or Rabbit Hercules, or Rabbit King David, which is L-R-I-R-R-I-R-A, who's the best dude.

823
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,032
Scott: Really, I just wanted to hear about him.

824
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:36,040
Scott: I didn't care about the other rabbit.

825
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:42,420
Rym: Well, you did hear about him because the whole story is the creation of another myth of L-R-I-R-R-A.

826
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,119
Scott: Obviously.

827
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,943
Rym: Emily yells at me.

828
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:46,399
Rym: I pronounce that differently every time I look at it.

829
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:54,320
Scott: Well, okay, so if you look in the book, right, his name is basically, like, he is hated by the thousand, right?

830
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,520
Scott: So, for example, the rabbits will often end each other's names with Ra, right?

831
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,620
Scott: So, like, Hazel, they'll call other rabbits will be, like, Hazel Ra, right?

832
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,075
Scott: So L-R-I-R-I-R-A, they end it with Ra, right?

833
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,079
Scott: So Ra goes at the end.

834
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:13,700
Scott: Elil is the word they use to refer to the thousand enemies of rabbits, right?

835
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:18,780
Scott: And the middle part, the Arara part, it means thousand, right?

836
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,640
Scott: So it's like, oh no, they're hated, I think, whatever.

837
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,140
Scott: So it's like Elil, right, Herrera, Ra, so something like that.

838
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,000
Scott: It's a combination of three words together fast, so it's hard to say, and the way they spell it is not make it easy.

839
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:44,080
Rym: But notice the structure of how we've got the story of, like, a clever rabbit who sort of picked up on something being wrong and decided to go do something different.

840
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:45,020
Scott: That clever rabbit.

841
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:52,177
Scott: Because that's where a lot of the rabbit stories that are in this book are really just rabbits.

842
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:55,020
Scott: so clever, and that's the best part, because it's like Bugs Bunny.

843
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,444
Scott: But then look at what the story is.

844
00:47:56,504 --> 00:48:02,520
Rym: The stories all kind of blur together, and it's like this historical spoken word narrative.

845
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,380
Scott: Prince Rainbow.

846
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:13,080
Rym: So you've got this cycle of history, this oration, this oratory history that they pass down, you know, rabbit to rabbit over time.

847
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,858
Rym: They don't write things down, except for the cult rabbits a little bit.

848
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:25,540
Rym: So Fiverr and Hazel together, especially Hazel, Hazel does clever things and totally wins in the end.

849
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:31,880
Rym: And you see that he's inspired by these stories that their storyteller tells and that he knows and remembered by heart.

850
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:38,620
Rym: But at the same time, it's pretty obvious that rabbits have very short lives, and he lived way longer than most rabbits in the end.

851
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,720
Rym: And individual rabbits get forgotten very quickly.

852
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,620
Scott: They don't have writing, they only have an oral tradition.

853
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,120
Scott: So it's making a big statement about what humanity was like when we only had an oral tradition, right?

854
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:59,620
Scott: All the clever rabbits that have ever existed, basically all their stories get exaggerated, simplified, and they basically all just become El Harira, whatever.

855
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:02,008
Scott: No one's going to remember Hazel.

856
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,500
Scott: All the stories of Hazel are going to be stories of El Harira.

857
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,445
Rym: Yep, exactly.

858
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:07,320
Rym: So every clever rabbit becomes El Harira.

859
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,280
Scott: That I'm going to pronounce differently every single time.

860
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,654
Rym: But also, it was done very cleverly.

861
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:15,960
Rym: So all the stories... You know how we anthropomorphize animals?

862
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:22,220
Rym: I'm amazed that Adams was able to lapinomorphize other stuff.

863
00:49:22,722 --> 00:49:26,399
Rym: Remember the story about the king who was evil or whatever?

864
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,560
Rym: And how he had all the lettuces and how the lettuces were the important treasure?

865
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,780
Rym: It's like the rabbits describe what other people do in rabbit terms.

866
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,352
Rym: Like lettuces, of course, that's the valuable thing.

867
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:37,915
Rym: Not gold.

868
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:38,759
Rym: Lettuces.

869
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,960
Scott: What does gold do to a rabbit?

870
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,994
Rym: That's like us and Redwall, the mice stealing gold from something.

871
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:45,360
Rym: We anthropomorphize them.

872
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:52,440
Rym: But Adams so consistently kept that perspective when he was looking through the eyes of the rabbits.

873
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:59,100
Rym: I was really surprised by how cleverly and well done that specific aspect was.

874
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,260
Rym: Everything was in terms of rabbits.

875
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:04,264
Scott: Yep.

876
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:08,940
Scott: So the reason it took me so long to read this book is because, A, shit was going down.

877
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,439
Rym: For eight months.

878
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,343
Scott: For a long time.

879
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:14,800
Scott: So I didn't have a lot of time for reading or ways to prioritize reading.

880
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:27,840
Scott: But more so, it's like while the book is not bad, it is good, there are many things I like about it, it lacked that thing that other books have where you read it and you just need to keep reading.

881
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,451
Scott: Oh my gosh.

882
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:28,820
Scott: Right?

883
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:41,359
Scott: It's like if I get a Prince of Nothing book, at least all the ones so far, you read some and it's like, even though you know you're going to fall asleep and close your eyes in this chapter and you're not going to be able to finish it, you can't help but continue reading.

884
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:46,240
Scott: This book, I would read a chapter and I'd be like, while I was reading it, I'd be like, alright, alright.

885
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,859
Scott: I wasn't upset or being like, this sucks, I hate this.

886
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,200
Scott: But I'd close my Kindle and put it there and there would be no urge to go pick it up again.

887
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,060
Scott: There would be no, like, when I got in bed the next day, I just completely forgot about it.

888
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,819
Scott: I'd just grab my DS instead or something.

889
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:05,319
Rym: It didn't have the grabbyness.

890
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:06,340
Rym: One, I have rabbits.

891
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Scott: Because I didn't care too much about the characters.

892
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:18,400
Rym: One of our rabbits, I think of him a lot like Hazel because Moogie, the brown one, he's sort of like cautious but also clever.

893
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:29,080
Rym: So he's the one where in the morning, I go out to get lettuces and things, and he'll be hiding near the door to be ready to sneak out into the hall.

894
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,900
Rym: He's always trying to bust into stuff and get into things and mess around.

895
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:33,979
Rym: So rabbits do.

896
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:38,800
Rym: So I was reading the book and I look up and I got a little rabbit right there doing rabbit-y things.

897
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:41,880
Rym: So I think that pushed me to just read a lot faster.

898
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,171
Rym: And two, the book's a really fast read.

899
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:45,860
Rym: so I read the whole thing in a few days.

900
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,422
Scott: I mean, I did.

901
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:50,119
Scott: I pretty much read probably the last 80% of the book yesterday and today.

902
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:54,820
Scott: Well, maybe 60% but still, yeah, it's a very fast read.

903
00:51:55,842 --> 00:52:04,940
Scott: But whenever I got to the parts where they were telling a story about El Herrera and the cabbages and whatever, that part was a part that was very grabby.

904
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,400
Scott: I had to keep reading and I basically never stopped in the middle of any of those stories.

905
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:15,519
Scott: But I stopped reading, you know, pausing in the parts about the regular rabbits because I just didn't care about them that much.

906
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,600
Scott: You know, often, they pretty much really had three different stories sort of stuck together.

907
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,780
Scott: You know, the first story was escaping from the village where they sense danger.

908
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,546
Scott: The village.

909
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:27,879
Scott: I don't know.

910
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,192
Scott: Yeah, the Warren where they sense danger.

911
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,160
Scott: That was story one.

912
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:36,578
Scott: Story two was the cult rabbits and story three was battling with the fascist rabbits.

913
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,384
Rym: But see, there was no break in those.

914
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:42,019
Rym: I don't think of them as separate stories because also the book did a really good job of...

915
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:45,700
Scott: You could have divided the book into like part one, part two, part three.

916
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,280
Rym: No, but here's why it didn't and why it works better that way.

917
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:54,060
Rym: They didn't go that far and their journey was sort of this continuous journey.

918
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,480
Rym: So there is no destination in a typical human hero story.

919
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,160
Rym: Like the slog, you know, the knee that breaks pulls ten men down.

920
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,767
Rym: They have a destination.

921
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:05,194
Rym: They're going to the coffers.

922
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:06,280
Rym: That's their goal.

923
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:10,288
Rym: There was no like place to get to.

924
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:11,150
Rym: There was just.

925
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,960
Rym: now we're safe and we can eat things and not be as worried.

926
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:20,500
Rym: But at the same time, it's not like they thought of it from the same perspective of this is our new home.

927
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:21,970
Rym: We're safe here now.

928
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,280
Rym: They just kept rabbiting.

929
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:32,259
Rym: So in the course of rabbiting, all these stories keep happening because there is literally no way to settle down unless you become one of these messed up warrens.

930
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:46,000
Scott: But yeah, each of those three stories, though, was basically akin to like a sort of animal farm, Lord of the Flies, social commentary kind of aspect.

931
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:50,440
Scott: And that part is sort of like, yeah, I've read these stories like a hundred times before.

932
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,647
Rym: But one, the author said that wasn't the case at all.

933
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,610
Rym: It was just an exploration.

934
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,480
Rym: Like there was no allegory or metaphor or anything.

935
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,479
Scott: Well, you failed at doing what you said you were doing.

936
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,260
Rym: No, because I think it was like, well, what would rabbits be like if this happened?

937
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,662
Rym: What would rabbits be like?

938
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:08,127
Rym: Like, you know, the cult rabbits.

939
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:12,640
Rym: What are wild rabbits that are that don't have to worry about food anymore?

940
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:14,186
Scott: What would they do?

941
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:17,420
Rym: So they start developing writing and art and culture.

942
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:18,285
Scott: Right.

943
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:20,020
Rym: So at the same time, they get kind of messed up.

944
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:26,500
Scott: In a rabbit warren, the term they used for basically like the, you know, the army was like the Ausla.

945
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,161
Rym: Right.

946
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:32,880
Scott: But in the fascist rabbit colony, they had the secret rabbit police, which were the Auslafel.

947
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,362
Rym: Yeah.

948
00:54:33,443 --> 00:54:36,058
Scott: That doesn't sound like a Nazi term to you.

949
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:37,439
Rym: Not really.

950
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,860
Rym: So Richard Adams talked about how the rabbit language.

951
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:49,560
Rym: He made it up to be very huffy and like the kinds of noises and things that he associated with rabbits.

952
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:53,020
Rym: And that is purely the sole reason the language sounds the way it does.

953
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,820
Scott: That's why you don't want if you don't want to make a metaphor for something, you should go out of your way to make it as far away as possible.

954
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:05,960
Rym: Plus, I mean, yeah, pretty much any fascism at all will be able to be read as a metaphor for Nazis.

955
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:08,339
Rym: Obviously, that's just how it goes.

956
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:17,980
Rym: But at the same time that Warren was very successful, except for the fact that Woundwort was fucking crazy.

957
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,180
Scott: I mean, that's interesting about that character, right?

958
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:30,320
Scott: Because at the same time as him being crazy, it like they took care to not just show him as like crazy evil bad guy.

959
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:30,703
Scott: Right.

960
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:32,960
Scott: It's like he had a lot of positive qualities.

961
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,260
Rym: Oh, he was also a product of his upbringing.

962
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:35,822
Scott: Yeah.

963
00:55:36,244 --> 00:55:37,027
Scott: But it's like he had so many.

964
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,914
Scott: it's like, yeah, he's a bad ass.

965
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,360
Scott: He totally saved everybody.

966
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,380
Scott: You know, it's like he has many good qualities.

967
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,520
Scott: But because he was basically he just took it too far.

968
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,140
Rym: Well, he was basically not a rabbit.

969
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,441
Scott: Right.

970
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:51,619
Scott: And even when he had the chance at towards the end.

971
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:52,144
Scott: Right.

972
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:53,699
Scott: Where Hazel was like, let's make a deal.

973
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:54,422
Scott: Right.

974
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:57,580
Scott: We'll just send some of your people, make a new war and out in the middle part.

975
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,119
Scott: He almost went with it.

976
00:56:00,362 --> 00:56:00,489
Rym: Yeah.

977
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,980
Scott: You know, but then he didn't because he was too far gone.

978
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,019
Scott: But if that had been a younger, you know, of him, he might have said yes.

979
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:10,399
Rym: But like, you know, when I'm reading, I was getting like that big scene at the end.

980
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:11,869
Rym: I like Kihar a lot.

981
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,539
Rym: And when they're like, when Kihar is helping him out.

982
00:56:13,942 --> 00:56:14,378
Scott: Bird is so good.

983
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:14,846
Rym: Yeah.

984
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:15,054
Rym: Yeah.

985
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:15,641
Rym: You get.

986
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:17,607
Rym: I would if I was going to ship like.

987
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:22,460
Rym: I think I feel like Bigwig had a weird crush on Kihar because the other rabbits get making fun of him.

988
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:24,740
Rym: Like you really like that bird a lot.

989
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,179
Rym: Why are you hanging out with him so much?

990
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,854
Scott: He was the one who was friends with the bird.

991
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:28,380
Scott: What's the problem?

992
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:28,721
Rym: Yeah.

993
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:31,760
Rym: But he was the one who was so skeptical of the bird in the beginning, too.

994
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:32,816
Scott: That's always how it is.

995
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,817
Scott: It's always how it is.

996
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:36,779
Rym: But then there were other little touches like that, too.

997
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,839
Rym: Like when they were moving, when they're on their way, like they had the fight with the rats at one point.

998
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:48,380
Rym: But at the same time later, like it implies that like rats have a similar thing going on and they can kind of communicate.

999
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,132
Rym: Because remember when?

1000
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:50,980
Rym: what's his name?

1001
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,260
Rym: I forget who was trying to get the dog to chase them back to the war.

1002
00:56:56,481 --> 00:57:00,860
Rym: He runs and hides in the barn and the dogs coming after him and the rats are like, just lay low.

1003
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,564
Rym: It's cool, dude.

1004
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:03,293
Rym: And he's like, no, I need the dog to chase me.

1005
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:04,359
Rym: The rats like, what the fuck?

1006
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,317
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1007
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,806
Scott: Yeah.

1008
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:07,580
Scott: One another thing.

1009
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:09,090
Rym: It's just a bird.

1010
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,660
Rym: It's just a dog.

1011
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,160
Rym: And he fucking turns around and tries to fight that dog.

1012
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:18,640
Rym: And we know as humans that the dog just ate him and walked away with his body like, duh.

1013
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,680
Scott: But probably took it back to the farm.

1014
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,041
Rym: Yeah.

1015
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:25,300
Rym: But I love how like they never found his body.

1016
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:27,980
Rym: So he also lives on forever.

1017
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:28,620
Scott: Sure.

1018
00:57:29,902 --> 00:57:34,277
Scott: You know, there was one thing in this book is there was a Chekhov's gun, which is the little mouse.

1019
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,060
Scott: they befriended, right?

1020
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,480
Scott: Because they befriended the mouse and then they befriended the bird.

1021
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,120
Scott: And the bird basically Chekhov's gun went bam right away.

1022
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,339
Scott: It's like, well, this bird is basically a character now that's hanging out with you all the time.

1023
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,693
Scott: But the mouse was like, it's going to come back later.

1024
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:47,596
Scott: It's Chekhov's gun.

1025
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:48,480
Scott: It hasn't fired yet.

1026
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:53,300
Scott: And when it fired, it did fire, but it sort of fired meekly, which I was surprised.

1027
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,278
Rym: Well, it's a mouse.

1028
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:55,803
Scott: Right.

1029
00:57:55,844 --> 00:57:57,006
Scott: The mouse is just sort of like.

1030
00:57:57,167 --> 00:58:02,580
Scott: all he did in the end was warn them of a danger over the hill, which was significant, quite significant.

1031
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:09,260
Scott: But it wasn't like I expected like a whole bunch of little miceys to come out and get all over, you know, the bad guys or something like that.

1032
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:14,900
Rym: I guess what's interesting is that the book kind of does it, you know, nerds like world building a lot.

1033
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,229
Rym: And there is a lot of world building.

1034
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:17,980
Rym: It's like rabbit society world building.

1035
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,120
Rym: You get a lot of this like sense of a world the way rabbits are and everything.

1036
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:28,320
Rym: But at the same time, nerds like world building where they wanted to be, quote unquote, realistic, like plausible.

1037
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,520
Rym: It has to fit like, why would that Game of Thrones character do this?

1038
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,028
Rym: Obviously, he just murdered them all.

1039
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,040
Rym: And they love it when that kind of stuff happens.

1040
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:42,720
Rym: So the fact that the mice couldn't play a bigger role sort of fits with the fact that everything is plausible.

1041
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:49,560
Scott: I mean, the craziest thing that happens is when getting in a boat and realizing they should bite the rope off.

1042
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,723
Rym: Like, well, that was clever.

1043
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:57,540
Rym: I'm talking about in the end where Fiverr is like, you know, I had a dream that like you rode one of those Haruda dues and I came back to the farm, whatever.

1044
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:01,159
Rym: And then like that happens because the little girl just picks him up and like, OK.

1045
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,100
Scott: Yeah, I like how sometimes he uses when he makes a proper noun like her to do.

1046
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:08,500
Scott: It's like you and any human being immediately knows they're talking about a car.

1047
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:09,142
Scott: Right.

1048
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:11,411
Scott: Because it sounds like a car.

1049
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:13,660
Scott: It's an onomatopoeia kind of situation.

1050
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:16,900
Scott: But some of the other proper nouns, they didn't do that.

1051
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,241
Scott: Right.

1052
00:59:17,301 --> 00:59:22,740
Scott: Like if you don't know that Frith is the sun, it's going to take you a while to figure it out pretty quick.

1053
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,214
Scott: But it's not as obvious as who to do as a car.

1054
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:26,200
Scott: You see what I'm saying?

1055
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,540
Scott: There's no sort of this connection between the rabbit language and the human language.

1056
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,240
Rym: But like the Prince of Nothing, where there's also no connection, it uses all those things consistently.

1057
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:43,720
Rym: And like when the rabbits have the different names for each other, it's like they're they're used consistently and they sort of just feel natural.

1058
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:47,940
Rym: It's the opposite of the the Rothfussian model.

1059
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,767
Scott: Yep.

1060
00:59:49,888 --> 00:59:51,980
Scott: Is there anything else to say about this book?

1061
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,984
Rym: I mean, I think it's definitely worth reading.

1062
00:59:54,044 --> 01:00:00,920
Rym: I don't I get the impression that nothing else related to the book is worth pursuing except the movie.

1063
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:04,680
Rym: Like, I guess the continuing adventures or whatever are pretty rubbish.

1064
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,688
Scott: I mean, like, would I?

1065
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:09,249
Scott: it's not like.

1066
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:14,280
Scott: I want to go back and unread it, but it's not like I would have regretted not reading it.

1067
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:16,199
Rym: I like this book a lot more than you did.

1068
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:16,600
Scott: Yeah.

1069
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,475
Scott: I mean, it's good, but it's not like it's not going to go on a favorite books list.

1070
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:21,620
Scott: I'm not going to read it again.

1071
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:22,908
Rym: I'll put it up there.

1072
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:24,060
Rym: I could read it again someday.

1073
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:25,258
Scott: Yeah, I don't think so.

1074
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,094
Rym: I definitely could.

1075
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,038
Scott: You can do that.

1076
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:35,110
Rym: I also like the implications, especially around the cult rabbits, like just the little things like the.

1077
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,840
Rym: you know, you were talking about allegory for the advancement of humans, like from an oral tradition and those sorts of things like what humans were like.

1078
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,824
Rym: Look at what happened to the cult rabbits.

1079
01:00:42,844 --> 01:00:49,080
Rym: They started making a little bit of art and stuff and they made a weird warrant and they made a social warrant.

1080
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,320
Rym: And these rabbits did not understand.

1081
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,224
Rym: Like, I like that.

1082
01:00:52,245 --> 01:00:55,300
Rym: No, they lived like the Hazel could not understand.

1083
01:00:55,841 --> 01:01:01,260
Rym: Like he knew there was something important about the things they pressed into the walls, but he didn't get it.

1084
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,117
Rym: Like he didn't he couldn't figure it out.

1085
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:07,520
Rym: No, a worse author would have made that happen more.

1086
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:16,800
Rym: But then they get the idea and their war and like they advance, like they civilize a little bit, like they make the bigger war and like you see them evolve.

1087
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,320
Scott: They made the honeycomb part.

1088
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:20,439
Scott: Yeah, that they wouldn't have otherwise done.

1089
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:23,859
Scott: They're like, oh, that's a good idea from them, but we don't need to bother anything else from them.

1090
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,225
Scott: Yeah, because they're weird.

1091
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:29,220
Scott: But in general, I like this part of the thing they did in all the things they figure out.

1092
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,289
Scott: They also bother stuff from the fascists, too.

1093
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:31,570
Scott: Right.

1094
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,639
Scott: They start sending the patrols out a little bit.

1095
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:33,840
Scott: Right.

1096
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:35,278
Scott: Just for whatever reason, you know.

1097
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:44,880
Rym: But it did a good job of letting them figure that stuff out and use it and evolve a little bit, but not figure it out too much to where it's not.

1098
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,026
Rym: Like, oh, what's his name?

1099
01:01:49,066 --> 01:01:50,549
Rym: The smart one.

1100
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:52,854
Rym: Who's the smart one?

1101
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,620
Rym: The guy who figured the one who figures out the rope because he's looking at the boat.

1102
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,940
Rym: He's like, I think like he's looking at it.

1103
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,405
Scott: Yeah, that's that's what I want to point out.

1104
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:01,626
Scott: Right.

1105
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:03,212
Scott: So there's like the main rabbits, right?

1106
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,080
Scott: This hazel, bigwig, fiver.

1107
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:05,582
Scott: Right.

1108
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,180
Scott: It's like the ones that, you know, that are really significant.

1109
01:02:08,441 --> 01:02:14,200
Scott: There seem to be a lot of rabbits that are sort of less significant, but still sort of important.

1110
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,894
Scott: Like, I think there's like strawberry and some of these other ones.

1111
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:19,115
Scott: Right.

1112
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,679
Scott: But it's like you really can't.

1113
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,007
Scott: It's hard to tell them apart.

1114
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:23,579
Scott: Like they're basically all the same rabbit to me.

1115
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:24,728
Rym: No, they all do.

1116
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:26,360
Rym: Most of them have pretty different personalities.

1117
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,284
Scott: Yeah, but like they they were there.

1118
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:33,920
Scott: like like they didn't develop or focus on them enough for me to remember like which one was which.

1119
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,540
Scott: It's like all I knew is whenever I saw one of those names, I'm like, oh, that's one of the names of one of the secondary second tier rabbits.

1120
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:43,920
Rym: I remember them because they all had a role in the party like this one's the bard.

1121
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,309
Scott: Yeah, I couldn't remember what their roles were.

1122
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:48,900
Scott: I saw they were all just second tier rabbit to me.

1123
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,160
Rym: I'm curious because so like Holly, second tier rabbit and the prince of nothing.

1124
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:59,296
Rym: What is the name of I don't know, any of the great names?

1125
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:00,240
Rym: Anyone?

1126
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:01,364
Scott: I don't remember.

1127
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:06,080
Rym: What is the name of the magic that the the the other people use, the Phantom?

1128
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,052
Scott: Oh, I used to know.

1129
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:10,858
Scott: It's been a long time.

1130
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:11,039
Rym: Yeah.

1131
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:16,740
Rym: Name any characters other than Hazel and Fiverr and Bigwig.

1132
01:03:17,843 --> 01:03:18,630
Scott: I just said Holly.

1133
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:18,993
Scott: That's it.

1134
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:19,840
Rym: That's a rabbit.

1135
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:27,640
Rym: You don't remember the name of the badass that came that was in basically in Irons that came out of her Fafero with them?

1136
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,109
Scott: Oh, what's that guy's name?

1137
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:29,833
Scott: That guy's so awesome.

1138
01:03:31,903 --> 01:03:32,726
Scott: Yeah, there was.

1139
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:36,840
Scott: I thought that Campione guy whose name was obviously should have just been championed.

1140
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:42,860
Scott: Yeah, I thought he was going to like, you know, do a trader situation and turn on the the work guy.

1141
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:43,424
Scott: But he didn't.

1142
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:45,720
Scott: Yeah, but he still was OK in the end.

1143
01:03:46,362 --> 01:03:49,420
Scott: I thought he was going to go full turncoat and help the good guys.

1144
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:58,680
Rym: Instead, he kind of backs off into like, let's just keep doing the smart stuff we're doing, but let the other people just leave because otherwise it's not working out.

1145
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:09,380
Rym: Yeah, but I but I did also enjoy how the characters were all like, no character did any of the stupid things that bother me in a lot of books or a lot of stories.

1146
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,002
Scott: That's true.

1147
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:20,280
Rym: When I first started reading, my immediate fear was that the initial plot was going to be Bigwig still wants to be like an important big boss rabbit and he bosses Hazel around.

1148
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,164
Rym: And that's a conflict.

1149
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:24,380
Rym: I like how it skipped that a hundred percent.

1150
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:25,724
Scott: I mean, it's the same thing.

1151
01:04:25,744 --> 01:04:29,160
Scott: Like people didn't trust fibers, crazy ramblings until they saw that they were true.

1152
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,105
Scott: Then they trusted them.

1153
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:30,890
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

1154
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:31,736
Scott: And then it's OK.

1155
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:32,320
Rym: Yeah.

1156
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,227
Scott: Everyone had the rabbits.

1157
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:42,000
Scott: This is why the main characters that why you were rooting for them, because like they were the smart, common sense ones who listen to reason and had reason.

1158
01:04:43,303 --> 01:04:44,888
Scott: And that's why they were the tricky rabbits.

1159
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:45,148
Scott: Right.

1160
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:48,720
Scott: They were clever and and, you know, smarter than the other ones.

1161
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:49,182
Rym: Yep.

1162
01:04:49,403 --> 01:04:52,360
Scott: Whereas all the other ones were, you know, messed up in some way.

1163
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,900
Rym: And it all fits with what real rabbits are like, because the way rabbits work is that they make a lot of them.

1164
01:04:58,422 --> 01:05:01,299
Rym: And only the lucky and clever ones keep making more of them.

1165
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,400
Rym: So they sort of evolved toward always being clever and making more of themselves as fast as possible.

1166
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:10,959
Rym: And the story sort of just like set around all that.

1167
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:21,599
Scott: Well, also because rabbits are that way in the real world that we live in, where people write stories about rabbits and they're, you know, they will often lead to a rabbit as a tricky character.

1168
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:22,682
Scott: Yeah.

1169
01:05:22,702 --> 01:05:29,180
Scott: Same way that you will lean is like, you know, if you were making something about like a loyal army of something, you would pick dogs.

1170
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:30,083
Scott: Right.

1171
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:31,349
Scott: You know, stuff like that.

1172
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,354
Scott: Yeah.

1173
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:33,480
Rym: I really like this book.

1174
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,200
Scott: People make like, you know, people make like the wise old God whale.

1175
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,951
Scott: No one makes the wise old God starfish.

1176
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:41,979
Scott: That doesn't happen.

1177
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:43,519
Scott: What about boa juice?

1178
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:46,504
Scott: I'm just saying, right?

1179
01:05:46,966 --> 01:05:51,400
Scott: It's like different animals in the real world have different personalities and traits.

1180
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,560
Scott: So that when stories are written, people pick animals to go with matching traits.

1181
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,247
Scott: You don't see mismatches like that.

1182
01:05:57,307 --> 01:06:00,520
Scott: It's not, you know, I don't know, grasshopper guard.

1183
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:01,328
Scott: Okay.

1184
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,199
Scott: No one's doing that.

1185
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:02,661
Rym: Yeah.

1186
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,339
Rym: But like red wall, there's not very mousy.

1187
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:07,715
Scott: No, but you get, you know, Bugs Bunny.

1188
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:08,318
Scott: You don't see it.

1189
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,885
Scott: It's not clever.

1190
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:14,160
Scott: Imagine if Daffy Duck was had Bugs Bunny's personality as well as getting away with shit.

1191
01:06:14,482 --> 01:06:15,953
Scott: And Bugs was the one who was getting shot.

1192
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:16,900
Scott: It wouldn't make any sense.

1193
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,518
Scott: It wouldn't make any sense for a duck to be so smart and always tricking the hunter.

1194
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,609
Rym: I mean, ducks never win Stanley Cobb.

1195
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,100
Scott: So of course, I'm just saying it wouldn't make sense.

1196
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:27,381
Scott: Right.

1197
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:30,295
Scott: So this is the same reason that rabbits are chosen here to be smart.

1198
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:35,580
Rym: But the book seems deserving of the fact that it's so well known.

1199
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:37,139
Scott: It is well known.

1200
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,298
Rym: I really liked it.

1201
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:44,516
Scott: If you like rabbits or adventures, you should read it because it won't take you that long.

1202
01:06:44,556 --> 01:06:45,418
Scott: if you actually try.

1203
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,899
Rym: It'll either take you three days or eight months.

1204
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:49,483
Rym: Yep.

1205
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:50,319
Scott: Something like that.

1206
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:54,240
Scott: The next book will probably take you eight months, even if you read it every day.

1207
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,931
Rym: You know what, Scott?

1208
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:59,000
Rym: I wouldn't pick The Count of Monte Cristo.

1209
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,318
Rym: I will tell you now.

1210
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,100
Scott: You're going to go even harder.

1211
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:10,180
Rym: No, there is a fantasy book that I don't know by two mediocre fantasy authors together.

1212
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,560
Rym: They're both famous in their own right.

1213
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,279
Scott: Why would you pick something mediocre?

1214
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,479
Rym: The book is almost three inches thick.

1215
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:17,994
Scott: OK.

1216
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:21,660
Rym: I read the first two thirds of it.

1217
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:22,015
Rym: Why?

1218
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,839
Rym: Because I used when I was younger, I just had this idea of if I get better.

1219
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Scott: I'm thinking at least there's some legit reason.

1220
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:35,680
Rym: Yeah, this book, these are famous authors and people like them, but the same kinds of people.

1221
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,909
Scott: Is it your friend R.A.

1222
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,180
Scott: Salvatore and someone else?

1223
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,858
Rym: No, God, no.

1224
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:52,200
Rym: That was the first book ever that I had started reading, made it more than a third of the way through, and still decided to quit at some point before the end.

1225
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,757
Rym: I never read the last like 200 pages.

1226
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,377
Scott: So you want to pick it so that I'll have to read the whole thing and you'll only have to read 200 pages?

1227
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,200
Rym: That depends entirely on how much I enjoy or do not enjoy.

1228
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:05,719
Scott: I can't have no control over that.

1229
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,058
Scott: I don't even have control over whether I'm going to enjoy it.

1230
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:13,860
Scott: It just has a significant place in nerd culture and I therefore I think it is worth investigating.

1231
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:20,460
Rym: Yeah, but you could say the same thing based on current nerd culture about Ready Player One.

1232
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,439
Scott: There's literally no reason to give that book a second look.

1233
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,140
Scott: But this has passed a greater test of time than those have.

1234
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,048
Rym: It's largely forgotten.

1235
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:30,300
Scott: I think only like- So is Game of Thrones if there wasn't suddenly a TV show.

1236
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,519
Scott: Well, actually- It's in the same place Game of Thrones was in.

1237
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:46,380
Rym: I've read a lot of increasing articles and sentiment that the Game of Thrones TV is actually taking the questionable parts of Game of Thrones and making them not just questionable but just bad and misogynistic and fucked up.

1238
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,899
Scott: Well, it's bad and fucked up to begin with.

1239
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,314
Rym: So there's a bunch of bad things happen to characters.

1240
01:08:52,340 --> 01:09:01,819
Scott: If Game of Thrones had never had a TV show made of it, I still would- And I went to that bookstore and I had the same thoughts about picking a long fantasy series.

1241
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,959
Scott: I still would not have picked Game of Thrones because of its reputation and what I knew about it.

1242
01:09:06,524 --> 01:09:10,600
Scott: All I knew about it- But I have seen these books on the shelves of trusted nerds.

1243
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:12,875
Rym: I always thought Game of Thrones was lost.

1244
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,359
Rym: It's going nowhere and the end won't be satisfying.

1245
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,200
Rym: Of course, The Prince of Nothing might not be going anywhere.

1246
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:21,038
Scott: That's true.

1247
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,538
Rym: If those books don't go anywhere, I don't know what I'll do.

1248
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,640
Scott: But The Wheel of Time, the author is dead.

1249
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:28,819
Rym: The author is dead in all works of literature.

1250
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,679
Scott: No, literally though.

1251
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,140
Scott: So there's someone else who took over but I don't think you have to read those ones.

1252
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:37,819
Rym: I'm worried that this is gonna be a slog.

1253
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,560
Scott: It is quite possible.

1254
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,960
Rym: It's got my knees gonna break.

1255
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,055
Scott: I'm not denying it.

1256
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,560
Scott: You don't see me saying it's not gonna be.

1257
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:48,359
Scott: I'm saying I chose it despite the same worries that you have.

1258
01:09:48,461 --> 01:09:49,800
Rym: I'm never making it to the coffers.

1259
01:09:50,022 --> 01:09:52,580
Scott: Every apprehension you have, I also have.

1260
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:54,560
Scott: But I venture forth regardless.

1261
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:02,630
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1262
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:07,730
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1263
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:13,150
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1264
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:16,090
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1265
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:20,850
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1266
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:24,366
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1267
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:28,650
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1268
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,790
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
