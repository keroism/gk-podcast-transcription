1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,217
Rym: It's Thursday, February 4th.

2
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:12,979
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,561
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:15,126
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:18,279
Rym: Tonight's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,549
Rym: in case you somehow haven't already read it.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,048
Rym: Hopefully you did read it because it's the book club book.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,357
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,395
Rym: Scott, I'm really impressed.

10
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,000
Rym: Not five seconds before we start recording you burped and farted simultaneously.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,476
Scott: That was not a simultaneous burp and fart.

12
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,940
Scott: There was one after the other.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,889
Rym: There was definitely, in the very least, a sort of crossfade between the two.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,708
Scott: Crossfade, perhaps.

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,950
Scott: But that could have just been due to the delay of the sound traveling across the room to your ears.

16
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,729
Rym: As opposed to the speed of light of me seeing it.

17
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,116
Scott: You know, you didn't see either one.

18
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:06,250
Scott: You only heard and perhaps smelled, but you know, the speed of smell is way slower.

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,390
Rym: Now you tend to make very obvious physical movements when you fart.

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,078
Rym: It's kind of like you build up to it a little bit.

21
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:14,815
Rym: Like you clench your fist just a tiny bit and you kind of just shoot it right out there like BAM.

22
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:19,250
Scott: Well, it builds up very quickly because I have a gaseous problem.

23
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:21,268
Scott: I need to go to a doctor.

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,237
Scott: He'll probably just say you have gas.

25
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:24,840
Scott: What the hell?

26
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:26,245
Scott: See, at least I can save mine up.

27
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:27,390
Scott: And be not helpful in any way.

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,685
Rym: Like if it starts building and I feel it in there, I can wait a while before I let it out.

29
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:42,829
Rym: Mine builds up basically from nothing to a whole lot and it basically instantly, you know, often I'll walk into someone else's office and just kind of leave it there and then go somewhere else just because I don't want to deal with it.

30
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,830
Scott: Like basically it builds up as fast as I can inflate a balloon with my lungs like well.

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,569
Rym: Well, that depends on how fast you can inflate a balloon very quickly.

32
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,603
Rym: But I do have to issue a brief retraction from yesterday's show or not?

33
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:57,627
Rym: yesterday's two days ago.

34
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:58,630
Scott: Rym sucks.

35
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:02,870
Rym: Yep, so I said that Emily did not know a lot about paranoia, the setting.

36
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,288
Rym: She had actually not that long ago, because we talk about paranoia more often than you'd think, researched all about the setting because she thought it was cool.

37
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:16,484
Scott: So she didn't research it in preparation to play in a game she knew she was gonna play and she didn't know she was gonna play or what?

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,375
Rym: She researched it long before the recess.

39
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:23,730
Rym: She just knew quite a bit about the system, but she did not grock it, I guess.

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,767
Scott: Well, I have the book and people, you know, can read the book.

41
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:27,109
Scott: I have it.

42
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:30,970
Rym: Yeah, I still- we had to get a bunch of copies of just like the red part of that book.

43
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,434
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

44
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:32,159
Scott: You gotta get the red book.

45
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,429
Scott: You can't, you know, for the players.

46
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,910
Rym: Even though it was still weird to play the game at blue.

47
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,835
Scott: That is very weird.

48
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,770
Scott: I definitely want to play it for serious starting at the low.

49
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,875
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

50
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,150
Rym: Play it for serious or play it serious?

51
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,070
Rym: For serious.

52
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,610
Scott: Serious for serious.

53
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,310
Rym: Oh, man, that- not many people have done that.

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,976
Scott: The dystopian version.

55
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,763
Scott: No silliness, no soda.

56
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,850
Scott: You know, it's actually- So basically Logan's run.

57
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:57,384
Scott: Yes, I want to play Logan's run.

58
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:57,930
Scott: For real.

59
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,997
Rym: So, uh, let's just get right into it.

60
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:01,640
Rym: It's Thursday.

61
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,324
Rym: We're lazy.

62
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,510
Rym: Go skiing this weekend.

63
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,590
Scott: Do you want to do news and thing of the day or just want to do the show?

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,116
Rym: I don't know, just jump right into it.

65
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,539
Rym: It's Thursday.

66
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,130
Rym: We used to call this the lounge, remember?

67
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,890
Scott: We kept saying- You called it the lounge.

68
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,546
Rym: The whole goal was that we won't do a normal show on Thursday.

69
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,475
Rym: We won't like, "Well, my news is

70
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,319
Rym: blah.".

71
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,870
Rym: Looked up this thing on Fark five minutes before.

72
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,990
Scott: We failed and I'm lazy, so I got some news.

73
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,443
Rym: Alright.

74
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,482
Scott: Alright, the news I have is that the Superb Owl is on Sunday.

75
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:27,435
Rym: Oh, yeah.

76
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,080
Rym: The Superb Owl.

77
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,369
Rym: Isn't there something on a website for that?

78
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,276
Scott: Superb-owl.com.

79
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,452
Scott: Ah.

80
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,015
Scott: It's on Sunday, February 7th, 2010.

81
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:35,576
Scott: Will be Superb Owl

82
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:40,930
Scott: 45? 44?

83
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,533
Scott: Yeah, screw that.

84
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:45,290
Rym: Meanwhile, one of my coworkers is going with one of my bosses to the Rangers game tonight.

85
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:46,409
Scott: Oh, very nice.

86
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,760
Scott: Yeah.

87
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,177
Scott: The Rangers are sort of up and down.

88
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:49,303
Scott: They win a whole bunch.

89
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,911
Scott: It's 44.

90
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,196
Rym: You know, I'm proud of New York.

91
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:55,266
Rym: I feel like New York City is my home city now.

92
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,129
Rym: I identify with it.

93
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,230
Rym: This is my city-state, but I still root for the Red Wings and not the Rangers.

94
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:07,902
Scott: The Rangers win a whole bunch and then they lose a whole bunch, and then they win, and then they lose.

95
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,069
Scott: That's how they go.

96
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:17,870
Scott: At least they don't have the problem they used to have, which is where they would basically fill the team with a bunch of big names who are all old and past their prime, not win at all.

97
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:18,793
Scott: Right?

98
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:23,150
Scott: And now, this year, it's actually not full of old Yeezers, so...

99
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:32,070
Rym: But very tactically, I decided to ski this weekend because I'm hoping... It's tricky because maybe fewer people will go up to ski because they want to go see the Superb Owl.

100
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,369
Rym: But maybe the kinds of people who ski are thinking, "Man, I hate the Superb Owl.

101
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:40,049
Rym: I'm going to go ski while all the idiots are watching the Superb

102
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:40,130
Rym: Owl.".

103
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,890
Scott: I think you might see a lot of skiing on Saturday, and then you might actually see a lot of Superb Owl watching in the ski lodge on Sunday.

104
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,830
Rym: Yeah, I'm only skiing Saturday, though, because I don't want to take Monday off work.

105
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,673
Rym: And you know what?

106
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:55,410
Rym: This old man can no longer ski one day, go to work the next day.

107
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,456
Rym: I just, I can't.

108
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,169
Rym: I wake up the next day, and they just don't go.

109
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:15,410
Scott: So for all you nerds out there who might end up watching the Superb Owl and not understanding or caring, allow me to spend a minute to tell you the story of this year's Superb Owl that maybe you will have a slight greater appreciation for it than you otherwise would have.

110
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:27,110
Scott: So from the NFC are the New Orleans Saints, and the reason that the New Orleans Saints are hyped up is because, A, they have shit tons of offense.

111
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,150
Scott: They get touchdowns like crazy.

112
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,990
Rym: Think of football like a board game.

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,449
Scott: Yes, because of their quarterback, Drew Brees.

114
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,409
Scott: And that is how you say his name.

115
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:35,700
Scott: Really?

116
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:36,585
Scott: Drew Brees.

117
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:47,570
Scott: Okay, so the opponents from the AFC are the Indianapolis Colts, who have Peyton Manning, who is pretty much possibly the greatest ever.

118
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,490
Scott: Brother of the Giants quarterback, Eli Manning, who didn't even make the playoffs this year.

119
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,190
Scott: But he won the Super Bowl in '07, which is okay.

120
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,850
Scott: And basically, he's the greatest ever.

121
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:04,250
Scott: So it's sort of like the greatest ever versus the young punk kids who have crazy offense.

122
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:13,230
Scott: And, you know, if you want to add some suspense, right, to this mix, the Indianapolis Colts, one of their very important players.

123
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,810
Rym: Killed the mother of the other coach and stole the baby.

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,690
Scott: Is injured, right?

125
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,870
Scott: And at the same time, a lot of people are rooting for New Orleans because there was a hurricane there, so the city is a very sad city.

126
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,170
Scott: And the football team is pretty much the only thing they have that is not sad.

127
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:35,070
Scott: So if they win, it is like a happy, feel good story.

128
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:45,790
Scott: But really, it's kind of bad for me because all the teams that I hated, like the Cowboys and the Vikings and the Eagles and the Jets, they already lost.

129
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,130
Scott: And the only teams left were the teams that I liked.

130
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,150
Scott: So it's pretty much like team I like versus team I like.

131
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:52,930
Scott: And I'm like, oh, whatever.

132
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,890
Rym: I don't get you New York sports fans because I see this happen a lot.

133
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,141
Rym: It's not just you where there's a lot like.

134
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,790
Rym: you have this whole list of teams you hate.

135
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:06,989
Rym: And anytime there's a game that doesn't involve your team, you're looking at all the other teams like, well, I hate them more than them.

136
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,749
Rym: So I hope they lose, but I hope one of them gets injured.

137
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,670
Scott: Yeah, because I mean, there's no other team you like.

138
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,690
Scott: You only like one team and then you hate like a fistful of teams.

139
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,910
Scott: And then the rest of the teams are just teams in hockey.

140
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,410
Rym: As a Red Wings fan, we have the rivalry.

141
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,210
Rym: There's only one team at any given moment that we hate.

142
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,902
Rym: Every other team we are 100 percent neutral toward.

143
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:35,067
Scott: Oh, see, this is why the reason for this is because if you look in hockey, really, you know, I only hate maybe a couple hockey teams like the Flyers.

144
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,788
Scott: I hate the Flyers.

145
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:38,730
Rym: I'm indifferent to the Flyers.

146
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:40,890
Rym: You stay at the Avalanche because they were the rivals.

147
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,750
Rym: But then the Devils with their fucking trap.

148
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:43,372
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,210
Scott: And, you know, the Islanders, but the Islanders are so shitty.

150
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,949
Scott: It's like whatever.

151
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,330
Scott: But if you look at, say, baseball, for instance, right.

152
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,950
Scott: You are a Mets fan in the Mets division.

153
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,468
Scott: Right there.

154
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,950
Rym: You know, I thought you were going to say in the Mets universe.

155
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:57,924
Scott: No, no, no.

156
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,290
Scott: In the Mets division.

157
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:00,050
Scott: Right.

158
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,338
Scott: Are all the hated teams?

159
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:05,170
Scott: because those are the teams you play the most and those are the teams you need to beat to get to the playoffs.

160
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,970
Scott: You know, if you're a Giants fan, you hate the Eagles.

161
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:08,990
Scott: You hate the Cowboys.

162
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,930
Scott: You hate the Redskins because those are in the same division.

163
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,390
Scott: You got to kick their asses.

164
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,863
Scott: It's the end of, you know, it's NFC East.

165
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,030
Scott: So if the team's not in your division, right, you know who really gives a shit.

166
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,510
Scott: It's the teams that are in your division.

167
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,989
Scott: You play them twice a year.

168
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,887
Scott: Fuck them.

169
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,949
Scott: Fuck them hard.

170
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,930
Rym: See, I guess hockey is a little weirder because one divisions matter a lot less in hockey.

171
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,390
Rym: Well, they still matter a lot in terms of how you get seated for like the Stanley Cup and all.

172
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,570
Scott: No, the only thing that matters for that is East and West.

173
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:42,990
Scott: And the thing is you in hockey, you only if you're in the East, you play each team in the West at most once a year during the regular season and vice versa.

174
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,250
Rym: So they still divide them up smaller and smaller.

175
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,770
Scott: And there are separate divisions, but they hardly matter.

176
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:51,009
Rym: But what hurts is that the people, the Red Wings play at that level.

177
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,790
Rym: Oh, pretty, at least while I was a kid, sucked and it didn't matter.

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,210
Rym: And all that mattered was the Stanley Cup.

179
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,630
Rym: It was never like, are they going to make it to the finals?

180
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,829
Rym: It was just, are they going to win the Stanley Cup or not?

181
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,229
Rym: Are they going to win the Stanley Cup or not?

182
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,049
Rym: Nope, nope, yep, yep, nope, yep, nope, nope.

183
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,150
Scott: Meanwhile, the Capitals have won like 12 in a row.

184
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,510
Scott: And I'm cool with them because their fans have style.

185
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,490
Scott: Caps fans are good fans.

186
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,650
Scott: And that's, you know, that's another thing that contributes to whether you hate or don't hate a team.

187
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,971
Scott: Right.

188
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,110
Scott: Like, for example, you know, Redskins, they're in the same division as the Giants.

189
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:21,882
Scott: I don't like them.

190
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:22,370
Scott: Right.

191
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:25,650
Scott: But the Cowboys and the Eagles are hated far more.

192
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,032
Scott: Why?

193
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,028
Scott: Because Redskins fans, they're OK people.

194
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,350
Scott: Cowboys fans are shitheads from Texas.

195
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:32,931
Scott: Right.

196
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,048
Scott: Nothing needs to be said more about that.

197
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:40,002
Scott: And Philadelphia sports fans are pretty much the worst human beings on the face of the planet.

198
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:40,770
Scott: Right.

199
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,350
Scott: So that's why Phillies, Flyers, Eagles are like the most hated.

200
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:46,109
Scott: One, two, three.

201
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,210
Scott: All these Philadelphia sports fans are like, like, you know, it's like Hitler, Philadelphia sports fans.

202
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,613
Scott: Right.

203
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,470
Scott: Right behind.

204
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:56,804
Rym: See, I only measure the how bad.

205
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:57,729
Rym: the fans are of a team.

206
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,030
Rym: I call it batteries per year.

207
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,210
Rym: How many batteries do those fans throw?

208
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,910
Scott: Did you see that video of the Eagles fans like like literally like drowning these people in snowballs who are not Eagles fans?

209
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,051
Rym: Yeah.

210
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,984
Scott: Like if you you know, there's even.

211
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,510
Scott: this isn't like something I'm making up either or something.

212
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,829
Scott: I'm just saying because I'm a New York guy.

213
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:27,130
Scott: If you watch like ESPN or something, all the sports writers will be like, yeah, when my kid goes to like a Philadelphia sports game, I tell him, you know, do not wear your Redskins jersey.

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,270
Scott: Do not wear, you know, because he seriously thinks he's going to get.

215
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:40,890
Rym: See, at the same time, I'm pretty sure that the media has contributed to nothing more than a legend of Krauser, that there is a kernel of truth, but there's primarily a gigantic Krauser fucking the Tokyo Tower.

216
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:41,353
Scott: OK.

217
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,770
Scott: All right.

218
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,610
Scott: The last, I guess, raping more precisely the very last time I was at Chase Stadium, which is the last time I'll ever be at Chase Stadium because it no longer exists.

219
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,270
Scott: Right.

220
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,324
Scott: Was the was the last game that the Mets played against the Philadelphia Phillies at that stadium.

221
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:54,689
Rym: All right.

222
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:58,890
Scott: And many, many Phillies fans showed up and they were all shitheads.

223
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,890
Scott: They were like the worst people imaginable.

224
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,049
Scott: They all bought their brooms.

225
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,470
Scott: They were like, sweep, sweep, because they had won the first two games of the series.

226
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,790
Scott: And of course, we won that night and there was no sweep.

227
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,230
Rym: I brought a broom to the the second set of Stanley Cup stuff when the Red Wings were doing really well when I was.

228
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,430
Scott: But I'm just saying is that these people were not pleasant people.

229
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,640
Scott: They were, you know, not.

230
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:23,407
Rym: Now, Scott, how about the corner crew at RIT?

231
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,768
Scott: We made the goalie cry.

232
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,089
Scott: It was a good natured ribbing as opposed to a.

233
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,241
Rym: He started crying.

234
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,990
Rym: Well, that's just because he was a pussy.

235
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,209
Rym: That's not because.

236
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,710
Scott: The corner crew was good natured ribbing.

237
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:42,390
Rym: It was not malicious, cruel, drunk and retarded through your thighs than your sister.

238
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,185
Scott: Yeah, that's not.

239
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,668
Scott: It was not malicious, cruel, drunken or retarded.

240
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:49,149
Scott: It was intelligent and good natured.

241
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:55,230
Rym: And also, I point out, as much as I love RIT, we stole half our chance from MIT and just said RIT instead.

242
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,109
Scott: What's wrong with that?

243
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,190
Rym: You know what most of our listeners just heard?

244
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:10,950
Scott: Sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, sports, his name is Drew Brees, like B-R-E-E-S, like the cool island breeze.

245
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,549
Scott: Aha, Drew Brees.

246
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,330
Rym: OK, so I just I'm not going to talk about it much, but there's this.

247
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:21,810
Rym: It's funny because I just finished our Scott backers neuropath and it's quick geek bite.

248
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,510
Rym: It's no prince of nothing.

249
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,150
Scott: If you're you don't say the prince of nothing is the prince of something.

250
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,730
Scott: It's the prince king of something.

251
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,110
Rym: It's the prince of let's just do a bunch of really disturbing Ghost in the Shell kind of stuff and then end on a downer.

252
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,508
Scott: So it's Ghost in the Shell and it's not.

253
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:37,889
Scott: It's mind game.

254
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:39,889
Rym: You know, it really is.

255
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,990
Rym: It's Strange Days, except it ends in the exact opposite way from the way Strange Days ended.

256
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,510
Rym: But otherwise, it's almost the same story.

257
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:48,430
Scott: All right.

258
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:58,087
Rym: But it's funny because I just read this whole book and it really has a really, really, really depressing outlook on what humans are and what consciousness is and free will and all that.

259
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,710
Rym: And then just today, randomly, I click on the top story on like Google News in science.

260
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:09,370
Rym: And it's the story on the Telegraph that basically says 80 percent of what neuropath says.

261
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:14,306
Rym: But it's a science article saying, check out all these scary things we've learned about the brain in the past year.

262
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,870
Rym: And it's basically, wow, neuropath is wild.

263
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,770
Rym: I'd say like half the book is definitely all right.

264
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,610
Rym: We're speculating and sci fi and whatever.

265
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,610
Rym: But half the book is pretty much hard science at this point.

266
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,176
Scott: I you know, it's it's.

267
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:34,086
Scott: the one thing that just fascinates me more than anything is that when I was a kid in school, like elementary school, right, you would ask, like, how does a brain work?

268
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,990
Scott: And we knew that, like, the brain was the brain.

269
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,828
Scott: And that was about it.

270
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:38,970
Scott: And I'm sure that scientists knew more.

271
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,010
Rym: I knew about the hippocampus in high school.

272
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,950
Scott: Yeah, but I know a lot about that, you know, and you knew the different parts of the brain different things.

273
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,070
Scott: But like, if you ask people like, how does the brain work?

274
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,030
Scott: Like, basically, nobody knows.

275
00:13:49,190 --> 00:14:05,090
Scott: It was basically this land of mystery, you know, and now if you ask how the brain works or go on the Internet, there's any number of books and websites and papers about neuroscience telling you a scary amount of information about how the brain works down to excruciatingly small details.

276
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:07,430
Scott: That is very frightening and awesome.

277
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:08,834
Rym: And it's one.

278
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:13,209
Scott: if I could go back in time, I would have been a neuro doctor instead of a computer guy.

279
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,809
Scott: I'll raise two points that I had to get all A's in school, and that would have been unpleasant.

280
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,369
Scott: I would have played a lot less video games.

281
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,829
Rym: It's been a while, so I got to slip back into Friday night party line mode a little bit.

282
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:26,970
Scott: Oh, I got to bring up the things I bring up Admiral Nelson and his brain is so massive.

283
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,430
Scott: That's why he never got killed in war, even though boats were horrible places.

284
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,250
Rym: Well, I could go back to Emperor Constantine and how his brain was so small.

285
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,470
Scott: First, I'll go to Cthulhu and how he doesn't have a brain.

286
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,049
Scott: You just go insane whenever you look at them.

287
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:46,598
Rym: But how we're getting, you know, the whole idea of the Cthulhu, like that kind of mythos story is the idea that there is knowledge.

288
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,686
Rym: that is true, that you do not know.

289
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:55,250
Rym: that upon knowing changes the very fundamental nature of the way you exist because you cannot forget.

290
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,230
Scott: Once you know, you can't un-know.

291
00:14:59,252 --> 00:14:59,847
Rym: Basically, yes.

292
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,886
Scott: You've seen it.

293
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,007
Scott: You can't un-see it.

294
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:04,506
Scott: It's tub girl.

295
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:07,690
Scott: It's the neuroscience paper.

296
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,030
Scott: And tub girl have something in common.

297
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,610
Rym: The FNPL point I always bring up is the zebra storyteller.

298
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,290
Scott: Oh, your zebra storyteller.

299
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:25,469
Rym: That these things would have been disturbing to me at a younger age, but because I've watched so much sci-fi that in many ways was worse than what reality is turning out to be.

300
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,690
Rym: Yeah, all right, maybe I don't have free will.

301
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,725
Rym: That's not nearly as bad as H.P.

302
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:30,390
Rym: Lovecraft World.

303
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,369
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's funny that you mentioned the Cthulhu because Cthulhu is the antithesis of the zebra storyteller.

304
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:36,977
Scott: You know, no matter how many H.P.

305
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:40,650
Scott: Lovecraft stories you read, if Cthulhu shows up, you will go insane and die.

306
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,449
Scott: It does not matter.

307
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:46,868
Rym: However, I point out the people who are zebra storytellers hold out a lot better.

308
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,990
Rym: or maybe they found out about the yellow sign and hold themselves off for a little while.

309
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,510
Scott: They're the last to go, the cultists.

310
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:52,209
Rym: They delay.

311
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,349
Scott: Yeah, the cultists are always the last to go.

312
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,447
Scott: Yeah, or the first to go, depending on- If they want to or they get what they go in the order they want to go because they know.

313
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,189
Rym: Yeah, you pretty much trust Cthulhu.

314
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:05,230
Rym: If it eats you first or eats you last- You have no choice but to trust.

315
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:17,160
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

316
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,600
Rym: I feel like I want to cross-pollinate for like the next month or so.

317
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,359
Rym: I'm never going to use a video game thing on a Tuesday and I can't really say vice versa because there's no other thing there.

318
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,174
Scott: Oh, you're always going to use an inappropriate thing.

319
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:28,860
Scott: today is what you're saying.

320
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:34,974
Rym: Yes, because that's the whole point of our show, to get people exposed to things they wouldn't otherwise be exposed to, like my hammer.

321
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,899
Scott: It's not a bad idea.

322
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:49,620
Rym: So my thing of the day is totally video game and it's from College Humor, which again, if you guys haven't figured it out, pretty much 99% of our things of the day are just a video from that day on College Humor.

323
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,520
Scott: I'm avoiding College Humor things of the day.

324
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,220
Rym: But there have been some really good ones lately that people don't watch.

325
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:54,933
Scott: That's true.

326
00:16:56,562 --> 00:17:00,779
Scott: Every now and then- Go to collegehumor.com/videos and just watch any video you think is funny every day.

327
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,459
Scott: Yeah, the thing is- Instead of watching whatever crap you're watching on TV.

328
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,960
Rym: It's sad because even there, the signal-to-noise ratio is higher than almost any other like funny thing on the internet site.

329
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,000
Scott: And it's still less than half.

330
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,520
Rym: Yeah, I watch maybe a third, maybe, of College Humor videos.

331
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,880
Rym: Of course, you kind of get this gnosis, this like innate understanding of that one's going to be funny, that one's not going to be funny.

332
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,060
Scott: Is Jake and Amir on it?

333
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:21,559
Scott: Not funny.

334
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,740
Rym: Jake and Amir is awesome.

335
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,440
Rym: What's wrong with you?

336
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:24,053
Scott: They suck.

337
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,880
Scott: I mean, they're probably cool guys, but their show sucks.

338
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,780
Rym: Actually, I hear on good authority from multiple people that, you know, Amir is actually really awesome in person.

339
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:33,960
Scott: I'm pretty sure he is awesome.

340
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:34,940
Scott: His show sucks.

341
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,240
Rym: I hear that Jake in person is actually a complete douchebag.

342
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,660
Scott: That may be true also, but their show sucks.

343
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,438
Rym: I don't know.

344
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:44,300
Scott: I think it's really funny because it- It says nothing about them as people.

345
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,600
Scott: Just like, you know, there are lots of cool people who make shitty shows and there are actually lots of uncool people who make good shows.

346
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,560
Scott: You know, your personality has nothing to do with the work.

347
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Scott: No, I'm saying I don't know why- It's the Michael Jackson syndrome.

348
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,040
Scott: He plays little boys and he makes amazing music and dances.

349
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,080
Scott: Mike Tyson can beat the shit out of people, but he's a piece of shit himself.

350
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,380
Scott: You said rape play.

351
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,340
Rym: You didn't say rape or play.

352
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:05,520
Rym: You said rape play.

353
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:05,975
Scott: He does both.

354
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
Rym: Wasn't that the name of that game?

355
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:08,733
Scott: Yes.

356
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:11,940
Scott: Michael Jackson made that game.

357
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,260
Rym: So anyway, this is a Mario wrap set to a much less- I don't think a lot of people even know this Mario exists anymore.

358
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:25,159
Scott: Yeah, the Game Boy, you know, it's really weird because of the way things have turned out with Nintendo's portable stuff.

359
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,700
Scott: You know, the NES stuff, right, it seems to last forever because people can emulate it.

360
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,269
Scott: It's the most easily emulated thing.

361
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,200
Scott: and they got the virtual console, right?

362
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:41,960
Scott: And, you know, the GBA is sticking around because DS's have GBA slots and such and such.

363
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:52,359
Scott: But Game Boy and Game Boy Color games have really sort of faded into history and only people who were around and had those games remember them.

364
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,220
Scott: And especially if something is an obscure Game Boy game, there were a shit ton of regular non-Color Game Boy games.

365
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:58,777
Scott: A lot.

366
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,600
Scott: There was like a Hunt for Red October game.

367
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,559
Rym: I was about to bring that up.

368
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,671
Scott: There was a Star Wars game.

369
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,620
Scott: Who's played Star Wars to the original Game Boy?

370
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,177
Scott: I have.

371
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,930
Rym: That Hunt for Red October is one of the most underrated, underappreciated, and in desperate need of-.

372
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,546
Rym: There was a James Bond game for the Game Boy.

373
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,220
Scott: There was a Bomberman Game Boy game.

374
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
Scott: It was like Indiana Jones Bomberman.

375
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,280
Rym: Hunt for Red October was an asymmetric information hidden multiple screens to Game Boy games.

376
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,597
Scott: There were lots of old Game Boy games that people just don't remember at all, right, except for Pokemon.

377
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:36,338
Rym: So punk kids, watch this rep and that game you're watching is on par with Mario 1 in terms of gameplay.

378
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,080
Scott: And the best Game Boy game that is lost to history is Wario 2.

379
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,440
Scott: Play Wario 2.

380
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,980
Scott: Play Wario 2.

381
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,342
Scott: Play Wario 2.

382
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:45,540
Rym: Okay.

383
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,240
Rym: Okay.

384
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,946
Scott: So someone was recently discussing, you know, how, "Oh my gosh, Avatar is the biggest movie

385
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:52,252
Scott: ever.".

386
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,780
Rym: It made like 30 million last weekend.

387
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Scott: It made like a bajillion dollars.

388
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,040
Rym: It made double what like brand new movies last weekend were making.

389
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,200
Scott: Right.

390
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:03,089
Scott: And they're talking about like, "Oh, Dark Knight, Spider-Man, these are the biggest movies ever,

391
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,637
Scott: Titanic.".

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,679
Scott: And I'm like, "Uh, those no...".

393
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,099
Scott: You know, but people always talk about the box office gross, how much money it made at the box office.

394
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:19,140
Scott: And I'm like, "Dude, those numbers are not adjusted for, you know, number of tickets sold versus price of ticket, you know, because the 3D tickets cost a lot more.

395
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,113
Scott: They're not adjusted for

396
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:20,620
Scott: inflation.".

397
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:21,854
Scott: And someone was like, "Yes, they

398
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:21,996
Scott: are.".

399
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,760
Scott: And I was like, "Oh, really?

400
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,168
Scott: I didn't know

401
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:24,331
Scott: that.".

402
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,180
Scott: So of course I go on the internet and no, they are not.

403
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:28,127
Scott: I was 100%, I was 100% right.

404
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,200
Scott: Here is the real box office numbers on this website that has them adjusted for inflation.

405
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,922
Scott: Avatar is number 21.

406
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:39,118
Scott: All right.

407
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
Scott: Let's look at the real, the real list.

408
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,460
Rym: Of course, Scott, you're going back in the day to when there was only one movie.

409
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,500
Scott: Uh, wait till you hear this list.

410
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:47,778
Scott: All right.

411
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,240
Scott: This list has a wide variety of time periods.

412
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,838
Rym: It's not going to be on there?

413
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,260
Scott: What?

414
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,100
Rym: Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger.

415
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,978
Scott: I don't know what that is.

416
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,280
Scott: Number one, I know it's a restaurant.

417
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,499
Scott: Number one, it's a movie.

418
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,420
Scott: Number one is Gone with the Wind from 1939.

419
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,699
Rym: You know what?

420
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,560
Rym: You know what I'm going to say?

421
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,280
Scott: Adjusted for inflation, one and a half billion dollars.

422
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,119
Rym: You know what I got to say?

423
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:08,349
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Rym: That movie sucks ass.

425
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,570
Scott: Number two, right?

426
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,378
Scott: Star Wars.

427
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,878
Scott: Number three, Sound of Music, E.T.

428
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,008
Scott: Ten Commandments, Titanic, Jaws, Dr.

429
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:29,816
Scott: Zhivago from 1965, The Exorcist, Snow White, 101 Dalmatians, Empire Strikes Back, which comes after 101 Dalmatians.

430
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:38,993
Scott: I just want to point this out that 101 Dalmatians made, adjusted for inflation, 20, about 13 more millions.

431
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,100
Rym: Now Scott, you're forgetting something important.

432
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,000
Rym: Avatar is still making constant money in the box office.

433
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,598
Scott: It might be higher than 21 when all is said and done.

434
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:50,400
Rym: It's got to at least make it to Titanic level because people are rewatching this thing.

435
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,100
Scott: The point is, is that when you do adjust for inflation, all right, it's like, shut up.

436
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,097
Scott: Don't tell me a movie is number one gross when it's not really number one.

437
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:02,239
Scott: when you adjust, It doesn't count.

438
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,637
Scott: Okay.

439
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,455
Scott: So all these people hyping up Dark Knight, Spider-Man, Avatar, okay, as being number one, you are wrong.

440
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:09,819
Scott: Shut the fuck up.

441
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,360
Scott: It's number 21.

442
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,453
Scott: Okay.

443
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,857
Scott: Call me back when it's really number one.

444
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,861
Rym: You're number 10.

445
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:16,240
Scott: That's right.

446
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:17,020
Rym: Number 10.

447
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,960
Scott: Not even number 10.

448
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,979
Scott: Number 10 is Snow White.

449
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:20,799
Scott: Until you beat Snow White, then call me.

450
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:21,938
Scott: Okay.

451
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,020
Scott: Otherwise, you didn't break any records.

452
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:29,340
Rym: Seriously, have you ever actually seen Gone with the Wind all the way through?

453
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,560
Scott: I saw about half of it one time when it was on after The King and I on the classic movie.

454
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,879
Rym: Do you really think you saw half?

455
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,040
Rym: How far did you get?

456
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,379
Rym: Because I don't think you realize how fucking long that movie goes on.

457
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,018
Scott: According to the TV guide, I was halfway through.

458
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,418
Rym: Maybe edited for TV?

459
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:49,720
Scott: No, I mean, it was, you know, they don't show commercials in the classic movie channel.

460
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,940
Rym: When I was in high school, we had a party.

461
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,640
Rym: We had 10 people over a whole weekend.

462
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:57,552
Rym: Everyone could bring one movie and the rule was everybody had to watch it no matter what it was.

463
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,960
Rym: I would have brought, uh, one guy brought Debbie Does Dallas.

464
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,357
Rym: That was, that was horrifying.

465
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,759
Rym: I brought Dominion Tank Police.

466
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:06,559
Scott: That was not a movie.

467
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,620
Scott: That's multiple episodes.

468
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,480
Scott: You only have to watch one episode and we can turn it off.

469
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,958
Rym: But we did that.

470
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,838
Rym: Everyone really liked it.

471
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,240
Rym: You know, the third movie was Gone with the Wind.

472
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:15,099
Rym: Everyone went home about halfway through.

473
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:16,219
Rym: That was the end of the party.

474
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,019
Scott: Yeah, I would have brought that movie so much.

475
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,360
Scott: I would have brought Hard Rock Zombies.

476
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,139
Rym: I don't know if I could ever watch that again.

477
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,860
Scott: Or perhaps like Each of the Killer or something along those lines.

478
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,199
Scott: Ebola, you know, one of the, I would have brought something like that.

479
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,999
Scott: The kind of thing that no one will ever watch.

480
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,819
Scott: If they're Odin.

481
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:34,935
Rym: I believe you mean Odin.

482
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:37,640
Scott: No, maybe I'd go light.

483
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,899
Scott: I would bring, you know, Odin Starlight Mutiny instead of bringing Odin Photon Space Sailor Starlight.

484
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:48,300
Rym: So I believe, so we don't forget, we should at least do the meta Musel.

485
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,260
Scott: Do we have any meta at all besides conventions?

486
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:52,839
Rym: PAX East will be there.

487
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,120
Rym: We're doing four or five panels plus other stuff.

488
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,500
Rym: Anime Boston will be there.

489
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Rym: We're doing between four and seven panels.

490
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:02,339
Rym: Nexus will probably be there.

491
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,680
Scott: Not doing any panels.

492
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,200
Rym: No, but we might, I'm going to try to get in as press.

493
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,740
Scott: Mocha will be there one day, walking around, looking at comics, buying comics.

494
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,500
Rym: Walking around, looking around, spending money.

495
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:11,971
Scott: Yep.

496
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,558
Rym: You know what?

497
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,500
Rym: This is bad.

498
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,660
Rym: The last Mocha, I very consciously chose not to buy many things because I didn't want to carry them around in the city the rest of the day.

499
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:23,520
Rym: Now I'm done.

500
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,980
Rym: I'm just going to walk into every booth.

501
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,240
Scott: The thing is, like after the first year at Mocha, I decided that every year after I would just buy anything that was even slightly.

502
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,500
Scott: And the thing is, I've never actually done that.

503
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,380
Scott: I'm going to go this year, like totally uninhibited.

504
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:39,300
Scott: Just I'm actually going to buy anything that's quality.

505
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,157
Rym: I feel like I should just go to every booth that looks cool and be like, here's 100 bucks.

506
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,958
Rym: Give me whatever you think that's worth.

507
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:49,299
Rym: I haven't even read all the comics I've got from the last Mocha.

508
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:50,206
Scott: Yeah, we've got.

509
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,340
Scott: we've got, I guess, a new book club.

510
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,720
Scott: But this is a book club episode.

511
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,319
Scott: Oh, crap.

512
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:55,698
Rym: So I guess I have to pick the book.

513
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:58,700
Scott: Were we going to decide on a different method for picking or are you going to pick?

514
00:24:59,122 --> 00:24:59,440
Rym: I don't know.

515
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,418
Rym: Let's decide at the end.

516
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:00,892
Scott: OK.

517
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:01,699
Rym: All right.

518
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,276
Scott: All right.

519
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:02,957
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

520
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:04,305
Rym: OK.

521
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,359
Rym: So the Hitchhiker's Guide, you know what I did not know?

522
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:07,879
Rym: What?

523
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,993
Rym: That book was published in the 70s.

524
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:10,358
Scott: I knew that.

525
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:12,560
Rym: I kind of assumed it was from the 80s when I was a kid.

526
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:13,239
Rym: I just didn't know.

527
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,300
Rym: I didn't I never cared.

528
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,200
Rym: I didn't think about it.

529
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,659
Scott: The first thing I want to say about the book is at least in my edition of it, there was a forward by Neil Gaiman.

530
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,860
Scott: I think it was by Neil Gaiman.

531
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,395
Rym: It has to be.

532
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:21,956
Rym: It was by.

533
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,400
Scott: All right.

534
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,240
Scott: But regardless of who it was by, it pretty much explains like radio show came first.

535
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:31,380
Scott: You know, TV series, this movie, that was based on this.

536
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,918
Scott: This is the order they came out in.

537
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:35,320
Scott: You know, we know that they weren't the same.

538
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,780
Scott: We don't care that, you know, the differences around purpose, yada, yada, yada.

539
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,960
Scott: And, you know, you can read that forward for yourself somewhere.

540
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:53,098
Scott: But the point is, I thought that was really good because you don't often get that that, you know, open, you know, no holding back explanation of adaptations and what order they came in.

541
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,694
Scott: And, you know, did the actual creator care about the differences or were they happy with them?

542
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,200
Scott: And the fact that they actually give you that, at least in the edition I had, was very nice.

543
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:14,559
Scott: I liked it a lot and it actually sort of helped me, you know, understand the book better and like, OK, I know there was a radio show and this is just a book of the radio show with changes made because it's not a radio show.

544
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
Rym: See, now, that's another interesting point.

545
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:19,199
Rym: I was exposed to the radio show as a kid way before I read the book.

546
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,860
Rym: And when I finally was like, there's a book, I'll read it.

547
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,160
Rym: And the whole time I thought, wow, it's cool to read the original.

548
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,578
Rym: And I did not know it.

549
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,380
Scott: You always think that a book is the original.

550
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,680
Rym: Yeah, I did not know until very recently that the radio drama actually did come first.

551
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:38,339
Scott: Yeah, it's even weirder now, like with animes and mangas, because you have those ones that are based on a light novel.

552
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:41,960
Scott: But then there's people coming out with like Full Metal Alchemist, the novel.

553
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:42,892
Scott: But there is no way.

554
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:43,480
Scott: that was first.

555
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,420
Scott: The manga was first.

556
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:50,288
Scott: You know, it's very difficult to tell what was first without looking in the front like flap of every freaking thing.

557
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,917
Rym: you are just going down to my news network and be like, what came first?

558
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,719
Scott: Yeah, even so, it's it's tricky.

559
00:26:56,261 --> 00:27:06,339
Rym: Plus, you can usually tell if it's like I have a Sailor Moon manga that I picked up somewhere at a con and then I have a Sailor Moon novel and Sailor Moon novel is written by a cat's friend.

560
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,937
Rym: Yes, it was.

561
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:13,199
Rym: And I'm pretty sure the comic was based on the novel, which was itself based on the cartoon, which was itself based on the manga.

562
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:16,339
Rym: And none of them are really in any way similar to each other.

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,740
Scott: OK, so anyway, Hitchhiker's Guide.

564
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Scott: Well, first thing I have to say about it is that it was very short, like it literally took me two nights to read.

565
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,740
Scott: But that's only because I barely read each night.

566
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,080
Scott: If I would have actually kept reading, you know, it takes almost no time to read.

567
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,520
Rym: Well, when I picked it up to read again, you know, I had this old collection of like the five books and I'd only ever read a few of them.

568
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,858
Rym: So I just had this book like beat up playing around and I didn't realize until I finished it how short it was.

569
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:46,198
Scott: Well, that's the reason that I picked it in the first place is because I'm like, OK, people don't read.

570
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,539
Scott: We need to get people to read.

571
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,800
Scott: Let's, you know, do the build up strategy like you do when you're trying to quit smoking with the, you know, Nicorette you build down.

572
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Scott: I'm like, well, build up, read this freaking tiny ass book.

573
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,600
Scott: And next time we'll read a slightly larger book and a slightly larger book until you can read a big book like a grown up.

574
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,200
Rym: I get this feeling that most of the listeners are not reading any books we tell them to.

575
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,119
Rym: They're just if they've already read the book we talk about, they look forward to the book club shows.

576
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,859
Scott: Some people did say they were rereading the book.

577
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:22,820
Rym: You know, the thing is, it almost every time in my life until now when I've reread a book, I got something I didn't get before or like I got some.

578
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,577
Rym: Are you kidding me?

579
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,162
Scott: It was.

580
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:27,260
Scott: I just rewatched Macross, which I'll talk about in another episode.

581
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:28,104
Scott: But it was.

582
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:31,258
Scott: it was like 10 times the power of when I rewatched Ava.

583
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,800
Rym: Yeah, but even Ava, we rewatched Ava.

584
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,394
Rym: It was like a whole new thing, like, oh, right.

585
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,760
Rym: This is game changing.

586
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,798
Scott: I forgot.

587
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:43,199
Rym: But reading Hitchhiker's Guide, it was like, yep, this is exactly how I remember it.

588
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,118
Rym: This is this is everything I remembered it to be.

589
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,520
Scott: See, the thing is, I basically didn't remember, but I forgot some details like minor stuff.

590
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:04,299
Rym: But I realized like the only revelation I had was completely meta that in geek and nerd culture, like I know how ubiquitous the Hitchhiker's Guide is, like everyone knows of it in some capacity.

591
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:15,520
Rym: But I thought and reflected on just how amazingly frequently it is referenced to a degree that you don't even notice when it's referenced because it's referenced so often by everybody.

592
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:25,520
Rym: I mean, like even way back, like every time I do something in the database, like in a development environment, if I make a user, he's been called Ford Prefect my whole life and I continue to do that.

593
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,158
Rym: There's a Ford Prefect user and like everything I do at my current job.

594
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,855
Scott: Yep.

595
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:40,395
Rym: Well, that's that's the only insight I had beyond what I had as a kid, that I didn't realize quite the scope of how frequently it is referenced in every nerd and geek media there is.

596
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:49,780
Scott: I mean, the one thing that really stood out to me in reading it is that, I mean, it's supposed to be primarily a comedy, right?

597
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:51,360
Scott: You know, it's supposed to be funny.

598
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:52,760
Scott: That's that's what it's all about.

599
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,959
Scott: It's all about being hilarious.

600
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,900
Scott: I mean, on the front cover is this green planet with his tongue hanging out and he's like thumbing is, you know, he's like, you know, nose at you or whatever.

601
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,180
Scott: It's supposed to be a comedy.

602
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,638
Scott: It's like, tada, here is comedy for you.

603
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:06,459
Scott: It's not funny.

604
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,000
Scott: Like, I didn't laugh at all.

605
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,279
Rym: I laughed out loud even rereading it.

606
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,839
Scott: Oh, really?

607
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,619
Scott: I don't think like it's completely not funny to me.

608
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:23,760
Scott: It's just, you know, I mean, any funny bits it has are just sort of like obvious sort of, you know, zaniness.

609
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:29,580
Scott: And it is not cleverly Monty Python humorous in any way.

610
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,159
Rym: See, they are, I think.

611
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,018
Rym: I don't think so.

612
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,760
Rym: Part of it is that it comes from the radio show.

613
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:42,287
Rym: And if you like listen to the radio show, when I read it, I kind of always hear it like all the dialogue in the same kind of cadence that the radio show had, where the timing of the like.

614
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,480
Rym: there are two levels of the comedy.

615
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,466
Rym: One is the timing of the dialogue, like listening to the dialogue at a spoken pace in your mind while you're reading.

616
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:50,879
Rym: it is half the humor of the book.

617
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:56,180
Rym: Not what's being said, but like the timing of who says what when and how people react to things.

618
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:08,579
Rym: And notice how people always kind of react to things by meeping or squelching or like very like the way the straight man in a Monty Python skit reacts when everybody around him spontaneously dies like it.

619
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,900
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

620
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:16,760
Rym: And the second half is it's kind of like I think Dave Barry wrote it Big Trouble, which is a more recent book.

621
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:24,400
Rym: I read it a long time ago, but I was reminded of it a lot again because it's the same kind of all the humor aside from the timing humor is the meta.

622
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:31,178
Rym: It's like in the dialogue and the phrasing and the writing itself is the humor, like the reading of it.

623
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,519
Rym: The humor is there.

624
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,820
Rym: The humor is not so much in the plot of the story.

625
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,780
Rym: It's in the meta of like the reading of it and the way it's written and the phrasing.

626
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:41,299
Rym: And it's in the humor of listening to the dialogue in your head.

627
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,399
Rym: The story itself isn't funny.

628
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,959
Scott: Just reading the book, I didn't laugh like at all, not once.

629
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:57,640
Scott: And, you know, I mean, there were things that I could see that were supposed to be funny, like, oh, he has a funny name or oh, that's so outlandish, it should be humorous.

630
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,420
Scott: But it was not humorous.

631
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,338
Scott: I was not lolling.

632
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,877
Scott: I don't know.

633
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,740
Rym: I just I don't think you pictured enough in your head.

634
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,060
Rym: If you listen to the radio drama again, I'll bet you'd laugh out loud.

635
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:06,940
Scott: It's possible.

636
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:09,800
Scott: I'm just saying, reading the book, I've got it laying around somewhere.

637
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,860
Scott: I'm sure I'm sure it's everywhere on the Internet.

638
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:13,519
Scott: If I want it, I got it.

639
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,520
Scott: But I'm just saying, reading the book, not funny.

640
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:20,112
Scott: I was not the only not funny thing at all.

641
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,560
Rym: that comes up is, again, 100 percent meta.

642
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:42,960
Rym: I have this problem where all the quotable lines from the entire novel and probably from the entire series, I'm so used to really boring nerds quoting them at me and pretending that is social currency that every time I read like every third or fourth paragraph, like the line about the pangalactic gargle blaster or the I don't know, the Vogons, anything.

643
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,579
Rym: It's just I picture the boring nerd who's quoting it at me to prove that he's read the same thing that I've read.

644
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,700
Scott: You know, I think that is true to some extent.

645
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,059
Scott: For example, you know, there's all the typical cliche things from this book, you know.

646
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:57,900
Scott: Oh, 42 is, you know, answer life universe and everything.

647
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,400
Scott: And, you know, all you know, all that stuff.

648
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:00,740
Scott: Right.

649
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,600
Scott: And the thing is, you read it and it's like they basically all the things, you know, are lined up one after the other.

650
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,418
Scott: Like, oh, there's that one.

651
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:07,318
Scott: There's that one.

652
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,300
Rym: In a way, it's that one.

653
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,240
Rym: It's a lot like rewatching a Monty Python movie.

654
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,620
Rym: I mean, you know, the whole thing by heart already.

655
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,339
Rym: It's just every memorable line one by one in a row.

656
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,499
Scott: But holy grail is still funny every time.

657
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Rym: Just because it's been a long time.

658
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:18,579
Scott: I don't know.

659
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,660
Scott: But basically it's like, you know, they show up as like there's that one.

660
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,679
Scott: I'm sure that if I had read this cold, I didn't know it already that it might be.

661
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,419
Rym: Well, there was a time when you did that.

662
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,100
Rym: Was it hilarious when you were a kid?

663
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,759
Scott: I don't remember.

664
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,177
Rym: Really?

665
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,340
Scott: I remember that I read like all of the ones in Future King.

666
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:42,260
Scott: But if you quiz me out on like Arthurian legend, I know like I didn't even know that Excalibur and the sword in the stone weren't the same.

667
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,820
Rym: So Scott, all right, Scott, question one.

668
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:44,599
Rym: Who was Arthur?

669
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,397
Scott: The king.

670
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:46,998
Rym: What was he the king of?

671
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,836
Scott: England.

672
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,396
Scott: Oh, no, Albion.

673
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,071
Scott: Albion.

674
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:53,160
Rym: Are you sure?

675
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:53,928
Scott: Albion.

676
00:33:57,684 --> 00:33:58,273
Rym: I'm not even going to.

677
00:33:58,846 --> 00:33:59,059
Scott: Okay.

678
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,459
Rym: I was going somewhere else with that, but you kind of just went right off the track.

679
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:04,995
Rym: But it's got it.

680
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,580
Rym: The humor is really the Britons.

681
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:12,335
Rym: That's not that's that's right.

682
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,099
Scott: I think I'm funnier than this book.

683
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,576
Rym: The book is funny, though.

684
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:25,500
Rym: I think the next book club should be listen to the radio drama.

685
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:26,672
Scott: No, no, no.

686
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,780
Scott: All right, fine.

687
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:29,628
Rym: The radio club is now.

688
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,040
Rym: listen to the radio drama of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

689
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,358
Scott: If you have to do a radio club, you do the shadow first.

690
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:39,800
Rym: No, the shadow is good, but it's also really, really, really cheesy and corny.

691
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,617
Scott: What's wrong with you?

692
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:42,938
Rym: Have you listened to the shadow in recent memory?

693
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,239
Rym: Do you remember the one with the volcano?

694
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:46,038
Rym: No.

695
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Rym: The magnetic volcano that was pulling airplanes out of the sky?

696
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:49,716
Rym: No.

697
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:50,699
Rym: I have that on vinyl.

698
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:51,378
Scott: Oh, man.

699
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,458
Rym: It's I love the shadow, Scott, but I'm going to say straight up.

700
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,999
Rym: The shadow is the oral equivalent of I'll hit you now, you little guy.

701
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,477
Scott: Don't you agree?

702
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,300
Scott: But that actually works in a radio drama.

703
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,200
Rym: No, it doesn't.

704
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,720
Rym: Because you hear like, oh, no, you're not.

705
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,479
Rym: You're not also looking at a picture of him hitting the little guy with a line pointing in an arrow that says he is hitting the little guy.

706
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,098
Rym: That's right.

707
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,300
Rym: And then it cuts to Professor Xavier saying, oh, no, he's hitting the little guy.

708
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,800
Scott: That means that I'm using my psychic powers just to determine.

709
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:22,580
Scott: Oh, my God.

710
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,359
Scott: He's hitting the little guy.

711
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,219
Rym: But then you says, yes, the little guy has been hit.

712
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:28,538
Scott: Oh, Zoe.

713
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:30,719
Rym: Okay.

714
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,140
Rym: But it's like, listen to the shadow.

715
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:36,980
Rym: Oh, no, I am stuck to the wall of the volcano because everything is magnetic.

716
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,260
Rym: I know I'll take my belt off and then I'll be able to get away.

717
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,800
Rym: No, says the shadow.

718
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:45,180
Rym: If you take your belt off and blah, blah, blah, then you electrify yourself.

719
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,519
Rym: No, I will be fine.

720
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,000
Scott: Are you looking at a script of the shadow?

721
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,539
Rym: No, I just listened to this one like a million times as a kid.

722
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:55,939
Rym: Oh, no, he has been electrified and he is now dead.

723
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,178
Rym: That is what it's like.

724
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:01,178
Scott: Cool sound effects, though.

725
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:03,180
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Scott: Okay, so Hitchhiker's Guide, regardless of its lack or presence of comedy.

727
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:10,398
Rym: I still say it's hilarious.

728
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,560
Rym: It's just it's blunted for a lot of people by the fact that nerds quoted at them all the time.

729
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:26,860
Scott: I actually think that the sci-fi part of it is actually like slightly interesting and above average, like, you know, this whole idea that there was a planet of people who made planets and doing this experiment.

730
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,978
Rym: Yes, by the way, spoilers, you know, it's the book.

731
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:34,958
Scott: God, we spoiled the incredibly tiny first book in a multiple series of books that you were supposed to read.

732
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:36,737
Rym: Oh, no.

733
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,333
Rym: Yeah.

734
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,016
Scott: Book that everyone already read when I was a kid has been around for 30, 40 years.

735
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,280
Rym: If you somehow haven't read it, you stop listening because I'm about to spoil the fact that the mice just fucking make up the answer in the end.

736
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:47,980
Rym: And that's hilarious.

737
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:48,938
Scott: Yeah, right.

738
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,691
Rym: You know, but just the whole the earth is.

739
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:59,680
Rym: the computer is one of those things that in a sci-fi like dead serious movie would be obvious from the start.

740
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,740
Rym: And when it happened, you like, oh, really?

741
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:10,100
Rym: But in this, because it builds itself as a comedy, I think the sci-fi aspects kind of slip under the radar and as a result, almost have more impact.

742
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:20,039
Scott: I think another reason that it has more impact is that, you know, in a sci-fi movie, like, you know, they'd be like, you know, at the beginning, they'd be like, oh, what is it?

743
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,318
Scott: And that at the end, they'd be like, it was this.

744
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:25,620
Scott: Whereas in Hitchhiker's Guide, it's like you're just on this adventure.

745
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,720
Scott: And then at the end, they're like, what was it?

746
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,979
Scott: It was this just at the end.

747
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:30,558
Scott: They don't go.

748
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,700
Scott: What was it at the beginning?

749
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,480
Scott: So you're not even looking for this mystery.

750
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:43,420
Scott: So it doesn't come out as obvious and cliched because they just throw it at you at the end and they can throw it at you at the end because they're not presenting themselves as serious and they're presenting it as serious.

751
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,639
Scott: You couldn't do get away with that.

752
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,440
Scott: It would just be a Dave's Ex Machina.

753
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,880
Scott: Fuck you throwing me complete softball at left field at the end.

754
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,900
Scott: But when you're presenting yourself as hilarious comedy, you just do whatever you want at any on time, completely spontaneous, zany randomness.

755
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,240
Scott: So the result is you can throw in spontaneous, random, zany, serious sci-fi ad in left field.

756
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,018
Scott: And it totally works.

757
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,379
Rym: Actually, when I think about it, the Heart of Gold reading it again, as soon as I like, I cut.

758
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,637
Rym: It's weird how I remembered the whole book, but I didn't remember a lot like the ship Heart of Gold.

759
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,559
Rym: Hyperion.

760
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,780
Rym: It reminded me of the ship they use in Hyperion for some reason.

761
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:21,820
Rym: And I kept thinking about Hyperion the whole time I read it as a result.

762
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,840
Scott: I didn't think about Hyperion at all.

763
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,060
Rym: But maybe that's just because you went full Hyperion in that thread in the forum.

764
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,239
Rym: And ever since then, I've been thinking about Hyperion every day.

765
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,119
Scott: Actually, strangely, I imagine the ship looking like the really silvery looking ship the princess has in episode one and two.

766
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,440
Scott: I don't know why I thought that way, but whatever.

767
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:45,611
Rym: Yeah, I will say I really like.

768
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,800
Rym: Zafar to this day is one of my favorite characters.

769
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:58,859
Rym: He is definitely an awesome dude because he has the perfect blend of awesome and Captain Tyler and doesn't give a shit, but also does give a shit, but tries to pretend he doesn't and is also not a moron.

770
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,738
Rym: What was the line?

771
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:11,439
Rym: It's one of the lines that no one ever quotes, but it spoke to me maybe because I just watched Tyler, but something along the lines of most of his success was probably due to the fact that he never quite understood the ramifications of what he had just done.

772
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:21,520
Scott: Yeah, I did that sort of thing is one thing that makes the book incredibly tolerable is the fact that, you know, there's no like retards in it.

773
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:30,098
Scott: You know, that's the one thing that bothers me about a lot of books is when you have a character who is just fucking stupid like they're just there things they could do that they don't do.

774
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,379
Rym: Wait, wait, Kaji, you gave him the thing.

775
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:33,440
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

776
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,930
Rym: Well, that was what you gave him the thing.

777
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:36,319
Rym: you gave him the thing.

778
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,688
Scott: Yeah, there are not like gigantic, you know, despite being zany, there aren't really plot holes or, you know, such.

779
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,719
Scott: it's like characters are doing what they can do.

780
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,700
Scott: You know, they're not doing things that are stupid.

781
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,977
Scott: They're doing the best they can with what they've got available most of the time, considering the circumstances and what they know and such and such.

782
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:03,139
Scott: And, you know, having Hitchhiker's Guide that tells you all sorts of stuff help make prevents you from being a moron in a lot of ways, as long as you remember to use it.

783
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,219
Scott: Too bad I have a hard time believing that looking at how much of the real world doesn't know how to use Google.

784
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:13,937
Scott: I don't have a lot of confidence that the real world would be smarter if everyone in Hitchhiker's Guide.

785
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,917
Scott: We already do.

786
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:17,880
Rym: Urban Dictionary plus Wikipedia plus WikiHow.

787
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,477
Rym: You've got it.

788
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:19,565
Rym: I've got.

789
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:21,620
Rym: my pre is basically the Hitchhiker's Guide.

790
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,419
Scott: And yet people are still morons and they don't use it.

791
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,740
Rym: Well, because it gives you information.

792
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,180
Rym: You see, but you do not witness.

793
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,460
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

794
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:37,040
Rym: There's not a lot to say about the Hitchhiker's Guide other than it's important.

795
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,419
Scott: Yeah, it's a book that I thought would be, oh, this is gonna be such a great book club book, but it's like, well, what, you know?

796
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,340
Scott: Sure, it was great for getting people to read.

797
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,919
Scott: Is it great for talking about?

798
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,567
Rym: Movies you should see.

799
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:52,140
Rym: whenever they talked about a movie that they love that was a comedy like Ferris Bueller or something, they descend into a quote fest.

800
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,719
Rym: But I almost it's weird.

801
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:03,559
Rym: I avoid quoting the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy wherever possible because quoting it in public is often associated with the boring nerd who doesn't have anything more reason to quote.

802
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,630
Scott: Yeah, I think the other thing is that it's really.

803
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,818
Scott: it's one of those things where, you know, it's good.

804
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:13,240
Scott: It's not like, oh, my God, is the most amazing thing ever.

805
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:14,405
Rym: Well, it was.

806
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:20,180
Rym: it definitely had to have been game changing when it came out because I absolutely look at the absolute look at the ripple.

807
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:26,740
Scott: Yes, but, you know, I think part of it was, you know, right thing, right time, right delivery, right situation.

808
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:32,300
Scott: You know, it wasn't all, you know, the quality is not, you know, a plus.

809
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:38,225
Scott: You know, you judge it based on the quality of its if its innate qualities alone, it is like, you know, B plus.

810
00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:43,860
Scott: what's really interesting is you also take into account the time it came out, you know, this and that and all these other things.

811
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,159
Scott: Then that's what raises it to that next level.

812
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:52,017
Rym: What's interesting is I just read the forward from, you know, Burke, the guy who did Bloom County and all that.

813
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:58,480
Rym: Yeah, he wrote the forward to the rereleased anthology and he basically admits straight up that it wasn't the greatest comic.

814
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:11,420
Rym: And the reason it was so popular and successful was that it was just before there was an Internet, really, and it was different at the time, just enough to break all these boundaries and be remembered.

815
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,100
Rym: But there was no Internet where everything was equally breaking boundaries and it would have just been one of a million.

816
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:18,179
Rym: That's true.

817
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:27,040
Rym: And then he says straight up, I was only a success because I just happened to do the right thing at the right time just before the Internet made what I was doing the norm as opposed to the exception.

818
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,480
Scott: And I think that something is that is absolutely true.

819
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:41,920
Scott: And I think that when something becomes sort of, you know, beloved and remembered and revered the way that Douglas Adams and the Hitchhiker's Guide is, it is very difficult to disparage in any way.

820
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,780
Scott: People will be like, oh, no, it's so beloved.

821
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,920
Scott: It's it's the best effort.

822
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,740
Rym: The thing is, I have nothing bad to say about it.

823
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,325
Rym: It's just.

824
00:42:47,346 --> 00:42:48,540
Scott: it's not as bad to say about it.

825
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,220
Scott: It's just that it's the same as Monty Python.

826
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,440
Scott: I think, you know, yeah, if you judged it based on its merit alone as a book, you know, the book only and only the books merits on its own.

827
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,899
Scott: That's it, you know, independently of anything else.

828
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:09,440
Rym: Well, you can't do that if you have to also take into consideration when it was and what else existed at the time to consume.

829
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,100
Scott: No, no, but I'm like, look, if you're you know, we're talking about the present day, we're not traveling back in time here.

830
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,139
Scott: If someone's going to the bookstore to buy a book.

831
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:16,940
Scott: Right.

832
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:19,580
Scott: And there's like, which book will be enjoyable?

833
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:30,638
Scott: I'll be like, well, this Hitchhiker's Guide book, you might think it's funny and it's a quick read and it's kind of quirky, but you'll probably be far more entertained by these other books over here.

834
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,068
Rym: Well, that's just that.

835
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,920
Rym: it's the whole, you know, right time, right place.

836
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,360
Rym: Bloom County, if it appeared today as a webcomic, no one would give a shit.

837
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:37,984
Scott: It'd be.

838
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,340
Scott: it'd be an OK-ish webcomic.

839
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:39,823
Rym: Yeah, but it would.

840
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:41,760
Rym: it would be one a speck among millions.

841
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,620
Rym: It wouldn't be like the memorable thing that has these repeated reprints of anthologies and like it's considered an important part of 80s culture.

842
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,460
Scott: Even Penny Arcade.

843
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,679
Scott: I don't think they've reprinted any of the volumes.

844
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,699
Rym: Yeah, of course, Penny Arcade is the kind of thing where everyone who cares bought it.

845
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,250
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

846
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:09,370
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

847
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,770
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

848
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,690
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

849
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,450
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

850
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,966
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

851
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,270
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

852
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,390
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
