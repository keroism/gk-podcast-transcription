1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,409
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 7th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:10,630
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,000
Rym: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,367
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,760
Rym: Tonight we talk about a bunch of anime.

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,858
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,100
Rym: Tonight we have three mini reviews.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,500
Rym: Drops of God, Welcome to the Space Show, and Children who chase lost voices from deep below.

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,420
Rym: I'm thinking about not paying for Xbox Live Gold anymore.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,184
Scott: Really?

11
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,360
Rym: Because I realize they don't use it for anything.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,800
Rym: Except, I guess, leaderboards and the Netflix thing.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,980
Rym: And they basically fucked the Netflix thing.

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,080
Scott: I haven't checked out the Netflix thing.

15
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:51,420
Rym: I haven't actually checked out the new one, but all the people noted the exact changes they made.

16
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:55,440
Rym: Seems like they just made it worse with no benefit whatsoever.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,860
Rym: And I already have a computer hooked up to my TV running Boxxy.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,720
Scott: Well, I've got it for a while, you know, without having to pay again.

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,758
Rym: I still have it for a while, but I see no reason to renew it.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,019
Scott: Well, you know, it's like, you say that, and then eventually you get a game that has multiplayer, like Street Fighter or something, and you're like, "Oh,

21
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:13,240
Scott: fuck.".

22
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:17,114
Rym: Playing Street Fighter online with strangers was never fun.

23
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:18,400
Rym: It's really only fun to play it in person.

24
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,580
Scott: I played it online with non-strangers.

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,198
Rym: Do you still do that?

26
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:21,754
Scott: No.

27
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:22,328
Rym: Uh-huh.

28
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,180
Scott: But you never know.

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,020
Rym: When was the last time you used Xbox Live Gold for anything?

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,780
Scott: I Netflixed something.

31
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:32,670
Scott: Netflix?

32
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,500
Rym: Don't you have a computer?

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:33,928
Rym: Yeah.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,839
Rym: Is it running Windows?

35
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:35,232
Rym: Yeah.

36
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:35,615
Scott: Huh.

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,960
Scott: I use whichever one is already switched, so I need to reduce switching.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,334
Rym: I do have this trouble that...

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,791
Scott: If the computer's currently switched, I'll use that.

40
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:44,359
Scott: If the Xbox is currently switched, I'll use that.

41
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:57,040
Rym: You do still need the computer, the actual normal computer with a real web browser hooked up to the TV, because so many online services are going further and further into preventing things like Boxxy from actually showing their content.

42
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:05,020
Rym: Or like Hulu, there's a Boxxy app, but if you watch Hulu through the Boxxy app, the commercials are a billion decibels and cannot be muted or made quieter.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,219
Rym: Doesn't that happen on regular Hulu?

44
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:06,812
Rym: No.

45
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,330
Scott: What do you mean?

46
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,120
Scott: they can't be muted?

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,060
Rym: So the volume control on the remote is disabled in Boxxy.

48
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,039
Scott: Why don't you push mute on your TV?

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,720
Rym: Because that's a different remote.

50
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:17,738
Scott: Oh, no.

51
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:22,920
Rym: That remote is basically like a vestigial feature of my television at this point.

52
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:32,320
Scott: I have a separate remote just for controlling my little speaker system, and the mute button is perhaps the second most used button after the power button.

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,143
Rym: But think about this.

54
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:37,840
Rym: So if you go to the website and just hit play, it just works fine, and you can do whatever you want.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,340
Rym: But if you use Boxxy, they actively remove a feature of Boxxy in the misguided attempt to get you to pay attention to the shitty commercial?

56
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:49,858
Scott: Yeah.

57
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,120
Rym: The moral is hook up a computer to your TV, because no device that isn't a computer.

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,479
Scott: We said that about a billion times.

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,280
Rym: Yeah, but it bears repeating.

60
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,840
Rym: Okay.

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,980
Rym: Plus, we say it usually on Monday, and this is Wednesday.

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,420
Rym: Wednesday is when the people listening to Wednesday GeekNights are the ones who tend to watch a lot of stuff on their TV via a computer.

63
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,160
Scott: Get a real, dedicated, real computer connected to your television in your living room.

64
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:17,029
Scott: If you want to play games, get a real Windows computer.

65
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,760
Scott: If you don't care about playing games on it at all, then you can get a Mac Mini if you want.

66
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,198
Rym: Yeah, you can.

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,940
Scott: But a Windows computer is better.

68
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:27,280
Rym: Except for the hardware, by and large.

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,586
Scott: Yeah, but whatever.

70
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,480
Scott: It'll be bigger and less quiet.

71
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,633
Rym: So, I guess your news is the only real news, so I'm going to start with the Geek Byte.

72
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:37,840
Rym: We'll do something happy before we do something sad.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,939
Rym: Wolverine and the X-Men.

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,859
Scott: Wolverine, oh shit.

75
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,040
Rym: Oh shit, it's Wolverine.

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,580
Rym: Scott hasn't seen Wolverine and the X-Men.

77
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,720
Rym: I've watched it three times because it's actually- The whole show?

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,400
Rym: Yes, it's actually- How many episodes is it?

79
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:55,820
Rym: It's actually pretty fucking good.

80
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,420
Scott: You've watched 26 episodes three times.

81
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,273
Rym: I've also watched Madoka three times.

82
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:00,636
Rym: It's 13 episodes.

83
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,499
Rym: I've seen Utena, I don't know, five times?

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:03,762
Scott: What?

85
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,120
Scott: I haven't seen Utena one time.

86
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,373
Rym: I've seen Utena, really?

87
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:06,819
Rym: Only once?

88
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,820
Scott: Well, and change.

89
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,000
Rym: And change.

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,419
Rym: You've got to watch it all the way through again.

91
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:11,360
Scott: Eventually.

92
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:14,200
Scott: Ava, five.

93
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,376
Rym: Escaflowne, only three.

94
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,817
Scott: Yeah, okay.

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,697
Rym: Bebop, three.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,899
Scott: Okay.

97
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,434
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,800
Rym: But Wolverine and the X-Men is actually pretty great.

99
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,140
Rym: And the sad story of it is that it was made.

100
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,500
Rym: Steve Blum, aka the voice of Spike Spiegel, is the voice of Wolverine.

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Rym: And it's fun reversal in that the plot is basically that the X-Men all split up and separate and quit.

102
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:47,479
Rym: So Wolverine, you know, the lone badass, tough and cool, is the one who has to go and gather everyone back together and be the leader, but he doesn't want to be the leader.

103
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:48,359
Scott: Okay.

104
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:49,298
Rym: It's pretty good.

105
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
Rym: Also, Emma Frost is kind of awesome.

106
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:53,299
Scott: Not really a fan.

107
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,671
Scott: Really?

108
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:54,194
Scott: No.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,220
Rym: So do you know anything about Wolverine and the X-Men?

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,694
Rym: Like where it's at, what it's about?

111
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:00,918
Scott: I know who Emma Frost is.

112
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,230
Scott: I know who Wolverine is.

113
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,060
Scott: I know who the X-Men are.

114
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,327
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:04,556
Scott: There you go.

116
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,387
Rym: Wow.

117
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:07,300
Rym: I don't know.

118
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,659
Rym: Maybe I should get the other Scott on to review this because he was the one who showed it to me.

119
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,900
Rym: We watched it twice at the show.

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,026
Scott: You watched 52 episodes in one go?

121
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,100
Rym: Yeah, actually.

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,319
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you?

123
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,839
Rym: Because we got kind of drunk toward the end.

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
Rym: Didn't remember a lot of it.

125
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:22,439
Scott: How much time is that?

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,478
Scott: You could have been on the beach.

127
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:24,319
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

128
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,979
Rym: It was on while we were playing games.

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,316
Scott: I'm going to calculate this.

130
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:28,962
Scott: 52 times .5 is 26 friggin' hours.

131
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,999
Rym: It was only three minute episodes for one.

132
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,580
Scott: 26 hours you spent over a day of your life.

133
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,440
Rym: And you know what?

134
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,358
Rym: We were doing other stuff simultaneously.

135
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:46,959
Scott: How many days were you there?

136
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,820
Rym: The greatest.

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,739
Rym: It was like the week and a half, you know, the big trip.

138
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,500
Scott: How many days were you there?

139
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,194
Rym: I don't know.

140
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,080
Rym: Six, seven?

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,316
Scott: If you were there for seven days, that means you watched three, four, five, six.

142
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:05,837
Scott: You watched like eight episodes a day on average.

143
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,820
Rym: I think we actually skipped the first like ten, the second run through because it wasn't until ten or so in that everyone was too drunk to remember what was happening.

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,660
Scott: Okay, that's a little bit better, but still.

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,180
Rym: But anyway, Wolverine the X-Men is pretty fucking good.

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,639
Rym: And you know why I know it's good?

147
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,980
Rym: Because it completely failed financially.

148
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,520
Rym: It didn't make any money at all and the second season was cancelled.

149
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,720
Rym: Like happens, Hasbro bought the rights to the toys.

150
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,820
Scott: So by that logic, ponies is awful.

151
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,740
Rym: So ponies, while it got a second season and everything, the merchandising isn't even being attempted at this point.

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,759
Rym: Meanwhile, this show, they tried to merchandise it and then they gave up.

153
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:54,720
Rym: But I don't know what else I can say.

154
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:05,020
Rym: If you're even close to a fan of anything even vaguely related to the X-Men, this is probably the best moving visual representation of the X-Men there's ever been made.

155
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,339
Rym: I don't like the live action movies that much.

156
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,399
Rym: The original cartoon is only great if you never watch it again.

157
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,460
Scott: Wait, what do you mean original cartoon?

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,099
Rym: Well, when I say original, I mean the first one I ever saw, the 90s X-Men.

159
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,819
Scott: Yeah, there is an X-Men older than that.

160
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,362
Scott: You know what?

161
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:26,860
Rym: That's in the same category as most of M. Night Shyamalan's movies.

162
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,486
Scott: There's also Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, which has- That's on Netflix now.

163
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,200
Rym: I almost clicked on that.

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,940
Scott: It has some episodes with the X-Men, but Iceman is one of Spider-Man's amazing friends.

165
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,400
Scott: He's in almost pretty much every episode.

166
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,380
Rym: Iceman is also in Wolverine and the X-Men.

167
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,600
Scott: So one third of that is an X-Men cartoon.

168
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,860
Scott: The thing is Wolverine and the X-Men- Greater than a third because there are episodes with all the X-Men in it.

169
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,890
Rym: It is animated pretty well.

170
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,920
Rym: The voice acting is good.

171
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,440
Rym: It doesn't sound like a crappy- like it's actually good voice actors.

172
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,839
Rym: I mean Stephen Blum and all these people.

173
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,983
Rym: It's a good story.

174
00:07:56,405 --> 00:08:03,340
Rym: and of course it's Phoenix Saga because Phoenix Saga seems to be the only thing anyone ever does when they do the X-Men.

175
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,520
Scott: Because every other X-Men story is a convoluted mess that no one can understand unless they've read every X-Men comic ever.

176
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:18,800
Rym: But they did a good job of taking the kind of plot points from the actual X-Men comic and re-representing them in a way that doesn't make them seem nearly as stupid as they actually were.

177
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,120
Rym: Like Master Mold is this AI controller for the Sentinels.

178
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,840
Rym: Master Mold is not just a sentinel so big that sentinels come out of its stomach.

179
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,860
Scott: No, but that's so much more awesome!

180
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,895
Scott: See, that disappoints me.

181
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,860
Rym: The only reason to really watch this is because the MRD guys have this heads up display in their helmets.

182
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:42,232
Rym: And it's like, "Human.

183
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:42,876
Rym: Mutant."

184
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:46,040
Rym: And we decided about halfway through that they should have a third option.

185
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,779
Rym: Oh shit, it's Wolverine.

186
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,894
Scott: Okay.

187
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Rym: Scott's blasé about everything.

188
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,700
Rym: All of you should watch this and I'll review it on the show with the other better Scott who actually has taste.

189
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:56,740
Scott: All you lowbrow people.

190
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,027
Rym: This is a good show.

191
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,540
Rym: I don't know why you're so resistant to it.

192
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,100
Scott: Lowbrow.

193
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,919
Rym: Scott, you showed me a picture you linked to Madoka Magica and you were like, "Let's watch this

194
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:06,100
Rym: show.".

195
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,990
Rym: And I was like, "Fuck

196
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,192
Rym: you!".

197
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:11,240
Scott: Would you say that the show now, having seen it, is low or highbrow?

198
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,092
Rym: What?

199
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,520
Scott: What is the elevation of Madoka's brow?

200
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,740
Rym: Oh, it's a very highbrow.

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,297
Scott: There you go.

202
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,440
Rym: But I'm saying that if you judge that cover...

203
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,980
Scott: What would you say is the elevation of Wolverine's brow, having seen it?

204
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:23,620
Rym: It's an upper middle brow.

205
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,100
Scott: You don't think it's an upper middle brow?

206
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,799
Rym: It's a middle brow.

207
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:27,099
Rym: It's a middle brow?

208
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,080
Rym: Yeah, it's a middle brow.

209
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,060
Scott: Middle brow, huh?

210
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,418
Rym: It's okay.

211
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,056
Scott: You think so?

212
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,000
Rym: Scott, it is better than the average B anime.

213
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:33,834
Rym: Uh-huh.

214
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:34,290
Rym: Yeah.

215
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,520
Rym: It's better than initial D. I'm gonna say that right now.

216
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,319
Scott: It's better than initial D. What's not better than initial D?

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,900
Scott: The initial D's brow is in the dirt.

218
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,500
Scott: The initial D's brow is in the Marianas Trench.

219
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,380
Rym: It's like the difference between chocolate and shit.

220
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,279
Scott: Initial D's brow is like in China because it's just...

221
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,759
Rym: Anyway, kids, Scott's a hater.

222
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,059
Rym: Watch Wolverine and the X-Men.

223
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,080
Rym: It's on Netflix.

224
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:51,919
Rym: It's pretty great.

225
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:52,738
Rym: You'll enjoy it.

226
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:54,839
Scott: So in anime news, right?

227
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:10,880
Scott: I don't know if people know this, but we saw Satoshi Kon once when he was alive, and he had one picture on display of the movie that he was making at the time, which is called The Dream Machine, and it featured a robot or some robot people.

228
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:12,920
Scott: And I was like, "Aw, shit.

229
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,390
Scott: Can't wait for

230
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:13,617
Scott: that.".

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,520
Scott: And then a couple of years later, like last year, right?

232
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:20,159
Scott: He died, and the movie was not done.

233
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:23,800
Scott: And he said, "Hey, I did as much work as I could on this movie.

234
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,487
Scott: Finish

235
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:24,632
Scott: it.".

236
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:26,140
Scott: And then whatever.

237
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:32,297
Scott: And so Madhouse started to try to finish it, and they put a guy in charge of it, and he was working on it.

238
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,838
Scott: And then he sort of stopped working on it.

239
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:37,119
Scott: And now the website is down.

240
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,489
Scott: So it's like,

241
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:38,551
Scott: "No.".

242
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,418
Rym: Now, the saddest thing is Scott links me, his news, and I'm just going through it, preparing for the show.

243
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,319
Scott: Not reading.

244
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,099
Rym: I didn't read it.

245
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,797
Rym: I'm just clicking on the links, and I see, "Oh, Dream

246
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:48,080
Rym: Machine.".

247
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,140
Rym: And I'm looking at the screenshot, and I say something to the effect of, "Man, once this movie comes out, I don't know what I'll do, because that's it.

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,567
Rym: There's no

249
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:55,853
Rym: more.".

250
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:58,411
Rym: And then I see the headline, and I'm like, "Oh, oh,

251
00:10:59,155 --> 00:10:59,195
Rym: oh.".

252
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:05,516
Scott: So the thing is, us anime people on the Twitter, we're basically like,

253
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:05,877
Scott: "Hey.".

254
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:14,440
Scott: Basically the reason they're not going through with it is because his movies were expensive to make, because they were pretty much prestige-type things, and they didn't make a lot of money.

255
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:16,597
Scott: And they can't really afford to make it.

256
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,819
Scott: And if he's not there to push it, it's not going to happen.

257
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:20,960
Scott: Guys, kickstart that shit.

258
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,520
Scott: That's right.

259
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,400
Scott: It's like, we're all like, "Hey, don't Japanese people...".

260
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,420
Rym: I would donate a lot of money to make that, just so I can see the movie.

261
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,700
Scott: Don't Japanese people know about Kickstarter?

262
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:34,955
Scott: It's like, this would be the perfect example of someone to actually try to use Kickstarter for something big, right?

263
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,801
Scott: It's like.

264
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:41,640
Scott: most people try to use Kickstarter for something relatively small, and they only ask for some thousands.

265
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,700
Scott: They should try to kickstart this and ask for, what do they need, a million, two millions?

266
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:55,740
Scott: Ask for the millions on Kickstarter, give out amazing prizes, like top prize, $1,000 will give you a fistful of, I guess they don't have cells, but you know what I'm saying?

267
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,239
Scott: Just amazing shit.

268
00:11:57,722 --> 00:12:02,139
Scott: You know, give out the big prizes that are big, but don't actually cost them anything.

269
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,540
Rym: I guess one question is, the only factor that you really don't know is how much work is actually done on it already.

270
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:19,136
Scott: People say a third, and someone else was like, "Hey, well, if you've already done a third of the work and you're not going to finish it, just put the third of the work you've done on YouTube in its raw form, you don't give a

271
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:19,357
Scott: shit.".

272
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:24,780
Rym: Or just edit it onto a DVD and sell it for like 10 bucks as a final, you know, whatever.

273
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:28,260
Scott: Yeah, or give that as like one of the Kickstarter, just do something.

274
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:35,860
Scott: It's like, you know, these people aren't trying, you know, they're just not trying to try, you know, they just don't put any effort into it, they don't give a shit.

275
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,679
Scott: It's like they just give up and that's it.

276
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:45,880
Scott: It's like, come on, there are like 10 billion things you can try to do, at least try, however long does it take to go to Kickstarter and click a few times and type in some things.

277
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,320
Rym: There might be some legal issues involved.

278
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:51,020
Scott: It doesn't matter, you can work it out, it won't take that much, you know, effort.

279
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,220
Scott: You've already, you know, I mean, it's on cost fallacy, you should just sort of give up, but, you know, don't put the good dollars after the bad.

280
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,779
Rym: But don't give up if I care about it.

281
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,399
Scott: That's right.

282
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:03,759
Scott: Also, uh, it would just, you know, it's it.

283
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,180
Rym: What?

284
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,877
Rym: No, that's it?

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,296
Rym: That's it.

286
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,930
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

287
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:19,006
Rym: So speaking of X-Men, I found this video on Dorkly, X-Men Sentinels can't do anything right.

288
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,630
Rym: Now the Sentinels in the new Wolverine and the X-Men, which isn't that new, are, you know, they're pretty scary and they're pretty competent.

289
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:36,769
Rym: The Sentinels in the original 90s cartoon were pretty crap, but I didn't realize until I watched this compilation how amazingly shockwave-esque they are.

290
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,990
Scott: They're about the same as stormtroopers.

291
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,630
Scott: They can't hit anything.

292
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,309
Rym: A stormtrooper never cut its own head off by running full steam into an overhanging I-beam.

293
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,590
Scott: They have hit their head on the top of, uh... That they have.

294
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,650
Scott: Well, technically that was not, that was a person in a stormtrooper costume, it was not a trained stormtrooper.

295
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:02,550
Rym: I think my favorite one of these is when there's like ten of them and they're standing around looking at a card on the ground.

296
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,870
Rym: They're like, this object appears to be an ace of spades and then Gambit's card explodes.

297
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:13,690
Scott: I like how his card, the amount of explosion in his cards varies wildly and what triggers them exploding.

298
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,130
Scott: It's like they could be a time bomb or most of the time when they hit something, they blow up as long as it's not Gambit that they hit.

299
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:19,530
Rym: Yep.

300
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,330
Rym: I like how he also has the power of survive being knocked like across the room into a brick wall by a giant robot.

301
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,330
Scott: But the sentinel can't even survive hitting its head on a piece of metal.

302
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,829
Rym: I also, you know, Wolverine is a badass.

303
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,285
Rym: And they always show...

304
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,947
Scott: These things are like made of the same shit that like friggin' you know, Ghost and Goblin's guy's armor is made of.

305
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,690
Scott: It's just like, doink, up, they just fall to pieces.

306
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,069
Rym: But I knowed something, it's always bothered me, Wolverine, right?

307
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:50,349
Rym: Even the original cartoon and the new one in the comics, it's always like you see him jump up and then a sentinel's head falls down with him like riding it.

308
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:50,888
Scott: Right.

309
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,029
Rym: How the fuck does he pull that off?

310
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:55,029
Scott: He takes his claw and he goes around the neck.

311
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,430
Rym: But his claw doesn't get that far into it.

312
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,570
Rym: It's a really big neck.

313
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,749
Scott: He goes around the neck.

314
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,530
Scott: He gets all, you know, ding ding ding ding.

315
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,829
Rym: Scott, that would be like me ringing a tree.

316
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,830
Rym: It doesn't cut the tree down.

317
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,929
Rym: I didn't get all the way to the core of the tree.

318
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,270
Scott: You don't have to because now there's just this little tiny bit in the middle.

319
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,770
Rym: I think there's a bunch of cables and stuff there.

320
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,310
Rym: And somehow Wolverine has torn all of them.

321
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,730
Scott: Well, first of all, Wolverine, you know, he doesn't have Superman's strength, but he's pretty strong.

322
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,970
Scott: He's not as strong as Spider-Man even, but he's still way stronger than normal people.

323
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:31,969
Rym: Plus, Scott, depending on what, you know, what second of animation you're watching, the sentinels in the 90s X-Men are either eight feet tall or 80 feet tall.

324
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:38,510
Scott: Well, I always thought it was weird that in the X-Men arcade game they were kind of small and there was only one boss that was actual sentinel size.

325
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,610
Scott: But in fact, all the sentinels are supposed to be the size of that boss.

326
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,050
Scott: Anyway.

327
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:44,950
Rym: Anyway, this video is actually pretty funny.

328
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,350
Scott: So, here is some awesome fan arts that are pretty cool.

329
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,670
Scott: Some, one of them combines Star Wars and Totoro and is the awesomest.

330
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:54,050
Scott: Some of them are like Cowboy Bebop.

331
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,210
Rym: I like the Kiki one the most.

332
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,929
Scott: Some of them are.

333
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,610
Scott: That's a good one.

334
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,670
Scott: I like the Castle in the Sky one the most, actually, because, you know, it's whatever.

335
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,310
Scott: But the robot.

336
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,070
Rym: You know, they have that robot at the Ghibli Museum.

337
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:03,949
Scott: I know.

338
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,649
Rym: It's pretty good.

339
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:05,168
Rym: Yeah.

340
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,209
Rym: He's just hanging out on the roof.

341
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:07,710
Scott: He doesn't move around, though.

342
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:08,689
Rym: No, he's just hanging out.

343
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,110
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,590
Scott: No, you got to get the one that moves around.

345
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:11,730
Rym: From where?

346
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,030
Rym: Where am I going to get the one that moves around?

347
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,762
Scott: Lupin's got it.

348
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,190
Scott: All right.

349
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,069
Scott: Cool fan arts here.

350
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,668
Scott: They're cool enough, and there are enough of them, that they are worthy of Thing of the Day.

351
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,766
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the book club books are...

352
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:35,345
Scott: The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry, and also Wind, Sand, and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

353
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:37,450
Scott: And read both of them.

354
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,590
Scott: One of them will take you almost no time at all.

355
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,630
Scott: Like a couple hours.

356
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,790
Rym: And the other one is also pretty good.

357
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,770
Scott: Unless you're a three-year-old.

358
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,730
Scott: If you're like in elementary school, you only have to read The Little Prince.

359
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,606
Scott: You don't have to read the other one.

360
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,589
Scott: If you are in high school or above...

361
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,390
Rym: If you're in elementary school and your parents are letting you listen to us...

362
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,130
Scott: If you are in high school or above, you must read both books.

363
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,430
Rym: Now, if you're in elementary school, your parents wouldn't even know what you were listening to because you're on the internet and they have no clue.

364
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,110
Scott: You must also read the Wikipedia page about Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

365
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:04,089
Rym: You might think, "Oh, he might be a cool guy.

366
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,968
Rym: He wrote about cool stuff.

367
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:06,386
Scott: He's way

368
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:06,550
Scott: cooler.".

369
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,469
Scott: The coolest dude to ever live.

370
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,770
Rym: Than you will ever imagine.

371
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,728
Scott: Cooler than Miles Davis.

372
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:27,910
Rym: Tomorrow, Thursday, December 8th, we will be at a nerd night in Brooklyn in Dumbo at a place called Galapagos doing one 20-minute lecture entitled "Losing Should Be Fun," which is the 20-minute version of the hour-long lecture we've run at, I believe, two Penny Arcade Expos and a bunch of other conventions.

373
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:34,729
Rym: If you want to go, I believe it costs $10, but there are two other lectures other than us, so you do have a reason to go, possibly.

374
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,789
Scott: Maybe it's worth paying for those other people.

375
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,389
Scott: I think it's sold out, though, isn't it?

376
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,289
Rym: I heard it was sold out, but I don't know.

377
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:42,948
Rym: Go to the website.

378
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,470
Rym: I'll link to it.

379
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,421
Scott: January 5, 6, 7, 8 is- Hot!

380
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:48,849
Scott: Hot!

381
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,428
Rym: Fucking go.

382
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:52,250
Rym: Oh, my God.

383
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,127
Scott: You suck.

384
00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:00,890
Rym: We are doing "Beyond Dungeons and Dragons," the reboot, and we're also going to be on two intellectual gamer discussion panels.

385
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,890
Scott: And we're going to play some fucking games.

386
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:03,232
Scott: If you

387
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:16,970
Rym: want to play, like, "Burning Wheel" or "Mouseguard" or "Free Market" or German board games with me, Scott, and a bunch of the FRC, this is pretty much your best shot, because "Magfest" is one of the only cons that we go to primarily to hang out and play games.

388
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:24,089
Scott: The week after that, the 14th and 15th of January, I don't know if I'm going to be going, but there's another Nerd NYC double recess.

389
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:33,549
Rym: If I go, I'm going to run the same game for four people, "Burning Wheel," that I ran at "Burning Apocalypse Con," because- You could run that game.

390
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,810
Scott: Or come up with a game.

391
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,650
Rym: You could run that game.

392
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,369
Rym: I can give you my notes.

393
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,630
Scott: Maybe I'll come up with a game.

394
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:38,529
Rym: You should come up with a game.

395
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,170
Scott: I was thinking, here's my idea that I came up with for a game.

396
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:41,749
Rym: Oh, you got an idea?

397
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,149
Scott: It's just a seed of an idea.

398
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,329
Scott: The idea is, there's a really powerful bad guy, right?

399
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:47,842
Rym: Yeah.

400
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,510
Scott: And he's not dumb like in the movies.

401
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,667
Scott: He just fucking kills you.

402
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:56,490
Scott: And you got to somehow not die and beat the bad guy.

403
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,570
Scott: But he's not a dumb bad guy.

404
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,490
Scott: He'll just fucking kill you.

405
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,410
Scott: He won't even let you talk.

406
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,710
Scott: He won't tell you his story.

407
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:01,869
Scott: He's just a bad guy.

408
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,070
Scott: And he's going to do his bad thing, and he's awesome powerful.

409
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,870
Scott: So- You're also powerful as good guys, obviously.

410
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,470
Scott: So you're not just peasants, and you just get disintegrated in two seconds.

411
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,115
Rym: So it's going to be.

412
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:12,950
Rym: Rezo casts the spell immediately.

413
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:13,526
Scott: Exactly.

414
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:14,709
Scott: That's the game.

415
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,590
Scott: It's the Rezo game.

416
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,986
Rym: I think that was the moment when I went from, "I like slayers," to, "I fucking love

417
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:19,448
Rym: slayers.".

418
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:20,788
Scott: Rezo's like, "Oh

419
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:20,910
Scott: shit!".

420
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:21,949
Scott: Just runs up the hallway,

421
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:22,010
Scott: "Oh!".

422
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:24,210
Rym: Locks the door, summons the- oh my god.

423
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,417
Scott: Well, the thing is, Rezo has nothing on- Copy.

424
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:27,968
Rym: Rezo.

425
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,170
Scott: Spoiler.

426
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,526
Scott: Ozymandias.

427
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,286
Scott: Rezo's like, "I'm doing it right

428
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:35,469
Scott: now.".

429
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,927
Scott: Ozymandias is like, "I did that shit before you came in the

430
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,129
Scott: room.".

431
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,610
Rym: Also, we'll be at PAX East.

432
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,770
Rym: We'll be at- we should be at Anime Boston, even though it's at the same time as PAX East.

433
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:53,908
Scott: And check us out on the internets and all the places on the internets besides iTunes or wherever you got this episode from.

434
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,350
Rym: The GeekNights Rym YouTube account has many of our previous lectures up, and a whole bunch of other stuff, like Radio Free Equestrian, video from PAX.

435
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:01,571
Rym: Make

436
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:16,809
Scott: sure to go to FrontRowCrew.com, which I hope to have finished updating it to be newer and better before the end of the year, because I'm gonna have a vacation, and that could be shit talk, and also go to Facebook, Google+, Twitter, whichever place you like the most, we will go to that place.

437
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:20,370
Scott: If you have any other places that you like the most, we'll go to those places too.

438
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,244
Scott: Just tell me where they are.

439
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,149
Rym: So, Drops of God.

440
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:26,910
Scott: Oh shit, son.

441
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:35,670
Rym: Drops of God is one of those kinds of manga that I'd be in like Hinokuni or something with Emily, and we'd be walking around, and I see all these manga that are not in English.

442
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,110
Scott: That are about crazy things.

443
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,870
Rym: It's like, wow, that's about golf, that's about politicians, that's clearly some Yakuza doing something awesome.

444
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,089
Scott: That's about wine.

445
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,830
Rym: So there's one that was- it looked like Initial D of Wine.

446
00:20:48,130 --> 00:21:03,669
Scott: Right, so I never read it, but then Vertical, the best manga publisher in the United States in English, they decided to publish Drops of God, and it's like, wow, they could've published any of those, they could've published the golf one or the business one, but they chose this wine one, which means there must be something good about it.

447
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:10,670
Scott: And I don't drink wine, but I read this, and just like every other shounen manga in the universe, it makes you want to do whatever it's about.

448
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,890
Scott: Initial D makes you want to drive a car, Hajime no Ippo makes you want to punch people in the face and get punched in the face.

449
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:23,285
Rym: Oh my god, I remember when I was watching Initial D like second and third stage while I was living up in the mountains, and I actually had to drive down a mountain road every day to get to work.

450
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:28,189
Rym: It wasn't necessarily good for me to have been doing those two things at the same time.

451
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,490
Scott: Drops of God makes me want to drink wine, even though I'm probably not gonna.

452
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,709
Scott: You should, you gotta taste the terroir.

453
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,209
Scott: I think I'll be alright with my non-terroir.

454
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:48,450
Scott: I love how, like I- But I wish people would make apple juice with so much, you know, intensity as they make- The shounen fighting- The dirt that you plant the apple trees in, it's so important.

455
00:21:48,631 --> 00:22:06,489
Rym: The shounen fighting genre has, you know, there's many different sub-genres within it, but the overall genre, the shows that I found I like, are the ones where there's someone who's good at something, but hates the thing they're good at, or doesn't care about the thing they're good at, but are forced to do it anyway, and come to love it.

456
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,018
Rym: Yep.

457
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,047
Rym: But not right away.

458
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,590
Scott: It's pretty much the formula.

459
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:16,530
Scott: It's also the same formula as Initial D in that he got good at it because his dad made him do all this stuff that he didn't like doing.

460
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:27,870
Scott: I want you to lick this belt and chew on this pencil and- Yeah, somehow he can, you know, you can implant amazing skills in your children, even though they don't want these skills, and then they'll thank you for it later when they have great skills.

461
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,221
Rym: So Scott, when you have kids, you're gonna be like, "Alright kid, before you get dinner, you gotta beat Mario

462
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:31,790
Rym: 1.".

463
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,910
Rym: What, Mario 1?

464
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,908
Scott: That's pretty much it.

465
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,050
Scott: He's gonna beat Contra before breakfast.

466
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:43,333
Scott: He'll thank me for it when he's like, "Starcraft God of the world making mad monies for playing video

467
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:43,677
Scott: games.".

468
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:55,569
Rym: But this is such a... Like I read it, and I like it, but at the same time, it's pandering to me so much, and it's... And you know what?

469
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,769
Rym: You know what this goes all the way back to?

470
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,548
Scott: They pander.

471
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,014
Rym: All these things that we like, like Initial D and now Drops of God, Nodame, they all go back to C.S.

472
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:10,828
Rym: Forest or Horatio Hornblower, because you read a Horatio Hornblower book- Anytime Rym opens his mouth, it goes back to C.S.

473
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:11,130
Scott: Forest.

474
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,689
Rym: No, seriously, you read those books, right?

475
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:17,136
Rym: And by the end of one, like you're reading this action scene, you're like, "Aw shit son, I wanna go

476
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:17,704
Rym: sailing.".

477
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,070
Scott: You wanna get flogged?

478
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:19,718
Rym: I know, nah.

479
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,017
Scott: You wanna get keelhauled?

480
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:23,770
Rym: He doesn't get keelhauled.

481
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,008
Rym: You wanna get cannonballed?

482
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:26,790
Rym: Scott, you watch the Initial D race.

483
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:29,489
Scott: You feel like- You wanna marry like ten ladies with all sorts of BD?

484
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,510
Rym: I wanna do that, and I could do it.

485
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,030
Rym: I understand how that drift works.

486
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:33,988
Rym: I know what's going on.

487
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,090
Rym: You read the wine manga, and you're like, "Aw shit, I know all about the Toa, and all about all these- You don't know shit.

488
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,097
Rym: Guys, you read a C.S.

489
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:46,690
Rym: Forrester book, and you feel like you know exactly what the deal is with sailing.

490
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,568
Rym: You know like, "Oh, he furled the topsails or whatever, and it's

491
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:49,850
Rym: awesome.".

492
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:50,366
Scott: You don't know shit.

493
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:58,351
Rym: If you take anyone, have them read one of those scenes, and ask them how well they feel like they understood what happened, they'll be like 100%.

494
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:05,849
Rym: Show them a picture of a ship, and ask them to point out any of the things named in the book, and they will get none of them.

495
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,530
Rym: That's right.

496
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,769
Rym: That is the real key.

497
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:16,187
Rym: You have to get someone to feel like they understand this thing, even though they have no goddamn idea, and this is just crazy, over-the-top bullshit.

498
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:16,690
Rym: that's happening.

499
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,490
Scott: But in a way, it's the best marketing in the universe to get people interested in a thing.

500
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,110
Scott: It just doesn't work when there's so many people using the same method.

501
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:38,068
Scott: But I feel like there are many countries in the world where this method is not being used, and if we could perhaps ... You know, people here don't read manga, but if we could make TV shows with this formula about specific things, that we could get people really interested in things.

502
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,721
Scott: So, for example, we could ...

503
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:40,770
Rym: Read or die.

504
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,507
Scott: Right.

505
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:54,010
Scott: Maybe we want to sell wine, and we could make a TV show, an American one, of Drops of God, and suddenly, wine sales would go through the roof, because all these people watching that show would start buying crazy wine.

506
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,970
Rym: You know, actually, Drops of God would make a good HBO kind of show.

507
00:24:58,572 --> 00:24:59,909
Scott: It would make a good just regular show.

508
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,830
Rym: Well, by HBO kind of show, I mean the shows that are made kind of to be sold, like to a premium channel.

509
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,089
Rym: Like, they're made as a unit, they're not an ongoing forever show, they have a plot that actually will end.

510
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,610
Scott: But anyway, here's a short plot summary of Drops of God.

511
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,010
Scott: You got this girl, and she's a sommelier in a small, kind of nice restaurant.

512
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,550
Rym: She's an apprentice sommelier.

513
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,150
Scott: That's right.

514
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,969
Scott: And you know, she's pretty good at sommeliering, but you know what, she's not ... She's a normal person, right?

515
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,350
Scott: She's not perfect, she's not amazing, she doesn't have superpowers, right?

516
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,050
Scott: And she's pretty cool.

517
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,990
Scott: I really like her a lot, because it's like, she's not like some of those anime characters that are intentionally extra, extra clumsy.

518
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:36,509
Scott: She's just normal clumsy.

519
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,590
Scott: It's like, yeah, if I was an apprentice sommelier, I'd probably drop one at some point.

520
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,690
Scott: You know, I'd mess up at some point.

521
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:44,070
Scott: But I wouldn't be messing up all over the place, you know?

522
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,010
Scott: She's pretty confident, and she's normal and not crazy or stupid or dramatic or anything.

523
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,710
Scott: And then, so she's having trouble with the customer, and this dude helps with his decanting.

524
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,990
Scott: And he has the amazing decanting of God, even though he doesn't drink wine.

525
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:05,789
Scott: Finds out that he is the son of this amazing wine critic, like the most famous wine critic that ever was.

526
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:14,030
Rym: Oh, but wait, with the decanting, one of the most important aspects of the shounen fighting manga is the two-page spread of the thing being done.

527
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,650
Rym: It doesn't matter what that thing is, that two-page spread is gonna be amazing.

528
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,289
Scott: That's right.

529
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,390
Scott: So, there's a two-page spread of his, you know, decanting.

530
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:35,190
Scott: So she finds out that he has these amazing wine skills, and he's the son of this guy, but he doesn't like wine or drink wine, and she actually resents his dad making him learn all that shit, just like Initial D. Then, his dad dies, the famous wine critic dad.

531
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:46,590
Scott: But before he died, he adopted this other guy, the rival, the evil, also wine critic guy, who was like the most skilled wine critic there is, besides the dad who died.

532
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:54,110
Scott: But the real son doesn't want that jerk to get the wine that his dad is letting him inherit.

533
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:04,810
Scott: So he's gotta beat him at this wine contest, and in the wine contest, you have to identify the twelve disciples and the drops of God, and then you will win the wine inheritance.

534
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:06,350
Rym: Now, you talk about your advertising.

535
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:18,650
Scott: So this guy doesn't like wine, he doesn't care about wine, but he has the innate skills from his dad, and he's gotta, you know, and he really, really suddenly doesn't want this other guy to get the wine collection.

536
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:21,604
Scott: So he actually learns to like wine, and tries to win.

537
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:29,289
Rym: I predict right now, I haven't read anything about the first, like, big trade, so this is just, it's not a spoiler if I guess it.

538
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:29,888
Scott: That's right.

539
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:31,230
Rym: I think they're actually brothers.

540
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:32,386
Scott: It could be.

541
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,010
Rym: Straight up, they're actually brothers.

542
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:34,450
Scott: That's not possible.

543
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,769
Scott: I wasn't even thinking of that.

544
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,950
Rym: I was thinking of- I thought of that, like, as soon, like, I don't know, 40 pages in, I was like, they're clearly actually brothers.

545
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:48,770
Scott: Maybe, but the actual, my guess is that the drops of God, like, all the twelve disciples are gonna be actual wines.

546
00:27:49,330 --> 00:28:08,189
Scott: I think the drops of God is gonna be something like the grape juice, you know, that grows outside his house, or, you know, regular ass grape juice, or his mom's breast milk, or something, you know, something like that, something that's personal and isn't really the greatest wine in the whole world.

547
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:09,089
Rym: It's gonna be Monishevitz.

548
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:19,010
Scott: It's gonna be something, right, the drops of God is going to be something that has like a personal meaning for that, it's not, you know, it's not gonna be, what's the guy's name?

549
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,789
Scott: Henry Jaller?

550
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:20,902
Rym: Really?

551
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:21,968
Scott: Jaller?

552
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,669
Scott: What was the name?

553
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:24,990
Scott: I forget the name.

554
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:25,630
Scott: Henry something.

555
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,260
Scott: But it's not gonna be some amazing wine.

556
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:32,950
Scott: that's really the drop of God, it's gonna be something that's, you know, story related.

557
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,850
Rym: I wonder, actually.

558
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,070
Scott: That's what I'm guessing.

559
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,568
Scott: It's a guess.

560
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,770
Scott: I've read one volume.

561
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:38,870
Scott: What do you want from me?

562
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,670
Rym: Yeah, Wikipedia, apparently, they've gotten through eight of the apostles so far.

563
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:43,669
Scott: Oh, in the Japanese?

564
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:44,190
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:45,189
Scott: That's good.

566
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,190
Scott: That means that it moved, how many volumes is that?

567
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:49,170
Rym: I have no idea, because I'm trying not to look.

568
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,310
Rym: Because it spoils a bunch of stuff.

569
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,750
Scott: Just on the right, in the little box, it should say the number of volumes.

570
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,247
Scott: Twenty-eight.

571
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,609
Scott: Oh, that's kind of eh.

572
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:56,550
Scott: That's a lot of volumes.

573
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,309
Rym: That is a lot of volumes.

574
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,390
Scott: Twenty-eight volumes is only eight disciples.

575
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,696
Rym: It's running me.

576
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:09,210
Rym: I wonder if only, I know this doesn't happen, if there were a crossover that linked that Ghost in the Shell episode with Aramaki and the wine.

577
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,229
Scott: There should be a crossover with One Piece and they drink rum.

578
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:22,670
Scott: Anyway, this manga is pretty awesome if you're willing to hold out for twenty-eight plus volumes to find out what the disciples are and the drops of God.

579
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:33,750
Rym: If anything, a manga like this is something where you read the first volume just to prove to yourself that the shounen fighting genre, the perfection of it, will work for anything.

580
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,490
Scott: Yeah, I'm actually kind of just satisfied reading the first volume.

581
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:47,470
Scott: You don't find out any disciples, but even if you don't plan to read the whole thing, you don't think you can hold out, you should just read volume one and you stop right there, which you won't be suffering on a horrible cliffhanger or anything like that.

582
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,170
Rym: It's like watching God, not God of Cookery.

583
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:55,130
Scott: It's a pretty big volume from Vertical that I think it might actually be two Japanese volumes in one US volume.

584
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:55,888
Rym: I think it is.

585
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:03,610
Rym: But like Cooking Master Boy, I don't need to watch all of Cooking Master Boy, but I watched the first couple episodes and I was good.

586
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,270
Scott: Oh man, I'm gonna get Chinese food for dinner.

587
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,270
Rym: Chinese food for dinner?

588
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,510
Rym: I was gonna reheat the Indian food from Burning Wheel last night.

589
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:08,910
Scott: Is this leftover?

590
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:10,469
Rym: There's a shit ton of it.

591
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:11,549
Scott: Oh, I thought there wasn't any.

592
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,170
Rym: No, there was like enough food to feed the entire gaming group again.

593
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,410
Scott: Oh, then I will stay here and eat some of that shit.

594
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,129
Rym: Alright, I'll reheat that shit as soon as we're done with the show.

595
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:20,129
Scott: Which kinds are left?

596
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:22,669
Rym: All of them except one of them.

597
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,870
Scott: The peppery one that I had?

598
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:25,050
Rym: I don't remember.

599
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:25,389
Rym: Anyway.

600
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:37,676
Rym: So, very briefly then, we'll do some kind of follow-up Geek Bytes because when it comes to an anime movie, I'm loathe to do a detailed review because you're just gonna go watch it.

601
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,026
Rym: I don't need to tell you much about it.

602
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:42,330
Rym: So all I really want to do is convince you to watch it.

603
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,310
Rym: Now some movies I could see as doing a final thoughts or kind of deep analysis.

604
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:55,550
Scott: It's possible that there could be an anime movie that is so bad that will say do not watch this under any circumstance, but that is so rare because like the worst anime movie that's gonna come out- Harmageddon?

605
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,530
Rym: Doom Megalopolis?

606
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:56,845
Rym: No.

607
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,670
Scott: That's gonna come out nowadays, right?

608
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:04,670
Scott: Is gonna be something like, you know, the one piece the movie number 55 or Pokemon the movie number 150.

609
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,290
Rym: Actually, I'll bet those are pretty watchable.

610
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:06,650
Scott: Right.

611
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,130
Scott: And those are probably pretty watchable.

612
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,009
Scott: So, and that's the worst anime movie that's gonna come out.

613
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:25,749
Scott: Then you should pretty much, and there's only like 10 or so a year at most, you should pretty much just watch every Japanese anime professional full length motion picture animated feature that comes out because they won't take you that long to watch them all.

614
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:31,769
Scott: You know, their longest ones are going to be two and a half hours and most of them are going to be 90 minutes or less.

615
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:33,710
Scott: And there are many of them.

616
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,549
Scott: You can watch them all if you're an anime nerd.

617
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:38,690
Rym: Finally you're like, yeah, most of them are going to be 90 minutes or less.

618
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:41,669
Rym: Both the movies we're talking about are two hours plus.

619
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:45,610
Scott: I'm saying, you know, even two hours, oh, big four hours.

620
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,709
Scott: That's less time than you spent watching Wolverine the X-Men and it was better than that.

621
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,790
Scott: But- Well, better than I assume that that is.

622
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,910
Rym: But I guess what I was saying is that I could see us doing some shows down the road.

623
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,770
Rym: Like I kind of want to rewatch Akira and or the original Ghost in the Shell just cause I haven't seen him in forever.

624
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,530
Scott: Uh, I've seen them like a thousand times.

625
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,810
Rym: But uh, we, you know, we could do like a kind of, you've already seen it final thoughts episode and really talk about the movie.

626
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,210
Rym: But uh, for here, welcome to the space show and I got to get the full title.

627
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,530
Rym: I usually make, I usually make a joke about the title to where I'd forgotten the real title.

628
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,530
Rym: Children who chase lost voices from deep below.

629
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,530
Scott: That's the English title.

630
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:23,210
Scott: I heard that that was a mistranslation of the Japanese title.

631
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,089
Rym: Literally it's children who chase stars.

632
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:27,943
Rym: Hoshi.

633
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:29,310
Rym: Oh, Koto.

634
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,348
Scott: Hoshi is star.

635
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:31,029
Scott: Yeah.

636
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:33,569
Rym: So start with welcome to the space show.

637
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,510
Rym: It's goofy adventure in space.

638
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:41,610
Scott: Yeah, pretty much really well animated.

639
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,410
Rym: It's a gigantic colors are really studying kind of like set pieces.

640
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,470
Rym: There's a lot of atmosphere stuff.

641
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,769
Rym: It's one of those really long.

642
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,257
Rym: Let's go on an adventure movies.

643
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:53,729
Rym: that's just really satisfying to watch.

644
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:55,130
Scott: Yeah.

645
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,230
Scott: I mean, it doesn't have a whole lot of like, you know, deep substance.

646
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:00,610
Scott: You can see, you know, there's no surprise.

647
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,709
Scott: You can see the twist coming from the thousand light years away.

648
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,330
Rym: Literally there's a couple of twists.

649
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:12,690
Rym: The story of welcome to the space show roughly is that on earth there's people, right?

650
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:22,290
Rym: Some kids and they go to a camp just like in Bocorano, but in space there's a gigantic Futurama style space society, but they don't talk to people on earth because people on earth aren't good enough yet.

651
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:22,810
Scott: That's right.

652
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:34,148
Rym: And there's some plot where there's something on earth that is very desirable out there that people are smuggling out and some hijinks ensue and these pretty much space drugs grow on earth and you can't find them anywhere else in the universe.

653
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,299
Rym: So these kids end up saving.

654
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:43,569
Rym: one of the investigators is working on this and he's like, all right, I'll take you up to the moon as thanks and they'll send you back down to earth.

655
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:51,550
Rym: And then shit goes down and two hours later you've watched a pretty solid fulfilling movie about space.

656
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,565
Scott: It's like they get to the moon and, you know, you know, there's like.

657
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:57,128
Scott: then suddenly they're stuck there and then adventure happens.

658
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,310
Rym: It's kind of like there's a lot of like adventuresome slice of life.

659
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:08,989
Rym: I mean, they run out of money so they all start getting jobs as like delivery people and such to save up their space dollars to buy the ticket home.

660
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:09,409
Scott: Yeah.

661
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,370
Scott: It's like the actual plot of the movie is pretty much straightforward.

662
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:19,270
Scott: It does the typical thing of meet a bunch of characters who then only at the end, all the characters you met along the way come together at the last minute.

663
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,688
Rym: They're all pretty great characters like it's yeah, they're pretty cool.

664
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:22,949
Rym: It's very simple.

665
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,190
Scott: They're not deep characters.

666
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,053
Scott: They're just like.

667
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:30,349
Scott: they're more like, you know, just aspects like, oh, man, that guy's got, you know, does this really cool thing.

668
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:31,308
Scott: And that's what he does.

669
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:37,449
Rym: It reminds me a lot in terms of almost like Mega Man bosses as a lot of those kind of like the old space shows we like.

670
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,150
Rym: But you know, those often have meaning or something like cats.

671
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:42,069
Rym: Cats on a train.

672
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:49,431
Rym: And those were now, here's why it reminds me of cats on a train, because cats on a train, a.k.a.

673
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:57,390
Rym: Night on the Galactic Railroad, was long and atmospheric and you watch it and it's just kind of like this long adventure.

674
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,970
Rym: It lulls you in and kind of forget about the outside world for a couple of hours.

675
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,429
Rym: And then it kind of lets you back out at the end.

676
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,246
Rym: It also reminds me of that because a lot of people will not have enough goddamn patience to watch this movie.

677
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:10,075
Scott: Hmm.

678
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:14,010
Rym: A lot of people I know did not have enough goddamn patience to watch this movie.

679
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,770
Rym: And if you don't have the patience to watch this, then I actually think a lot of anime movies are not up your alley.

680
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:23,230
Scott: A lot of things, period, are not up your alley.

681
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:30,188
Rym: I mean, Skycrawlers, that's very long, very slow, very repetitive.

682
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,430
Scott: People, you got to have real attention spans to appreciate the arts.

683
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,970
Rym: But here's the other reason why the show is great.

684
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,232
Rym: Welcome.

685
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:47,690
Rym: There is a space show because as a backdrop to all this adventure these kids are having, there is a pirate television show in space called The Space Show.

686
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,470
Rym: It is the most popular media in the entire collected universe.

687
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,045
Rym: Yep.

688
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,830
Rym: It is illegal and broadcast from some mystery place.

689
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,389
Rym: And it is just crazy, crazy like it is basically condensed red line.

690
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:11,130
Rym: So, yeah, the space show and these kids and everything all collides into a gigantic, epic conclusion with extremely lush, beautiful, colorful animation.

691
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,450
Rym: Great kids, great colors, pionkichi.

692
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,310
Scott: The most basically the fun of it is not that big plot, right?

693
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,867
Scott: The fun is basically exploring this space society that they've come up

694
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:27,602
Rym: like seeing weird stuff like currency, the food, the nationality,

695
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:40,650
Scott: you know, like all these kids get jobs on the moon and you get to just throughout these two and a half hours, you just keep seeing little slices of different aspects of this gigantic space society to see how this, you know, how things work out there.

696
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:49,950
Scott: And it's just this cool world that you're being exposed to, just like the kids are being exposed to it after being taken from Earth and thrown into a galactic civilization.

697
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:58,849
Rym: There's a ton of great set pieces, like they ride this kind of biological spaceship at one point where all the doors inside that are basically sphincters.

698
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:01,990
Scott: Yeah, there's just a lot, you know, there's all kinds of crazy aliens.

699
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,950
Rym: I think my favorite part is when they all have to get space passports.

700
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,770
Scott: Oh, yeah, and the thing like questions.

701
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,650
Rym: Yeah, they all get interviewed.

702
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:18,634
Rym: They basically ask them questions like if a race of benevolent aliens came down to your planet and offered you all the technology in the universe to make your lives awesome, would you accept it?

703
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,230
Rym: If you answer correctly, you get a space passport.

704
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,810
Rym: If you answer incorrectly, I guess we lock you up forever.

705
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,024
Rym: Yeah, and it's fun.

706
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:30,730
Rym: I'm really trying to avoid saying much more about it because you just fucking watch it.

707
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,450
Scott: Yeah, it's only two and a half hours.

708
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,195
Rym: You can just pirate it.

709
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,030
Rym: It's just that it's just on the Internet.

710
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,864
Rym: You can just watch it.

711
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:38,710
Scott: Make sure you get the HDs, though, or else you'll be missing a lot.

712
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:38,932
Rym: Yeah.

713
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:39,988
Rym: Watch this on a big screen.

714
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,260
Scott: Well, it doesn't need to be big.

715
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:41,767
Scott: It needs to be HD.

716
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,760
Rym: Real screen.

717
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:43,148
Rym: Yeah.

718
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,910
Rym: So children who chase lost voices from deep below is the most recent Makoto Shinkai effort.

719
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,030
Rym: And we watched it at the New York Comic Con at it from here.

720
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,170
Rym: And then we got to see him and he talked a lot about it.

721
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,208
Rym: He seems like a really chill guy.

722
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:55,734
Rym: Yeah.

723
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:57,450
Rym: I liked his answers to all the questions.

724
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:04,909
Scott: I like it when the people are common sense guys and not crazy people or, you know, weird artsy partsy, you know, what's it called?

725
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:07,008
Rym: So funny hats.

726
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:15,730
Rym: If you know anything about beret wearing people, Makoto Shinkai, you could guess that this movie is about lovers separated by space and time.

727
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:17,030
Scott: Oh, no.

728
00:38:17,651 --> 00:38:20,470
Rym: In this case, it's the story of lovers separated by death.

729
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,031
Scott: Yep.

730
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:24,010
Scott: He's just like, well, I've separated you by space and time.

731
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:26,310
Scott: Now I'm just going to separate your period.

732
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:36,011
Rym: But at the same time, this is a pretty straightforward Miyazaki-esque fantasy adventure story.

733
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,133
Rym: Yeah.

734
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,890
Scott: So pretty much is this girl and she likes to, you know, make a little radio, sort of like Carl Sagan's Contact.

735
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:44,093
Scott: Right.

736
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:49,609
Scott: And she goes up on the mountain near behind her house in the woods, you know, like adventuring in the woods a little bit.

737
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,350
Scott: And, you know, she listens to the thing and she keeps hearing this thing on a radio.

738
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:53,769
Rym: This music from somewhere.

739
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,573
Scott: From somewhere.

740
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,121
Rym: It's not a radio station like.

741
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,354
Rym: it's something she can't explain it and it makes her happy.

742
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:00,310
Rym: So she goes and listens to this all the time.

743
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:05,232
Scott: And then one day she sees this dude up on the mountain and is like, oh, what's up with that dude?

744
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:12,130
Scott: And then suddenly you've sort of got this situation where the dude is mystical and the government's after him and something, something you're not quite sure.

745
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:21,090
Scott: So she's in this situation and then she basically the dude gets owned by some monster and she gets to.

746
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:23,390
Rym: I believe he also may have owned the monster.

747
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,689
Scott: It was a double ownage, double K. So she sort of fell in love with the dude.

748
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,929
Scott: You know, this weird mystical, you know, plot dude from another world.

749
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,073
Scott: But now he's dead.

750
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:40,150
Rym: So she's sort of like, that's the best summary of a movie ever.

751
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:40,634
Scott: Yep.

752
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:41,350
Scott: All right.

753
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,848
Scott: And then she goes on the adventure into the other world because she thinks there's a chance to see him again.

754
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:56,209
Rym: It is really interesting watching this because it it cribs so heavily from Ghibli that I could see if someone didn't know who made this movie.

755
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,050
Scott: Well, you could tell by the way it looks that it's not.

756
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,591
Rym: But at the same time, it's so close, like the character designs are echoes of Ghibli stuff.

757
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:14,470
Rym: The whole world, the way that world that they travel to is portrayed and the kind of the the metaphysics of it and the mythology of it is very Ghibli.

758
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:21,711
Rym: It's a very straightforward movie with a very kind of almost heavy handed moral at the end.

759
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:27,072
Rym: But at the same time, the movie did surprise me more than once, like it did a few times.

760
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:30,330
Rym: I kind of got lulled into the sense of, all right, I see where this is going.

761
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,570
Rym: And then it didn't do a 180, but it went forty five degrees off course.

762
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:43,349
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you go in and it's like, you know, there are many different aspects that are very Ghibli, like the animal guardians are very mononoke ish.

763
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,389
Scott: And the other world is very Laputa ish.

764
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,590
Rym: There's a lot of Nausicaa in the other world.

765
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,730
Scott: The girl is sort of like Nausicaa, you know, she's got her technologies.

766
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:01,209
Rym: And you can feel almost like Makoto Shinkai was like, I got to have some of this and some of this and some of this and some of this.

767
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,189
Scott: I want all these things.

768
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,648
Scott: They meet that like the doctor guy.

769
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,230
Rym: He's like, check it off all the things he wants in his fantasy world adventure.

770
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,779
Rym: Yeah, it's beautiful to behold.

771
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:15,230
Rym: the animation and the characters and the colors are just breathtaking and the story is pretty good.

772
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:15,915
Rym: It's not great.

773
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:17,750
Rym: It's not the best movie I've ever seen.

774
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,276
Rym: But you know what?

775
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:19,429
Rym: It's a solid movie.

776
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:20,332
Scott: Yeah.

777
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:27,189
Scott: And, you know, I was kind of expecting, like, you know, as it went along that, you know, like just amazing shit would happen, but it wasn't.

778
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,598
Scott: But at the same time, I was actually kind of thankful that it wasn't sort of all existential and weird.

779
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:32,920
Scott: Like it was.

780
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,290
Scott: it was it was very straightforward.

781
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,314
Scott: You know, it was like.

782
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:38,709
Scott: this is the thing that happens and it happened and you're good.

783
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:39,372
Rym: Yep.

784
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,090
Rym: The actual end of the plot didn't go the way I expected at all.

785
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,393
Scott: No, not at all.

786
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,570
Rym: Again, we're being cagey here because you should watch this movie.

787
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,840
Rym: I don't want to spoil it for you.

788
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,749
Rym: There's no reason to.

789
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,376
Rym: You should just see it.

790
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:54,610
Rym: Nothing I say should convince you to see it.

791
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,796
Rym: You should just go see it.

792
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,190
Rym: Otherwise, why are you listening to the anime manga comics?

793
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:02,414
Scott: I wasted more time listening to GeekNights that you could have spent watching this movie.

794
00:42:02,798 --> 00:42:03,849
Scott: Seriously, what the fuck?

795
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

796
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:16,154
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

797
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:21,414
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

798
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:29,050
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
