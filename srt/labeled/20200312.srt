00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:29,800
Scott: Let's do this All right, so my work is awesome work at least on my team because we can just work from home Sort of whenever and actually I work from home probably less than almost everyone else.

5
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:36,700
Rym: Lot of my engineers work from home a lot But I rarely do since I'm a very visible position and I got to talk to my base.

6
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:42,499
Scott: It's funny that actually the people who are more visible are out of the office more, huh?

7
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,816
Rym: anyway But yeah, I'm also in a weird industry compared to like any other normal company.

8
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:49,419
Scott: Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:58,990
Scott: But yeah, I tend to only work from home like, you know, and when I got a bunch of chores piled up You know something where it's like, okay I work from home get my shit back in order like

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,702
Rym: the super is gonna come do something and I want to like be home To let them in.

11
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,530
Scott: but exactly right and it's like.

12
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,120
Scott: that is you know, it's like, you know.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,273
Scott: Obviously you think I'll work from home every single day.

14
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:09,480
Scott: That would be the best thing ever.

15
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,240
Rym: But everyone I know who's done that has started to go crazy.

16
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:17,637
Scott: I'm actually perfectly content to just work from home occasionally enough to have my shit together and like that's.

17
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,721
Scott: you know I don't.

18
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,109
Scott: actually I'm okay going to the office offices are.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,015
Rym: I wanted to work from home a lot more when I had a commute But now it takes me like 12 minutes to get to my desk.

20
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:29,040
Scott: Yeah anyway from here.

21
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:38,080
Scott: So but now they're like, oh my god virus, right and some people they're panicking too much And some people not panicking enough and too much is obviously better than not enough.

22
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,509
Scott: But I don't see a lot of people getting it just right.

23
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,915
Rym: too much is better than not enough.

24
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,569
Rym: up to the point of I am Going to Mad Max that is that is too much.

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,473
Scott: Yes, that is too much.

26
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:48,682
Scott: You cannot personally Mad Max Maybe.

27
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:53,056
Scott: so my company decided to do was not let anyone travel on business trips.

28
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:53,678
Scott: Okay, sure.

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,120
Scott: I'm on that.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,140
Rym: I'm not allowed to go to conferences until not going any business trips anyway.

31
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,960
Scott: And to they're like, okay, we made sure everyone's VPN works in their computer.

32
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,057
Scott: Let's try to work from home for two days to see how it goes.

33
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:11,320
Scott: so Wednesday after I already left work, they sent an email saying hey work from home Thursday Friday.

34
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:19,207
Scott: So this morning I got on the train and it went back because like if they didn't say don't come to work I would have I'd go in.

35
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,814
Scott: Yeah, they didn't cancel hockey.

36
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,220
Scott: I would have gone to hockey, right?

37
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:26,053
Scott: But yeah, no, they're like, okay work from home Thursday Friday.

38
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:31,014
Scott: So Michael not gonna argue with you Right, I might be willing to go to work, but I'm not gonna go.

39
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,200
Scott: it's an empty office.

40
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,680
Scott: But I had to go and get my work computer that I left at work.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,040
Scott: It's a lot of other people seem to carry their work laptops back and forth every day.

42
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:39,847
Rym: No, no, no.

43
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,359
Scott: I only carry it home.

44
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,720
Scott: Like if you see at the end of the day my laptops not on the desk, that means I work at home tomorrow.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,242
Rym: It's interesting.

46
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:54,872
Rym: a lot of people I know like not just my current job and in all the jobs I've ever had Don't have like good PCs or equipment at home.

47
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,056
Scott: Like they need I'm not using.

48
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,542
Scott: I'm not using my purse I had.

49
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:57,763
Scott: do.

50
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,453
Scott: I'm not using my personal computer for work.

51
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:03,470
Rym: Yeah, if I'm working from home I do because I don't need remember the kind of job I do.

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,300
Rym: I don't need like local files or anything.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,327
Rym: No, it's not about that.

54
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,200
Scott: It's I'm not gonna use my hardware.

55
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:15,530
Scott: Yeah, I don't I don't care for my works if they want it if they want me to have a good You know a computer at home to work on.

56
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,497
Scott: Well, they should have bought me one.

57
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,510
Scott: Yeah But I already bought me this one.

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,220
Scott: So that's the one I'll use right?

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,540
Scott: My computer would actually do the work a lot faster, but they didn't want to buy me a fancy work laptop.

60
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:27,660
Scott: So I'm gonna do the work at the speed of the laptop that they have provided.

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,750
Scott: That's you know, anyway, that's a separate issue.

62
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:36,606
Scott: So this morning I went back to the work to get You know my laptop and bring it home.

63
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:40,220
Scott: Yeah, I tried to go to TJ's which is across the street from my work.

64
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,885
Scott: I'm there at like 9 a.m.

65
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:55,400
Scott: And I'm like, you know what I'm going this TJ, right and I'm gonna get me some snacks And maybe I'll get some English muffin because they sell if you don't know Thomas English muffins at the grocery store usually overpriced when they're on sale There may be like $2.

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,742
Scott: TJ's.

67
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,975
Scott: English muffins are better and only like a dollar fifty at all time.

68
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,100
Scott: Hell, yeah, that's right.

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,479
Scott: So I was trying to get and then I wanted to maybe get some locks to put on there, right?

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:12,145
Scott: They're sold out of locks Wow, and there was a usually that TJ, you know TJ's in Manhattan often have mega lines Right.

71
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,580
Scott: This one rarely has the mega line.

72
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,690
Scott: The line was wrapped like around the whole store.

73
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:24,937
Rym: I find the most fascinating about this is like in Midtown Like I went to a random CVS just like to get a Red Bull they got everything like.

74
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:25,900
Rym: it is no crowd there.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,265
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's a CVS right next door.

76
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:27,827
Scott: They had everything.

77
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,400
Rym: Yeah, it's like the people who are like panic buying thousands of rolls.

78
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:37,271
Scott: I don't think people are Panic, some people are but I don't think most people are.

79
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:40,970
Scott: I someone showed a photo of Astoria grocery store That was really crowded.

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,595
Scott: Yeah, and You know the the idea that they were trying to get across.

81
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:47,571
Rym: like I saw that photo It didn't look that much more crowded than normal.

82
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:48,336
Scott: It was pretty crowded.

83
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:56,383
Scott: But the point is People the idea they're trying to get across is like all people are panicking but I looked at people's carts and it was just like Cereal.

84
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:03,080
Scott: Well, it's like normal shit and I'm like no no, no, no No, people are not going crazy cuz I'm virus and rushing and my you know, cleaning out the grocery store.

85
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:07,477
Scott: It's simply that when people don't have to commute and spend eight hours in office.

86
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,588
Scott: Oh my god They finally got time to take care of.

87
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,600
Scott: their finally got time to cook.

88
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,000
Scott: Maybe they could actually go to the grocery and buy ingredients to cook and not have to get delivery.

89
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,360
Scott: That's why there's a crowd at the grocery store.

90
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:27,079
Scott: Right if people could work from if everyone could work from home as much as I do The grocery store would just always be slightly more crowded than it is.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,340
Rym: Yeah, but it wouldn't need to be as open it like 2 in the morning like the Wegmans right to go to anyway.

92
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:43,636
Scott: So on the way back on the train after I bailed from the TJ and had the laptop I'm on the train and the train stops at 34th Street and a smell funny smell.

93
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:44,780
Scott: Oh and everything's.

94
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:46,553
Scott: I look around.

95
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:49,646
Scott: there's no stinky people It's not a crowded train.

96
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:50,470
Rym: Go is it that does go?

97
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,480
Rym: is it that bromine like disinfectant smell?

98
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,509
Scott: No, the train was going in the opposite direction of commuting.

99
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,271
Scott: So it wasn't crowded.

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,940
Scott: No, um, and it's kind of hazy.

101
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:03,059
Scott: And I look at oh and there's like a firefighter coming out of a haze.

102
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:12,300
Rym: And it was basically they always talk about like track fire, dude I do know I've seen like 10 or 15 track fires at Queensborough Plaza in the time.

103
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,980
Scott: Right, but this is an indoor underground track fire that filled that station with smoke.

104
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:18,943
Scott: So I switched.

105
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:24,419
Scott: another train comes in and that train this the the indicators aren't on telling me what letter it is.

106
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:26,860
Rym: But you're just like I want to get out of this station, right?

107
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,088
Scott: The train at the W I was on wasn't moving and I'm like, well that has to be NRQ It can't possibly be anything else.

108
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,074
Scott: I get on it.

109
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:34,340
Rym: It's all right for Street.

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,405
Rym: I guess an R could.

111
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,014
Rym: I think there's a way for an R to get.

112
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,163
Scott: it would be on the same as the W So it would be behind us.

113
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:49,334
Scott: Yeah, so I switch and then finally after I switch the W moves And you know how this smoke and there's like a firefighter walking around.

114
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,740
Scott: it's all creepy the thing.

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,208
Rym: But I the thing I love about New York is like that situation to a New Yorker is just slightly Notable and easily forgotten.

116
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,440
Scott: right and then but they don't tell you about right now.

117
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,523
Scott: They don't tell you which one is leaving next and then the queue moves that I'm on which I didn't realize there's a queue until It stopped.

118
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,280
Scott: Yeah, you watch you now because now I don't want to be right I don't want to be on a queue.

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,118
Scott: So luckily I was able to run across at 42nd Street to get back on the W because they stopped.

120
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,303
Scott: they have big at the same Stops.

121
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,060
Scott: Yep, and then I got home.

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:25,880
Scott: But yeah, but there was a. it was a creepy scene at 34th Street because track fires real common But I don't encounter the track fire indoor.

123
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:39,340
Scott: I've encountered the outside track fires occasionally But the indoor ones that filled the station with smoke and made it smell bad and had firefighters there are less frequent and You know, we were stuck in that station with the fire for a little while.

124
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,739
Scott: Yeah So it was slightly more notable than you know.

125
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:47,638
Rym: Like I've said before the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me on the subway other than the first time I saw a garbage train Before I knew those were a thing.

126
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,808
Scott: Because it's why do you think garbage train?

127
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,072
Scott: Where do you see track geometry?

128
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:53,536
Rym: Oh my god that thing.

129
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,319
Rym: because it's not like it's scary It's not like it's made out of a skeleton or blind you.

130
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:07,768
Rym: It's more that if you've been in the city enough Like you just have this sense of you hear subway noise and you look to your right and a subway train comes in and then One time you hear the subway noise.

131
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,680
Rym: They look to your right and something fucking else is there.

132
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:15,814
Rym: Yeah, doesn't matter if it's scary It's just your brain like almost already shows you a subway.

133
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,168
Rym: and then you get there and the brains like wait This doesn't map the fuck is that?

134
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,997
Rym: and it takes your brain a while to figure it out.

135
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:21,640
Scott: It's the x-ray.

136
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:31,300
Rym: But the creepiest thing I ever encountered on the subway was still Hurricane Sandy when they just turned off the lights at every station On the way it was.

137
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,308
Rym: so it was just silent.

138
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:38,750
Rym: The train would stop the conductor would just walk out like lock a bunch of stuff Close a bunch of gates go into that little booth.

139
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,389
Rym: If it was there all the lights would turn off one by one and then they'd get back on the train.

140
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:49,875
Rym: They'd yell last call doors would close and then it was just pitch black outside of that train And we moved on to the next station.

141
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:50,156
Rym: Mmm.

142
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,285
Rym: It was a weirdly fun night that night.

143
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,197
Rym: just because of that whole situation They're burning.

144
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:56,479
Rym: Yeah.

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,063
Rym: All right.

146
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:57,949
Rym: You got any news?

147
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,044
Scott: Yeah, I got some news.

148
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:08,170
Scott: so Recently, there was some teasing tweets about a Super Mario Lego combo and that's pretty sexy news.

149
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,379
Scott: It's like you go to Toys R Us when I'm a kid.

150
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,203
Scott: And what did I buy?

151
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,107
Scott: Nintendo games?

152
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:12,910
Scott: Yeah Legos.

153
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,298
Scott: Those are the two things that I bought.

154
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:14,701
Scott: Yeah.

155
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,197
Rym: So now finally after 20 magic cards, I buy magic cards.

156
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,461
Scott: Sometimes not a Toys R Us.

157
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,063
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,147
Scott: I mean I didn't.

159
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,738
Rym: I didn't buy them there At Toys R Us and Meijer.

160
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,924
Scott: anyway after 20-plus something years Finally those things combining in an official capacity.

161
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:38,299
Scott: That's a big news for a nerd But then they revealed what it is and what it is is actually pretty cool But something I have no interest in owning personally.

162
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,640
Scott: Yep.

163
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,470
Scott: If you have a kid you are obligated to buy them this.

164
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:47,770
Rym: Oh my god, when I get of appropriate age when I was a kid This would have been like the best gift of that Christmas.

165
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,919
Scott: Basically what is is a Duplo level kind of Lego.

166
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:59,062
Rym: actually it's sort of in between Lego and Duplo and it's the pieces are Lego Conforming but the Mario pieces have like big blocky pieces.

167
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,409
Rym: Yeah, but they interface with the regular Lego.

168
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,710
Rym: you look at it You see what I mean, right?

169
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,912
Scott: but anyway what it is?

170
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:14,750
Scott: it's a Lego toy where Mario is electronic in some fashion and he any Interact a little screen on his chest and had a screen on his chest and he interacts with the other Lego pieces.

171
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,434
Scott: So for example you put Mario on top of a goomba and he'll make a goomba stomping noise and like get some points Appearing on his chest.

172
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:31,685
Scott: or like you'll put him near like a fire and he'll make that like whoa Noise of it when he got his feet get burned and his chest will show fire on it.

173
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:36,537
Scott: or he'll put him near the flag Pole and it'll go And show the flag on his chest right.

174
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:40,327
Scott: and it's sort of like you can make your own little Mario thing.

175
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:46,030
Scott: That's interactive Between you know Mario and all the little little bits and that's a pretty great toy.

176
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:52,650
Scott: But if you're an adult hoping for like, you know a Nintendo, I want a four thousand piece Mario.

177
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,455
Rym: That's the size of a Death Star.

178
00:10:54,576 --> 00:11:02,103
Scott: Yeah, something like that or like a Koopa castle, you know thing where you open it up And you can put all and there's all sorts of things going on in there.

179
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:08,344
Rym: That is not what they made Yep, but at the same time I'd like this is just such a phenomenal looking toy.

180
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,169
Scott: Oh, yeah over made this way.

181
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,426
Scott: good I think everyone in any elementary school anywhere wants this.

182
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:18,550
Rym: Oh my god This is I would put like if I ran like a doctor's office This would be one of the things that would just be in the waiting room.

183
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,445
Scott: I think there's certain rules about what kind of toys are okay for like.

184
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:24,876
Scott: the nut is a choking hazard So you can't put in doctors.

185
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,470
Rym: Yeah, it depends on what level I guess and also sanitation.

186
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:34,210
Scott: I mean There's a reason why every every every doctor and dentist has that toy where the the wires things across the wires of the wood.

187
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,655
Rym: with The blocks you move along the wires.

188
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,019
Scott: Yes now that toy.

189
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,884
Scott: if you search for doctor's office toy on Google Images You will see the toy.

190
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:44,079
Rym: Yep The orange wire was the best wire.

191
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,270
Rym: Okay, that was a really long one.

192
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,179
Scott: Okay, obviously the longest highest most complicated one was the best.

193
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:49,901
Rym: I was the orange one.

194
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,690
Scott: IIRC obviously some some other news.

195
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,428
Rym: Uh, I don't know how many of you care about this, but remember GeekNights.

196
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,301
Rym: two nights ago I talked about the hero pools and overwatch.

197
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,230
Scott: you're doing the same news twice in two GeekNights.

198
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,194
Rym: All I'm gonna talk about.

199
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,270
Rym: well cuz I I feel like I don't need to tell you that stuff shutting down.

200
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:13,450
Rym: You should socially distance and like if your convention is canceled because of coronavirus like there's a reason they canceled it.

201
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,975
Rym: Like don't get mad at the organizers.

202
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:20,056
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I if they canceled hockey if they didn't cancel hockey I would have gone.

203
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,689
Scott: no, but they canceled it.

204
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,457
Rym: So hockey is a hockey.

205
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:27,633
Rym: audience is a much lower risk than a weekend-long convention for a lot of reasons I don't want to get into.

206
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:34,275
Rym: it's bigger though a shorter duration shorter duration less interaction Fewer hotel stays.

207
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,302
Scott: I still one person caught it like the wave.

208
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:39,035
Scott: one person coughs in the prison to the left to coughs in the Person to the left.

209
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,567
Scott: he coughs in the person then it makes a circle.

210
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,603
Scott: that could happen in one period.

211
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:49,170
Rym: but They just did the rotation and the next four heroes they pulled out.

212
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:58,370
Rym: This will mean nothing to Scott, but they they pulled out Basically, like the four most important heroes just to see what the fuck happens.

213
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:06,726
Rym: So the four most used one Reinhardt the big guy with the shield like the guy that like everyone uses to make a big Channing the four best people.

214
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:10,101
Rym: Yeah Well, not the four best people but like for the most used ones.

215
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:12,350
Rym: The other thing is that two of them are healers.

216
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:18,630
Rym: There's two healers that are like super a big part of the meta and like people really worry about which healers.

217
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:23,310
Rym: They basically remove the two best healers meaning you can use a shitty healer or no healer.

218
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,278
Rym: Yeah, meaning well, you have to have two healers.

219
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:29,501
Rym: You could have two shitty healers, but healers that are shitty Oh, right because they have the roll lock.

220
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,750
Rym: Yeah, but good at other things.

221
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:39,609
Rym: This shows the power of this feature Like the fact that the meta is so radically different now and just by saying you can't use these two healers.

222
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:43,670
Rym: Now like which damaged guy do you play is way different.

223
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,090
Scott: This gave me an idea right of a way to possibly evolve this idea to make it even better.

224
00:13:49,194 --> 00:14:02,410
Scott: Yeah Obviously if you have a bunch of choices in any game an asymmetric game and those choices are not all on the parade or frontier Right, if you there's no reason to ever use something in outside the parade or frontier unless you're dunking on someone who's worse.

225
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,540
Scott: But I'm saying if you ban Options that are not on the frontier.

226
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,910
Scott: You're changing nothing basically, right?

227
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,790
Scott: It's only interesting to ban options on the frontier.

228
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,210
Scott: Yep, because it's the only thing that will change what people play with them for moving the frontier, right?

229
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,776
Rym: Instead of picking who to ban.

230
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:21,070
Rym: It'll just ban whatever heroes are used the most or the most effective.

231
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,720
Scott: I'm saying go even further than that.

232
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:31,445
Scott: Yeah every hour Right figure out which hero of each category was most used.

233
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,955
Scott: no, right and Ban that one.

234
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:39,630
Scott: Yeah, right and that way it's obviously every single hero will be unbanned the next hour.

235
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:40,793
Scott: So it's like okay.

236
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,715
Scott: This guy's opie.

237
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,840
Scott: He'll be available every other hour.

238
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,249
Rym: Oh, this gives me an even better idea based on your better idea.

239
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:52,290
Rym: Smash tournament right big weekend long full format smash tournament.

240
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:58,250
Rym: But the way it works is if you win around with a hero with a player character, that's what Hearthstone did.

241
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,170
Rym: Yeah You can never use that character again for the rest of the tournament.

242
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,234
Scott: Hearthstone did that?

243
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,950
Scott: Hearthstone did you had you bring X decks and you have to get a win with each one.

244
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,057
Scott: I also did.

245
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:12,450
Scott: you can play your decks as much as you want But as soon as one of your decks loses that one is dead and you have to play the remaining.

246
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,145
Rym: But I want to see you like I win round one with Bowser I cannot pick Bowser again for the rest of the tournament.

247
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:22,818
Scott: Fuck you What if during it This how about this?

248
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,050
Scott: ready in a single match of overwatch?

249
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,502
Scott: Oh, you join a match of overwatch.

250
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,170
Scott: pick whoever the fuck you want, right?

251
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,999
Scott: So who'd you say was this that's really strong?

252
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,707
Rym: He'll don't say we're doing talent healers more.

253
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,210
Rym: I'd be more.

254
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,879
Scott: So you're more of the best healer, right?

255
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,005
Scott: Yeah, you start playing.

256
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:36,810
Scott: you're dead.

257
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,284
Scott: You're still stuck in the healer role, but I can't be more.

258
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,310
Scott: ever is dead.

259
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,170
Scott: You cannot pick more again this match.

260
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,335
Scott: You have to pick a different healer.

261
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,408
Rym: even better if you die and now you can't be any healer.

262
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:46,789
Rym: Fuck you.

263
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,990
Scott: Well, I think if you die, I think I think it would reset.

264
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,758
Rym: yeah, well that's because that's what root does with the birds.

265
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,592
Rym: if you decline like you go into turmoil four times and all your Leaders are dead.

266
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:00,302
Scott: They all respond or you could have.

267
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:13,610
Scott: you could either reset you could just be like you're fucked or you could be like Here, there's some base healer who's like just this like replacement player and like if you looks like Barney from half-life.

268
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,039
Scott: Exactly you've lost you've lost.

269
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,270
Scott: you've died with all of the real characters.

270
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,282
Scott: You're now stuck on the generic healer guy no matter what role you're in.

271
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:23,847
Rym: You just turn into Dan Hibiki.

272
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:28,322
Scott: Yes, exactly Right, so they the only problem with this.

273
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,550
Scott: I think it has a little bit of snowball enos.

274
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:38,518
Scott: Oh, it definitely does but if you sort of mix it up, right so you kill the other team's healer But they kill your tank and it's you can sort of.

275
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,950
Scott: it might not be a complete snowball for one side because you have teams.

276
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,693
Scott: Yes, might be snowball per player if it's Depending.

277
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,110
Rym: Well, you know what that's like in counter-strike good old gun game, you know.

278
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:55,370
Scott: But the point is with that mode right you could then combine it with that sort of ban, right?

279
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:05,248
Scott: So you could be like, okay, which heat healer was chosen in first Right in all these games and then you ban that one and then you have the reset.

280
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:05,810
Scott: so it's okay.

281
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,964
Scott: We banned the healer that keeps getting chosen first and will reset you.

282
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,410
Scott: so you have to cycle through all of them.

283
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,061
Scott: So you can't be good at a character.

284
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,770
Scott: You have to be good at a whole class.

285
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:21,943
Rym: Yeah, if you want to play over which is actually Bob That's kind of the direction overwatch is pushing in terms of.

286
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,490
Rym: you can be you can play whatever you want.

287
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,953
Scott: It's like.

288
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:29,110
Scott: you don't have to be good at tank and healing and sniping Yep, but you have to pick one and be able to play any character.

289
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,463
Rym: Yeah of that role and remember way back the other change they made.

290
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:34,050
Rym: that was brilliant that I talked about a while ago.

291
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,567
Rym: They rank you separately for each type.

292
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:41,002
Rym: now So I have a rank in tank that's way higher than my rank in DPS.

293
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,727
Rym: for obvious reasons I'm 38, right.

294
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:50,310
Scott: Here's another thing you could do right which might not make players want to play is the problem.

295
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:57,250
Scott: But instead of banning the one that's chosen the most we ban you from choosing the one you choose the most.

296
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:01,783
Scott: So so you are a. you know, even let's say you are a big Danny Vicky guy.

297
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:04,089
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can't play Dan.

298
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,179
Scott: Too bad, you're too good with Dan.

299
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,429
Scott: Yep, you can play the top meta guy.

300
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,677
Scott: sure You think you have no practice with.

301
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,530
Scott: basically is you get too good with the character?

302
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,969
Scott: We force you off that character and onto another one.

303
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:28,227
Rym: But what I like to is this all these types of things like what overwatch is doing and even the crazy stuff we suggested now They do a game design thing that I kind of like where instead of trying to balance your entire game forever.

304
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:32,483
Rym: Just Mix up a bunch of stuff and then the game becomes.

305
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,250
Rym: who figures out the new meta first?

306
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,954
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

307
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:35,658
Scott: is a meta?

308
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,463
Scott: can a meta, you know matter how much you know It always takes time to form but it will change the game frequently enough.

309
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:42,245
Scott: It cannot.

310
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:43,730
Scott: you can prevent it from forming.

311
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,061
Scott: Yeah, right.

312
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,928
Scott: No, no one can evolve to adapt to an environment if the environment changes more faster than the rate of evolution.

313
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:51,169
Scott: Yep,

314
00:18:51,189 --> 00:19:09,810
Rym: and If a degenerate strategy appears like think back to sports fucking awesome I want to watch the overwatch league match where the the disaster meta that appears from the hero bands ends up making a weird degenerate Nonsense situation because that is the anomalous thing that I love to see in a sports match like crazy shit happening.

315
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,525
Rym: but anyway Things of the day what he got.

316
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:25,211
Scott: Oh, so I discovered this very short animated film recently Thanks to reading a lot of internet.

317
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:26,540
Scott: This is from.

318
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,480
Scott: I get the feeling this is one of those short animations that would play before a movie.

319
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:42,593
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure when it was exactly shown but it was Written directed and voiced by Mel Brooks, but there's other people involved.

320
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,220
Scott: Yeah, you can check the credits, but it's mostly a Mel Brooks joint.

321
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,850
Scott: It's called the critic has nothing to do with the other animated critic.

322
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,619
Rym: I almost want to read out loud this description of it from the.

323
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,629
Scott: Yeah, you can read it yourself, but it's only what.

324
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,733
Scott: it's less than 10 minutes long.

325
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,677
Scott: It's super short, right.

326
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,585
Scott: three minutes long It's long.

327
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:11,240
Scott: So this will be a very entertaining three minutes for anyone who has never heard of This or seen it before like me where I've seen pretty much everything Mel Brooks has ever created.

328
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,146
Scott: Yeah, several times over yet.

329
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,397
Scott: I hadn't seen this so that's got to be thing of the day worthy.

330
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:16,938
Rym: Yep.

331
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,414
Rym: I I'm not gonna say anything about it.

332
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,020
Rym: Just watch it.

333
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,933
Rym: In fact, I would say watch it before you even read the YouTube description.

334
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,319
Scott: got three minutes, right?

335
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,505
Scott: You're wasting your time.

336
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,309
Rym: What are you doing?

337
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,214
Rym: 24 seconds saying.

338
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,220
Scott: what are you doing with your time?

339
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,126
Scott: Listen to GeekNights.

340
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,515
Scott: No, you can.

341
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:32,260
Scott: you can change that.

342
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,939
Rym: So We've never made this a thing of the day.

343
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,040
Rym: It's been around for a while like in various forms, but it's irrelevant to our main bit.

344
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:51,830
Rym: this is just a YouTube video that is like 16 17 minutes long and is a collection of bloopers Failures and I feel like I've seen this before.

345
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,101
Rym: I think I've seen parts of this before from like specials Like.

346
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:58,900
Rym: I think I saw this in a documentary or parts of it, but it's from Star Wars a new hope.

347
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:17,779
Rym: But some of it isn't even mistakes so much as it's the video that they were filming but with the audio from the soundstage or the set that includes like Some production assistant or even in some cases the director or an assistant director yelling at stormtroopers like walk faster faster faster

348
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:19,603
Scott: I mean the all.

349
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,128
Scott: the entire movie was dubbed over.

350
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:31,080
Scott: Yeah, pretty much almost every scene in Star Wars the new hope as a DIs There's Almost everything in the entire original trilogy is dubbed over in post.

351
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,720
Rym: In fact most action movies until like relatively recent times had a lot of ADR because good camera.

352
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,071
Scott: But there was still audio recorded on set.

353
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,080
Scott: Yeah, it just was when they went to post.

354
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,295
Scott: They just got rid of that like some old movies.

355
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,542
Rym: if you see these things It's great.

356
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:57,600
Rym: Like you'll literally hear someone saying like pew pew pew and they shoot a gun sometimes Like you'll hear someone off-screen just yelling bang bang bang or especially like stunt actors need to communicate with each other.

357
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,155
Scott: There's like a fight scene or anything like that, right?

358
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:01,020
Scott: So they don't hurt each other.

359
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,573
Scott: I was watching one from or they need to yell.

360
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,989
Scott: timings like okay Like let's say there's like a motorcycle jump over it.

361
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,580
Scott: Yeah, that happens all the time and like James Bond movies, right?

362
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,844
Scott: Then you know you hear people.

363
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,054
Scott: it's like okay one two three.

364
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,406
Scott: Okay go with the car and Now the motorcycle.

365
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,880
Scott: timing, you know, you need instruction, right?

366
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:26,780
Scott: This was just like because they're all collected and then in post all you hear is Right, you know some special effects or some shit.

367
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:34,206
Rym: But just the fact that this is a whole bunch of them and a variety of those situations just all strung together It's pretty entertaining to watch.

368
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,193
Scott: I mean Star Wars right a lightsaber fight.

369
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,100
Scott: It's two people smacking wooden sticks together.

370
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,307
Scott: These clacking noises also, right?

371
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:44,380
Scott: They gotta replace those with the old, you know, electric razor and a metal bowl noise.

372
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:48,292
Rym: You get Darth Vader's real voice, but like the actor thought he actually had to act.

373
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:56,440
Scott: Yep, and you get a lot of outtakes 100 everyone knows this but a hundred percent of Darth Vader is dubbed over by James Earl Jones.

374
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:04,762
Scott: Yes, but the actor who actually played Darth Any might know but can now currently actually act bring to mind and I want to say it's a name I know.

375
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:06,067
Scott: Yeah, I know the name.

376
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,020
Scott: I just can't say it right now, but there's a lot my brain is not good.

377
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,574
Rym: there's that one scene where he chokes out a Rebellion.

378
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:15,150
Scott: so giant dude, he died actually not too long.

379
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,309
Rym: Yeah, they keep having to do retakes of him choking out this dude, and it's actually really funny.

380
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,666
Scott: I'm gonna look it up cuz it's driving me nuts that I can't remember his name.

381
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,533
Scott: Yep David Prowse.

382
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:26,894
Scott: Yep.

383
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:27,737
Scott: Yeah, that's a guy.

384
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,748
Scott: He's a no if you ever seen him outside the Darth Vader costume.

385
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:31,230
Scott: He's enormous.

386
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,844
Rym: Yeah in the metamoment he knows book club book the tale of Genji.

387
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:36,450
Rym: I am Genji and a long Hanzo.

388
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,104
Rym: Hanzo is not showing up yet.

389
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,914
Scott: Nope Other things going on.

390
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:49,519
Scott: obviously not any conventions until PAX West which has not yet been announced as canceled Yep, but we'll see how things go with the coronavirus.

391
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,010
Scott: Also, we get a lot more free time with no hockey even to go to.

392
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,850
Rym: So I'm gonna as things in New York slowly shut down.

393
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:59,047
Rym: I think what we're gonna do is you're gonna see a lot of.

394
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:07,768
Scott: yeah I got nothing to do except make content and I guess Zelda randomizer has like gone up to the top of the list of things right now.

395
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:12,407
Rym: this weekend I'm gonna set up a Final Fantasy 4 free enterprise infrastructure, right?

396
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,110
Rym: I'm gonna set it up.

397
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:24,714
Rym: So if anyone is interested in trying out the Final Fantasy 4 randomizer I will be very patient with you because I need some people to play it this way if you want to play Zelda 3 Randomized in some way.

398
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:27,583
Scott: come to the GeekNights official semi official.

399
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:28,987
Rym: I'll do score.

400
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:29,890
Rym: I'll dig up a link to it.

401
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,903
Scott: Yeah, uh, yeah, we got discord.

402
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,890
Scott: you go to Twitter.

403
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:36,866
Scott: We got to do two different YouTube channels that you should go to.

404
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:39,192
Scott: we got Instagram.

405
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,215
Scott: I don't remember to use enough.

406
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,199
Scott: Yep, but it's there.

407
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,667
Rym: It's it's I shut down the rimbler's.

408
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:44,390
Rym: the rimbler's gone.

409
00:24:44,673 --> 00:24:45,178
Scott: Oh the rimbler.

410
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:45,542
Scott: Okay.

411
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:46,290
Rym: I also shut down.

412
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,078
Rym: I forgot I had a tumblr whose sole purpose was.

413
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,790
Scott: I think I actually have access to the GeekNights YouTube channel that we don't use.

414
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:55,857
Scott: Anyway, we have a lot of.

415
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,888
Scott: Oh GeekNights is now on Spotify if you want to listen to it there instead.

416
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,822
Scott: Yep We got everything.

417
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:01,468
Rym: we got stuff going on.

418
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,289
Scott: I didn't delete the Facebook page and if you end up getting stuck at home with I probably should.

419
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:08,490
Rym: We're gonna be playing a lot of video games and hanging out online.

420
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,034
Scott: Yeah, now it's me.

421
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:10,796
Scott: It's nerd time.

422
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:10,997
Scott: Now.

423
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:12,081
Scott: Everyone's stuck inside.

424
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,586
Scott: Yeah, it's nerd season.

425
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,670
Rym: I'm dusting off the VR.

426
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,783
Scott: Oh, the only thing that can stop me is is bike season which is coming.

427
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:18,325
Rym: Yep.

428
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:19,430
Scott: So that's good.

429
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,690
Rym: Yeah, the thing is because once it's warm, the one thing coronavirus does not stop for me is running.

430
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:26,410
Scott: I am I will bike regardless of any virus.

431
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,136
Scott: I'm gonna get a virus while biking.

432
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:36,063
Rym: in fact running is gonna be great because if if like all the places I run don't have People I don't have to deal with crowds of people blocking me and messing up my times.

433
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:36,906
Scott: less cars.

434
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:37,930
Scott: Yeah bikes.

435
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,334
Rym: So otherwise, yeah stay tuned We got.

436
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:47,010
Rym: no that the next possible Convention for us at this point is probably gonna be Pax West and none of us have the virus yet.

437
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,478
Scott: So we're can still podcasts.

438
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,948
Scott: Yeah, and even if Rym's was something like oh, I got the virus Well, I probably got it too.

439
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:57,150
Scott: Yeah And if somehow he does and I don't we can just podcast over the internet or whatever.

440
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:57,512
Rym: We.

441
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:01,513
Rym: the only reason we don't podcast over the internet because it's kind of a pain in the ass But we can.

442
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,075
Scott: we can.

443
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:02,979
Rym: yeah, I'd have to.

444
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,670
Rym: in fact, it's actually easier now that I got the new rig.

445
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:08,600
Scott: Yeah, we could go to that if we had to yep.

446
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,707
Rym: I don't think we'll have to for the foreseeable future.

447
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:11,449
Scott: I do not either.

448
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:14,990
Rym: Especially well anyway, so the Mandalorian.

449
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:18,302
Scott: So if you don't know what the deal is, right.

450
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,730
Scott: so Disney bought the Star Wars.

451
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:28,339
Scott: They made a bunch of movies They made TV show and they brought out their Disney Plus streaming network and they want to compete with the Netflix and you know Everyone else the hoot.

452
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,629
Scott: Well, I guess they own Hulu also.

453
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,636
Scott: I don't know why they just don't.

454
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:37,510
Scott: I thought they would just merge Hulu into Disney Plus But I guess they want to keep all the Disney branded content in the Disney Plus.

455
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:44,750
Scott: We want all the other things they technically own but aren't Disney branded on the Hulu side.

456
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,610
Rym: Anyway, so last night we pulled up Disney Plus and I saw a movie that struck.

457
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,964
Rym: You know Sometimes you see something and suddenly your brain remembers something from your childhood that you look.

458
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,088
Scott: poster looks familiar.

459
00:26:55,128 --> 00:27:00,315
Rym: The name rings No bells, so there's this Disney Plus movie called Perry Uh-huh, and it's a lot.

460
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:13,082
Rym: It's basically a nature documentary with a narrative about this squirrel Mm-hmm, and I saw it when we were just scrolling through Disney Plus and I was like something that I've that some stern Powerful in my soul and we watched it.

461
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:18,184
Rym: I'm not only do I remember this I am like 90% sure we had it on a VHS tape.

462
00:27:18,324 --> 00:27:20,252
Scott: I definitely didn't have it on VHS tape I'm not.

463
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:25,712
Scott: I can't tell you whether I remember it or not because the poster is like that's a movie poster I've seen.

00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,584
Scott: yeah that name and that squirrel I do not remember.

465
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:34,526

00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:35,670

00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:44,625
Scott: but I'm saying like that I remember and that's what the squirrel brings to mind.

Rym: when I was a little kid I saw Ricky Dickey Tavi and then I didn't know what it was and it wasn't an internet to look it up and it took Me a long time to find out what like there was a book and all that.

479
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,534
Rym: for some reason I kept asking adult.

480
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,224
Scott: my memory knew my memory of Ricky Dickey there.

481
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:11,947

Rym: Yes There was a book.

483
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:20,950
Scott: Yes I think my memory of it is seeing it in the public library in like the meeting room on a projector.

484
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:34,167
Scott: but my memory of seeing it there includes a memory of having seen it previously like I Remember seeing it in the library and I remember remembering having already seen it But I don't remember where I had already seen it.

485
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,530
Scott: I saw must have been from an even younger age when I had no memory.

486
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:50,199
Rym: I saw the Chuck Jones cartoon on TV and then I remember like I asked my parents like what it was and they didn't know and like my teacher didn't like no one knew what it was and TV guy didn't say anything other than Chuck Jones Ricky Dickey Tavi.

487
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:51,622
Rym: Okay, I didn't have anywhere to look it up.

488
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:52,224
Rym: Okay.

489
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:55,193
Scott: Anyway, uh That's it.

490
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,800
Scott: Anyway, don't Disney Plus right?

491
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,789
Scott: So Disney Plus wants people to sign up.

492
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:04,190
Scott: So, of course they bring their best hottest property the Star War and they make a TV show.

493
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,082
Scott: Yeah, and it's eight episodes.

494
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:06,827
Scott: I thought it was more.

495
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:07,270
Scott: I was wrong.

496
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:08,990
Scott: Or today I found out it was eight.

497
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,793
Scott: I thought I had watched.

498
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:13,429
Scott: I watched four episodes at the time when there were only four episodes out.

499
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,341
Scott: Didn't watch any more than that Rym.

500
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,529
Scott: watch the whole thing and I loved it.

501
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,982
Scott: I really await the sequel and that was that wasn't.

502
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:23,712
Scott: and then they came out with more and I didn't watch him and That was that.

503
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:25,820
Scott: so I found out today.

504
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,844
Scott: There were only eight episodes.

505
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:27,406
Scott: I thought there were more.

506
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,899
Scott: they're not long either So they're only like all.

507
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,730
Scott: the first one I think is longer longer.

508
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,710
Scott: It's like a typical TV show where you got to start off with the long episodes to build your whole thing.

509
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,390
Rym: Well, also kind of like a lot of shorter, you know.

510
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,370
Rym: You know like some anime like the first episode was a little longer and didn't have the opener.

511
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:48,230
Scott: Well, yeah, they'll bleed in the first and last episode of a lot of anime.

512
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:56,617
Scott: They'll bleed over into the credits and they won't have openers or closers or didn't show the closer over the anime to get those Extra seconds in there.

513
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:58,790
Scott: Yeah, that was the side of the middle episodes.

514
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,530
Scott: We'll have full openers full closers and be really short and cheaper.

515
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:08,409
Rym: There were definitely some like late 90s anime where if you heard the closing music coming in too early Shit was about to go down.

516
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:14,710
Scott: Well, I mean the ultimate anime for closing music is coming in while the show is still showing is Gundam seed.

517
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:21,450
Rym: Yeah, go well for she did it every episode but Gundam seed when it did it That was the episode where you'd be like what?

518
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,230
Scott: Because you'd because they would start playing it while characters is still talking.

519
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,350
Scott: So people are talking or fighting in robots and you hear the song and you're just like fuck you.

520
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,578
Scott: So you didn't realize that was over.

521
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,100
Scott: it's like.

522
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,304
Scott: it's like guess.

523
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,810
Scott: it's like guess what?

524
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,248
Rym: five seconds.

525
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:46,130
Rym: So now let's back up a little bit - we were young and we saw Star Wars.

526
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:51,047
Rym: Yeah, and in the background of a bunch of scenes, there was this character that people would say.

527
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:51,830
Rym: Oh, that's Boba Fett.

528
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:52,994
Scott: Yep, didn't?

529
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,158
Rym: they didn't tell you shit about.

530
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,285
Scott: Boba Fett was a better toy than a character.

531
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:57,730
Rym: Here's what I here's what I knew about.

532
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,636
Rym: That's Boba Fett the Mandalorian.

533
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,903
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, it's like that's Boba Fett.

534
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,990
Scott: It's a dude in armor with a jetpack.

535
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,916
Rym: What's a Boba Fett?

536
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,063
Rym: Is that his name or his race?

537
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:06,646
Rym: I don't know.

538
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:09,905
Rym: I don't know What's a Mandalorian that is never explained.

539
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:10,629
Scott: bounty hunting?

540
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:17,810
Scott: Dude with guns and a jetpack and a grappling hook and he wants working with the Empire but not necessarily with the Empire.

541
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:24,190
Scott: He's obviously some mercenary and he wants to just make money dangerous enough to where even Darth Vader will not give this dude shit.

542
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:31,390
Scott: But for some reason even after capturing Han and bringing Han to Jabba and getting paid hung out with Jabba.

543
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:33,321
Scott: Anyway, instead of leaving to find new work.

544
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,870
Scott: Yeah, I always thought that was strange.

545
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:35,836
Rym: Well, cuz we didn't.

546
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:41,070
Scott: but then it was died like a chump Yeah, and then it's like I actually didn't pay that much attention.

547
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,430
Scott: I knew Boba Fett right, but I didn't pay that much attention to Boba Fett when I was a kid.

548
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:50,870
Scott: But later on like high school college Star Wars nerds were always like love it both of it.

549
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:55,927
Rym: And I'm like family guy would make jokes about this like I never bet the Fett right.

550
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:59,510
Scott: and it's like You mean that guy who was in the movie for two seconds?

551
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,770
Scott: I'm like people cared a lot about this character.

552
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,693
Rym: Which is the thing like that?

553
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,620
Scott: what I did not care very much about?

554
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,758
Scott: and usually I'm all about caring about the site the small Side character who doesn't get enough skill.

555
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,270
Rym: Well like in Gosaraki, I'm all about the president of the United States, right?

556
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,917
Scott: And it's like I'm okay.

557
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:15,620
Scott: I'm Boba Fett both.

558
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,790
Scott: That's cool, but I'm not a huge Boba Fett.

559
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:22,962
Rym: It was partly I think that when I looked at the costumes like Boba Fett really stood out and I really like that.

560
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:26,237
Scott: if you want to talk about cool side character I'm a. I'm a vix wedge side.

561
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:27,744
Rym: Oh, yeah vixen wedge.

562
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,829
Scott: Give me those x-wings.

563
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:38,821
Rym: I'm also a very like early venture brothers like 21 and 24 like two henchmen But anyway, I like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern side characters.

564
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:41,250
Scott: Obviously the fat man was mad popular though.

565
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:54,330
Scott: So making any sort of new thing for the mass audience based on Mandalorians bounty hunters Boba Fett's y'all cetera Is gonna be a good sell and is an easy thing to do as a side story?

566
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,288
Rym: And it's fertile ground doesn't?

567
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,202
Scott: yeah It doesn't conflict with anything in the main movies.

568
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:06,367
Rym: you have now and also you have not Established in the cinematic universe a significant cannon that you have to deal with.

569
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:14,722
Scott: Yep And you've got an overabundance of now Non-canon that was formerly cannon to completely poach from.

570
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,410
Scott: yeah, because mad nerds were all over that shit.

571
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,497
Rym: Yep, so take all that.

572
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:23,590
Scott: I don't even think that was the word Mandalorian even said in a Star Wars movie.

573
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:24,835
Rym: I thought it's hard to see.

574
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,759
Rym: this is the problem.

575
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,570
Scott: It might have been in the in the ridge in the prequel trilogy.

576
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:34,296
Rym: I feel like it was said because I knew the word But I don't know.

577
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,204
Scott: I knew the word from nerds on the internet.

578
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:36,747
Scott: Yeah, I don't.

579
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:42,890
Scott: I don't think I knew the Someone out there who's watched the prequel series because it definitely wasn't said in episodes 4 5 6.

580
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,441
Scott: Well, this is the thing said in episodes 1 2 or 3 nerds.

581
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,446
Scott: Let us know.

582
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:47,749
Rym: You know what?

583
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,191
Rym: It's like.

584
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:58,090
Rym: it's like when I first got into anime and I was in elementary school and like I couldn't find out about anime Like I'd see some anime but like there was no way to find out more about it.

585
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,442
Scott: You googled that you wouldn't find too much.

586
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:00,169
Scott: there wasn't Google.

587
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:01,032
Scott: No There wasn't.

588
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,457
Rym: and then there'd be the.

589
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:12,004
Rym: it was the nerd in my middle school who knew a lot about anime Because he had lived in Japan for a long time and He would just like tell me things about anime that I like.

590
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:15,541
Rym: like he told me shit about tenchi muyo And I was just like what the fuck always remember this.

591
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:16,969
Scott: I'll always remember fourth grade.

592
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,449
Scott: It was a Japanese exchange student, right and we were doing something.

593
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,290
Scott: We're like we drew pictures of what we wanted for holiday gifts or something of all and he drew a Super Nintendo.

594
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,159
Scott: Everyone else was like what the fuck?

595
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,167
Scott: there ain't no such thing as Super Nintendo.

596
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,417
Scott: Super Nintendo You're making shit up.

597
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:39,438
Scott: and then that Japanese kid was definitely not Right, they knew what he knew.

598
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,085
Scott: what was up, right?

599
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:41,545
Scott: Yep.

600
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:49,130
Rym: Anyway, so Boba Fett has this like cultural cachet, but also the new Star Wars movies.

601
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,483
Rym: I'm not saying good or bad or anything, but some people really like them.

602
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,386
Rym: Some people really hate them.

603
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,290
Rym: Some people don't care.

604
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,174
Scott: I like them.

605
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,103
Scott: I just don't like them as much as the original.

606
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:58,510
Rym: I'm pretty much in that same boat.

607
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:04,950
Rym: I don't hate them as much as the prequel trilogy But they're set what like 20 30 years after the trilogy that everyone knows and loves.

608
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,732
Scott: Yeah, but the point is like I could watch original trilogy and I'll just be captured in it like a yep Oh my god.

609
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:10,756
Scott: prequel trilogy.

610
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:11,720
Scott: I'll try to turn it off.

611
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,687
Scott: Yeah, right the new trilogy.

612
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:14,349
Scott: I'll watch it.

613
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,250
Scott: Yeah, I would watch it again, but I could not be trapped by it.

614
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,778
Rym: I could turn it off if I want but to this day like if you put up if if I see those twin suns rising Fuck I'm stuck here now until this movie ends.

615
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:26,501
Rym: There's no way out.

616
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:26,943
Rym: That's right.

617
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:31,284
Scott: So that's hopefully The end of the movie was the new beginning.

618
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:42,273
Rym: have a lot of stuff That's from a like a future of the Star Wars universe But the Mandalorian is basically set right like a couple years after Episode six.

619
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:42,735
Scott: Yep.

620
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:53,990
Rym: So like stormtrooper like instead of having like oh the stormtroopers It's like oh There's the general who's like leading a band of ex stormtroopers on this bullshit planet hiding from the New Republic.

621
00:35:54,831 --> 00:36:06,050
Rym: It's set in the same universe that I have the maximum nostalgia for the accoutrements of Mm-hmm, and I think they realize there's a terrible power there coupled with it's not spoilers at this point.

622
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:09,850
Rym: The whole thing is he's protecting the child, which is basically a baby Yoda, right?

623
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,736
Scott: So that's the thing.

624
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:11,541
Scott: is they went in?

625
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,730
Rym: if you were surprised by that?

626
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:15,306
Rym: I really want to know how you avoided knowing that.

627
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:18,075
Scott: Yeah They go in already.

628
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:21,970
Scott: The show is like announcing that it's fanservice the show because it's Boba Fett the show.

629
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:23,370
Scott: No, it's not the Fett man.

630
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:33,890
Scott: You know what for Star Wars if it's set in like the direct and then some genius is like what fanservice thing Could we come up with to make people who don't care about a Boba Fett man, right?

631
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,133
Scott: want to watch this show?

632
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,442
Rym: and the answer is turns into lone wolf in color, like.

633
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:49,275
Scott: I don't think they've told us exactly which Genius came up with a baby Yoda idea, but that's basically like whoever was like in a writers room and was like Baby Yoda.

634
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:52,748
Scott: and they're just like here's a here's this briefcase full of money.

635
00:36:52,789 --> 00:37:00,469
Scott: you win Genius like the extent it's like, you know personally like it doesn't excite me personally that much like it's guy.

636
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:01,352
Rym: It's cute I like it.

637
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:02,176
Rym: Well, I like.

638
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:05,390
Rym: I'm like the baby is a mural and dangerous, right?

639
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,740
Scott: But the point is that I might not be a good guy.

640
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,227
Scott: that idea is obvious.

641
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:09,810
Scott: gold mine.

642
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:14,472
Scott: Yeah, right in terms of oh obviously that will be the greatest hit in the Boba Fett.

643
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:20,109
Rym: someone who never says a word and the entire universe just agrees as a badass despite not having any right.

644
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,954
Scott: It's like.

645
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:21,939
Scott: it's like a music producer.

646
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:22,623
Scott: Here's a song.

647
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:27,225
Scott: They might not like that song They might not play that song in their car more than a few times, but it's like.

648
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:28,470
Scott: they know that's going platinum.

649
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:29,617
Scott: Yep, that right.

650
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:30,683
Scott: Here's a contract.

651
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:31,025
Scott: Mr.

652
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:31,809
Scott: Rock star.

653
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:39,897
Rym: So we were at PAX East a little while ago and at PAX East there's acquisitions incorporated where the penny arcade people play Dungeons & Dragons with celebrity guests and just fun.

654
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:42,930
Rym: and I was there like helping but manage the audience.

655
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:50,658
Rym: They basically made the entire plot was basically the Mandalorian with a baby Something else baby Mike's character.

656
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:55,116
Rym: Okay, Mike's character turned into a baby and the rest of characters had to like Mandalorian.

657
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:55,659
Rym: that baby.

658
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,827
Scott: so she's out.

659
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:07,270
Rym: So The Mandalorian if I actually had to describe it it did like on a high level before we get into like some details and review.

660
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:15,279
Rym: It gives me a lot of the feels that moments from the original Star Wars give me Sometimes and it gives me fan service and the fan.

661
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:16,744
Rym: but the fan service is not.

662
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,153
Rym: it doesn't cross that line where I cringe at It.

663
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:24,910
Rym: like there's this one moment in a later episode Where it just does a venture brothers kind of thing or a vixen wedge kind of thing.

664
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:36,565
Rym: It just costs to these two like dumbass Stormtroopers working for the bad guy and they're just sitting on speeder bikes outside of town and they they're just bored and they keep calling Back in like can we come back into town yet?

665
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:39,776
Rym: And they're like no Darth whatever just like murdered.

666
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:43,910
Rym: a bunch of people just hang tight and they're just like ends having this like mundane conversation.

667
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:54,187
Rym: and one of them just kind of is bored and he's kind of pulls out his blaster and starts fucking with it and there's like This garbage in the distance and he just starts taking potshots at the garbage Just can't fucking hit it.

668
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,200
Rym: And the other one starts kind of chuckling like that kind of stuff.

669
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,484
Rym: like that's the line of.

670
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,170
Rym: I like that kind of fan service.

671
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:10,272
Scott: Anyway, so what the show is is it's actually just lone wolf and cub a serial Western Which is well just lone wolf income, but it's just So.

672
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,342
Rym: it's actually more than that because I've seen the whole thing.

673
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:24,415
Rym: every episode is Take the lone wolf and cub like basic like we have a lone wolf income situation and then make that episode an homage to a different Genre or milieu of cinema.

674
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,523
Rym: like what episode is a full-on Western?

675
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:28,570
Rym: one of them is a full-on heist movie.

676
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:34,750
Rym: Like every one of them is a very different genre And the only thing that ties them together is the lone wolf and cub.

677
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:39,328
Rym: One of them is very Kurosawa as opposed to like traditional American Western.

678
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:41,839
Rym: Mmm I know you didn't like the Kurosawa one.

679
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:44,270
Scott: I mean, it's basically right.

680
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,998
Scott: So, you know when you go see a Star Wars movie, right?

681
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:47,941
Scott: You're seeing right?

682
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:53,799
Scott: Everything is like very grandiose Right and large like you like on Endor.

683
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:57,309
Rym: There's like a thousand a TSTs like whatever there's everywhere, right?

684
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,054
Scott: But I'm just saying like now

685
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:00,037
Rym: see with 80 not

686
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:14,814
Scott: just the content of what is happening story-wise being grand But the the production of it right the way it's shot, right the the kind of like wide You know terrain shots they have Right, you know even

687
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:18,685
Rym: the stakes like we're waiting here to save an entire planet.

688
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:20,149
Scott: right the loud score, right?

689
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,262
Scott: It's like, you know trumpets like your door Star right, it's like they're there, you know, it's like ta-da.

690
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:27,205
Scott: here comes the king.

691
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:28,830
Scott: Star Wars is walking through right?

692
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,711
Scott: Whereas this is sort of like, you know It's like.

693
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:40,824
Scott: okay the actually the beginning couple episodes sort of have a lot of that going on Even though you're telling this smaller story about a few characters

694
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:43,473
Rym: because it's not environmental storytelling but it's more the same

695
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:48,732
Scott: way that cowboy bebop tells a story about just a few characters are in this bigger world where other stuff is Bigger than

696
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:48,913
Rym: that.

697
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:56,040
Rym: Well, like it doesn't tell you what the deal is with this like former Imperial guy No, but you can imply a lot about the universe.

698
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,390
Rym: That's interesting without ruining it by being too specific, right?

699
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:08,245
Scott: But the point is in those beginning episodes, even though you're still focusing on the small Set of characters in the smaller situation, right?

700
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:09,792
Scott: You're still setting It's.

701
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:18,777
Scott: it's those early episodes aren't doing the serial thing yet They're sort of the first two episodes are really sort of Setting up the.

702
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:22,750
Scott: you know that Mandalorian, you know, baby situation.

703
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:25,961
Scott: Yeah, that is gonna be carried through the other episodes.

704
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:28,370
Rym: Yeah, and they do it pretty pretty well pretty succinct.

705
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,950
Scott: So those early episodes I was actually kind of way into it, right?

706
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,932
Scott: But then you know episode three a little bit and episode four completely Right.

707
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:40,318
Scott: What ends up happening is okay.

708
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:48,401
Scott: that big setup that we did right is now been reduced to this thread That is simply tying these independent episodes together.

709
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,953
Scott: as you see these characters travel from Story to.

710
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:56,249
Rym: so I would urge you because it's only eight episodes to watch the rest because I got stuff to do.

711
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,237
Rym: After that episode four.

712
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,730
Rym: it basically turns into resolve that plot and go deep.

713
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:06,230
Rym: Oh, maybe it's not just fight an AT-AT in episode five.

714
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:16,218
Rym: It actually is like like five is like a heist movie instead like totally different and that leads into like why the Mandalorians are Doing what they're doing and like it.

715
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,250
Rym: it goes deep into the Imperial thing and answers a lot of questions.

716
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,988
Rym: But like all the other someone way more important than Verna Herzog shows up with a lightsaber.

717
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:37,662
Scott: Okay The other thing is like I said, not just content wise but also, you know Filming wise score wise, you know all that right?

718
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:40,470
Rym: It's does it's not grand cuz I don't want it to be grand.

719
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:41,090
Rym: I like this release.

720
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:57,197
Rym: I love the idea of like like I like that AT-ST episode a lot because you zoom in and it's just here's some regular people and we're looking at an AT-ST like from the ground up in a zoomed in environment as opposed to here's the wide shot and there's A thousand AT-STs in a giant battle.

721
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,112
Scott: Yeah, maybe I just thought it was sort of cheesy like Oh, I love monster in the woods is an AT-ST Like.

722
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:04,030
Scott: I already saw that coming a mile away.

723
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,970
Rym: I saw it coming too because it was a formula and it's Kurosawa esque movie But it's boring and lame.

724
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:15,322
Rym: I wanted that because I really like watching like Good deep homages to other movies and the fact that

725
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:22,799
Scott: I don't mind that it's not the fact that there's no mod It's just that it was sort of like a oh my like, okay I see we're doing

726
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:23,643
Rym: it but I will say it's got.

727
00:43:23,663 --> 00:43:24,849
Rym: the other episodes are not like that.

728
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,870
Rym: All right, like it does not do but all you know.

729
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,803
Scott: But episode three like the second half was sort of you know winding down right and it's like.

730
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:33,111
Scott: I still can't find words to describe It.

731
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:36,810
Scott: that will let anyone accept my feelings but basically I don't accept your feelings.

732
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,918
Scott: I know you don't but I think I'm sorry.

733
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:42,170
Rym: episode six is the heist movie episode five is an American Western.

734
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:48,928
Scott: Anyway, the point is every time I watch live-action American television of recent times and even actually older times too, right?

735
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:55,394
Scott: There's sort of this feeling of like cheapness to it And I can't describe.

736
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:57,100
Scott: that makes me not care.

737
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,945
Rym: that is never sufficiently explain this to me.

738
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,370
Rym: nor do I recognize this.

739
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:05,154
Scott: I lack the English language to describe What is going on?

740
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:13,014
Scott: But like, you know, if you watch a movie versus a TV show, there's like a clear difference in Something.

741
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:17,530
Rym: you just you're just like the people and more who like to miss because the graphics you just want.

742
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:24,070
Scott: Their movies old black and white movies that don't have this problem.

743
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,756
Scott: But you ever all the shitty resolution.

744
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:29,270
Rym: you have a problem with old black and white TV shows from that same era?

745
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,591
Scott: I Don't know.

746
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,554
Scott: I think you do.

747
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:35,199
Rym: I think you do.

748
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:42,628
Scott: it's just something about tell live-action television from the United States Especially recent of you United States television, right?

749
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,033
Scott: Which I thought I started.

750
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:49,510
Scott: I started getting this feeling around the time when like those HBO serials became like a big deal.

751
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,490
Scott: I think you're just got like sopranos times.

752
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,695
Rym: I think you're just old where it's like.

753
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:55,788
Rym: I started watching those shows and people are all hype over them didn't wash like Oz.

754
00:44:56,573 --> 00:45:01,015
Scott: I did watched a few episodes and I was like I mean, you don't like Star Trek.

755
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:02,620
Scott: You don't like mostly I never like Star Trek.

756
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Rym: Yeah.

757
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,663
Rym: I know that's terrible.

758
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:05,889
Rym: Yeah you not Star Trek.

759
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:14,169
Scott: There are terrible Star Treks Like honestly if you're gonna know but the Star Trek that everyone loves with Picard next generation.

760
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:17,560
Scott: now It has the same cheap feel that Mandalorian has.

761
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,510
Scott: that makes me not want to watch it and I don't see that at all.

762
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,290
Rym: But obviously the first two and a half seasons of TNG or garbage is don't watch him.

763
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:26,119
Scott: Well, I don't know which ones I've watched.

764
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,194
Rym: if you watch the phrase if there if there's this Beardless like shithead.

765
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:31,198
Rym: Here's the first officer.

766
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:31,900
Rym: It sucks.

767
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,469
Scott: Once the guy definitely watch sums that had Borg in them.

768
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:36,927
Scott: So, I don't know if that they were in the first season.

769
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:37,370
Rym: There's some.

770
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:41,827
Rym: There are not great board of Borg episodes and there are later great Borg episodes.

771
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:48,208
Scott: The point is Mandalorian right started getting after the first two episodes which didn't really have it.

772
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:58,870
Scott: Third fourth episode when I stopped watching started bringing in that feeling I get when I watch Live-action US television that I don't like and I just made me not want to watch anymore.

773
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,889
Rym: I think you're just a weird curmudgeon because I don't see it.

774
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:07,469
Rym: but there is a problem with the show that started in episode in the episode you didn't like and Then it doesn't happen for a while.

775
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:13,190
Rym: But it does happen two more times in the show and what it is is circular dialogue.

776
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:26,030
Rym: You know and the way I'll describe this, you know We're playing a burning wheel game and we us like two of us playing characters and like two NPCs Argue in a circle and Basically just keep saying the same things quick slightly.

777
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:32,750
Rym: So over and over again But nothing gets resolved and eventually the game master is like listen fuckers and hence this dice and makes us roll to resolve it.

778
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:44,367
Rym: Mm-hmm the dialogue moves in a circle with characters basically just debating the same point repeatedly without moving anything forward multiple times before resolving it.

779
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:53,883
Rym: and That happens in the episode that you didn't like where basically there's a bunch of characters talking And the camera basically goes from face to face to face to face.

780
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,170
Scott: Oh, yeah, those are the words.

781
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,063
Scott: Those are like the most those you seen.

782
00:46:57,123 --> 00:47:07,296
Rym: those can be great Except when they go to a face that basically just says the same fucking thing again And does not that dialogue serves no actual purpose Like it's almost like they're just padding out the scene.

783
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:14,499
Rym: the game master meaning the director or the editor or someone should have just been like Yeah, let's just have the duel of wits guys.

784
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,121
Rym: Come on.

785
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:17,490
Rym: It also gives that in the last episode.

786
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:19,466
Rym: There's like a really a second to last episode.

787
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:22,149
Rym: last episode There's like a big like really important scene.

788
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:23,850
Rym: It's egregious.

789
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:35,009
Rym: there's a scene where the characters are debating whether or not to leave a certain character behind for plot reasons and they literally just Have the same conversation about this for like six minutes.

790
00:47:36,091 --> 00:47:37,056
Rym: Nothing gets revealed.

791
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,182
Rym: No plot changes.

792
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:39,910
Rym: No characters change nothing.

793
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,445
Rym: It like an editor should have just cut that entire scene out and it would have showed a loss.

794
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:44,887
Rym: nothing.

795
00:47:45,288 --> 00:47:49,585
Rym: and I think Circular dialogue is one thing.

796
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:50,550
Rym: It's not the only thing.

797
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:54,168
Rym: It's one thing that I think you bristle at even if you don't recognize it's happening.

798
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:57,570
Scott: maybe The other thing is that really?

799
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:00,577
Scott: That really like reminded me of like.

800
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:02,785
Scott: I was getting flashbacks while I was watching the show.

801
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:03,428
Scott: Yeah, isn't?

802
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,528
Scott: I was a kid I actually liked.

803
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:07,375
Scott: It was so.

804
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:12,282
Scott: I liked him in the way that I like T man where once I learned better I realized like oh, why did I like that?

805
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,970
Scott: That stuff is garbage, right?

806
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:20,050
Scott: I liked a lot of these cheap adventure shows that were a thing for a while, right like young Indiana Jones?

807
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:21,409
Scott: No, no, like that's a good.

808
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:25,237
Rym: I remember that show being good.

809
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,108
Rym: I have not seen even one second of footage from it in my adult life.

810
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:28,590
Scott: I agree.

811
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:32,566
Rym: Now shake that tree same cuz snakes are gonna buy out.

812
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:36,819
Scott: the shows I'm talking about are the xena warrior princess princess.

813
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,421
Rym: I never liked.

814
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:40,530
Scott: you know, there was a Conan one Buffy.

815
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:41,415
Scott: I didn't.

816
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:42,120
Scott: I didn't watch Buffy.

817
00:48:42,482 --> 00:48:43,790
Rym: Buffy was not worth watching.

818
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,254
Scott: But there was a Briscoe County jr I did not like.

819
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:51,303
Rym: Briscoe County was always on when I was waiting to watch something else.

820
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:53,850
Scott: It was 99 lives of blackjack savage.

821
00:48:54,693 --> 00:48:55,757
Scott: There was a. there's no one.

822
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:56,761
Rym: that looked like a lot.

823
00:48:56,902 --> 00:48:58,849
Scott: It was a sin bad the sailor one.

824
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,100
Scott: But basically these shows were on and like bad time slots.

825
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:14,410
Scott: You could see the most often like weekend afternoons on Not the main broadcast channel, but like your local channel that was like it's showing syndicated shows.

826
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:24,188
Scott: So like in New York, it would have been like 11 right or something like that Like your local like Connecticut channel as opposed to like actually NBC or some shit like that.

827
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:28,830
Scott: And those shows right some of them, right?

828
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:34,352
Scott: We're just sort of that episodic adventure with bad acting kind of thing Right, sort of like.

829
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:41,008
Scott: those are basically a pure essence of the thing that I dislike right distilled and it's like 200 proof.

830
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:48,778
Rym: Now I will say I get zero of those vibes from the Mandalorian except in that one circular scene I talked about.

831
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:49,870
Rym: that was way too long.

832
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,739
Scott: And you also see for example Briscoe County jr.

833
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:58,141
Scott: And also blackjack savage as examples of I Don't know if you have much Briscoe County jr.

834
00:49:58,181 --> 00:49:59,348
Scott: Remember you said you didn't watch it.

835
00:49:59,972 --> 00:50:03,369
Rym: Well, I always saw like the last five minutes of it before the thing I wanted to.

836
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:12,304
Scott: okay Okay But basically it was sort of X files II in the way that there was this main Secret from space plot that they'd barely address.

837
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:13,390
Scott: that they barely address.

838
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,910
Scott: So in Briscoe in X files It was always like what's up with the smoking man and that yeah, they find the ship.

839
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,650
Rym: Ah, but that's that's the curse.

840
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:27,542
Rym: I wanted to know about all that stuff for so long in the X files and then as soon as they showed it to me It was stupid and then I didn't care anymore exactly.

841
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:31,760
Scott: but in Bristol County jr it was this ball this metal ball with like.

842
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:35,897
Scott: that looked sort of like a I Don't know like you would take rods out of it.

843
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:38,890
Scott: I guess they were trying to evoke a nuclear device of some kind.

844
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,398
Rym: That's just the fucking plot of the venture brothers.

845
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,365
Scott: Anyway, there's a ball.

846
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:44,047
Rym: There's the orb.

847
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:52,069
Scott: the orb Anyway, you can probably find pictures of it online And it would only show up occasionally and most episodes weren't about it.

848
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:56,350
Scott: And when it was about it, it would sort of like oh dang it got away again.

849
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,160
Rym: Okay, that orb looks way different from what I expected.

850
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,829
Scott: yes, that's the thing that's like the main plot orb.

851
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,438
Scott: That's the main plot of the show.

852
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:04,444
Scott: Is that McGuffin?

853
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:05,469
Rym: Did they ever explain what it is?

854
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:12,944
Scott: I don't remember gonna find out what in the 90s Anyway, but in that same way the Mandalorian has this core plot of.

855
00:51:12,964 --> 00:51:15,010
Scott: what's the deal with the Mandalorians?

856
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,212
Scott: what's deal with this baby, right and When?

857
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:19,116
Scott: that you know?

858
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:20,401
Scott: starting episode 3 and 4.

859
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:22,650
Rym: never fucking explain it in at any point.

860
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:23,877
Scott: No, the show got canceled.

861
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:28,536
Rym: before then, uh, the orb gets destroyed Sure, and there are three orbs.

862
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,120
Scott: Okay one gets destroyed.

863
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,828
Rym: The other two are taken back to the future by someone.

864
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:40,810
Scott: Okay, sure I guess there's time travel, you know, they make that terrible secret of space thin right while these other things happen, right?

865
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:46,310
Scott: According to Rym they unfin it, but I didn't see that far because I got bored and had better things to do.

866
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:54,159
Rym: Yeah I did not see any thinning in the Mandalorian because it sort of gets thicker as it goes on As soon as this motherfucker shows up.

867
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,888
Scott: I did not see that motherfucker that guy.

868
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,359
Rym: so Werner Herzog is pretty fun.

869
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,408
Rym: Like the role he plays this guy Is his boss?

870
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:08,250
Rym: Okay, and he basically show rolls into town like in the second half of the show and he's like the fuck is going on.

871
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:09,192
Rym: Did you fuck this up?

872
00:52:09,513 --> 00:52:10,115
Rym: Seriously?

873
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:10,957
Rym: Fuck you.

874
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:11,378
Rym: Mm-hmm.

875
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:12,982
Rym: He's great.

876
00:52:13,303 --> 00:52:14,305
Rym: It's Moff Gideon.

877
00:52:14,325 --> 00:52:14,807
Rym: He's a moth.

878
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,695
Scott: Oh It's a Star Wars.

879
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,765
Rym: Yeah, it was some fanservice but Moff Gideon is I think my.

880
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:24,470
Scott: that's only fanservice to nerds like us.

881
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:24,814
Scott: You know what?

882
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:25,482
Scott: I'm office.

883
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:31,750
Rym: Yep He's an Imperial remnant commander and he is my favorite character in the Mandalorian.

884
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,636
Rym: He doesn't even show up till episode 7.

885
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:34,700
Rym: He literally just shows up.

886
00:52:35,162 --> 00:52:37,289
Rym: He comes down and he's like, what the fuck?

887
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,032
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

888
00:52:38,052 --> 00:52:38,656
Rym: He's got with him.

889
00:52:38,676 --> 00:52:39,138
Rym: Mm-hmm.

890
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,729
Rym: He's got some stormtroopers wearing black Fancy and they're actually good shots.

891
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:45,336
Scott: Yeah, they either.

892
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,722
Scott: those are the ones it's like a red guy.

893
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:47,405
Scott: that's our gun.

894
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:54,350
Rym: when we were kids both Was the coolest character in Star Wars knows the kid number two Episode when I saw those red stormtroopers.

895
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:59,210
Scott: Oh, yeah The way most people feel about Boba Fett is the way I felt about red storm as soon as I sold it.

896
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:04,770
Rym: I remember I was like my uncle was the nerdiest person in my family and I was like what's up with those red stormtroopers?

897
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,292
Scott: No one knows.

898
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:07,303
Rym: he didn't know so he made up a bunch of shit.

899
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:08,932
Rym: Okay, and it took me Way to go.

900
00:53:08,972 --> 00:53:09,838
Rym: uncle he's awesome uncle.

901
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:16,044
Scott: That's the difference between a boomer uncle and a millennial uncle.

902
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:17,770
Scott: boomer uncle will make up a bunch of bullshit.

903
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:18,413
Scott: Yeah, right.

904
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:22,270
Scott: Whereas a millennial uncle will actually tell you the truth because they googled a fuck ton about it.

905
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,970
Scott: Yeah, and they'll go on and on and on telling you everything there is to know about those red guys for real.

906
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:30,026
Rym: I wanted to know the deal with those red guys so bad as a kid.

907
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:36,810
Rym: Yep, but Yeah, that the month showing up is pretty great and it's only four more episodes.

908
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,500
Rym: He shows up in episode seven if you want to see what his deal is.

909
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,970
Rym: Yeah, but there's already gonna be a season two.

910
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:44,419
Rym: I think we're season one ended without spoiling.

911
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:47,049
Rym: It is gonna set up a pretty good season two.

912
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,578
Scott: I wish they would make a Star Wars show.

913
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:52,929
Scott: It's about space pilot and not about you know.

914
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:53,950
Rym: Well, you know what?

915
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:54,492
Rym: I'd like to see.

916
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:56,117
Scott: I'd like to see as part of.

917
00:53:56,157 --> 00:54:03,757
Scott: it does feel like the people who are making this are sort of just like Sort of like just sort of like.

918
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:04,280
Scott: it's there.

919
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,364
Scott: it's like there.

920
00:54:05,926 --> 00:54:06,830
Scott: what's the word for it?

921
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:08,355
Scott: Like their pet project like.

922
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,567
Scott: no, we really want to make, you know an homage to Kurosawa.

923
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:12,450
Scott: All right, let's just do it.

924
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,153
Scott: Let's have like.

925
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:16,910
Scott: they're having the fun making what they want to make as filmmakers.

926
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,566
Scott: So find someone who really wants to make regardless of what Scott wants to see.

927
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:22,629
Rym: so, you know what I want to see.

928
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,064
Rym: now I'd like to see in with the same level of care that Mandalorian is getting.

929
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:29,949
Rym: I want to see one a show That's about like one fucking TIE fighter pilot.

930
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:35,249
Rym: I'd like to see one that is Our boy out in the Outer Rym.

931
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,455
Rym: Okay, Vice Admiral Thrawn.

932
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:38,639
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna see that.

933
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,623
Rym: I know someday.

934
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,345
Rym: I think it'll happen.

935
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:41,670
Rym: I'd like to see a Thrawn.

936
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:43,970
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what else I really want to see.

937
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,276
Rym: hmm What do you want?

938
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:47,861
Rym: What do you want?

939
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,090
Rym: That would be Mandalorian adjacent?

940
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,590
Rym: Like the most fan service things Star Wars could give you personally me personally.

941
00:54:53,632 --> 00:55:01,863
Rym: Yeah Like if you got to direct what the what the pet project would have been for the people who ended up making the Mandalorian Vixen wedge like their whole lives.

942
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:02,909
Scott: No, I would do.

943
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:07,581
Scott: It would still be space battles because you gotta have space battle.

944
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,008
Scott: Yeah, right, but we'd be focusing on.

945
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:14,070
Scott: you know What's going on on one ship the way not in the way Star Trek though?

946
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:21,710
Scott: Like Gundam seed made the way Gundam does but the main character right would not be a lame.

947
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:25,563
Scott: Oh, you know blank Gundam character, right?

948
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,650
Rym: Yeah, like one of the Battlestar Galactica pilots.

949
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:34,038
Scott: No, no, no the really the main character has to be one of those droids that has too much character That would normally be.

950
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:37,513
Scott: is that would normally be a side character Killed quickly.

951
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,981
Scott: Yeah, right like the one in.

952
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:44,236
Scott: well the one in Mandalorian or the one in What's it called?

953
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:45,709
Rym: All I'm gonna say is that droid comes back.

954
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:47,192
Scott: I'm sure it does.

955
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:52,888
Rym: also that droid the one you're talking about gives me mad return to Oz creepy voice.

956
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:56,013
Scott: What's the Rogue?

957
00:55:56,093 --> 00:55:58,223
Scott: rogue, whatever the droid in that one also a cool.

958
00:55:58,384 --> 00:55:59,630
Rym: Oh, yeah, that guy like that droid a lot.

959
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,657
Scott: Yeah, just take me a cool droid like that.

960
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:02,941
Scott: That's the main character.

961
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,570
Scott: make a Gundam setup where you're focusing on one ship.

962
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,928
Rym: Yeah, like one Mon Calamari cruiser, right?

963
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,930
Scott: Exactly right with a bunch of fighters right that I'll see the equivalent of the Gundams rise.

964
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,835
Scott: You have this whole cast.

965
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,780
Scott: that's on the one ship.

966
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:22,016
Scott: It's like a Gundam not like a Star Trek Yeah, and but the main character has to be an awesome Hilarious character with a lot.

967
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:24,948
Scott: Yeah, I like it and a droid and not some lame.

968
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:27,510
Rym: Oh Well, you need three parts.

969
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:32,430
Rym: You need the the ensemble cast of people to do the cuts to the faces when there's a space battle, correct?

970
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,018
Rym: You need the character you described.

971
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,370
Rym: is the real main character to like pull everything together?

972
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,840
Scott: You need the evil Empire character in a mask.

973
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,142
Scott: Yep.

974
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,895
Rym: And then you need the Probably a Jedi.

975
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:46,390
Scott: Oh, yeah, everyone need these new types are Jedi's obviously, of course.

976
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:51,289
Rym: But then in the background of the ship you need the irresponsible captain Tyler.

977
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:57,050
Rym: You're under arrest slash pat labore cast of idiots and side characters.

978
00:56:57,191 --> 00:57:09,423
Scott: Oh, yeah, we're just always in the background capering and fucking things up and getting drunk and causing trouble Yep, and then they need to be on a journey a slow journey from point a to point B Like they are in a Gundam or macross or whatever.

979
00:57:09,745 --> 00:57:17,250
Scott: We're like, okay We're leaving this planet and we have you know, the problem is they have warp drive and in Star Wars that fucks that all up.

980
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:21,030
Scott: Yeah, the other thing you could do in Star Wars that would totally work.

981
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,094
Scott: But actually I don't want it.

982
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:25,748
Scott: cuz like I don't I don't need more of it is to do a Galaxy Express.

983
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:27,297
Scott: There's some sort of.

984
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:37,369
Scott: you're focusing on like, you know Couple mysterious people making a long journey and they basically go in hyperspace and then land on Star Wars planets and have moral Quandary.

985
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,870
Rym: Right on Tatooine right when it's about to have it's like workers.

986
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,070
Scott: They land on somewhere where the moral quandary and at the end of the episode they get back onto the space.

987
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,690
Scott: So here's the question and it warps them to the next place.

988
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:51,302
Rym: Are these two characters starting in the part of Star Wars?

989
00:57:51,362 --> 00:57:53,110
Rym: We know and going out to the Outer Rym?

990
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:56,110
Scott: So it doesn't even matter just give more moral quandary.

991
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:02,030
Rym: Are they out in the Outer Rym trying to come in to like meet Yoda not knowing that Yoda's dead?

992
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:02,914
Rym: Everything's been destroyed?

993
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:05,606
Rym: doesn't matter spoilers Yoda dies guys.

994
00:58:05,948 --> 00:58:07,777
Rym: Oh, no Yeah, also spoilers.

995
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:08,801
Rym: We haven't seen the Mandalorian.

996
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:12,076
Rym: That's not literally Yoda It's just the race that Yoda is.

997
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:15,030
Rym: yeah, like obviously because it takes place after Episode six.

998
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:20,929
Rym: Yeah, but what the other thing I really like about it and it comes out a lot more in the second half the show is You didn't see much of it yet.

999
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:23,840
Rym: The baby is really powerful obvious.

1000
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,362
Rym: I saw that it's obvious and really dangerous and Not necessarily actually good like it might not know.

1001
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:31,306
Scott: it was just born.

1002
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:31,969
Scott: What does it know?

1003
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,589
Rym: Yeah, but it might not be okay for this baby to go where it's supposed to go in the end.

1004
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:37,395
Scott: Well, you can't?

1005
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:38,543
Scott: you don't know anything right?

1006
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:39,127
Scott: You know, you'll.

1007
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:42,120
Rym: Season one tells you a lot more.

1008
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,743
Scott: You don't know any.

1009
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:44,230
Scott: we don't know anything about Yoda's race.

1010
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:46,260
Scott: We don't know anything about right.

1011
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,003
Scott: We just know all right.

1012
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:53,387
Scott: It's a baby of Yoda's race Yeah, and it has mad strong with the force and does it even have parents?

1013
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:54,210
Scott: What does it think?

1014
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,093
Scott: What is it right?

1015
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:55,797
Scott: Does it candidate?

1016
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:58,030
Scott: it must have ideas is like I don't you know.

1017
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:04,430
Scott: The end of season one actually kind of explains what you can't really communicate in a way that the audience can understand.

1018
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:09,003
Rym: Yeah, I think the baby of a real interesting in season two.

1019
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:11,530
Rym: Mmm, and I will watch season two when it comes out.

1020
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:14,260
Scott: I like you know if they follow the lone wolf and cub trend.

1021
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:16,730
Scott: right you think lone wolf and cub is this dude?

1022
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,424
Scott: I've read most of it.

1023
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:21,950
Scott: Yeah It's just episodic samurai stories, right?

1024
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,029
Scott: But it's like yeah, the kid is actually isn't just like this.

1025
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:35,970
Scott: You know baby in a carriage that he has to protect and keep it from getting killed like the kid You know at points fucking cuts people Oh kid goes out and does things even though it doesn't really talk a lot.

1026
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:41,590
Scott: Right, like the kid is actually like, you know a real deal that happens more and more in the second.

1027
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,857
Scott: It's like imagine imagine like a bear cub.

1028
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:49,924
Scott: that's like, you know, not just born but like been around a little bit But it's still a cub like, you know, I can hear that.

1029
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:50,809
Scott: is she gonna fuck you up?

1030
00:59:51,472 --> 00:59:52,196
Scott: It's not a bear.

1031
00:59:52,216 --> 01:00:02,380
Scott: it won't like maul you but it you don't want to go near it Right, and that's basically what the deal is, but I mean in the end like I really like Mandalorian I will watch season two as soon as it comes out.

1032
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,949
Scott: Mmm, and Yeah, it's a pretty good show.

1033
01:00:06,151 --> 01:00:13,530
Rym: I do I enjoyed it more viscerally than I enjoyed the newer Star Wars movies But I don't think that I'm saying I did not like the new Star Wars movies.

1034
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:20,510
Rym: I think it's mostly that the Mandalorian is set closer to like the aesthetic of the first trilogy, which I like the most.

1035
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:20,711
Rym: I

1036
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:30,252
Scott: think the new movies at their best moments I liked a zillion times more than Mandalorian, but at their man moments, I'd liked less than Yeah,

1037
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:36,418
Rym: I can I can feel that like for that one of the movies like that casino thing was just real bad And that you should not been in the movie.

1038
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:37,586
Rym: and I would like that movie a lot more.

1039
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,930
Scott: Mmm part even in the casino part which was mostly man.

1040
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:43,598
Rym: It had it had a few moments.

1041
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:48,562
Scott: a few moments of the casino thing were not me Yeah, but 90% of the casino part was met.

1042
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:49,948
Rym: Yep, but there were some not met moments.

1043
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:56,248
Scott: I will give you that Yeah, Mandalorian better than casino not as good as space battle where they crash one ship in another ship.

1044
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:58,016
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but you know what?

1045
01:00:58,036 --> 01:00:58,479
Rym: That's like.

1046
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:00,328
