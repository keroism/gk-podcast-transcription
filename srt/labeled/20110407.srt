00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:18,470
Rym: It's Thursday April 7th 2011 I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight MichioKaku's hyperspace on the GeekNights book club.

2
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,023
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:35,509
Rym: It was kind of amazing at work that and I'm sitting there do working on some code or something and suddenly Suddenly I noticed that that didn't really matter.

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,257
Rym: the market dropped like point six percent.

5
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:39,300
Scott: Is that a lot?

6
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:41,567
Scott: The whole market almost 1%.

7
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,830
Scott: yeah, there's one almost at six.

8
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:57,320
Rym: So basically think about this the market dips six Suddenly and I see all these alarms like ah, and I wonder alright what happened?

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,730
Rym: I have CNBC and everything on and all the news feeds and there's nothing.

10
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,836
Rym: I go to FARC and there's nothing.

11
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:13,700
Rym: I go to Twitter And I just start to see a couple of tweets Coming in about aftershock and then minutes later the news is like oh shit and aftershock hit Japan.

12
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,460
Rym: Everything's mostly okay, you know and all the news after that.

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,689
Rym: But the fact that the market reacted before I think any human on the at least in the United States Knew that there was an aftershock was amazing.

14
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,295
Scott: Well, this is something I wonder about right?

15
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,319
Scott: It's like where did that?

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,214
Scott: movement come from right.

17
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:38,233
Scott: so I We know that there are people out there who have trading systems hooked up to news feeds But they wouldn't be able to react for minutes.

18
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,307
Rym: also little-known fact you think you know there are different ways to do news feeds.

19
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:48,358
Rym: one way is to just consume a feed of like text news and Do some sort of you know algorithm to parse out words or whatever.

20
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,739
Scott: Yes There could have been someone on the AP wire which may have been fast But most could have been a human doing it.

21
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,869
Rym: But most people respond.

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,263
Rym: the news feeds that you hear about are actually Scores.

23
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:03,540
Rym: someone else does all the work for you with proprietary whatevers and they send you a score.

24
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,280
Rym: That's like good or bad for this sector or this stuff, right?

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,937
Scott: But that person is analyzing the same internet news that we're analyzing.

26
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,256
Rym: Yes So my guess as to what happened and obviously I'm not speaking to any particular stock.

27
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:18,760
Rym: Nor am I giving investment advice?

28
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:20,128
Scott: Is that?

29
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,098
Scott: let me call the SEC?

30
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,387
Scott: I'll see what they think about.

31
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,259
Rym: is that because it happened in Japan, right?

32
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:31,980
Rym: So there were reactions in the financial sector in Japan which triggered things in the u.s Almost immediately.

33
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:36,200
Scott: So the Japanese people clicked on, you know manually trade.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,903
Scott: Oh, no Because the market was open and then those movements were automatically detected by computer systems in the u.s That automatically trade.

35
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:51,487
Rym: my other guess is that or Japanese people traded on the American exchanges now There's a latency back to the u.s.

36
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:52,209
Rym: And then to Japan.

37
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,112
Rym: again is pretty high.

38
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,496
Rym: the market react, but it's not.

39
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:55,760
Scott: it's not minutes.

40
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,400
Rym: No, it's not minutes, but it was just kind of amazing.

41
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:04,360
Rym: Remember when people were pointing out that the tweets are far faster than actual earthquakes.

42
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,411
Scott: Yeah, so here's it.

43
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,020
Scott: This gave me an idea actually.

44
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:18,800
Scott: So these people are trading based on news right from the news, you know And they're trying to parse things that journalists have written or the AP is written in English to make trades.

45
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,310
Rym: Well, most people are parsing more complex data feeds.

46
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,420
Rym: that score the news based, right?

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Scott: But it's based on looking at news written in English, which is then turned into a score.

48
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:30,926
Rym: Oh, yes to a degree though.

49
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:38,050
Rym: I just want to qualify that some of that news is actually Formatted in kind of reliable ways like it's normalized data.

50
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,179
Rym: Like I don't know corporate actions that happen.

51
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,045
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah, I'm sure.

52
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,559
Scott: so here's an idea I had.

53
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,020
Scott: What if we put sensors all over the world of different varieties, for example detected disaster in cell, right?

54
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,464
Scott: We have a size a seismograph in Japan and if we can program it to put it connected to a computer Or it is a computer.

55
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:06,373
Scott: if the earth if there's too much earthquake in this area cell You could be way faster than the guy parsing the news and we would get out.

56
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,338
Rym: There's no guy parsing the news.

57
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,200
Rym: It's algos.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,558
Scott: I'm just saying is it would be faster than the news algorithm because those few seconds where someone types in that news story We're beating them.

59
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,944
Rym: Well, the news I'll see.

60
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:23,640
Rym: the way to use a news feed like that is more to prime other decision-making systems.

61
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,890
Scott: It doesn't matter we can make money because it'd be faster.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,220
Scott: You're saying milliseconds usually count this work.

63
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,398
Scott: This is on the order of seconds.

64
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,523
Rym: So here's the trouble.

65
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,091
Rym: you can't guarantee that the market will drop or not.

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,880
Rym: a similar earthquake in a different place in a different time Wouldn't have had this reaction and the market recovered almost all the way.

67
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,760
Scott: Well, this is why you have to have you know, it's not just a simple decision hooked up to the data.

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,600
Scott: It's you have the algo hooked up to this raw data of and not just a site one seismograph in Japan, right?

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,267
Scott: I'm talking about get all kinds of data.

70
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,556
Scott: hook it up to weather stations around the world.

71
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:56,243
Rym: I can guarantee Seismographs.

72
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:08,275
Rym: I can guarantee taking photos in Scott Scott I can guarantee to you that there are small outfits out there that are looking at the goddamn weather and trying to see how it Correlates to stocks, but I'm saying not just whether right.

73
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,320
Scott: that's just one example.

74
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:18,000
Scott: Everything they're looking at anything they can get sudden the checks like radio active radio wave activity, you know and stuff like that.

75
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:26,681
Scott: Yeah, if there's any Possible link so increase we can detects increased cell phone and Wi-Fi activity in localized areas We got.

76
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,874
Rym: if there's any possible link to anything people are doing it.

77
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:35,765
Scott: I don't know I haven't heard about anyone doing these sorts of things Anything about how it even works.

78
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:43,208
Scott: we can hook it sign up to you know, detecting tides and ocean movements and Yeah, you could yeah.

79
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,245
Rym: Yeah Okay, you got any news?

80
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:46,807
Rym: It's Thursday.

81
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:47,971
Rym: We can talk about whatever we want.

82
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:55,060
Scott: You know, we often give Government a hard time because you know, it doesn't usually do stuff that makes us happy.

83
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,665
Scott: Yeah, especially when it's making laws We usually does a bad job.

84
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:04,655
Rym: the worst thing is we're getting to getting better pretty much constantly except The years and Bush was in office.

85
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:12,438
Rym: Oh But it's getting better just because we're smarter and we have more access to information than previous generations.

86
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,891
Rym: as a whole We're very aware of the glacial pace of change.

87
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:23,932
Scott: But anyway, I just wanted to you know Highlight a good law and what I consider to be a good law.

88
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:24,915
Rym: a good law.

89
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:25,637
Scott: You might disagree.

90
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:26,820
Scott: It's a new good law.

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,905
Scott: It's a New York law.

92
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:31,140
Scott: It's just a few weeks old right, but it's really good.

93
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:42,393
Scott: so basically there was this problem and the problem was is that you know, the vast majority of Crimes and especially assaults and batteries and those sorts of things are domestic disturbances.

94
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,498
Rym: Yep closed-door versus open-door crimes.

95
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:59,540
Scott: Yes now The fact is I wasn't aware of this problem right that a lot of people when they get mad You know instead of punching and kicking or beating with a frying pan or whatever They do some strangling activity and maybe they don't strangle someone to death.

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,269
Scott: But you know, they give someone a nice choke, right?

97
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:03,734
Scott: Yeah, and what happened?

98
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:04,115
Rym: I mean, what?

99
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,680
Rym: what's the phrase choke a motherfucker?

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,402
Rym: That's right.

101
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,045
Rym: Choke a bitch.

102
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:19,468
Scott: Apparently what was happening for a very long time Is that when you choke somebody there wasn't a whole lot of evidence because by the time anyone gets there You're done gasping for air, right?

103
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,214
Scott: You didn't really leave any bruises.

104
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:29,387
Scott: Yeah, cuz if you choked him enough to bruise him There's probably enough permanent injury, you know, and you know, there might have been red marks around your neck But they fade.

105
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,992
Rym: so Scott.

106
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,480
Rym: I just want to point out We're gonna have to have a second follow-up law now or follow-up forensic evidence.

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,474
Rym: We need a way to handle the sack full of doorknobs problem.

108
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:50,520
Scott: I know but anyway anyway The point is is that a lot of people who strangled somebody We're getting away with it or getting very reduced sentences because of the lack of evidence of the lack of quality evidence.

109
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,667
Scott: There is a new law in New York.

110
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:53,890
Scott: It's just a few weeks old.

111
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,856
Scott: That's basically like it's an.

112
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,060
Scott: it's a strangling law.

113
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:00,434
Scott: It's like strangling is illegal and this is what you do if there's a strangling.

114
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,137
Scott: All right.

115
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,266
Scott: All right, and So far how many people?

116
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,075
Scott: how many times do you think they have used the strangling law?

117
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,600
Scott: in just a few weeks now?

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,267
Scott: You won't even a month.

119
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,175
Scott: How many times do you think this law has been used?

120
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,200
Rym: to quote Futurama?

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,876
Rym: You wouldn't ask unless it was either really high or really low.

122
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:22,054
Scott: I'm gonna say So far in just less than a month, right?

123
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:26,064
Scott: They have arrested Two Thousand people.

124
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:30,500
Scott: how many bitches need choking first strangling with this new law?

125
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,720
Scott: So there you go a quality new law that seems to be working.

126
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:41,068
Scott: Government did a good thing for once in How do you know?

127
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,659
Rym: they're not arresting people who didn't actually strangle?

128
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,540
Scott: There's actually some interesting things in this law about like if there was a strangling then you got it.

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,034
Scott: Then that means that you have to investigate DNA evidence Which previously they would not investigate in such a case and such and such.

130
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,559
Scott: so there's actually here.

131
00:08:58,964 --> 00:08:59,433
Scott: Here's what it is.

132
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:06,720
Scott: The new law recognized the serious in the offense and has teeth sharp enough to keep a convicted offender behind bars or under scrutiny.

133
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:13,020
Scott: Under the new strangulation law anyone convicted of either felony or misdemeanor counts must submit a DNA sample to authorities.

134
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:14,746
Scott: So yeah, yada yada.

135
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,760
Scott: So basically if you're if there's a strangling involved, right?

136
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:28,720
Scott: There's gonna be a whole bunch more Evidence right to actually make sure that that the you know It sticks as opposed to getting away with it because there wasn't any bruising or whatever.

137
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:38,307
Scott: Yeah, well the and since most of these strangling people are people who've had run-ins with the law previously They've got DNA on them so they can look at the person's neck and say yeah This dude is strangled.

138
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,259
Scott: and then what are you gonna do about it?

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,242
Rym: What now?

140
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,388
Rym: the next step of course is what do we do about this?

141
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:56,828
Rym: because all domestic violence and you know crimes of passion like that in general are Usually driven by poor impulse control which is correlated with all sorts of things ranging from bad Nutrition to bad upbringing.

142
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,410
Scott: it says here.

143
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,612
Scott: domestic abusers aren't usually first-time offenders And we're expecting to see that as people get convicted of these offenses.

144
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,640
Scott: It will lead to solving other crimes.

145
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,207
Scott: Ah, but what you find?

146
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:10,140
Scott: a guy who's strangling somebody he's probably done something else.

147
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,729
Scott: You found him and you look and you say oh, yeah This is the guy who did the whatever.

148
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,170
Rym: so you find a guy who's guilty of I don't know some computer a crime.

149
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,640
Rym: Oh, he might be doing weed.

150
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,967
Rym: maybe That's a bad path.

151
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,678
Scott: That is well, but you know, but that's just.

152
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,192
Scott: you know There's nothing you can do about that as long as the weeds illegal.

153
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:30,758
Scott: There's a separate issue from the strangling Yeah, and plus, you know now the Boston Strangler will get him.

154
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,579
Rym: Yeah, because he totally wouldn't have done it.

155
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:48,944
Scott: I know he was getting away with it all those years But now finally it you know, the glacial pace of government after how many centuries we finally made it illegal to strangle Luckily just hit the Boston Strang just in time for the government to shut itself down Whatever.

156
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,060
Scott: It's the New York government at the federal government.

157
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,110
Rym: Well, you know, it's kind of this thing where?

158
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,398
Rym: because we argue I the thing is we were just arguing in the forum about the problem.

159
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:56,619
Rym: where?

160
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,780
Rym: Laws are often passed with a supposed deterrent effect, even though the punishments are shown to not actually deter.

161
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:12,640
Rym: But in a case like this where there's clear evidence of recidivism and linked crimes It seems like this is a case where it will be a deterrent.

162
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,163
Scott: Well, this is.

163
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:15,175
Scott: this is basically a case of law.

164
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,080
Scott: was no good, right?

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,396
Scott: It's we had laws against a certain thing, but there was a loophole.

166
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,160
Scott: you can get away with it If you strangled instead of punching someone in the face, so people were strangling.

167
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,120
Scott: So now you can't get away with it just cuz you're strangling now.

168
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:26,904
Rym: That's perfect.

169
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,693
Rym: That does imply a secondary thing.

170
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:42,620
Rym: if this is true it implies that there is a significant number of people or are who Wanted to punch someone and then had they had that moment of restraint where they thought oh shit I might get caught if I punch them.

171
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,959
Scott: I think it was more than they happen to strangle and then they happen to get away with it because they did.

172
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:54,593
Rym: or Maybe strength is choking a bitch Requires far more dedication to your choking cause.

173
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,340
Rym: I mean if you want, but they weren't choking him to death.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,310
Scott: You're not gonna get away with that.

175
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,280
Rym: Oh, yeah, but even a little bit.

176
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,577
Rym: I mean I punch someone like say I get mad I go BAM and I punch someone.

177
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:12,820
Rym: All right Maybe I'm not mad three seconds later, but it only took me a half a second to punch But to start to even reach out and start strangling by the time you're proper choking.

178
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:25,245
Rym: It's been some seconds And if you want to maintain that joke for any reasonable amount of time, you gotta really want it because they're gonna fight back Unless you're just way bigger than Fighting back.

179
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,430
Rym: So you had a good law.

180
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,300
Rym: Let's talk about a bad law.

181
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:37,003
Rym: I learned recently that kuya hoga which is the name of the guy who accidentally caused dude, bro My shit is fucked up.

182
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,569
Scott: It's his internet name is cool.

183
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,389
Rym: So I got to shoot slash slice you it's straight-up dog - no It's dude, bro.

184
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:44,597
Scott: My shit is fucked up.

185
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,298
Rym: So I got It's straight.

186
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:52,375
Rym: Well kuya hoga is also the name of a town kuya hoga Falls.

187
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,380
Scott: I've heard of this town.

188
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:54,146
Rym: I've heard of it.

189
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,391
Scott: now that I think about that I knew if you said what's kuya hoga Falls.

190
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,660
Scott: I would have said a town in the Midwest.

191
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,907
Rym: Yeah, but before we're like yeah, and this guy?

192
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,309
Scott: where is it?

193
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,613
Scott: in the Midwest, Ohio?

194
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,676
Scott: Oh, it makes sense.

195
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:10,187
Rym: Yeah, kuya hoga kuya hoga Falls has a Really white mare.

196
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:30,220
Rym: No, and this really white mare is afraid of those goth kids with their piercings and those gangbangers hanging out on the riverfront Intimidating everybody else and these dangerous kids listening to their quote hippity-hop music hanging out under bridges.

197
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:39,940
Scott: So the old people voted for an old guy And the old guy got nowhere to hang out in town except for the old cool bridges down by the boardwalk.

198
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,800
Rym: So this story is great because the what he's done.

199
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:47,440
Scott: Why does he make a park for the kids to hang out and so they don't hang out in the riverfront because they got nowhere?

200
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,119
Rym: Oh, so maybe they were.

201
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:59,861
Rym: But his town much like my town when I was a kid after I moved out of Detroit He has passed or proposed to pass a curfew for anyone under 18.

202
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,928
Scott: The other under 18, that's the law we can do.

203
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,657
Rym: Yeah, unless maybe we signed the Human Rights Accord.

204
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,340
Scott: Yeah, right.

205
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:12,480
Rym: So I have many things to say about this article and it's just funny that it happened to take place in kuya hoga Falls.

206
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:16,741
Scott: Of course, I greatly disagree with this idea of a curfew, but they're under 18.

207
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:21,220
Scott: That's law and you know, I want to change that law a great deal, but nothing I could do.

208
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:21,903
Rym: No, but I still did.

209
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:27,511
Rym: you can disagree with the law independent of the realities of voting But here's my reality.

210
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:28,760
Rym: is the Constitution point the one?

211
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,224
Scott: Alright, maybe

212
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:48,985
Rym: if this guy just had a generic statement and a generic law like we're gonna have a curfew because of rising crime Rising youth related crime something like that The fact that he earnestly is afraid of people with piercings and goth style clothing and spiky hair and Hanging out under bridges.

213
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:52,580
Rym: It's like he's afraid of the opening montage from the Lost Boys.

214
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,430
Rym: Now I recently watched the Lost Boys again.

215
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,540
Rym: You know what it really holds up as a vampire movie.

216
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,025
Rym: It's got Corey Haim Corey Feldman Kiefer Sutherland like.

217
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:05,173
Rym: it's a great movie about vampires.

218
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:10,788
Rym: before vampires were cool 80s movie and It's set in the 80s, right?

219
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,417
Rym: But you know a lot of movies that are made in the 80s.

220
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,267
Rym: They're not set in the 80s.

221
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,077
Rym: They're just made in the 80s.

222
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,878
Scott: So they lose all this 80s stuff, even though they weren't trying to set it in the 80s.

223
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:30,033
Scott: Yeah, like they have that crappy synthy music and the montage Especially if it's try if they try to set it in the future, but they made it in the 80s There'll be stuff like key tars and shit like that.

224
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:34,755
Scott: It'll look like You know, what's the name of the the teacher in ponies?

225
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:46,173
Rym: Oh, Charlie yeah, I look like, you know Charlie's, uh, you know Charlie's high school that was more like early 90s Even so early to midnight that was that was that solos punky Brewster.

226
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,478
Scott: even so right?

227
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:47,980
Scott: It's like.

228
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,970
Scott: You know it looked that they made in the 80s.

229
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,638
Scott: the future looked like the future 80s.

230
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,478
Rym: But you know that like that like there's movies that happen to have been made in the 80s.

231
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,919
Rym: So they look like shit today.

232
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:06,305
Rym: But then there are movies that even if they were made in the 80s or not They were set in the 80s, but they didn't have the meta Constructs of the 80s.

233
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,674
Rym: like the music isn't shitty 80s synth.

234
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,139
Rym: It's just music from the 80s.

235
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,630
Rym: So the lost boys is like that.

236
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,040
Rym: It's a great movie.

237
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,665
Rym: You should watch it, but I digress.

238
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:23,251
Rym: the opening montage of lost boys shows all the scary Weirdos on the boardwalk while it plays the cover of the doors.

239
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,205
Rym: people are strange and it's just like yeah Look at that scary guy.

240
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,489
Rym: He's wearing all black.

241
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,660
Rym: Oh my god, that guy's got a mohawk and he's on a motorcycle.

242
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:44,233
Rym: Watch the fuck out And It seems like this guy from Ohio is afraid of that, but I see people like that every day Just like walking around in Midtown, and they're usually not scary at all.

243
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:54,939
Rym: in fact people who dress the way People were afraid of scary people in the 80s like the people that 80s people were afraid of in the 80s are the nerds.

244
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,492
Rym: today The guy with the mohawk is the gamer nerd.

245
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:00,219
Rym: more often than not that's true.

246
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,031
Scott: He's playing that dangerous Dungeons and Dragons, it's like this.

247
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:15,339
Rym: guy just came here out of 1981 and passed a curfew and I have more to say because I you know curfews suck and there was a curfew.

248
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:23,821
Rym: I ran away from the police at least every other night as a kid because of the fucking curfew and you know I just be out at night getting into trouble, but That's it.

249
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,347
Rym: I just kind of ran it for a while.

250
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:27,635
Rym: There's no news that I want to talk about yet.

251
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:37,370
Rym: Yeah, all right Because it's time for things of the day.

252
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,517
Rym: Got a thing of the day.

253
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:45,578
Scott: Yeah, so there is a little meme quick meme I guess it's on reddit or something.

254
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,205
Rym: This is pretty great right.

255
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,294
Scott: it says if you are religious Don't look at this.

256
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,868
Scott: if not enjoy, so it's a meme and every all it is.

257
00:17:52,531 --> 00:18:01,244
Scott: It's one of those you know head in the middle picture of someone's head in the middle of a square With sort of a starburst and some text on the top and the bottom and the impact font.

Scott: you know that and there's a lot.

259
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,609
Rym: I believe the what the kids used to call that is a macro right.

260
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,241

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,186
Scott: it might be a different God.

Scott: follow a rule.

Scott: that requires the understanding of right and wrong.

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,950
Rym: I Love that those sorts of things like the courage wolf or the courage bridge.

288
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:33,110
Rym: There's something about that style of meme of statement statement that has just never worn thin with me.

289
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,870
Scott: Yeah, this is this many six pages of this stuff, so there's plenty for you to read back.

290
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:45,189
Rym: There's only one meme of this style that I enjoy more than this particular one, and that is the haha guy haha.

291
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:51,073
Scott: So I'm making fun of God's Inconsistency.

292
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,922
Rym: my thing of the day here is just not.

293
00:19:54,002 --> 00:20:02,590
Rym: it's a complaint, but I can't really justify Complaining because I do not willing to step up and do something better.

294
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:18,876
Rym: but you know we're into the ponies as all men are and the only place you can really go to get your pony business is Either randomly searching YouTube which doesn't work Or going to equestria daily, which is 90% fanfiction.

295
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,069
Scott: You can just ignore the fanfiction.

296
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,612
Scott: you know that you can.

297
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:28,016
Scott: you can look at all the other sections Individually yeah, and not look at the fanfiction, but it's not really a filter.

298
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,060
Rym: It's more like a sin.

299
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,260
Rym: It's just every pony thing and not all of it.

300
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,609
Scott: Well is equestria daily not a crest here weekly?

301
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,400
Rym: so they need something yeah, but College humor is daily, and you know what?

302
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,149
Rym: Mostly gold or at least bronze.

303
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,640
Scott: well cuz they got a lot more stuff coming in the filters.

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,433
Scott: They could be more selective the pony stuff.

305
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:46,399
Scott: That's pretty much all of it.

306
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,001
Rym: Yeah But you've.

307
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:52,380
Rym: the way to make a successful internet filter is to you have the slider like the line of how much do you let?

308
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,148
Rym: Through you have to set it.

309
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,660
Scott: problem with the question is they've already let so much through.

310
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,422
Scott: It's like will you let?

311
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:04,748
Scott: if they if they start being filtering more harshly before you know the the source material Quantity increases well.

312
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,619
Rym: This is it will create drama.

313
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:15,996
Rym: This is why someone needs to make the Ponyville Street Journal That is the like erudite version that only posts and has no fanfiction whatsoever.

314
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:20,938
Rym: No fanfiction whatsoever Except comics which while technically fanfiction I?

315
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,962
Rym: Think you agree.

316
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:27,258
Rym: Yeah, they're fanfiction, but they're okay because they're short yeah, and they're drawn.

317
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:27,600
Rym: yeah.

318
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,612
Rym: There's a barrier to entry a higher barrier to entry.

319
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:35,858
Scott: so because there's a lot Still deny comics that weren't funny, or we're poorly drawn yep.

320
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:44,300
Rym: But because there is not a lot of great pony stuff and a lot of it's actually kind of hard to find My thing of the day is just a really awesome pony video notice.

321
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,715
Scott: I've been laying off the ponies entirely in the podcast since the let.

322
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:48,820
Scott: we actually had a pony episode.

323
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,052
Scott: We him cannot hold back.

324
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:50,859
Scott: He can't help himself.

325
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,534
Rym: Yeah, we were talking about ponies for a while before the episode.

326
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:54,956
Scott: I didn't.

327
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:55,960
Scott: I just said not in the show.

328
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,639
Scott: Yeah, not only restrained myself so much Oh my god.

329
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,076
Rym: So yeah ponies ponies.

330
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:16,786
Rym: And very briefly in the meta moment we will be this weekend at Saturday pretty much all day Or at least most of it at the mocha festival in New York starts at 11 a.m.. Yeah, whatever it starts We'll be there around that time.

331
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:20,640
Rym: Yeah, I plan to talk to pretty much everyone at every table.

332
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,200
Rym: Yep, yep, yep, yep, I thought no more ponies no more ponies accidental pony accidental pony.

333
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,945
Rym: You can't hold it in.

334
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:30,133
Scott: stop make it stop extending it.

335
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,200
Rym: wait a minute.

336
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:35,796
Rym: I just noticed that because I'm looking at our con schedule because I was about to announce that.

337
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:37,322
Rym: don't forget anime Boston.

338
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,899
Rym: April 22nd through 24th in Boston at the hiney.

339
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,174
Rym: We will be at anime Boston doing a shit ton of panels.

340
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,440
Scott: Are we really doing a shit ton?

341
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,238
Scott: I thought we're only doing like four really like four.

342
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:51,076
Rym: We've really cut down from our days of seven or eight panels at con.

343
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:51,820
Scott: forget those days.

344
00:22:54,584 --> 00:23:00,271
Rym: But I just noticed I think someone might have told us before and I forgot that There's a band playing Saturday night called stereo pony.

345
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:02,820
Scott: I don't think that band acts has anything to do with my little pony.

346
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,907
Rym: No, but it's nomen.

347
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,656
Scott: some people are planning a brony meetup at Otakon.

348
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,924
Rym: Oh We should.

349
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:15,100
Rym: uh we should be the ones who force the impromptu brony meetup at anime Boston.

350
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,748
Scott: I'm sure there will be a brony meetup.

351
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:18,859
Rym: Yeah, well has Daryl Surratt seen it?

352
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:19,100
Rym: yet?

353
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:24,139
Rym: I don't know cuz the last I heard he had not actually watched an episode yet.

354
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:27,138
Rym: Yeah, whatever if that is true I'll make him watch.

355
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,453
Rym: anyway We will be at anime Boston doing panels like anime openers from around the world.

356
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,238
Rym: and who is hot today?

357
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,230
Scott: Miku Yep, high quality panels that have been rarely seen.

358
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,015
Rym: Yeah, I've done anime openers.

359
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,800
Rym: I think one at anime Boston.

360
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,350
Rym: Yeah, and it was a way different panel.

361
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,040
Scott: I did miko one Miku once at Kinetic Con.

362
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:58,258
Scott: It was the best panel ever but there was hardly anyone in there because it was late at night and now it's gonna be the Awesomest panel you ever seen yep, and of course the book club book was Michio Kaku's hyperspace, which we're now gonna talk about.

363
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,952
Rym: yep Are you gonna announce the next book?

364
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:02,060
Scott: well actually?

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,315
Scott: Actually, I had a book in mind my favoritest book of ever.

366
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,360
Rym: yeah a little prince.

367
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:10,170
Scott: No, that was my second favorite book ever.

368
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,357
Scott: That's probably my third favorite book ever.

369
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,187
Scott: Oh wow But anyway, I was gonna pick that book.

370
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:18,879
Scott: my Claire Bibble might now my favorite is book ever, but you know what I?

371
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:21,448
Scott: Changed my mind like yesterday.

372
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:24,180
Scott: god damn it, so I'm glad I didn't say anything.

373
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,589
Scott: And you know why I changed my mind.

374
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:26,596
Rym: you want to read something.

375
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:30,514
Scott: You've never read That's right, and also because I read hyperspace, and it gave me an idea.

376
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:35,980
Rym: well whatever it is You're gonna have to wait because a book I've been waiting for for a long time is gonna be delivered to my door any day.

377
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:36,580
Scott: It's all right.

378
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,300
Scott: We waited a long time to do hyperspace, and I think that was worthwhile.

379
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,931
Scott: But hyperspace gave me the idea of the book that I should choose and then after that I will go and choose my favoritest book ever.

380
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:47,420
Rym: so what brief history of the universe.

381
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:48,986
Rym: No, we're gonna read.

382
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:55,628
Scott: you know we're gonna read fucking foundation bitches, that's right Foundation that's right foundation number one.

383
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:59,820
Rym: Yeah, I should actually read that bought all three on am?

384
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,487
Scott: I see there's more than three, but I bought that.

385
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:03,695
Scott: the read that the original three on Amazon.

386
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:04,780
Rym: That's all we're doing.

387
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:06,447
Scott: Yep, yeah one.

388
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:06,909
Scott: We're not.

389
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,134
Scott: we're not doing the all three.

390
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,199
Scott: We're doing just the first one.

391
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,526
Scott: yeah Otherwise we'll be here all night.

392
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:12,531
Rym: It's about time.

393
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,058
Rym: I actually did read foundation.

394
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:14,520
Scott: That's right.

395
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:16,526
Rym: As much as I know about it.

396
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,011
Rym: I've never actually read it.

397
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:19,938
Scott: I started to read it one time.

398
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,480
Scott: I think my parents have like a hardcover.

399
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,239
Scott: That's like a three in one, but I bought the three separate ones, so we're gonna read.

400
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:31,820
Scott: We're just gonna read the first foundation and by Asimov, and that's it all right.

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,873
Scott: So there you go done, and then next time it is my turn.

402
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:36,400
Scott: I'll read my favorite his book every.

403
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:49,640
Rym: So when I was a kid this was a long time ago, and I didn't realize how long ago Was until I read hyperspace again, I read hyperspace a scientific Odyssey through parallel universes time warps and the 10th dimension.

404
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:52,665
Rym: I don't even know Why I read hyperspace like.

405
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:58,446
Rym: I don't know if someone gave it to me if I just found it in the bookstore like I can't I don't remember.

406
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:02,907
Rym: all I know was that when I was really young Something like 1995 or 1996.

407
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,130
Scott: well the book came out in like 93 94 94.

408
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:13,118
Rym: I read it and it seemed really profound to me and I forgot about it.

409
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:18,446
Rym: And then you know I was kind of reminded of it recently cuz I read that Bryson book and a bunch of other books on science I was like oh hyperspace.

410
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,775
Rym: I could read that again.

411
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:20,580
Rym: I think it's a good book.

412
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,685
Rym: We just did cosmos.

413
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,698
Rym: it fits with my theme, and you know we'll see how it stands up.

414
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:30,839
Rym: It amazes me how little I remembered from that book from reading it as a kid.

415
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:38,200
Rym: But at the same time it amazes me how much I realize now that hyperspace affected my worldview.

416
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:39,503
Scott: I'm reading

417
00:26:39,543 --> 00:27:09,892
Rym: this book as a kid and thinking about the things I cared about as I got older and the things I was interested in and What I understood didn't understand and thought I understood, but didn't about particle physics And even like what I got into in high school like when I really started gravitating toward physics and away from biology and away from chemistry and toward math and the fact that I got really really really fucking into math toward the end of high school and actually Considered for a while going into math like as a career.

418
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:13,964
Rym: obviously that would have been maybe a mistake, but Definitely, I don't know.

419
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:19,230
Rym: actually my co-workers a lot of them on the research side are trying to convince me to go back and get Like a master's in mathematics.

420
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,658
Rym: Uh-huh sure I Would if I didn't have to pay for it if I had a full ride to go back to college and learn math.

421
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,932
Scott: hell's Fuck yeah, math was great up until calculus.

422
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,860
Rym: Ah calculus was my favorite thing.

423
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,953
Scott: I do not like calculus see in high school.

424
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:34,120
Rym: We used to have calculus parties.

425
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,903
Rym: We'd get together.

426
00:27:34,923 --> 00:27:36,368
Rym: This is like when I was a senior.

427
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,211
Rym: We'd watch The Simpsons.

428
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,720
Scott: How many people at this party - like eight, okay?

429
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,792
Rym: I mean look like my AP bio class was I don't know 12 people total.

430
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:44,776
Rym: so anyway.

431
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:45,619
Scott: Let's talk about this book.

432
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:50,951
Rym: so hyperspace like I The analogies, I think that's where it really shows.

433
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:58,660
Rym: like whenever up until I reread this book I you I would make an analogy for anything related to physics or time or space or math or anything.

434
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:06,019
Rym: Almost all of those analogies I realized came out of hyperspace, and I just forgotten that that's where they came from.

435
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:15,159
Scott: yeah I mean, I never read the book, but I've always also been an analogy person and when it comes to science I'm obviously weak very weak in the math department right, but I'm very strong.

436
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,960
Scott: at least I think I'm very strong in the conceptual department.

437
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:25,358
Rym: So words that were said by one of my favorite physics teachers in high school were that and I quote as well.

438
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,013
Rym: as I can remember Everybody likes the conceptual side of physics because you don't need to know fucking anything.

439
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:31,715
Scott: That's right.

440
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:36,580
Rym: That's exactly right Because I said the same thing to him.

441
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:38,130
Scott: We even says so in this book.

442
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,580
Scott: there's a part pretty close to the end.

443
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,655
Scott: He's like look if you just want to describe you know conceptually what we've learned in physics.

444
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,140
Scott: It's actually pretty simple, right?

445
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,562
Scott: It's like.

446
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:54,338
Scott: it's like you could say in a few sentences You know it's it's you know, but to actually describe why we know that and how we know that metric tensors.

447
00:28:54,459 --> 00:29:02,297
Scott: Yeah But thing is even though this book talks about a lot of math it doesn't actually do any math right.

448
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,971
Scott: he names Equations and he describes what you know he's like.

449
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:11,733
Scott: so there's an equation called of this You know a metric tensor and a metric tensor means this.

450
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:12,154
Rym: well.

451
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,700
Rym: He showed you like a matrix.

452
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,991
Rym: He's like all right, and then he shows those boxes where he's like.

453
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:19,017
Rym: here's where Einstein's theory fits in.

454
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:19,800
Rym: here's this.

455
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,789
Rym: You see them like growing out like when he does so.

456
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:23,114
Scott: it's like I couldn't.

457
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:23,797
Scott: you know.

458
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:36,976
Scott: based on this I couldn't actually do any of this math, but obviously but if You so if you showed me an equation and said what the name of the equation was I'd be like oh That's the equation that does this thing right and you know it's like.

459
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:37,859
Scott: I could match the.

460
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:49,402
Scott: now I can match the conceptual ideas with the names of the mathematical equations and actually if I understood and knew how to read those Mathematical equations I could probably say oh, that's the one that matches up with that idea You know.

461
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:58,777
Scott: so it's like you can't think about the math directly But it gives you sort of this idea of You know which maths are used for what.

462
00:29:59,099 --> 00:29:59,220
Rym: well?

463
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Rym: I think for as a kid though what this book did what is a cosmos is very different?

464
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,084
Rym: But they both serve the same purpose.

465
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,959
Rym: They're like hey you guys realize that science is actually the most awesome thing right?

466
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,600
Scott: yeah It's very similar to cosmos a lot of ways because you know he talks about the history.

467
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,612
Scott: Yeah, he's talking about all the old sigh.

468
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:27,589
Rym: You know he does a lot of storytelling Like second style of getting people excited about science is more of a awe and like oh my god You know how many anythings there are anywhere.

469
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:28,954
Rym: just think about that.

470
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:30,720
Scott: whoa he doesn't do a lot of that here.

471
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,527
Rym: He'd know cock who does more this thing of?

472
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,212
Rym: yeah fucking wormholes.

473
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:35,954
Rym: Holy shit.

474
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:37,117
Rym: Yeah, they might be real.

475
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:38,280
Rym: Oh, here's the math.

476
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:45,771
Scott: Instead of being like you know trying to awe you with the wonders of the universe He does a lot more practical stuff like he's like.

477
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:47,438
Scott: so what does this mean for you?

478
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:47,518
Scott: Yep?

479
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:48,462
Scott: You know.

480
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,369
Scott: and oh this discovery.

481
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,312
Scott: Well, what did that mean?

482
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,340
Rym: Yeah, I'm like all right the universe is gonna end.

483
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,764
Rym: Can we do anything about that?

484
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:59,299
Rym: Yeah, huh, and he actually poses like hey, maybe maybe we can.

485
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:03,879
Scott: He's like there's a chance that we can do this and there's a chance that we can do that.

486
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,911
Scott: You know he doesn't really you know have any definitive things cuz.

487
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:12,891
Scott: well at the site then except for where the science is definitive Yeah, it's like he's directly in line with whatever the science says.

488
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:13,935
Scott: you know he's like.

489
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,884
Scott: could there be a God and as you read Through the book.

490
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:16,389
Scott: It's like yes.

491
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:17,035
Scott: Nope

492
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:17,560
Rym: yes

493
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:27,697
Scott: No, maybe yes, no, but oh, but then you know towards the end He's like well you can you can't have the God of miracles But you have the God of order, and it's like make

494
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:28,820
Rym: up your mind Yep

495
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:38,015
Scott: Because as you learn more sciences throughout the book the answers to the clay keeps asking the same questions again And you keeps answering them differently because you learned a new thing.

496
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,060
Scott: so now the answer has changed.

497
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:44,040
Rym: I do enjoy how he went through and I had with with like light as a particle in different different aspects.

498
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:55,537
Rym: Well based on what everything we've talked about so far it seems like this is true the next chapter is basically yeah That's a bunch of horseshit, and here's why yeah, I mean you know he also does a lot of concentration on.

499
00:31:55,818 --> 00:32:00,210
Scott: you know Theoretic the theoretical versus the experimental is like experimentally.

500
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:02,656
Scott: standard model is the king right?

501
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,120
Scott: There's just so much evidence.

502
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:04,984
Scott: It's unbelievable.

503
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:09,146
Scott: it always works, but it doesn't work 100%.

504
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:10,339
Scott: So we got to go to this.

505
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:18,479
Scott: But we can't actually use the string theory because we would need the energy of a hajillion And we don't have that and we're not gonna have that for a long time.

506
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,311
Rym: I also think about remember how when we're at RIT.

507
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,740
Rym: We'd argue about physics or causality or whatever.

508
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,912
Rym: I'd always be like yeah the Planck constant the Planck limit.

509
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,900
Rym: That's because I read hyperspace as a kid.

510
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,210
Rym: Yeah, Planck didn't come up that much in my physics classes.

511
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:32,631
Rym: No.

512
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,075
Scott: I still have.

513
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:34,456
Scott: I still.

514
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:39,034
Scott: that is one thing That I you know a lot of the things he describes in this book.

515
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:43,931
Scott: right I can have a much better Conceptual understanding of after reading it obviously like strings and such.

516
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:51,840
Scott: yeah, but one thing I do have a better understanding of it But I still have a hard time understanding it right is the idea that there's these other dimensions.

517
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,080
Scott: I understand that other dimensions.

518
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:58,620
Scott: I can't picture them in my brain, but I can I can you know understand more multiple spatial dimensions.

519
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:03,817
Scott: But I still have a hard time thinking about is that the other spatial dimensions are collapsed.

520
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:04,720
Scott: It's like why?

521
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:15,287
Scott: Okay, I understand Mathematically they're collapsed and I can understand that the fact that they are collapsed But I can't actually well It's picture why they're collapsed.

522
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:19,200
Scott: like why can't they just be fully remember the part in cosmos?

523
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,959
Rym: Where Sagan talks about the the fact that we don't know for sure if our universe is open or closed.

524
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,978
Rym: mm-hmm a dimension can be the same thing.

525
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:42,830
Rym: a Spherical dimension would be closed and that you can go infinitely in any direction Along the surface, but yet there is a finite amount of space But yet infinite space depending on how you look at it.

526
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,760
Rym: that it's closed in on itself that there's like this discrete.

527
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:50,180
Scott: So this is basically there's an edge whether but there is no edge, okay?

528
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,147
Rym: So let me think about this there's no edge whether or not it's open or closed it either loops back on itself or goes off Or so it's either pac-man or its infinity.

529
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,216
Scott: Yeah, okay, so so what you're?

530
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:10,679
Scott: so the thing is Let's pretend that the third dimensions you have a cube right yeah What if the third dimension was collapsed resulting in two dimensions, but there's really three, but the third ones collapsed?

531
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,563
Scott: What would that be like?

532
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,774
Scott: because we can imagine that right same thing.

533
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:14,980
Scott: so what would that be like though?

534
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,170
Scott: Would it be like flat land, but you can go around the you can pac-man?

535
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,556
Scott: yeah, right so.

536
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:20,659
Scott: but then where's the third dimension?

537
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,929
Scott: Is it just the cube got flattened, but but there is a cube is just a really short cube the way I I think.

538
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,300
Scott: so there is an up and down But you can't actually go up and down because as soon as you go up you pac-man to the bottom.

539
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,578
Scott: I mean think of this you can't really tell there's nothing down.

540
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,668
Rym: the way I always envisioned is you know there is you can see me.

541
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:46,300
Rym: I'm savo tendering right now, but for all you know I'm moving back and forth all over the place in this fourth dimension, but because it's so small I'm just looping back around and there's no way to detect that.

542
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:48,409
Scott: So there is a fourth dimension, but it's so.

543
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,100
Scott: it's like if you squish a cube like a pancake right.

544
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,628
Scott: So there is a third dimension.

545
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:56,737
Scott: we can where even though we think we're in flat land We can actually jump up and down a little bit.

546
00:34:57,282 --> 00:35:05,997
Scott: But because it's pac-man when you get to the top when you jump up and down It doesn't actually look like you're jumping up and down because you're hardly actually jumping because your head comes out the bottom.

547
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:11,644
Rym: another complication I don't know if this is in hyperspace or not because I read it again Long time ago.

548
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,478
Rym: it took a while for us to do this episode, but three to met.

549
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:20,920
Rym: the third Three-dimensional physical space is the only place where a knot can exist.

550
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,331
Scott: I know that's that's I want.

551
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:26,499
Scott: he didn't give me the math for that But it made me reminded me that thing of the day you had a long time ago.

552
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:27,965
Scott: What was that one?

553
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,610
Rym: Oh the four-dimensional knots?

554
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:32,440
Scott: Yeah, whatever that would think that it was the thing of the day you had.

555
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,323
Scott: It just reminded me of it.

556
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:33,925
Scott: I don't know.

557
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:40,044
Scott: I remember a four-dimensional game that no it was like he was like some like visualization of some.

558
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:48,743
Rym: oh, it's the one where you have you take it this three-dimensional shape and Cross it over itself without Breaking it.

559
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:49,526
Scott: Yeah, that's the one.

560
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,660
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I'll try to find that that was amazing.

561
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:56,320
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, there were you know, of course reading a book like this, right?

562
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,120
Scott: Someone like me who doesn't know any math is gonna come up with crazy ideas, right?

563
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,926
Scott: Yeah, I came up with two crazy ideas.

564
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:02,730
Scott: I would like to discuss.

565
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:03,613
Rym: All right.

566
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,942
Scott: All right, so crazy idea number one You ready for this?

567
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:06,704
Scott: I'm ready.

568
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:12,800
Scott: So he at one point he talks about light actually being a vibration of the fourth dimension, right?

569
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,465
Scott: Yeah, so is that true or not?

570
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:17,175
Scott: Or is that just you know in progress kind of thing?

571
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,500
Rym: Ah, it makes sense.

572
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:22,634
Scott: Okay, so if we pretend that light is a vibration of the fourth dimension, right?

573
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:27,318
Scott: Yes, that means Let's combine it with another idea that we understand very well.

574
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,660
Scott: You're right Photosynthesis, so you got a plant Scott.

575
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,880
Rym: There was just an article on slashdot not that long ago talking about quantum effects and how important they are to photosynthesis.

576
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,643
Rym: They're really.

577
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,948
Scott: I don't read that anymore.

578
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:44,939
Scott: Well, maybe you should maybe I should because I was thinking wow There's a wave in the fourth dimension.

579
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:50,796
Scott: Shake some molecules and atoms or whatever inside a plant and then the plant eats it.

580
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,280
Scott: How crazy is that shit?

581
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,565
Scott: So that is crazy.

582
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,152
Rym: Think about it even one step further.

583
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,700
Rym: Imagine that we're in flatland, right?

584
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,371
Rym: All right, and say that light or whatever in some other dimension.

585
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:03,200
Rym: There's a sheet that's like a vibrating like waves.

586
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:10,729
Rym: So say a wave like a bulb pops up through flatland momentarily Depending on at what point we observe.

587
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:11,754
Rym: it say it's oscillating.

588
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:12,940
Rym: So it's a wave like a book.

589
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:14,280
Scott: So it appears and disappears.

590
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,380
Rym: So it's a bubble going up and down up and down up and down intersecting with our universe at some point.

591
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:32,966
Rym: Okay if the peak the absolute peak of that wave is the Exact point of our universe then it appears and it's a point an oscillating point that appears and disappears Infinitely and regularly.

592
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,134
Scott: Okay, but it's if it's only a point.

593
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:38,072
Scott: it's kind of hard to see though, but it's there All right, and we can interact with it.

594
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:38,978
Rym: Maybe it messes stuff up.

595
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:44,500
Scott: It might pop up like in just like the worst place in your brain or hurt if it's just a little bit taller.

596
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,497
Rym: It's a circle now instead a sphere a circle that keeps appearing.

597
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:48,758
Rym: it does.

598
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:49,260
Rym: that's correct.

599
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:51,086
Rym: so think about that.

600
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:55,344
Rym: in terms of electrons and the fact that they're not a point.

601
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,324
Rym: they're a particle.

602
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:57,887
Rym: they're not either.

603
00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:01,103
Rym: they're like a wave of probability that They're.

604
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:02,287
Rym: we know they're like.

605
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:10,486
Rym: this is the area where it could be and we know it's somewhere in there but we can't know where it is specifically and Maybe that has something to do with.

606
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:26,665
Rym: imagine, you know that dimension something appearing in our universe Repeatedly in that manner that I described the bubble coming in through flatland Like the area where it's intersecting our universe is the probability wave but the actual structure of the electron.

607
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:34,005
Rym: the reason we can't really interact with it directly is because it is actually just of Oscillation on that other dimension.

608
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:34,688
Rym: Hmm.

609
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,220
Rym: It's not a thing but in our universe it manifests as a thing.

610
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:43,238
Rym: Mmm, that would also explain why there are so many different particles.

611
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:49,377
Scott: Yeah So my second crazy idea isn't really chemo is like just knocking that hoof against his.

612
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:54,395
Scott: I'm sure every every I'm sure every real physicist listening to us non-physicist is going crazy.

613
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:55,580
Scott: And for that we apologize.

614
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:56,504
Rym: Yeah, what if a computer?

615
00:38:56,524 --> 00:39:02,564
Scott: but you should be glad that we are interested and we are not people who believe in Metaphysical or it's not?

616
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,972
Scott: you want to do scientific things Scott and all.

617
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:12,295
Scott: you are just curious and we know we are Unlearned and we do not believe the gods that are crazy you and all we just computer people can.

618
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:13,900
Rym: now I'm going to do something.

619
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:21,151
Rym: I will use magic to let you experience Exactly what all the physicists listening to this episode are right now.

620
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:24,220
Rym: All right, man, so computers use binary, right?

621
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,223
Rym: It's just like zeros and ones.

622
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,032
Rym: What if I had like a one two or five?

623
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:30,380
Rym: it'd be so much more powerful.

624
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:31,159
Scott: We could do that.

625
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:41,160
Scott: But in fact if they're physicists they will know that how a transistor works and a transistor is actually a quantum device Right, so they would know that you couldn't have a one two, three or five if they were physicists.

626
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:45,578
Scott: But if they were normal people they would think you could have one two, three or five which you can actually do.

627
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:50,560
Scott: There have been computers that use their own one and they just kind of suck and they're hard to program.

628
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,126
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of reason.

629
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,133
Rym: also are the way we do.

630
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:59,913
Scott: logic is not as easy or useful No, but anyway, here's my second crazy idea, which isn't really that crazy.

631
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:03,668
Scott: It's actually just you know a Increased understanding right?

632
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:08,720
Scott: So I always since it was explained to me originally I always sort of understood Einstein's gravity, right?

633
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,283
Scott: You got a lot of.

634
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,270
Scott: you got a lot of mass.

635
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:20,920
Scott: when you have a lot of mass You know, if you have a two-dimensional universe and you have a heavy thing It's gonna put a big dent in it, you know And that dent is actually a dent three a three-dimensional dent in the two-dimensional universe.

636
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:25,580
Scott: So things seem to be falling into it Even though you can't see why they're falling into it because you're a two-dimensional person.

637
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:32,709
Scott: Yeah, and likewise in three dimensions when there's a heavy thing right with a lot of mass It makes a big dent, but it's a four-dimensional dent.

638
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,720
Scott: So things fall into it right and gravity, whatever.

639
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:37,856
Scott: But think about this, right?

640
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:46,320
Scott: So Well, if there was a four-dimensional thing and it you know Let's say I was a four-dimensional person and I was not touching the third dimension and then I punched it, right?

641
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,685
Scott: Yeah, so I put my fist into it.

642
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,428
Scott: What's gonna happen?

643
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,820
Scott: Well, they're gonna see three-dimensional people.

644
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:59,312
Rym: I'm gonna say that it's not that you're putting your fist into the third dimension It's that there is a thing in the third dimension that you can.

645
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,436
Rym: there's a three-dimensional thing.

646
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:06,905
Rym: It's the equivalent of me I'm holding say this piece of paper is actually totally flat and there's things living on it That are effectively two-dimensional.

647
00:41:07,206 --> 00:41:08,049
Rym: I just start fucking with them.

648
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:16,954
Rym: Yeah, I'm not putting my hand into the second dimension I'm just interacting with a four-dimensional object that happens to have also.

649
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:24,460
Scott: you're saying that so we live in a third dimensional object That is floating in a fourth dimension and a lot of that fourth dimension isn't touching us only some of it is touching us.

650
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:26,720
Rym: I guess that's the best way we can say it anyway.

651
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:31,500
Scott: But the point is if something from the fourth dimension were to enter our dimension, right?

652
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,040
Scott: It would sort of appear out of a point and grow larger, right?

653
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,197
Scott: It would be like if a basketball came in a four-dimensional basketball.

654
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:40,587
Scott: So a Four-ball right would.

655
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,032
Scott: they threw it at us right?

656
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:42,835
Scott: They poked at us.

657
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:44,360
Scott: We would see this a basketball.

658
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,439
Scott: It would start out as like a dot.

659
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:58,932
Scott: It would grow to a full basketball and then it would shrink again into another dot Right or something like that something along those lines, but isn't that what you know, like, you know The Sun looks like right, you know, it's got.

660
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:01,825
Scott: you know, it's it gets bigger I get in.

661
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,318
Scott: gravity makes it smaller, right?

662
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,864
Scott: So it's like they.

663
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:10,000
Scott: you know that that lends itself your gravity versus things from the fourth to met.

664
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,557
Scott: You know things all matter being something from the fourth dimension protruding into the third dimension, right?

665
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:16,219
Rym: Well, it's not.

666
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:20,009
Rym: if Gravity is the distortion of space-time or something like that.

667
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,060
Rym: Then it's just that's a dip in another dimension effectively

668
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:36,680
Scott: No, but I'm saying is that it ever all if all matter is actually Something from the fourth dimension poking its way in Right, yeah, and then gravity is sort of it being sucked, you know back out to the fourth.

669
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:39,610
Rym: well that's exactly what I guess it would be.

670
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:46,333
Rym: and that if if all the individual particles are just the Manifestations of strings or waves or whatever in this multi-dimensional universe.

671
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:57,299
Rym: We can't really interact with then What we are is just kind of this meta structure that is manifest of all those other things That themselves are unrelated to their constituents.

672
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:09,921
Scott: Yeah, I was really struggling to have a sentence there but you see but that's the thing is you look at you look at You know a star and it's gravity and you look at the four-dimensional basketball just sort of passing by and it's the same sort of Thing.

673
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:12,230
Rym: I know the trouble we have is looks the same.

674
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,562
Rym: the trouble we have to watch out for is that we're definitely we can fall into the trap of the anthropic principle of We.

675
00:43:17,622 --> 00:43:22,100
Rym: it's very easy for us to analogize things because they appear similar and they're complete bullshit in the math.

676
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:31,696
Scott: It doesn't even match at all Of course Sagan because I was ran but you know Like a star going into a black hole looks the same with our eyeballs as a bat.

677
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,505
Scott: a four-dimensional basketball Leaving our dimension.

678
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:35,528
Scott: remember in cos.

679
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:36,912
Scott: it shrinks to a point and goes away.

680
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:53,540
Rym: when Sagan points out that if our universe is closed It's as though we are our entire universe is contained within or it is effectively an electron But one in a greater universe and that every point particle in our universe is in fact a closed universe.

681
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:56,459
Rym: That itself, you know, and it's ad infinitum up and down.

682
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,040
Scott: Yeah, but I don't think that you know, you could fit a billion billion galaxies in in one of our electrons.

683
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,245
Scott: That's that's not in there.

684
00:44:02,747 --> 00:44:03,168
Rym: Why not?

685
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,036
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not in there.

686
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:05,578
Rym: then how come?

687
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,080
Rym: how do you know?

688
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,003
Rym: We're not an electron.

689
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,040
Scott: I'm pretty sure that our universe of a billion billion galaxies is not an electron.

690
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,945
Scott: Maybe why not?

691
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:13,789
Scott: Maybe it's a proton.

692
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,719
Rym: I don't think you listen to Carl Sagan that much.

693
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,205
Scott: It's not it's not.

694
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,334
Scott: this isn't turtles all the way down.

695
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:27,414
Rym: so I did ask Timo our Non-resident expert on these man.

696
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:28,376
Scott: What did you ask him?

697
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:30,820
Rym: I was like, yeah, so I really know hyperspace.

698
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:38,200
Rym: I was talking a little bit and I gave me permission to read this But he gave a short like mini review of his feelings in the hyperspace.

699
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,545
Rym: My question was here.

700
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:41,551
Rym: Let me find the exact question that I asked him.

701
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:45,926
Rym: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo I can't find it.

702
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:47,953
Rym: I was basically like hey you have the answer.

703
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:52,406
Scott: You know the question is hyperspace legit Did anything?

704
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,133
Scott: that is something I do want to comment on.

705
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,700
Scott: oh actually two things I want to comment on.

706
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:07,560
Scott: So one thing if you were not someone who understood science and math, you know, I mean and you read this book Just from the look like if you were not an educated person like if you were, you know, very uneducated.

707
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:08,665
Rym: Oh, it's rock-solid.

708
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:11,236
Scott: No, no, but this book even though it is rock-solid.

709
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:11,818
Scott: I agree, right?

710
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,140
Scott: The way it presents itself physically and with diagrams and lit, you know in its wording, right?

711
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:25,757
Scott: Easily and On a surface level very much resembles pretty much any time cube.

712
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,340
Scott: Randy book.

713
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:34,409
Scott: You know, you actually you have to have some sort of beginning knowledge or intelligence To be able to tell the difference between this.

714
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:35,412
Rym: you want to know why.

715
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:36,376
Rym: you want to know why.

716
00:45:36,396 --> 00:45:37,720
Rym: two dimensional?

717
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:50,338
Rym: Simple drawings that illustrate very powerful analogies that directly relate to feelings people have look at the fourth way I know exactly so, you know, it's like What's what really does?

718
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,126
Scott: Separate this from time cube.

719
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,159
Scott: besides the fact that the math is right and as opposed to the math is not made up.

720
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:00,860
Scott: and if you're Not an expert who can tell you you whatever book you read first time cube or hyperspace is gonna get you know How?

721
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,610
Rym: you you know how you solve that if I read time cube?

722
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,713
Rym: Alright time cube.

723
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,908
Rym: I read a different book That isn't time cube.

724
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:08,934
Rym: They don't match up.

725
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:09,739
Scott: That's true.

726
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:14,544
Rym: If I read hyperspace and then some other quantum physics book, they're gonna match up quite a bit They are.

727
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:18,728
Scott: and as for the up-to-date ness, you know I was also thinking about that because this book is from 94.

728
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:20,092
Scott: Yeah there it's.

729
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:22,300
Scott: it's at least a lot of years later.

730
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:25,460
Scott: Right, there had to be some development since then.

731
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,689
Scott: So there are things in this book that are out of date.

732
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:30,640
Scott: For example, he talks about the superconducting supercollider.

733
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,895
Scott: We already know that we now have the hadron collider, right?

734
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,400
Scott: He didn't know about that when he wrote the book.

735
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:39,636
Scott: Yeah, but we haven't found anything huge there yet.

736
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:39,978
Scott: Yeah.

737
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:44,529
Scott: Yeah But anyway so that sort of thing is out of date.

738
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:52,217
Scott: but I thought about the out-of-date ness of this book when I was reading it and I was like 20 years whatever but reading the book most of the time.

739
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,080
Scott: what's he talking about?

740
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:59,740
Scott: He's talking about people like von Neumann or Riemann or Einstein or even Newton, right?

741
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,378
Scott: It's like those guys are centuries old.

742
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:06,239
Rym: Scott Who does Sagan talk about?

743
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:08,288
Scott: Ancient Greek, right?

744
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:15,343
Scott: So he's talking about these old old Scientists, right and even a lot of the ones, you know Even the more recent ones.

745
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:20,560
Scott: he talks about our 20th early 20th century guys and their shit still holds up.

746
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,383
Scott: You know, he's got like he'll.

747
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,975
Scott: you look at the matrix he's got and whose names are in there?

748
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:25,100
Scott: Maxwell and Einstein.

749
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,763
Scott: Those are not recent, dude right, I mean.

750
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:47,416
Scott: so if there was something, you know, and if their stuff is still legit after centuries then In the 20-something years since this book has been written You're I don't think you know the odds of there being something devastatingly Huge that changes this book completely and makes it invalid are pretty low.

751
00:47:47,537 --> 00:47:51,380
Scott: if centuries Couldn't have invalidated these other guys, right?

752
00:47:51,741 --> 00:48:00,897
Scott: If their stuff is still right Then the stuff in this book is still gonna be mostly right and right enough for a layman like myself Who's never going to do any sort of?

753
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:02,969
Scott: Scientific experiment in this department.

754
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,060
Rym: one thing that's really cool is that look at cosmos.

755
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:09,939
Rym: I was reading through all the errata like all the updates since cosmos came out.

756
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,076
Rym: Very few corrections very few outright.

757
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:15,940
Rym: This was wrong.

758
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:23,120
Rym: Mostly it's we confirmed this even more or we confirm something even crazier than we suspected.

759
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:26,635
Rym: Yeah, or you know, this science is happening things like that.

760
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:27,800
Scott: It was there was some article.

761
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,453
Scott: I don't remember what it was, but I read it.

762
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:48,260
Scott: I think yesterday I don't even I just read it really quickly I'd even bother but it was about a very similar hyperspace related topic on a real science blog and a lot of the stuff that was written in that post was like Totally just straight from this book and I was like I understood half that blog post because it was just out of this book.

763
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:59,140
Scott: So if it hasn't changed since a blog post from yesterday, I think this book is still Incredibly valuable to someone who wants to learn about this and is not yet so out of date.

764
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,420
Scott: It's not no longer worth reading.

765
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:07,820
Rym: So from Timo who is a physicist who actually does know what he's talking about, you know 10 billion times more than we do I read hyperspace over the weekend.

766
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,818
Rym: Here's the short of it too many boring anecdotes and strained analogies, but I like anecdotes and analogies, especially strained one.

767
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,686
Rym: Yes Longer, here's the long of it.

768
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:25,320
Rym: I am tempted to say that there are too many overly generalized explanations But in hindsight, I say that he doesn't actually explain anything.

769
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:29,094
Rym: The book is basically a dog and pony show.

770
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:38,280
Rym: Yep of neat ideas Yep, and that it doesn't fail completely Although there are parts where I get an interesting insight into his thoughts on some meaningful physical concepts.

771
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,490
Rym: There are few and far between hmm.

772
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:45,591
Rym: The book is scientifically sound Though mostly old news.

773
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:50,740
Scott: Yeah, well dots is 94 it's old news there has especially for someone who's a profession.

774
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,206
Rym: This is the part I want I get to learn more about.

775
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:56,404
Rym: there has been a second revolution in string theory in the early 2000s.

776
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,510
Scott: Oh, so that is that is the thing.

777
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,040
Scott: That is pretty the only thing that's not in this book.

778
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:10,609
Rym: probably also over the last decade Cosmology has become a precision science and added a lot of new opportunities for testing some of the ideas in the latter part of the Book that I'm really excited about.

779
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:11,835
Scott: I want to learn about that.

780
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:17,291
Rym: 17 years Even for the glacial pace that science advances.

781
00:50:17,311 --> 00:50:19,097
Scott: Yeah, see glacial pace of science.

782
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:23,480
Rym: all in all It's not a bad popular science book, but I'm a scientist.

783
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,800
Rym: So I see all the ifs and buts no kidding and I want more meat on my explanation.

784
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:33,519
Scott: Of course if this if there's a computer science book that was written like this It would have no little to no value for me.

785
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,217
Rym: the thing is this is a book to where you could throw this at almost anyone and they can.

786
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:45,164
Scott: you could throw it at a Nerdy middle school student or a non fit or a beep or higher High school student.

787
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:47,572
Rym: I think that the best person to give this a

788
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:48,556
Scott: good high school is

789
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:51,310
Rym: someone who's a little nerdy Who but like

790
00:50:51,472 --> 00:51:04,274
Scott: early on in there I think it's best if there's a kid who's starting to show who actually shows interest in science like if they're in science class at all and they go ooh, or if they watch Discovery Channel and they're like, oh And they go all even once you gotta give this book.

791
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,294
Scott: Yep, or Cosmos or any of those similar books.

792
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:11,775
Rym: Yes But it's I think middle school is the age because that you know.

793
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,160
Rym: end of middle school early high school.

794
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,659
Scott: It's like they'll get some of it, but they won't understand a lot of it as well.

795
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:19,620
Rym: And if they're like me, it'll influence them in surprising way.

796
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,474
Scott: I mean, I still can't even really understand how that dimension collapses.

797
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:26,340
Rym: besides pac-man Yeah, and I can talk out my ass for hours.

798
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,480
Scott: So in a third is in a three is actually in a three-dimensional space.

799
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,518
Scott: But the third dimension collapse actually pac-man because he can go.

800
00:51:34,061 --> 00:51:35,086
Rym: Depends depends on the map.

801
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:40,472
Rym: Can you just call it the sides of the top didn't go at the sides and the top Okay, so come up with a shape that works.

802
00:51:40,492 --> 00:51:42,039
Rym: You've got a shape that crosses over itself.

803
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:43,345
Scott: Oh, didn't he say?

804
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:48,498
Scott: there was one point where he said it was like pac-man's on a cylinder or no He's on a Taurus, right?

805
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,294
Scott: Yes But it's like how can pac-man be on a Taurus?

806
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:57,275
Scott: I don't know whatever But if he's on a Taurus then it's three-dimensional but but it's a collapsed Taurus.

807
00:51:57,736 --> 00:51:58,659
Scott: I don't I still don't get it.

808
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,752
Rym: That's why we need a book with more meat on it now.

809
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,000
Rym: I think we've gotten past this point.

810
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,900
Scott: I want to see a picture of a three-dimensional universe where the third where the third dimension collapsed.

811
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:08,105
Rym: I guess it's only.

812
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:14,029
Rym: I'm glad I read this book when I was much younger because I think there are better books for someone Of my age to read on these topics.

813
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:16,440
Rym: I think I could do for a little more math.

814
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:23,853
Rym: Yeah, I could you know, I could Like the math is unimportant, but let's move on.

815
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:25,620
Scott: Yeah, the math is just kind of hard.

816
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,117
Rym: Yeah, I would least like more of the grounding of the math like more of the.

817
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:33,997
Rym: alright Here's what this implies Mathematically and here's why it implies that.

818
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:45,560
Scott: yeah The only thing that I sort of question and obviously I'm almost I'm actually I'm 100% sure I'm wrong Right is that you know, he keeps showing you the matrix of like Einstein in the top left then Maxwell then Yang Mills, right?

819
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,739
Scott: It's like now we have enough room.

820
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:58,439
Scott: It's like adding more dimensions increase the size of the matrix Which means you have more room to fit stuff in there Which means you could add these, you know Now we can add all these guys in and everything fits together, right and I understood that conceptually very well.

821
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,640
Rym: But it's like in taking stuff, right?

822
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,405
Rym: But it's like and other people.

823
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:11,360
Scott: but at the same time I was thinking obviously wrong and mathematically right obviously, but it's like Couldn't I just make any matrix bigger and fit in any kind of maths?

824
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,656
Scott: I wanted I could make a giant matrix and fit all the math in the world and it wouldn't.

825
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:15,400
Scott: it would totally work.

826
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:16,825
Scott: So what is so?

827
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:18,069
Scott: what does that even mean?

828
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:18,370
Scott: Right?

829
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:19,394
Rym: I guess the that was.

830
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,020
Scott: that was my stupid and incorrect thinking.

831
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:25,627
Scott: Well, I guess my way around that is it's like yeah I can take two completely unrelated things.

832
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:28,999
Scott: make a big enough matrix so that there's enough spots in there to put both of them.

833
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,691
Scott: But if you but if you make that does that make them related?

834
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:36,653
Rym: if you make it too much bigger Like bigger than it needs to be there's this extra space in there.

835
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:38,179
Rym: You don't have anything to put in that space.

836
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,995
Rym: So there's a hole that you can't fill.

837
00:53:41,015 --> 00:53:45,180
Scott: that's meaning Well, there are some little holes that he said they do put something in there.

838
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,899
Scott: But he said yeah, we're not gonna talk about what they put in that corner bit.

839
00:53:49,801 --> 00:54:02,809
Rym: Yeah, I about three times reading this book again I went to Wikipedia and tried to learn more about metric tensors and I even asked some of the mathematicians at work and one of them I was like so I'm interested in metric tensors.

840
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:11,640
Rym: and he looked at me and he said really and I said Yes And he said why reading some kaku?

841
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,193
Rym: So We've got our new book.

842
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:20,980
Rym: we had our old book.

843
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:31,961
Rym: I think it's a worthwhile read especially if you've got like a nerdy Cousin who's younger than you or something or like a nerdy nephew or niece and you need a book to give them like a science Book.

844
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:33,066
Rym: that'll get them thinking.

845
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:35,879
Scott: Yeah, also it's like I delayed starting of reading it.

846
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:37,993
Scott: You know by a lot of time just cuz mostly cuz.

847
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:38,960
Scott: I was busy with other things.

848
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:48,040
Scott: But once I started reading it, I not only did I have to finish it quickly to be in time for this episode I finished it yesterday last night, but I really wanted to finish it very quickly.

849
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,160
Scott: Yes, you kept wanting to read more.

850
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:55,810
Rym: I dragged through the first and that's kind of a good book because I remembered it pretty well But then after that it was like, oh, whoa.

851
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:56,635
Rym: Wait, what what?

852
00:54:57,118 --> 00:55:08,080
Scott: Oh Yeah, so it's once you you know It's the kind of thing where it's like you won't want to start reading it because it's nonfiction and it's kind of like how no One wants to play a goddamn wooden cube game until I play it.

853
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,040
Scott: Then once you start reading it, you're not gonna stop just like my little phone.

854
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:19,590
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

855
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,390
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

856
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:29,710
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

857
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:37,390
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

00:55:42,191 --> 00:55:46,946
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

860
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:48,370
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
