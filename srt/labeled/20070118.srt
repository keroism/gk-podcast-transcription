1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,859
Scott: It's Thursday, January 18th.

2
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,203
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,106
Scott: And I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,170
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,900
Scott: Tonight we discuss snooze.

6
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:18,704
Scott: Snow.

7
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:19,610
Scott: Snow.

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:22,764
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,370
Rym: Well, as I was reminded last night, because I actually forgot, as I've forgotten in the past, tonight's actually my birthday.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,055
Scott: Congratulations.

11
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:33,457
Scott: Yeah.

12
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,650
Scott: An arbitrary time has passed.

13
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:40,770
Rym: I have survived for another year in an arbitrary time scale that involves planets.

14
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:57,104
Scott: Yes, the sphere upon which we live has traveled its entire orbit a round number of times about, well, I mean, it'll, for like a nanosecond, you know, the smallest unit, if there is a smallest unit of time, that was true.

15
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,650
Scott: Now it has passed.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,677
Rym: Well, the thing is, I don't remember, well, obviously I don't remember, but I don't know when I was born during the day, so it could be any time.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,490
Scott: I think I was born like two in the morning.

18
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,212
Scott: I don't really remember.

19
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:10,184
Rym: See, I think that too, but I might just be totally making that up.

20
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:10,766
Rym: Yeah.

21
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:11,650
Rym: I'm really, I don't know.

22
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:13,478
Scott: But yeah.

23
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,073
Scott: You could still be 24, possibly.

24
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,383
Rym: But at least this year, I didn't totally forget.

25
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:24,989
Rym: It was like, it came up what day it was, then I was like, "Oh, yeah, my birthday's in an

26
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:25,250
Rym: hour.".

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,215
Scott: Huh.

28
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,930
Rym: I think it was two years ago, might have been three years ago.

29
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:32,690
Rym: I completely forgot it was my birthday.

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,090
Rym: I absolutely had no idea, and then eventually I forget who it was, but someone wished me a happy birthday.

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,334
Rym: And I was like, "It's not my

32
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:39,796
Rym: birthday.".

33
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:43,710
Rym: And then someone else convinced me it was my birthday, and I thought about it.

34
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:44,854
Rym: "Wait, Jenny?

35
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,324
Rym: Yeah, hot

36
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:46,405
Rym: dad.".

37
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:47,230
Scott: Yep.

38
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,701
Scott: Yeah, we just don't really pay attention to birthdays around here.

39
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:51,986
Rym: Birthdays are- No, we used to.

40
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:52,689
Rym: Remember at RIT?

41
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,599
Scott: Other people really paid attention to them for us.

42
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:56,122
Scott: Yeah.

43
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,110
Scott: It was like we were getting pushed into it by others.

44
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:08,225
Rym: See, we have two general traditions around birthdays that pretty much died as we left RIT, just because we're not around each other every waking moment of every single day.

45
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:08,910
Scott: Birthday punches.

46
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,178
Rym: Yeah, but that wasn't all.

47
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:15,356
Rym: That was mostly just Kate coming and punching us, regardless of whether or not it was our birthday.

48
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:15,878
Rym: Yeah.

49
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,090
Rym: But no, we had one tradition among a small number of us.

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,150
Rym: I think it was Peter who started it, where on your birthday, you had to buy a steak dinner for everyone else.

51
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:25,790
Scott: Yeah, I don't think that was a tradition.

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,260
Scott: I think that was just people did it because, like I remember on my birthday, I took everyone to the Outback because it was my birthday.

53
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,658
Scott: My mom decided to pay for everyone to go to the Outback, so I took as many people as I could.

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,650
Rym: It wasn't like a- Oh, yeah, it wasn't the whole crew.

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,650
Rym: It was pretty much just a few of us who did that, and we did it semi-regularly, if we remembered birthdays, for about two and a half years.

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,055
Scott: I guess that's about right.

57
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,305
Rym: It was almost your tradition, and then we moved away.

58
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:49,928
Rym: Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,727
Rym: That, and we always tended to get cakes, which ended in the archangel, dark angel debacle that I won't get into.

60
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:57,289
Rym: Oh, God.

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,482
Rym: I still, to this day, do not know how that happened.

62
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:01,306
Scott: I remember that now.

63
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,010
Scott: That's a good one.

64
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,109
Scott: I can't believe I forgot it.

65
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,418
Rym: I was thinking about it the other day, in fact, because I was talking on the phone when Emily reminded me it was my birthday, so I started telling- Ear?

66
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:09,901
Rym: Yeah, ear.

67
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:15,990
Rym: I started telling birthday stories, which, of course, the ultimate birthday story is the story of the ear on the cake.

68
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,989
Scott: I totally forgot about that, but now it all came back to me in like a rush.

69
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,949
Rym: How that ear appeared on that cake, man will never know.

70
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:23,672
Scott: No.

71
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:27,550
Rym: There's no way to track down the person who put it there and ask them why they did that.

72
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,910
Scott: It's a great mystery of the universe.

73
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,978
Rym: Maybe we'll actually tell the story someday.

74
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,283
Scott: Maybe we will.

75
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,390
Rym: I don't know if it's as good as the blow-dryer story.

76
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,270
Scott: I haven't heard the blow-dryer story because I haven't listened to Penn in God knows how long.

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:48,347
Rym: Yeah, but there is more important news, aside from it being my birthday and me being exactly, give or take, up to 12 or so hours, a quarter century old.

78
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,950
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,274
Rym: A third of my life is gone.

80
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,708
Rym: Maybe a quarter if technology stays up and I'm as healthy as I think I am.

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,569
Rym: But, uh, it snowed today for the first time.

82
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,152
Rym: Ever?

83
00:03:59,172 --> 00:03:59,252
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,339
Scott: How did we have a word for it?

85
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,165
Rym: I made the word up just now.

86
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:03,988
Rym: Now, it snowed.

87
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,650
Scott: All right, so everybody, that white stuff that you see falling from the sky, we're gonna call it- Snew.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,647
Scott: I can't bel- What's snew with you?

89
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,789
Rym: Do you even know the origin of snew?

90
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,861
Scott: It's a joke from Kermit the Frog on that commercial with Fozzie.

91
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,688
Rym: No, it came from way before then.

92
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,310
Rym: Oh, really?

93
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,734
Scott: Yeah, cuz that was the best.

94
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,548
Scott: It was like he had those barrels and Kermit was like, "What's

95
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:28,829
Scott: snew?".

96
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,632
Scott: He's like, "Snew?

97
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:29,994
Scott: What's

98
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:30,234
Scott: snew?"

99
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,423
Scott: and Fozzie goes, "What's snew with you?

100
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:33,105
Scott: Oh,

101
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:34,229
Scott: zing!".

102
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,049
Rym: Now there's a much older snew.

103
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:46,100
Rym: In fact, if any of our listeners can bring up that older reference to snew, which specifically refers to- The show knows what snew is.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,825
Scott: I'm just curious.

105
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:47,249
Scott: I don't.

106
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,270
Scott: And uh- I don't need to remember his Fozzie bear.

107
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,201
Rym: You won't win anything.

108
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:50,910
Scott: Okay.

109
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,583
Rym: They're like, "He'll win fuck

110
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:54,107
Rym: all!".

111
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:56,089
Scott: Ooh, that's a good prize.

112
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,659
Rym: But yeah, it hadn't snowed yet this year.

113
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,190
Rym: In fact, it had barely frosted yet this year.

114
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,304
Rym: I have been wearing t-shirts outside up until about two days ago.

115
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:10,161
Scott: Yeah, well, yeah, two days ago it got cold and I was like, "Ooh, it's cold now.

116
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,888
Scott: I have to wear like a coat and I wish I had a

117
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:12,129
Scott: hat.".

118
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,718
Rym: Yeah, but it wasn't bitterly cold.

119
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,105
Rym: It was hovering around freezing.

120
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,070
Scott: It wasn't really below freezing.

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,078
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't shivering outside in my coat, but walking out to the car I was just thinking, "Woman, it is

122
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:22,581
Scott: cold.".

123
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,690
Scott: And, you know, there was frost on the car.

124
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,316
Scott: I had to defrost it a little bit, warm it up.

125
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,066
Scott: You could see the exhaust coming out of cars.

126
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:33,390
Scott: It was cold, but it wasn't like Rochester cold.

127
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,774
Rym: God.

128
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,383
Rym: See, maybe it's just because I grew up in Michigan that- I mean, cold is cold.

129
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,050
Rym: And if it's below freezing, it's cold.

130
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:44,847
Rym: But it's not that special kind of cold unless it's below zero Fahrenheit.

131
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:45,710
Scott: That's right.

132
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,599
Rym: That's the moment where I go outside and go,

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,041
Rym: "Fuck!"

134
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,810
Rym: And you turn around and go back inside.

135
00:05:49,990 --> 00:06:00,828
Rym: No, you end up doing that Rochester shuffle where you're walking as fast as you can, but you're holding your body perfectly rigid hoping that no amount of air will in any way enter your clothing.

136
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,290
Scott: Yep.

137
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,050
Scott: I pull that string at the bottom of my coat in to keep the air from going up into my business.

138
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,542
Rym: But no, my news is that it snowed and I live in a state where it snows.

139
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:18,505
Rym: It snows pretty much, barring catastrophe, every year in New York State, both upstate and downstate.

140
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,250
Rym: It snows here every year.

141
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,229
Rym: You'd think after the previous thousands and thousands of years of it snowing.

142
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:25,992
Rym: You know what?

143
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:26,757
Rym: I'll even go closer.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,478
Rym: Since the invention of the automobile, except for that first winter, people knew it was coming.

145
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,204
Rym: You knew it was gonna snow.

146
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:39,600
Rym: You knew that your car might spin out or somehow lose traction in snow.

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,430
Rym: You know exactly what snow is going to do when it's on a road.

148
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,244
Rym: You'd think after that first winter we would have this down.

149
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:48,590
Rym: It wouldn't be an issue anymore.

150
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,357
Rym: But no, it snows today.

151
00:06:50,377 --> 00:07:02,885
Rym: And not only did I pass five or six major, major freaking accidents with dead people laying in the street, but one of the accidents that I passed, there were about no exaggerations.

152
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,750
Rym: I'll tend to exaggerate stories.

153
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:11,757
Rym: There were exactly 16 police cars that I could see and more than six ambulances.

154
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,790
Rym: There were at least 20 cars involved in this accident.

155
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,550
Rym: There was debris everywhere, and I'm pretty sure I saw body bags.

156
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:19,671
Scott: Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:27,650
Rym: Now, I would have understood this if there had actually been any significant amount of snow on the ground, but the roads were just fine.

158
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:36,962
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I, driving home, I drive half the way home on a freeway and half, well, an interstate, and half the way home on this country road.

159
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:37,805
Scott: that kind of sucks.

160
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:47,715
Scott: And on the country road, there was one part that was slippery going down an incredibly steep hill, and my anti-lock brakes made it nothing.

161
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,465
Scott: So, and they didn't even engage the rest of the way home.

162
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:51,610
Scott: I just kind of coasted home.

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,284
Rym: I probably would have just, as I crested the hill, downshifted.

164
00:07:56,786 --> 00:08:00,770
Scott: Yeah, either way, I'm just saying, I had no problems going home at all.

165
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,340
Rym: It seems to me that people, when it comes to snow, when they're driving, can't take a rational, middle-of-the-ground approach.

166
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:18,269
Rym: It seems like everyone out there either goes faster for some reason, just as fast as they can possibly go, tailgating me, or they go five miles an hour.

167
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:24,027
Scott: It's like people are either driving, you know, they're like, "Oh, it's safe to drive," and they drive fast.

168
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,797
Scott: Or they go, "Oh, it's dangerous," and they drive too slow.

169
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,900
Rym: It's like, what the fuck?

170
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:31,634
Rym: I mean, first, I pass all these horrible accidents, and now I'm just on the taconic.

171
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,361
Rym: I'm going about 50.

172
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,370
Rym: The only reason I'm not speeding, the road is fine.

173
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,852
Rym: Absolutely fine.

174
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,378
Rym: It's just snowing a little bit.

175
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,549
Rym: The only reason I'm not speeding is because there's cops everywhere.

176
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,888
Scott: The road was worse when it was raining a week ago when there was fog.

177
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,170
Scott: Yeah.

178
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:49,330
Rym: So, eventually, traffic slows down in the traffic wave pattern.

179
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,790
Rym: So I get in the right lane, because everyone ahead of me seems to be getting in the right lane, and everyone seems to be slowing down a lot.

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,520
Rym: So I figure, all right, there's trouble ahead.

181
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,010
Rym: I'm just gonna, you know, do the smart thing.

182
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,622
Rym: So five minutes later, I just kind of zoned out listening to movies.

183
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,124
Rym: you should see.

184
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,650
Rym: I'm catching up on the archives.

185
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,749
Rym: I actually finally listened to the episode where we reviewed Attack the Gas Station on their show.

186
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,753
Scott: Oh, really?

187
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,250
Scott: See, I listened to the ones where we were on their show a long time ago.

188
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,481
Scott: Their episodes were not on the show that I had.

189
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,010
Rym: I gotta say, that was a long time ago.

190
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,298
Rym: We didn't do a very good review.

191
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:18,900
Scott: No, we didn't.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,124
Rym: We just kind of gushed.

193
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,569
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

194
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,404
Scott: We did the same thing for our City of God review also.

195
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,058
Rym: If they ever ask us to do it again, let's give them a real review.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,447
Scott: We'll have to prepare.

197
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:29,970
Scott: That sucks.

198
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,384
Rym: No, I think we just have to avoid saying things like, "This is without a doubt the greatest achievement in the history of

199
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:35,825
Rym: cinema."

200
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,342
Rym: Which we said more than once about Attack the Gas Station.

201
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,250
Scott: Well, we didn't lie at least.

202
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,190
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, so after about five minutes of this, I hit pause, and I think, "All right.

203
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,990
Rym: I've been going 30 miles an hour for five minutes in a line of cars in the right lane.

204
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,453
Rym: The left lane is empty.

205
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,201
Rym: I'm going to go for

206
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:56,341
Rym: it.".

207
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,330
Rym: So I pull into the left lane, and I accelerate back.

208
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,813
Scott: That's a big risk.

209
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,342
Scott: What if the left lane is closed ahead?

210
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:02,570
Scott: Now you're going to look like an ass.

211
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,417
Rym: Yeah, so I drive a lot.

212
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:06,661
Rym: I've driven this road a lot.

213
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,690
Rym: I drive hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles every single week.

214
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,580
Rym: So I think I've made a calculated risk here, and I start going.

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,222
Rym: I accelerate to 50.

216
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:16,971
Rym: I accelerate to 60.

217
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,600
Rym: I accelerate to 70.

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,270
Rym: I pass hundreds of cars.

219
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,170
Rym: Eventually, I get to the front, and there's no traffic anywhere.

220
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:36,970
Rym: These people are just so paranoid about this zero inches of snow and this light dusting that is slowly falling from the sky and quickly melting on the salt that they're driving 30 in the right lane of the Taconic during rush hour.

221
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,070
Scott: Don't they usually drive 90 in the left lane?

222
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,690
Rym: Yeah, I actually got home faster because of the snow because everyone got the hell out of my way and went to 30 miles an hour.

223
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:46,470
Rym: Awesome.

224
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:47,775
Rym: I don't know.

225
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:49,262
Rym: I couldn't fathom it.

226
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:50,610
Rym: I just kind of drove.

227
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,010
Scott: Maybe there was an accident, but you just waited so long while listening to movies.

228
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,804
Scott: You should see that when you got up there, the accident was cleared out.

229
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,050
Scott: You got there just at the perfect time.

230
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,290
Scott: The last police car was pulling away as you got there.

231
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:11,050
Rym: The thing is, I drove for a long time, and no one was in the left lane anywhere in that entire time, including all the way behind me, and no one thought to follow me.

232
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,550
Scott: My guess is that a lot of the people who were in the left lane assumed that there was an accident up ahead.

233
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,654
Rym: Well, no.

234
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:24,930
Rym: What I think it was, because there's a bunch of somewhat sharp corners around there, while there was no snow on the ground and traction was just fine.

235
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,247
Rym: In fact, I tested my traction by braking carefully around corners to see if I would start to lose control, and I didn't.

236
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,050
Rym: It was fine.

237
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,922
Rym: But because of the wind, it looked like there was a slick surface.

238
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:37,030
Rym: It looked like there was a lot of snow on the ground, but it wasn't.

239
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,629
Rym: It was just kind of swirling in the corners.

240
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,790
Rym: I think people were just afraid of having an accident, especially after having passed three fatal accidents just before that.

241
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,630
Scott: Yeah, I think it was a combination.

242
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,370
Rym: Of course, the best part is there was one accident blocking my area of traffic, not from the accident.

243
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:02,795
Rym: The accident was in the southbound lanes, but the car, which had crashed all by itself due to stupidity, had crashed into the guardrail.

244
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,077
Rym: Various bits of large debris had continued through the guardrail and blocked my side of the road.

245
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,250
Rym: There was a hood laying there and a fender.

246
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,859
Scott: Going pretty fast, wasn't he?

247
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,350
Scott: His hood flew off.

248
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:17,770
Rym: I don't know what he was doing.

249
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:27,710
Scott: I didn't even see an accident on the way home, but as soon as I got on the interstate, there was a short, about a half mile of slow traffic in both lanes.

250
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,578
Scott: An ambulance got on the highway.

251
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:39,037
Scott: It merged right into where I was sitting, so I just kind of stopped in the middle of the highway until the ambulance went away, down the highway in front of me.

252
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,927
Scott: I assumed, oh, there's an accident up ahead.

253
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,413
Scott: That ambulance is going to it, right?

254
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:48,215
Scott: Then eventually, I'm going down about a half mile, then traffic picks up again, and I'm on my way home.

255
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:54,360
Scott: Then eventually, I get to one of those cross-the-highway bits, and the ambulance is going to the other side of the road.

256
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,510
Scott: It was somewhere way behind me.

257
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,614
Scott: I wasn't even close to it.

258
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:05,790
Rym: Actually, one, you have to give right away, obviously, and you should give right away, but you don't have to stop for an ambulance on the freeway.

259
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:11,149
Scott: I was at this merge, and there was no way it was getting on unless I let it.

260
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,410
Scott: If I wanted to, I could have held the ambulance there and not let it go anywhere.

261
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,911
Rym: A few months ago, I was driving up the Bronx River Parkway, and there was an accident somewhere up ahead.

262
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,910
Rym: I'm in three lanes of traffic, completely balled up, stopped for like 10 minutes.

263
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,889
Rym: Eventually, I see a commotion way back, so I just get out of my car and look.

264
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,865
Rym: There's an ambulance trying to get to the scene of the accident, furiously.

265
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:43,109
Rym: The ambulance driver is obviously very pissed off and fervently trying to get through this crowd of cars, and all the cars in front of it are just sitting there like, "Where do you want me to go?

266
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,535
Rym: There's nowhere to move my car.

267
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:48,245
Rym: There is no way we can let you through.

268
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,510
Rym: What were you thinking?

269
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,308
Rym: Whoever you're coming to save is already

270
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:51,510
Rym: dead.".

271
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,959
Scott: The road is too narrow and full of cars.

272
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,063
Scott: That's it.

273
00:13:56,645 --> 00:14:00,990
Scott: If you're an ambulance guy, you should grab your little medical first aid kit and run.

274
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:02,926
Scott: That's what you should do.

275
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,055
Scott: I got a news here.

276
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:11,970
Scott: It said the headline is MySpace to Offer Spyware for Parents.

277
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,550
Scott: Now, you read that headline and you think, "All right, what is MySpace going to do?

278
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:28,310
Scott: They're going to give a program that even the stupidest parents can install that will let them see everything their kid is doing on MySpace, even the private stuff and everything, to make sure their kids aren't doing any nasties, right?

279
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:33,408
Rym: The first thing I thought was, "How can I gain the system in installing this for one of my

280
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:33,869
Rym: friends?".

281
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:34,694
Scott: Exactly.

282
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,490
Scott: However, that's not what they're doing.

283
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,270
Rym: What are they doing?

284
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:48,330
Scott: Parents who install the monitoring software on their home computers will be able to find out name, age, and location their children are using to represent themselves on MySpace.

285
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:50,288
Scott: That's it.

286
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,190
Rym: Can't you just look at their MySpace?

287
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:57,350
Scott: Oh, shit.

288
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,489
Rym: Does this cost money?

289
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:00,028
Scott: I have no idea.

290
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,076
Rym: I hope it costs money.

291
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,250
Rym: I hope this costs money, because that is a direct...

292
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:14,529
Scott: It's like, in order for this to work, you'd have to know your kid's MySpace username anyway, to type it in, to know what... The software has to figure out who to look for.

293
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,090
Scott: Maybe it could root through your cookies or something, but I doubt that highly.

294
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,170
Scott: This makes no sense.

295
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:36,270
Scott: It's basically, MySpace is doing nothing at all, and stupid parents see this nothing as if it's a move to help them out and make MySpace safer when it's actually nothing.

296
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:37,668
Rym: I'll bet I know what this is.

297
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:46,140
Scott: These stupid experts, all these expert people, they're like, "Ah, now the kids are gonna run away from MySpace because the parents can watch them on it.

298
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,497
Scott: They're gonna start using something else because kids are all fickle.

299
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:53,571
Scott: They'll just go to a different social network as soon as one starts to

300
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:53,872
Scott: suck.".

301
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,423
Scott: I'm like, "Dude, MySpace already sucks the most.

302
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,473
Scott: It doesn't get much worse than MySpace.

303
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,027
Scott: Anyone who hasn't pleaded already isn't

304
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:03,309
Scott: gonna.".

305
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,310
Rym: I think I know exactly what MySpace is doing.

306
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:14,855
Rym: By doing this, they can now say that, "We have implemented measures to protect children from predators.

307
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:19,234
Rym: It is now the parents' responsibility to make use of this tool that we have provided.

308
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:20,459
Rym: You have no excuse.

309
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,543
Rym: You can't sue us.

310
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:22,989
Rym: Nah nah nah nah nah nah.

311
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:24,583
Rym: Nah nah nah nah nah.

312
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:25,129
Rym: Goodbye.".

313
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,579
Scott: Well, kind of what it says here is a group of 33 state attorneys led by Connecticut's attorney, Blumenthal.

314
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,486
Scott: That guy's not so great.

315
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:32,869
Scott: I know him.

316
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:34,892
Rym: Who are the other 33?

317
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,450
Scott: Other state attorneys general.

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:36,973
Rym: Yeah, I know.

319
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:37,582
Rym: Which states?

320
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,130
Rym: Does it say?

321
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,574
Scott: No.

322
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,330
Rym: Because I want to know so we can tell people not to ever vote for them again.

323
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:42,550
Scott: Yeah.

324
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:51,171
Scott: They're thinking about taking legal action against MySpace if it doesn't raise the age limit to join the site to 16 from the current 14.

325
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,890
Rym: But the law says 14.

326
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:52,977
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:16:54,932 --> 00:17:01,695
Rym: Not to use such low language, but this is a phrase that I think applies perfectly and should be the response of MySpace.

328
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,760
Rym: Eat a dick.

329
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:04,750
Rym: Eat a dick.

330
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,011
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:14,650
Scott: It also says that they want MySpace to verify members' ages against public databases.

332
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,550
Scott: What?

333
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,638
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

334
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,230
Rym: I don't think anything needs to be said about that.

335
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,470
Scott: The answer is lawyers do not understand technology, and MySpace has done a double whammy.

336
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:33,196
Scott: These lawyers who don't understand technology causing MySpace some trouble because they don't understand technology.

337
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,522
Scott: So what does MySpace do?

338
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:35,266
Scott: They go, "Hey, wait.

339
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,998
Scott: These guys are giving us trouble because they don't understand technology.

340
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:42,758
Scott: Let's take advantage of the fact that they don't understand technology, and let's do

341
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,642
Scott: nothing.".

342
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:48,909
Scott: And because they don't understand technology, they'll think we did something, and they'll leave us alone.

343
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,687
Scott: It's brilliant.

344
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:51,833
Scott: It's brilliant.

345
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,039
Scott: It's, "Hey, look.

346
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,948
Scott: These dumbasses are causing us trouble because they're

347
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:55,430
Scott: dumbasses.".

348
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,181
Scott: Well, since they're dumbasses, it's not easy.

349
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,653
Scott: It's not too hard to fool them into going the fuck away.

350
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,229
Scott: And it looks like what's going to happen to me.

351
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,305
Rym: I think so.

352
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,392
Scott: So, yeah.

353
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:10,921
Scott: Anyone who saw this headline and didn't actually read the story, MySpace is doing nothing.

354
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:17,370
Scott: See, now- They're not giving your parents spyware to check your emails or anything.

355
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,274
Rym: This is actually one of the main reasons why I'm more and more seriously considering going to law school.

356
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:30,349
Rym: I'd probably be maybe one of, I don't know, 10 lawyers in the world who knows something about technology.

357
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:31,849
Rym: I don't know.

358
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,135
Rym: I mean, I have a BS.

359
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:35,667
Rym: I have a bachelor's of science in information technology.

360
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:36,270
Rym: I'm an expert.

361
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,213
Rym: I've worked in the industry.

362
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:41,409
Rym: If I was also a lawyer, I think I could do some good.

363
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,010
Rym: I think I could actually change something.

364
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:43,738
Scott: Maybe.

365
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:44,410
Scott: We'll see.

366
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,431
Rym: We'll see.

367
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:53,901
Rym: Also, I do find it interesting that GeekNights has a lot of strange or somewhat counterintuitive target demographics.

368
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,650
Rym: I mean, we're popular among Australians.

369
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,345
Scott: Yep.

370
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,257
Rym: Much more so than you'd think.

371
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,910
Scott: We have a not insignificant number- Well, I think podcasting in general is pretty big in Australia more so than you would think.

372
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,869
Scott: I don't know why, though.

373
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:07,350
Rym: I'll bet it has to do with- Because I don't know enough about Australia.

374
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,050
Rym: I'll bet some of it might have to do with access to other media.

375
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,030
Scott: Perhaps.

376
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,650
Rym: Because, you know, Australia always gets dicked when it comes to video games and DVDs.

377
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,773
Scott: That's true.

378
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,925
Scott: They do get stuff, but they do have Wii's there.

379
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:18,770
Scott: They got Wii games.

380
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:20,568
Rym: They don't get dicked as much as Europe does.

381
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:27,669
Scott: I think their proximity to Japan helps them a little bit, but I don't think they have the greatest selection of German board games in Australia.

382
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:31,161
Scott: I don't know.

383
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:31,548
Scott: They might.

384
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,690
Scott: They might, but I'm just guessing that they don't.

385
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,291
Rym: Yeah.

386
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:36,150
Rym: GeekNights is also very popular among atheists.

387
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:44,470
Rym: And GeekNights apparently is more popular than you might randomly assume among lawyers.

388
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,930
Rym: A not insignificant number of the people active in our forums are lawyers.

389
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:53,170
Scott: Which must mean that at least one person not active in our forums is also a lawyer.

390
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,969
Rym: Yeah, so if you're a lawyer and you're listening to this- Oh, he says it's a safe assumption.

391
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,929
Rym: Join the forums and there's other lawyers there.

392
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:00,893
Scott: Gasp.

393
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,330
Scott: Law-ing.

394
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,090
Rym: Well, the mayor mays, the lawyer lois.

395
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:06,674
Scott: Uh-huh.

396
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:07,689
Scott: That's right.

397
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,620
Rym: Things of the Day.

398
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,833
Scott: Oh, I found this I think last night maybe.

399
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:21,920
Scott: It's pretty good.

400
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,380
Rym: Yeah, Scott had another thing of the day and we're just about to start recording the show.

401
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,796
Rym: And I say, "Well, it's my

402
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:29,260
Rym: birthday.".

403
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,647
Rym: And then Scott says, "Oh, shits!

404
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,316
Rym: I gotta use this other thing of the day.

405
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:32,617
Rym: Start

406
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:32,838
Rym: over.".

407
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:33,519
Scott: Yep.

408
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,816
Rym: Even though that had nothing to do with- That's right.

409
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:54,180
Scott: As any real geek knows, if you were to watch Star Wars Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, if you were to watch the special edition, at the end, there's this big celebration where they show you all these cities around the galaxy and- And they play some jive music.

410
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,360
Scott: And there's this jive song going on, right?

411
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,660
Scott: Well, if you watch the original Star Wars Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, at the end, they don't show you cities around the galaxy.

412
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,400
Scott: All they show you is the Ewoks celebrating.

413
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,339
Scott: Everyone else who's celebrating, you don't see them.

414
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,080
Scott: And during that, they don't play no jive music.

415
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,378
Scott: They play the Ewok song.

416
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,292
Scott: Yub nub.

417
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,428
Rym: Okay, it's a pretty catchy song.

418
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,317
Scott: And I like it.

419
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,638
Scott: Even though a lot of people hate it, I like it.

420
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,500
Rym: The only reason I didn't play that song just now is that I don't want to get sued by George Lucas.

421
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,276
Scott: Yeah.

422
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,680
Scott: So, that is the song.

423
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,100
Scott: Now, how could I turn that song into a thing of the day?

424
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,659
Scott: I mean, it's just a song in a movie, you know, it's hard to-.

425
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
Rym: Well, maybe if someone made a music video to that song.

426
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,800
Scott: Ooh, that would be pretty good, but I don't know.

427
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Rym: Maybe someone took the new Star Wars and put that music over it.

428
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,120
Scott: Yeah, that wouldn't be so good.

429
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,859
Rym: That would just- Maybe if someone else performed that song, a cover, if you will.

430
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,780
Scott: Well, it just so happens that this song has been performed by a mediocre barbershop quartet.

431
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:10,980
Rym: Now, when he says barbershop quartet, he means it.

432
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,480
Rym: When he says mediocre, he fucking means it.

433
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,820
Scott: Yeah, there's a video on YouTube of these four guys.

434
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,739
Scott: That's what a quartet is, four guys.

435
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,639
Scott: And they're a barbershop quartet.

436
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:26,400
Scott: They're not a very good one, but they're better than no barbershop quartet at all, I guess.

437
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Rym: I think they get an A for effort and an A for concept, but a D for execution.

438
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,496
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you look at them and you say, "Well, okay, that guy with that beard, he's such a nerd, oh

439
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:35,858
Scott: god.".

440
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:37,958
Scott: Those other guys, yeah, they're pretty nerdy too.

441
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,960
Scott: And they sing Yub Nub, the Ewok celebration song.

442
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:46,400
Scott: And they have some subtitles so you can see what they mean, what the Ewok words mean.

443
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:48,015
Scott: What the fuck does Yub Nub mean?

444
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:48,339
Scott: I don't know.

445
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:50,900
Scott: The thing is, I don't know how they came up with these subtitles.

446
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,219
Scott: They must have gotten it from some Star Wars fan site because Ewok is not a language that you can speak.

447
00:22:56,741 --> 00:23:02,640
Scott: You can speak Klingon because nerds have figured out the whole language, but- Did George Lucas put out some official lyrics?

448
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,539
Scott: I don't know, but you cannot speak Ewok.

449
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:13,360
Scott: And a lot of times, I think they say like one word and then they say another word and both of those words translate to mean celebration.

450
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,059
Scott: So, I don't know what fucks up with that.

451
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,200
Rym: Well, obviously, they're different inflected tenses of the verb.

452
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:20,276
Scott: It could be.

453
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,680
Scott: I mean- It could be just a bad subtitle.

454
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,900
Scott: It could be just a Hong Kong subtitling.

455
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,740
Scott: I mean- We need to go get the legitimate region one DVD.

456
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,280
Rym: Because we can speak hut just fire, beach of a wookiee Chewbacca.

457
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:32,819
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

458
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,259
Scott: And I can speak Boba Fett real well too.

459
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:35,720
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:37,940
Rym: Or even Jawa.

461
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,074
Scott: I'm fluent, Boba Fett.

462
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:40,935
Scott: Oh dee dee.

463
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:42,014
Scott: Oh dee dee.

464
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,000
Scott: But yeah, you cannot speak Ewok.

465
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,040
Scott: That is not a fully fleshed out language.

466
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,600
Rym: So, my thing of the day is very much related to the topic at hand and to my news.

467
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,759
Rym: You see, all three of my things are in fact the same thing.

468
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,151
Scott: Snow.

469
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,600
Scott: Oh my god, is there a word for that when all three things match?

470
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,956
Rym: Well, you see- A trifecta?

471
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,537
Rym: The word used on Fark is trifecta, which apparently is a term from horse racing when a very specific thing happens.

472
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:12,902
Rym: But on Fark, a trifecta is when three stories that are far too related to be normally statistically probable, like

473
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:13,483
Scott: say

474
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:24,639
Rym: there are two stories of fat people exploding, then people start posting in the end of the second one, "Man, if there's a trifecta of this, I'm buying a lottery

475
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:24,800
Rym: ticket.".

476
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,618
Scott: I would too.

477
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,918
Rym: So I guess this is the first GeekNights trifecta.

478
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,979
Rym: Well, other than, I don't know, I guess every show is a geek trifecta.

479
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:32,858
Scott: I guess so.

480
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,958
Rym: Two of them in fact.

481
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:36,480
Scott: All right, but yeah.

482
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:52,597
Rym: I would never have used this as a thing of the day, and I'm using it only as a public service announcement and an educational bit to all of our listeners who do not live north of the Messier Line in the United States, because I don't think anyone else in the world does this.

483
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:59,539
Rym: At least not to the extent that Americans do, to the point that we have a word for it, a commonly understood and known word.

484
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:04,640
Rym: You see, a long time ago, I was hanging out with a friend of mine from down south.

485
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,540
Scott: Not even that far down south.

486
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:07,600
Scott: North Carolina.

487
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:08,679
Scott: Not that far at all.

488
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,479
Scott: Not that far south.

489
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,140
Rym: And for somehow, the conversation of donuts came up, and this person was entirely utterly confused as to what I meant.

490
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,279
Scott: They thought we were talking about Krispy Kremes and Dunkins.

491
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,920
Rym: And they wondered how Krispy Kremes and Dunkin' Donuts had anything to do with snow and cars.

492
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,340
Rym: What, do you get a warm donut and sit in the car while it's cold?

493
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,600
Rym: Is it a euphemism for something?

494
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,560
Rym: And I was flabbergasted.

495
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:42,420
Rym: I think I realized at that point that there are a lot of people out there, especially people who don't live in pretty much New York State, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.

496
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,519
Scott: Yeah, you know, it reminds me, one time I was at my grandparents' house in Florida, and I needed a haircut pretty badly.

497
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,619
Scott: So I went to just whatever the closest place was that could give a haircut, and I got a cheap, shitty haircut.

498
00:25:54,222 --> 00:26:00,039
Scott: But the person who cut my hair was like 40-something years old at the time, and this must have been years ago.

499
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,840
Scott: So they must be 50-something now, right?

500
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:07,660
Scott: And they said that they had never left Florida in their entire lives.

501
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:09,900
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:11,620
Rym: I can't fathom that.

503
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,660
Scott: No, I can't either.

504
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:13,919
Rym: I mean...

505
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,600
Scott: That have never left the state of Florida.

506
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,700
Rym: My wanderlust is enough to get that.

507
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,319
Rym: I would just die.

508
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,337
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,840
Scott: But it's probably never seen snow, ever.

510
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,159
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

511
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,957
Rym: Except in TV.

512
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,475
Scott: Yep.

513
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,207
Scott: So.

514
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:26,080
Rym: All right.

515
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:29,676
Scott: There's no... I can't expect that person to know what I mean when I say, "Do a

516
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:29,958
Scott: donut.".

517
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:46,280
Rym: So, a donut, which is... I mean, there are probably terms for this in other places that it's done, but to all of you in foreign countries, I don't think you quite understand, even Canada, the extent and the fervor which is put forth when it comes to donuts up here.

518
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:56,797
Scott: I mean, there are a lot of places in the world where donuts are done, but specifically in the Northeast US, I don't know about other places, but we're really intense about doing donuts.

519
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,480
Scott: College students and high school students in the Northeast United States love doing donuts, and they will do as many as they can.

520
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,538
Rym: Like in high school, right?

521
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,318
Rym: If I was in 10th grade, I got my car, 11th grade, whatever, anytime all through high school, I've got my car.

522
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:19,734
Rym: If it snowed and I had nothing else going on, I would probably just get in my car and drive over to the high school, which had a gigantic donut-shaped parking lot of all things.

523
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:23,980
Rym: And in this parking lot, I would proceed to make donuts.

524
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:33,960
Rym: Now, not only would I be doing this, but I could count, I could just expect at least 10 or 15 other cars to be in this parking lot doing the exact same thing.

525
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,600
Rym: There'd probably be one guy in the church parking lot across the street because he's afraid of getting hit by someone.

526
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,220
Rym: There'd probably be some kid doing it at the park in the grass on the ice.

527
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:48,440
Scott: It's kind of like, you know, if it snows, you go down to the golf course with your sled and what do you see?

528
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,799
Scott: A bunch of other kids with sleds.

529
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,940
Rym: Yeah, or you go down to the local pond and you all start ice skating.

530
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:57,080
Rym: Y'all go down to the local thing and start doing donuts.

531
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,579
Scott: Yep, that's what donuts are.

532
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,700
Rym: And pretty much it was either that or play hockey.

533
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:01,778
Rym: That's what we did.

534
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,255
Rym: Yep.

535
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:11,220
Rym: So a donut, very specifically, is when you get into your car and there's a slick ice covered or snow covered surface somewhere.

536
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,800
Scott: I guess you could do a donut when there is no ice, but you would have to be going very fast and it would be rather dangerous.

537
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:17,939
Rym: I wouldn't call it a donut.

538
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,940
Rym: So you get out of the parking lot.

539
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,676
Rym: Now, part of the reason that I think they're so pervasive in the U.S.

540
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,304
Rym: is to other places is that in the

541
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:25,686
Rym: U.S.,

542
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:29,438
Rym: especially in a lot of the places we've grown up or lived, everyone has a car.

543
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,600
Rym: Also, everyone has a parking lot.

544
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,600
Scott: And when it snows, those parking lots are empty and icy.

545
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:39,780
Rym: And they don't bother plowing the parking lot because people can just deal with it.

546
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,679
Rym: They usually plow it like on Monday for work.

547
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,900
Scott: But actually one that was like plowed recently, but then it's still snowing.

548
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,099
Scott: That's usually the best.

549
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,879
Scott: Yes, because if they plow it because it's got like a foot of snow and it's still snowing, you can go there when there's like half an inch.

550
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:54,640
Scott: That's perfect.

551
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,420
Rym: However, I think the best possible donut is when there's about two to three inches of snow and it can just be powder.

552
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,900
Rym: It has to be a little bit wet, but it can't be too wet.

553
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,520
Scott: But you got to be slippery.

554
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,940
Scott: It's the kind of snow where you get out of your car and fall on your ass if you weren't careful.

555
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,740
Rym: Yeah, but not the so cold that it's a solid sheet.

556
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,040
Scott: Yeah, solid sheet of ice.

557
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,716
Scott: You just kill yourself because you don't have enough friction to stop or get going.

558
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,438
Rym: You want snow that when you step on it, compact snow that would make good snowballs makes good donut snow.

559
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:36,860
Rym: So then what you do is you get into a large open area, which are very common in the United States in the Northeast in your car, and you proceed to start driving until you reach whatever speed you are comfortable with performing this maneuver.

560
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,479
Rym: Now, at this point, it depends on your exact car, your level of ambition and adventure and your skill.

561
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,080
Scott: And if your car is front or rear wheel drive.

562
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,700
Scott: Yes, all sorts of front or rear or mid engine.

563
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:56,599
Rym: But considering that most Americans have a two wheel drive, front wheel drive, automatic car in one of those cars, the front engine.

564
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,058
Rym: Yes, for the front engine.

565
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,379
Scott: I mean, you could have a rear engine front wheel drive.

566
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,199
Rym: I don't think anyone's ever made anything like that.

567
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,079
Scott: I think there does exist, but I don't know.

568
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,498
Rym: Maybe someone made one to say they made one.

569
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:11,800
Rym: That seems like a bad idea all around.

570
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,079
Scott: But that's not the point.

571
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,615
Rym: And what you do is you go in at a good clip, so say 30, 35, 40 miles an hour.

572
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:27,700
Rym: Then you turn your real a little bit to the right or a little bit to the left, depending on which direction has less stuff, just enough to start the car turning.

573
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:36,118
Rym: Now, obviously, at this point in a car like this, you're going to understeer, meaning your front tires are going to lose traction and your car will start to angle to the right or to the left.

574
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:40,420
Rym: But it will continue going mostly straight and the front tires are not grabbing at all.

575
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:44,658
Scott: It will go in the direction you were originally going and not in the direction you were trying to turn into.

576
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:52,179
Rym: At this point, you flip your car into neutral so you don't stall out and you simultaneously pull your parking brake.

577
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,060
Rym: Now, you don't hold the parking brake the whole time.

578
00:30:56,662 --> 00:31:03,100
Scott: You just pull it a little bit because pulling the parking brake, what it does is it takes your rear brakes and locks them.

579
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,819
Rym: Now, also, you do not want to do this if you have a Boolean parking brake, the one that's just on, off.

580
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,780
Rym: You only do this if you have a normal parking brake.

581
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,140
Rym: Usually you want the hand one.

582
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:22,779
Scott: Yeah, if your parking brake or your emergency brake or whatever you want to call it, it's a parking brake, is the kind where you pull a lever with your right with your hand, your hand brake, that's good.

583
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:30,080
Scott: If it's the kind where you push down this locking pedal, like on the left, like to the left of where the clutch would be, that's no good.

584
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,180
Rym: Now, you can do it without using the brake, but the brake will give you the most dramatic results with the least required skill or effort.

585
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,900
Scott: That is correct.

586
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:42,360
Rym: Your car will then proceed to spin any number of times while flying across the parking lot at high speed, eventually coming to a stop.

587
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:51,420
Scott: Yeah, because what's happened here is the initial turning, your front wheels have lost traction because they are trying to go in a direction, but the momentum is carrying you in a different direction.

588
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,917
Scott: Secondly, your rear wheels, which still have the traction, have now locked and those wheels will not spin.

589
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,440
Scott: Thus, your car will spin around in a circle with a little 360 creating a donut on the ice.

590
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,699
Rym: That's the basic, basic, basic donut.

591
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:11,840
Rym: If you want to be more advanced, obviously you can do really cool things.

592
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:18,880
Rym: It's kind of like Initial D, you can drift all around, you're not going to ruin your tires, you're not going to hit anything unless you're a complete consummate jackass.

593
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,098
Scott: Or dumbass.

594
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:20,716
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,760
Rym: Oh, God.

596
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,280
Rym: There was a friend of ours once, because in addition to donuts, I would often use my parking brake in snow.

597
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,138
Rym: It's something that, because I grew up in Michigan, if you live in a place where it snows a lot and you just have to drive in snow all the time, it snows and that can't stop you, you just have to go.

598
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,819
Rym: The parking brake is often useful to swing your car around a corner that you might not otherwise make due to your current speed.

599
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:55,780
Rym: So whenever I was dropping people off at the dorms on my way back to our apartment, I'd usually do that coming up to the area where I could let people out, because otherwise I'd have to go real freaking slow to get around that corner.

600
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,779
Rym: So I'd just go faster, pop it, come around, come to a stop, let them out.

601
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:09,018
Rym: One of our friends, while they were driving someone else home, because one time I drove them home and they saw me do this and they were a little bit impressed, probably more impressed than they should have been.

602
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:09,659
Scott: That's right.

603
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,660
Rym: Because a lot of people who go to RIT are not natives to cold places, so they can't understand what all these donut snow people are doing.

604
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,056
Scott: It's like, "What are you

605
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:18,198
Scott: doing?".

606
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:19,460
Scott: This is still the thing of the day.

607
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,096
Scott: Yeah, it is.

608
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:22,160
Rym: That's fine, because it's relevant.

609
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:22,700
Rym: It's pertinent.

610
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:33,459
Rym: So then he decides to do it one day with someone else in the car, and he comes around, he pops the parking brake, car slides and bump just right into the side of the building, just and stops.

611
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:36,740
Rym: Yeah.

612
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:48,020
Rym: But really, if you want to get advanced, instead of popping your car into neutral, you use the accelerator and use the wheel right to try to get a perfect slide or some counter steering, try to land on a target.

613
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:56,480
Scott: I think my goal, usually when doing donuts, the goal is to go as fast as you can safely and then do as many 360s as possible in place.

614
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:57,599
Scott: That's the goal.

615
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,580
Scott: My goal is almost always to do the- Because that provides the most thrills in the car.

616
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:04,700
Scott: Anyone else who's in the car with you, it's like an amusement park ride.

617
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:13,420
Rym: God, there were like four times at RIT where I took someone out who had never been on a donut run before, and I just took him out into a parking lot, and I did a donut.

618
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
Scott: Like a shitty donut too.

619
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:22,927
Rym: Just like a little like, because Scott was in with a couple times, and we'd just be like a little, like I'd maybe go like one 360, like a little, "Shit, it wasn't going more than 30 or 35 miles an

620
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:23,027
Rym: hour.".

621
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:27,000
Rym: And they'd totally freak out like I was going to kill him somehow.

622
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:35,300
Scott: I think what it is, is people feel those g-forces not too often, and when they do feel them, it's in an environment where they know they're safe, like a roller coaster or something.

623
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,599
Scott: So when you feel them in a car, which is a place where you never want to feel those kinds of g-forces, you freak out.

624
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:47,000
Scott: Now unless you're from the place where these are common- Unless you fee- Well, you know, if you do it twice, then you're used to it.

625
00:34:47,080 --> 00:35:00,380
Rym: I mean, the first time I ever did one, when I was in 10th grade, I didn't even have my driver's license yet, I had my learner's permit, I was so afraid I was going to hit something, and then I did one, and I didn't hit anything, and I did one again, and I realized that you can't hit anything unless you're a consummate jackass.

626
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:09,779
Scott: See, now I want to encourage people to do donuts, that way they'll be better to able handle their cars, like if they get into some serious snow traction situations in the snow, not on purpose.

627
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,740
Scott: However, is it illegal to do donuts or not?

628
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,580
Rym: You see, it depends.

629
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,420
Rym: If you're doing it on private property, it's not illegal unless you're trespassing.

630
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:23,920
Rym: They could get you for reckless driving if you did that on a public road, but you shouldn't be doing that on a public road anyway.

631
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,745
Scott: No, I think just don't do it where you know you're going to get in trouble for doing it.

632
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,217
Rym: RIT turned a straight up blind eye to it.

633
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,239
Rym: Well, I'm sure if Campus Safety was right there- Campus Safety was right there watching me one day.

634
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:40,080
Rym: I was just sitting there in his car, and I was doing donuts.

635
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:51,246
Rym: I didn't notice him at first because it was still snowing, so finally, in the middle of one of my runs, I look and I see this car, this Campus Safety guy sitting right there looking at me, and I just stop, and I sit there like, "Great, he's going to come do something to me,".

636
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:52,699
Rym: and he doesn't do anything.

637
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:01,396
Rym: So eventually, I build up a little bit of courage, I do another donut, and then eventually his lights come on and I think, "All right, now he's coming after me,".

638
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:07,520
Rym: and he drives off into this other parking lot, does a donut, and then drives away.

639
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:14,320
Rym: It was one of the most beautiful moments in my life, second only to when this jackass ran a- I keep saying jackass today.

640
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,359
Scott: Ran a stop sign- I had to say ass hat instead.

641
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,780
Rym: The guy passed me from behind over a double yellow and ran a stop sign.

642
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,260
Rym: He was then immediately pulled over, and I drove past him.

643
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,585
Rym: I was laughing so hard with the window down, and the cop looked up to me, and he gave kind of this smirk like,

644
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:30,787
Rym: "Yeah?".

645
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:34,207
Scott: "Lol.".

646
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we rely on cops a lot, but we don't dislike cops.

647
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Rym: We just dislike some of the uses of cops.

648
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:41,438
Scott: Yeah, and some cops.

649
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:42,454
Scott: All right, so.

650
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,339
Rym: So, my thing of the day- Oh, shit.

651
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:51,600
Rym: Is a video of someone at RIT in the donut parking lot.

652
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,960
Scott: Doing it in a Saturn.

653
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:54,999
Rym: I mean, D-Lot is well and good.

654
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,820
Rym: If you've never been to U-Lot.

655
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,420
Rym: And he does a pretty damn good donut.

656
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,720
Scott: Anyone but us got that reference.

657
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,780
Rym: Now, I will note that while the donut- the normal donut he does is really impressive.

658
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,620
Rym: The end of the video is doubly impressive.

659
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:17,260
Rym: I would give it a 20% chance that he faked the second half of the video with a clever cut and then having a guy laugh.

660
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,357
Scott: It could be.

661
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,640
Rym: However, I have known people.

662
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:21,879
Rym: I am not- I cannot do this.

663
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,740
Rym: I don't think Scott can do it.

664
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,838
Rym: I don't think anyone we know can do it.

665
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,640
Scott: I could do it if I practiced a bit.

666
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,375
Rym: Yeah, but I knew people in Michigan who could do donuts.

667
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,260
Rym: you wouldn't freaking believe.

668
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:33,440
Rym: They would have two cars and they'd go at each other like you're playing a game of chicken.

669
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,798
Rym: And then one would veer to the right and one would veer to the left and they'd like initial D past each other.

670
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,060
Rym: And that was like the common game and I never ever had the balls to try that.

671
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,560
Scott: I would never have the balls to try it either.

672
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,560
Scott: Unless it was a shit car and like a demolition derby of ICE.

673
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,457
Scott: Then I would do it.

674
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,700
Rym: Yeah, and yeah, I guess in that case.

675
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:55,196
Scott: Yeah, if it was like a demolition derby car with like the roll bar and a helmet and everything, I'd be up for it.

676
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,078
Scott: But not in my car.

677
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,540
Rym: Right, so the topic today is snow because it snowed today.

678
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:05,819
Scott: What is there to say about snow?

679
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,220
Scott: Let's see.

680
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,080
Scott: It's cold, it's wet, it falls from the sky.

681
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,159
Rym: It's made out of mostly water, but sometimes there's some acid in it.

682
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,759
Scott: A lot of people in the world don't deal with it.

683
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,479
Rym: A lot of people get a lot of it.

684
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:19,060
Scott: Sometimes it's good and sometimes it sucks.

685
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:21,340
Scott: It's pretty much like all weather.

686
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,080
Scott: It's like you want it and sometimes you gotta deal with it when it comes.

687
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,300
Rym: Yeah, and I think every part of the world, people just growing up have very different snow experiences.

688
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,500
Rym: We both grew up in somewhat similar climates.

689
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,535
Scott: Yeah, where I live it's got summer, spring, winter, and fall.

690
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:39,839
Scott: It's just like the climate is here right now.

691
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,859
Rym: Yeah, and contrary to popular belief, while it's really cold in the winter and it snows a lot in Michigan, it's really hot in the summer too.

692
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:56,579
Rym: So yeah, but I remember it seems like the older I got, like my joy from snow is inversely proportional to my age.

693
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,440
Rym: Because when I was young, no matter what, if it snowed it was a good day.

694
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,880
Scott: Snow was the best thing in the world as a kid for many reasons.

695
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:05,799
Scott: In my cancel school.

696
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,980
Scott: In my cancel school, in my delay school.

697
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,119
Rym: I went to a private Catholic school.

698
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,860
Rym: They would cancel school at the drop of a goddamn head.

699
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:21,798
Scott: In my younger years, they wouldn't cancel school so easily, but later as liability fears rose, they would cancel school over anything and that made everyone happy.

700
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,020
Scott: Except for the parents, well some parents.

701
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:35,477
Rym: See my high school never canceled school, and actually as I got older, especially when I lived in the suburbs, no one ever canceled school when it snowed unless there was freezing rain and they just expected you to drive in it.

702
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:39,177
Scott: Yeah, they always canceled school because buses and shit.

703
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:48,419
Rym: Yeah, well I think it's just a different, I mean I grew up in a place where if it snowed a foot, you weren't expected to alter your habits in any way and no one did.

704
00:39:50,261 --> 00:40:00,100
Scott: See the other reason snow was awesome as a kid is because it was sort of like this toy that you didn't know if you were going to get to play with it and just some days it would appear outside your house.

705
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,480
Scott: Like imagine if outside your house there was a swing set and most of the time you looked out the window and the swing set wasn't there.

706
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,200
Scott: It was just the summer, you look out the window, no swing set.

707
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:15,319
Scott: Then in the winter, on just a few random days for one part of the year, the swing set would appear.

708
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:18,039
Rym: Not just in your yard, but in all your friends' yards too.

709
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,480
Scott: Yeah, and in the streets and everywhere.

710
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,638
Scott: And that was the best times, building snow forts.

711
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,139
Rym: Snow igloos which always collapsed on me.

712
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,259
Scott: Yep, throwing snowballs, snow angels, snowmen.

713
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:32,819
Rym: Whitewashing as I got older.

714
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:34,160
Scott: Snow everything.

715
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,920
Rym: Every Bill Cosby stand up about snow.

716
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:41,420
Scott: Yeah, there was just so much shit to do with snow if you were a little kid.

717
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,000
Rym: God, I mean, I love sledding.

718
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,980
Rym: I still love sledding.

719
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,000
Rym: Sledding is one of my favorite things in the world.

720
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,360
Scott: Sledding is pretty damn good.

721
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,300
Rym: I haven't done it recently.

722
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,338
Rym: I wanted to.

723
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,539
Rym: In fact, I had decided to this year.

724
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,259
Rym: I had a sled picked out to buy and everything and it just hadn't come to be.

725
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,218
Rym: Rosebud.

726
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,660
Rym: But when it would snow, like my brother and I were serious about it.

727
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,400
Rym: When it snowed, we'd get together kind of like Calvin and Hobbs style.

728
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:12,760
Rym: And alright, this is what we're going to build out there in terms of sledding hills.

729
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,839
Rym: We'd always make sledding hills in our front and backyards.

730
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:23,660
Rym: We'd always make different, like in the front yard because the plows would pile up all that extra snow from the street into the front half of the front yard.

731
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:31,179
Rym: We'd take all that in addition to the driveway snow and the yard snow and make one really, really tall hill to sled off of.

732
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,519
Scott: Oh, see our backyard had a hill so we mostly sledded on that.

733
00:41:34,922 --> 00:41:44,980
Scott: But if you wanted to get some serious dangerous, possibly dangerous sledding, you could go to this one golf course where one of the holes just was like a big, big hill.

734
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:48,020
Scott: And you would just go right down this hill on your sled.

735
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,780
Scott: The thing is, if you went too fast and you didn't slow down or stop properly, there was a little hill.

736
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,660
Scott: There's like a bump at the end, sort of like a slip and slide.

737
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:55,838
Rym: No, wait.

738
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:58,539
Scott: The thing was that you were going straight for the road.

739
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:06,100
Scott: And I don't know if this is true, but I heard a story once that someone went down that hill full speed, hit the bump, went out into the road and got hit.

740
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,800
Scott: I don't know if that's true, but I guess it'd be, it would be pretty difficult if you've seen the area.

741
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,579
Scott: Like they would have to be going really fast.

742
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:21,160
Scott: But if someone did have a really fast sled and they were big enough and they got a running start, it could be possible.

743
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,419
Rym: If you had one of those cigarette style bullet sleds.

744
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,300
Scott: Yeah, it could be possible.

745
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,400
Scott: But just a story that they make about that hill to scare you from going to the fun hill.

746
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:32,099
Rym: It's kind of like going over the bar.

747
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,140
Scott: Exactly.

748
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:36,319
Rym: Even though a kid did go over the bar at my school and did break his neck.

749
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:36,787
Scott: Wow.

750
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,599
Rym: But he didn't go over the bar all the way so much as he went so high up that he just kind of fell right down out onto his neck.

751
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:43,731
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,478
Scott: Yeah, it sucks.

753
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,820
Rym: Then he got beat up after he came back to school.

754
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,380
Rym: He was fine.

755
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,057
Rym: Just other than a broken neck, but he had to wear this huge horrible brace and some kids beat him up.

756
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:54,037
Scott: What the hell?

757
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,528
Rym: Yeah.

758
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:56,280
Rym: Anyway.

759
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,339
Scott: See, I grew up in... Getting hit by a car.

760
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,720
Rym: I grew up in Michigan.

761
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,340
Rym: There weren't hills anywhere.

762
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,378
Scott: Ah, true.

763
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,620
Rym: We didn't see anything ever.

764
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:10,820
Rym: So we had to make our own.

765
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:20,060
Rym: Now, as a result, we got really good at it and we learned that while the tall hill seemed like the best idea to a young kid, make a tall hill and go off the top of it.

766
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,919
Rym: You didn't go so fast.

767
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,520
Rym: What we realized, the ultimate way to sled in a flat front yard.

768
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:35,180
Rym: We made a bump about, I don't know, a little over knee high and we'd make it really, really compact and we'd pour some water over it and more snow overs.

769
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,379
Rym: It was this compact solid ice thing.

770
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:41,300
Rym: What you would do is you would run at it at full speed.

771
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,040
Scott: You'd hit the bump and get some air.

772
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,479
Rym: No, you'd run at it full speed just before you got to it.

773
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,459
Rym: You jump into the air, stick your sled under your knees and land on it.

774
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:55,439
Rym: You would go flying down three or four yards.

775
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:56,087
Scott: Oh.

776
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,680
Rym: And usually we'd put jumps or angles or beams or ice or something.

777
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
Rym: A lot of times we'd pull out a hose and make ice lanes.

778
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,639
Scott: Yeah, that's always a good plan.

779
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,420
Scott: You know, you can make like a little, what's it called?

780
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,859
Scott: The thing in Cool Runnings.

781
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,220
Scott: The toboggan run.

782
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,300
Scott: A bobsled action.

783
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,486
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:23,716
Scott: You pile up snow on two sides and then you compact the snow in between and then you just run for it and go right down the middle with your sled.

785
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,020
Scott: And if you put a turn or two in there, you can bank off the turns to pick up more speed.

786
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:30,858
Scott: That could be some good stuff.

787
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,520
Rym: See, we'd always make those kind of, they would just happen because we're sledding in the same place.

788
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,440
Rym: It kind of made a dip in the snow over time.

789
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,099
Scott: Yep, yep.

790
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,320
Scott: You didn't actually do it by hand.

791
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,920
Scott: That takes too long.

792
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:50,780
Rym: But oh, when I was a kid, I was a Cub Scout and right before I, you know, left the Cub Scouts and decided not to join the Boy Scouts because no offense, but it seemed really kind of nerdy and I didn't like any of those people.

793
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,560
Scott: Yeah, I also did the same thing.

794
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:56,959
Scott: I got like two Cub Scout things and no- I got all the way to Weebillows.

795
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:58,480
Scott: I didn't go to Weebillows.

796
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,200
Rym: I also got a pile of medals and pins and whatever.

797
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,100
Scott: I gave them the finger way before Weebillows.

798
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,519
Rym: I didn't get the religion pin.

799
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,920
Rym: Because that was before they kicked atheists out of the Cub Scouts.

800
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,419
Scott: I actually got that one for Jew.

801
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:10,339
Rym: Really?

802
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:11,799
Scott: I don't remember actually.

803
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,400
Scott: I had to go look at my little- I remember one of the-.

804
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:22,380
Scott: The thing was my mom was so like lazy about sewing those things on to the stupid shirt that like I had a whole mess of them that never got attached to anything.

805
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:23,899
Rym: That's so sad.

806
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,100
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

807
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,840
Rym: Yeah, my Pine Box Derby cars always sucked ass.

808
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,660
Scott: Yeah, I had one and it sucked ass, and I only did the Pine Box Derby once.

809
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,860
Scott: But in that one Pine Box Derby, I saw the kid who won and I realized the answer to winning.

810
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:42,380
Scott: And if I would have had another year, I would have won because I would have done it Formula One style.

811
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,300
Rym: I think we could do a show on Pine Box Derbies.

812
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:45,580
Scott: That's not a good idea.

813
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,435
Rym: If we also include CO2 cars.

814
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:48,932
Scott: Ah, CO2 cars.

815
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:51,100
Rym: I think the two combined will be a good show.

816
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,700
Rym: But anyway- So we went to this huge Boy Scout camp in the middle of nowhere.

817
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,277
Rym: And it actually was somewhat hilly there.

818
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:01,880
Rym: But it wasn't hilly like, you know, rolling hills.

819
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,779
Rym: It was hilly like dangerous hills in the woods.

820
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,040
Rym: So at our cabin, right next to it was not really a cliff, but a very sharp grade.

821
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,119
Rym: It looks like it was a drainage ditch and it was snow and ice.

822
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:19,200
Rym: And it formed what appeared to us as young, not so bright kids to be a perfect toboggan run.

823
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,660
Rym: However, at the bottom was a little bank of snow.

824
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,680
Rym: And the toboggan run kind of went to the right or to the left.

825
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,440
Rym: And there was a raised section in the middle.

826
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,899
Rym: And directly behind this raised section was a gigantic oak tree.

827
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:38,820
Rym: So we're all debating, will the bank push you out of the way before you hit it or not?

828
00:46:40,682 --> 00:46:44,085
Rym: So finally, one kid gets in a little saucer and he goes- A saucer?

829
00:46:44,186 --> 00:46:45,600
Scott: Oh shit, I wouldn't do it in a saucer.

830
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,358
Rym: Why, saucers are the crappiest of sleds.

831
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,080
Scott: No, you're not using the saucer properly then.

832
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,739
Rym: How do you use the saucer properly?

833
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,420
Scott: You got to make sure that you don't let yourself rotate in the saucer.

834
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:56,299
Rym: Oh, I'm well aware.

835
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,220
Rym: Saucers can't go nearly as fast as certain other kinds of sleds.

836
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,620
Scott: No, saucers can go fast.

837
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,240
Scott: What you have to do is you have to bend the sides up, right?

838
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,200
Scott: That way it does less-.

839
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,420
Rym: Oh, I'm well aware.

840
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:08,060
Rym: You can also steer by pulling one side up or the other side.

841
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,720
Scott: Or you can do the national lampoon style where you get the metal saucer and you polish it.

842
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,780
Rym: That doesn't actually work.

843
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:14,960
Scott: I know, but it's hilarious.

844
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,040
Rym: I was thinking, I was trying to come up with a way to reference that.

845
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:19,580
Scott: I just came out and said it because I knew.

846
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:21,860
Rym: I was going to reference it somehow and be all clever.

847
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,939
Rym: So he's going down and he's going straight for the tree.

848
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:28,038
Rym: And at the last second, because there's- He just jumps off.

849
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,460
Rym: No, because the snow goes up, it goes right toward it, and then it just kind of falls to the side and keeps going down the trail.

850
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:34,480
Rym: Oh, sweet.

851
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,651
Rym: So the next kid's like,

852
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:36,419
Rym: "Badasses!".

853
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:37,880
Rym: He just jumps down without even thinking.

854
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,399
Rym: Same thing, but he goes to the left.

855
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,860
Rym: And so we're saucering for a while and people are like, they figure out how to pick left or right and it's going okay.

856
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:49,879
Rym: Then a kid pulls out the toboggan and we're like, "All right, who's with

857
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,020
Rym: me?".

858
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:51,357
Rym: Not me.

859
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,360
Rym: So I got on, but I was at the back.

860
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,898
Rym: There were six people in front of me.

861
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:57,059
Scott: It's a big one.

862
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,680
Rym: Yeah, it was a big straight up wooden one with metal railings on it.

863
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,320
Scott: Oh, shits.

864
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:06,680
Scott: No, it was either plastic dish or it was plastic sled.

865
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,912
Scott: We didn't have no wooden ones.

866
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,700
Rym: The most dangerous sled are the ones that are about six feet long, about a foot wide.

867
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,000
Rym: They're made out of plastic.

868
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:19,700
Rym: Basically just a shallow piece of plastic and they have basically rifling along the bottom.

869
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,488
Scott: Yeah, that's dangerous.

870
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:25,060
Scott: Those things got- Remember when we went sledding with dinner trays?

871
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:25,920
Rym: That didn't end well.

872
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,520
Scott: No, it didn't.

873
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:27,620
Rym: No, that was awesome.

874
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:28,659
Scott: It was hilarious.

875
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,940
Rym: I watched a guy try to snowboard with a piece of cardboard.

876
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:32,749
Scott: Wow.

877
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,260
Rym: He met down a steep hill.

878
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,239
Rym: He made it about two feet and then he fell on his face.

879
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,259
Scott: At least did he attach it to his feet with strings?

880
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:40,017
Rym: You'd think that.

881
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:43,300
Rym: It basically just stopped and then he just fell.

882
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:45,819
Rym: This toboggan, I'm at the back of it.

883
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,300
Rym: I'm the seventh person and the lucky hobbit at the back.

884
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,240
Rym: I know this is not going to end well.

885
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,479
Rym: I've decided to be at the back because that way I have six airbags in front of me.

886
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:59,440
Rym: It's going down and they're like, "Yeah, we're going to make it.

887
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,166
Rym: We're going to make it,".

888
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:01,540
Rym: because they're all big tough boy scouts.

889
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,679
Rym: Now I'm a little young cub scout.

890
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,980
Scott: This thing is not going to turn.

891
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,959
Scott: It's how long?

892
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:07,139
Rym: This thing's going straight for the tree.

893
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:11,160
Rym: I bail about halfway down.

894
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,300
Scott: Bailing is something that you do in snow often, not just when it's in sledding.

895
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,639
Rym: Yeah, I bailed and rolled.

896
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:24,360
Rym: I saw that one other person bailed and at the last second I hear, "Oh shit," and it just goes right into the tree.

897
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:30,620
Rym: Just, "Fuck," and the back of the toboggan goes up and then back down and I just hear,

898
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:31,662
Rym: "Oh."

899
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:34,960
Rym: Right in the mean bean machine.

900
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,099
Rym: They were all hurt.

901
00:49:37,386 --> 00:49:38,260
Scott: As they deserved.

902
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:40,918
Rym: They totally deserved it.

903
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:46,439
Rym: Yeah, I think though in the front row crew, I'm really the only one who skis.

904
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,300
Scott: Yeah, I'm just sort of anti-skiing.

905
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:52,420
Scott: Like, I actually kind of like watching downhill skiing in the Olympics.

906
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,240
Scott: It's kind of cool and I like playing Ski Free for Windows 3.1.

907
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,916
Rym: I remember that.

908
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,119
Rym: The Yeti would get you again.

909
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,860
Scott: The Abominable Snowman.

910
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,739
Scott: Yeah, that was a good one.

911
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,379
Scott: I love that game.

912
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:07,759
Scott: But actually skiing, I've never done it and I don't plan to because I can get a lot more fun with a lot less danger.

913
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,760
Rym: Skiing is not that dangerous.

914
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:12,800
Scott: I'm not saying it is that dangerous, but it is dangerous.

915
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,360
Scott: See, the thing is- And there is the danger to fun ratio is not good enough.

916
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:19,739
Rym: I don't think you quite understand how fun it is.

917
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:22,419
Scott: I think I know how fun it would be for me.

918
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,057
Scott: Not so much.

919
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,020
Rym: Well, that's just because you have no leg strength.

920
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:26,800
Scott: I have plenty of leg strength.

921
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:27,373
Rym: We'll see.

922
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:37,059
Scott: But even if I, you know, it's like the amount of time to take that... If I tried to ski right now, I'd kind of suck at it and it wouldn't be fun.

923
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,580
Rym: Not because, honestly, the basics of skiing.

924
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,079
Rym: I mean, you saw that South Park.

925
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,500
Rym: French fries, pizza.

926
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,498
Rym: French, that's it.

927
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,600
Scott: But even so, you know, it would take me a while before I could actually ski anywhere fun.

928
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,200
Rym: It would take a lot of time.

929
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,060
Rym: That's not true at all.

930
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,160
Scott: And a lot of money and I might get hurt.

931
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,097
Rym: The first time I ever went skiing, it cost me 20 bucks for a lift ticket and 20 bucks to rent skis.

932
00:50:58,741 --> 00:50:59,759
Rym: I went over to the bunny hill.

933
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,580
Rym: Someone explained to me how to use the tow rope.

934
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:04,120
Rym: That's all I needed.

935
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:12,660
Rym: And they explained to me, I took a little 20-minute lesson where they taught me how to go faster, how to go slower, how to turn, and how to not impale myself.

936
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,259
Rym: Impaling yourself, you see, never hold a ski pole out in front of you.

937
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,160
Rym: Because if it, like, anywhere in front of your body, because if it catches, you have basically just planted a spear against the charge.

938
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,300
Rym: And you know that that does triple damage.

939
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,460
Scott: Oh man, I never thought about that one.

940
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,198
Rym: Neither did I. And the ski instructor was like, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't cross your skis, blah, blah, blah.

941
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,539
Rym: Crossing your skis totally sucks.

942
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,500
Scott: See, this thing, there's just too many things.

943
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:40,876
Scott: You know what?

944
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:42,199
Scott: I can go to a roller coaster.

945
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,160
Scott: It's faster, it's more fun, it's cheaper.

946
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,820
Scott: And I can ride it a bunch of times.

947
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,440
Scott: I don't need to learn anything.

948
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,339
Scott: I don't need to sit on some lift.

949
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:49,880
Scott: It's not cheap.

950
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,220
Scott: I don't need to wait in line.

951
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,740
Rym: To buy a ticket, to get on the dope-ass Disney train.

952
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,640
Scott: It's much cheaper and it's much less effort.

953
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:02,620
Rym: Meanwhile, at Roller Coaster Land, press A. Actually, I'm kind of considering the two of us should go.

954
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:03,798
Rym: Maybe we'll get anyone in on it.

955
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:11,060
Rym: Should just fly out to Ohio, go to Cedar Point, get all of our rollercoastering out of our system and be done with it forever.

956
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:12,460
Scott: Maybe that's a good idea.

957
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,260
Scott: Then we'll have to go to the Slitterbot and get all the water parking out.

958
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,800
Scott: The thing is, I kind of want to go to the water park more.

959
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:25,320
Rym: Well, I do too because I haven't been to a water park nearly so recently as I've ridden And I like water parks a lot more than I like roller coasters.

960
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,900
Rym: Yeah, well that's because you won't go on half the good roller coasters.

961
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,179
Scott: I just don't like the upside downy.

962
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,179
Rym: Yeah, I don't know why.

963
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,280
Rym: I think the upside downy is great as long as it's done well.

964
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:35,540
Rym: As long as it's all the special kinds of loops and not just a circle.

965
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:36,539
Scott: Uh, not a fan.

966
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,220
Rym: Yeah, but I like roller coasters, but I like skiing more.

967
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:47,239
Rym: The problem is I skied in school and I went to RIT and I didn't have any money anymore and no one I knew skied.

968
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:49,480
Rym: So I basically just gave up skiing.

969
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,493
Rym: And this year, now that I'm finally, I've settled somewhere.

970
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:53,820
Rym: generally, I have money.

971
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:54,698
Rym: I thought I'm going to ski.

972
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,100
Rym: I'm going to buy a bunch of equipment.

973
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:57,619
Rym: I'm going to go skiing.

974
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,980
Rym: And it hasn't fucking snowed until today.

975
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,597
Rym: Yeah.

976
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,720
Scott: Well, I guess they have places where they make snow.

977
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,180
Scott: Yeah, but there's some mountains that are high enough around here where there's snow, even though there isn't any on our front lawn.

978
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:09,499
Rym: Oh no.

979
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,716
Rym: Yeah.

980
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,458
Rym: There were places I could have gone to ski, but all the places that were really close and really cheap.

981
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:16,460
Rym: No, not so much.

982
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:17,759
Scott: There's a reason places are cheap.

983
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:23,039
Scott: You know, it's when the skiing sucks, they make the prices low because that way you can ski even though it sucks.

984
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,000
Scott: And then, you know, the prices are high.

985
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:26,679
Scott: That means there's good skiing going on.

986
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:35,579
Rym: Though a friend of mine from IBM, the one who was over the other day did point out to me that because the skiing season has been generally abysmal, I can pick up ski equipment real cheap.

987
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,040
Scott: Well, it's not real cheap.

988
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,199
Scott: It's relatively cheap.

989
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,279
Rym: No, that's real cheap.

990
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,900
Scott: No, I mean, it's relatively cheap for ski equipment.

991
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,680
Scott: On an absolute scale, ski equipment is still expensive.

992
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:51,074
Rym: Yeah, but I could outfit myself with everything I would need and high quality relative to my skill for about 500 bucks.

993
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,560
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

994
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,459
Rym: That's not bad at all.

995
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,040
Scott: Well, you know, it's still 500 bucks is a lot of money.

996
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,099
Scott: You could get a PS3, the low end one.

997
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:02,280
Scott: Couldn't get a real PS3 or get an Xbox 360 in a game.

998
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:08,940
Rym: You could buy for good ski equipment and go skiing for less than the cost of an iPhone.

999
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:09,974
Scott: All right.

1000
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:16,280
Rym: Yeah, but now that I'm older, I love snow still because I want to go skiing.

1001
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:24,180
Rym: I have snowball fights and everything, but most of the time all snow means is my commute is going to take longer because people don't know how to drive.

1002
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:31,299
Scott: Once you get out of high school and the snow, it generally just sucks because you've made enough snowmen in your life.

1003
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,240
Scott: Sleds are too small for your body most of the time, even though not always.

1004
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,680
Scott: Well, the other thing is skiing takes time and it's expensive.

1005
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,619
Scott: You can only do it on the weekend.

1006
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,300
Rym: When I went sledding again at RIT, I realized something important.

1007
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,073
Rym: When I was a little kid and I sledded, my body was resilient.

1008
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:48,060
Rym: I would just bounce off of things.

1009
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,019
Rym: Now, a lot of the things that I did as a kid would kill me, including many of these stunts I've tried to pull when sledding.

1010
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:53,379
Scott: Yep.

1011
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,940
Scott: You know, when you're a kid, you could just fall down in the snow, jump around.

1012
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,557
Scott: It was okay because you just bounced around as an adult.

1013
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,259
Scott: You fall down once you're done.

1014
00:55:01,906 --> 00:55:02,498
Scott: Oh, my hip.

1015
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:03,758
Scott: Oh, my ribs.

1016
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,170
Rym: Yeah, I'm 25 now.

1017
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,120
Rym: I'm a quarter of a century old.

1018
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:07,716
Rym: That's the end.

1019
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:09,097
Scott: It's very much the end.

1020
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,320
Scott: So, uh, yeah, as an adult, it's like, oh, great, it snowed.

1021
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,759
Scott: Now I have to clean off my car.

1022
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:14,420
Scott: Great.

1023
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,380
Scott: Now I can't go anywhere.

1024
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,557
Scott: It's way for my car to warm up.

1025
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,079
Rym: I will never complain about cleaning my car off again.

1026
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,719
Scott: Oh, I have to shuffle, you know, shovel the walkway.

1027
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:23,360
Rym: We don't have to shovel the rockway.

1028
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,540
Rym: We pay people to do that.

1029
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,640
Scott: I know, but you still have to do it indirectly.

1030
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:27,918
Rym: See, the thing is.

1031
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,120
Scott: It would be worse if we did have to shovel like most people do.

1032
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,540
Rym: I always used to like shoveling snow.

1033
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,740
Rym: And if we didn't have a service already, I would just shovel the snow because I like doing it.

1034
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:37,359
Rym: It's good exercise.

1035
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,619
Rym: I like being outside like that.

1036
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,900
Rym: And usually if I'm out there anyway in snow pants shoveling, I've got no excuse not to build a snowman or something since I'm already snowy.

1037
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:52,740
Scott: The thing is like with shoveling snow is a lot like mowing the lawn, you know, it's like before I mowed the lawn, I really wanted to mow the lawn.

1038
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,239
Scott: You know, like I thought mowing the lawn would be so fun.

1039
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,280
Scott: And then once you mow the lawn once, you know, it's fun to use the lawnmower.

1040
00:55:59,702 --> 00:56:02,240
Scott: But after that, there's no fun in it anymore.

1041
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,899
Scott: It's like, oh, great.

1042
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,599
Scott: This sucks.

1043
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,060
Scott: I walk around for an hour pushing this thing with a tractor.

1044
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,199
Scott: It's a little more fun.

1045
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,732
Rym: No, no.

1046
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,920
Rym: See, I actually even right up until I left, I always like mowing the lawn.

1047
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:17,079
Rym: The only reason I wouldn't want to mow the lawn is that to mow the back lawn, I'd first have to pick up the dog crap.

1048
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:19,799
Rym: And I never wanted to do that.

1049
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,660
Scott: See, I just I liked mowing the lawn maybe twice and then it was not fun anymore.

1050
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,660
Scott: The same thing with shoveling snow.

1051
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,519
Scott: See, I like mowing it.

1052
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,920
Scott: You know, if you had a new shovel, it would reinvigorate the joy of snow shoveling for a few minutes.

1053
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,778
Rym: Well, we have a new shovel.

1054
00:56:32,283 --> 00:56:32,434
Scott: I know.

1055
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,020
Scott: So you'd shovel for a few minutes.

1056
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,539
Scott: You'd be like, whee, a new shovel.

1057
00:56:35,781 --> 00:56:38,200
Scott: And then you'd be like, oh, yeah, shoveling snow sucks.

1058
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,880
Scott: Unless, well, I guess if it's a light snow, it's not so bad.

1059
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,620
Rym: No, heavier the better.

1060
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,020
Rym: I love just battling the elements like that.

1061
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,580
Scott: No, just it's like, yeah, it's great to battle the elements for the first battle.

1062
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:54,260
Scott: And then as soon as you win one battle and then you realize you have to fight that same exact battle 100 more times, it's just like, fuck this.

1063
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,798
Scott: I'm going inside.

1064
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,820
Rym: But remember, we lived in Rochester.

1065
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:03,660
Rym: We can never complain about cleaning off our cars again because here we have to clean our cars off maybe once every couple of weeks, even when a normal winter happens.

1066
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,620
Scott: And it's real easy to do it.

1067
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:09,080
Scott: I don't have to chip off a half an inch thick shield of ice from my front windshield.

1068
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:16,760
Rym: In Rochester, it would snow just enough to where you would have to scrape your car off every single night.

1069
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:18,720
Scott: Every snow, not every night.

1070
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:35,958
Scott: Every time you got in your car, you would drop, you would wake up, you'd get in your car, you'd go, you'd wake up, you clean off your car, you'd go to class, you would come back to your car in the parking lot, clean it off, drive home, go inside for 10 minutes, come outside, clean off the car.

1071
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,258
Rym: Double awesome.

1072
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:37,600
Scott: Yeah.

1073
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:48,799
Scott: My strategy whenever there was a perfect sheet of ice just covering the windows, which there often was, I would turn the car on, have the heat going full blast and all the defrosters and everything on all the time.

1074
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:57,560
Scott: And what eventually would happen is the ice, the part of the sheet of ice that was closest to the windows, the parts that were actually touching the windows of the car would melt.

1075
00:57:57,962 --> 00:58:00,059
Scott: And then I would just push the sheet of ice off the car.

1076
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:01,054
Scott: Just whoop.

1077
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:02,920
Scott: That was the great strategy of Scott.

1078
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:05,000
Scott: No chipping, no hacking, no scraping.

1079
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:05,798
Scott: That was the key.

1080
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,100
Scott: It still sucked because it took so long to wait for that shit to defrost.

1081
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:11,660
Scott: But it was fun when I pushed that device right onto the ground.

1082
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,300
Rym: I always used to love sheets of ice whenever I could get a hold of them.

1083
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,100
Rym: I always felt like I was breaking a giant plate glass window.

1084
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,599
Scott: Remember that dude with the recycle bin?

1085
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:27,080
Rym: Actually, one time, we'll end on this just because we've already gone way too long for an episode of this caliber.

1086
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,485
Rym: Yep.

1087
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:34,878
Rym: My mom had to wash her Jeep to get the salt off of it and the sand off of it so it wouldn't cause problems.

1088
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,039
Rym: And it was in the winter, but car washes are open in Michigan in the winter.

1089
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:47,019
Rym: So we go to the self-serve car wash and there is a sheet of ice about three to four inches thick covering both walls.

1090
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,115
Scott: Wow.

1091
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,220
Rym: So we wash the car and then we pull the car out.

1092
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,520
Rym: I go back in and I start doing something that's rather non-intelligent.

1093
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:57,159
Rym: I start poking at this wall.

1094
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:58,380
Scott: That's not a good idea.

1095
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,179
Scott: That sheet of ice is going to fall down on you.

1096
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:01,920
Rym: So I realized this right away.

1097
00:59:01,981 --> 00:59:02,920
Rym: So I back away from it.

1098
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,998
Rym: I take the power washer.

1099
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:06,439
Rym: I put some quarters in because I figured this is going to be worth it.

1100
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:07,080
Rym: Uh-oh.

1101
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:08,560
Rym: I set it to the strongest setting.

1102
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,880
Scott: This is not, it's gotta be on YouTube.

1103
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,059
Scott: Why didn't you have a camera with you?

1104
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,280
Rym: Because I was in high school.

1105
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:12,916
Scott: Dumbass.

1106
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:15,298
Rym: You wanted me to go find my, uh...

1107
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,620
Scott: You should have had the foresight to know that 10 years later, YouTube would be around.

1108
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,633
Rym: Yeah.

1109
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,439
Rym: Back then the idea of a video on the internet was crazy.

1110
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:24,337
Scott: Yep.

1111
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,399
Rym: So I set it to the wide spray.

1112
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:26,936
Rym: So I've got...

1113
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,519
Scott: Well, I guess real player might've been out.

1114
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:41,620
Rym: So I've got this basically hot sword of water and I proceed to cut the bottom of this ice sheet and eventually I hear creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, creak.

1115
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,320
Rym: And then the thing just goes, it starts to fall like the whole thing in one sheet.

1116
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,779
Rym: And then the top breaks off and it makes a tremendous mess.

1117
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:51,059
Scott: Awesome.

1118
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:52,560
Rym: And then we drove away.

1119
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,399
Rym: That pilot was there for another three or four weeks.

1120
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,049
Scott: Sweet.

1121
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,799
Scott: You should have done the other wall.

1122
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,279
Rym: I'd already lost interest.

1123
00:59:59,922 --> 01:00:00,616
Scott: Oh, that's too awesome.

1124
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,490
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1125
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,130
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1126
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:24,010

1127
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:30,189
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1128
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,329
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1129
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,910
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1130
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:40,870
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1131
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:49,369
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1132
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,930
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1133
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:58,470

1137
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,230
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1138
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,770
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
