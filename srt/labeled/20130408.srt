00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,790
Rym: So I go downstairs and of course You can't go out the front of the building because the streets all blocked off the service entrance.

31
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:54,921
Rym: So I just walked off the walk out the other Completely normal entrance on the other side of the building.

32
00:01:54,961 --> 00:02:01,390
Rym: that I guess no one is paying attention to of course And I did my business and by the time I came back everything's gone and I see a cop.

33
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,782
Rym: He's just kind of standing there and I'm like, so what was in the bag?

34
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:10,330
Rym: and he looks at me and he Smirks and he says and I quote two bricks.

35
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,436
Rym: Yeah, I'm like what he's like.

36
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:15,090
Rym: it was a bag with two fucking bricks in it.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,896
Rym: Here's like just bricks.

38
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:21,890
Rym: and he was like, well, there was a rolled-up newspaper too, but there wasn't anything in the newspaper.

39
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,770
Rym: So I was like, so why - he's like, I don't know.

40
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,875
Scott: How does a bag of two bricks in a newspaper even fucking And you know what?

41
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:32,222
Rym: It wasn't even in front of our building.

42
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:33,530
Rym: It was in front of the staples.

43
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,005
Rym: So I guess someone wanted to send a message to staples that they're not gonna take these bricks anymore.

44
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,149
Rym: I don't know.

45
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,921

Rym: say something cuz there's it's never something That's right.

47
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:49,101
Scott: If you see something shut the fuck up and save us all a lot of hassle.

Rym: All right, if you see like a guy You should probably tell someone here's the problem is it's yeah.

52
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,010
Scott: If you see something say something a bag laying in the street is not something that's it's the something part is the problem, right?

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,258
Scott: Yeah, if you see something say something but you know what.

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,366

Scott: Right something is Some dangerous shit.

59
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:39,630
Scott: a dude with a dangerous weapon who is not a military or police person, right?

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,666
Scott: That is a something.

61
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:49,877
Rym: well Something what about all those open carry states where there's those assholes walking around with like an ar-15 just openly just like yeah It's my right.

62
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,022
Rym: It's my right Cuz then you can't even say something about that.

63
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,590
Scott: That's not even something right.

64
00:03:54,711 --> 00:04:02,327
Scott: It's a difference between that guy just walking in the street with it slung over his back And a guy walking down the street amazing people going holding it, right?

65
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,210
Scott: It's like in Israel.

66
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:07,810
Scott: Yeah, everyone's fucking got ar-15s walking around everywhere right from military people.

67
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,790
Rym: If you sing really the hobo whitey song the shotgun then you might want to say something right.

68
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,378
Scott: You know, it's an Israeli walk down the street.

69
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,610
Scott: Everyone's got friggin m16s everywhere, right?

70
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,173
Scott: But you know what?

71
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,200
Scott: It's not something cuz.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,589
Scott: no one's holding them ready to shoot.

73
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,170
Scott: They just all got him on their back like it's you know, or an umbrella or something.

74
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,570
Rym: But that is not my opening bit.

75
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:32,410
Rym: My opening bit is that Amazon fucked up for me in a pretty amazing way.

76
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:38,064
Rym: Okay, it was a confluence of multiple fuck-ups that it I couldn't even use their automated like.

77
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,550
Rym: something's wrong with my order thing.

78
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,437
Rym: I had to talk to a human being.

79
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:45,990
Rym: Okay, and the human being had to investigate and then deal with it.

80
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,784
Scott: They usually just tell you to keep whatever they sent you if they fuck up.

81
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:52,120
Rym: Oh, well legally I'm still entitled to keep the thing they sent me.

82
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,578
Rym: that's true and I might cuz it's actually like $70 worth of Star Wars miniature game piece.

83
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,063
Scott: Maybe someone bought it for you as a present.

84
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:02,150
Rym: Yeah, I thought that that is not what happened.

85
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,330
Scott: Okay, so how could you get this game that we know about that is a nerdy thing sent to you?

86
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,874
Rym: So I got the Millennium Falcon.

87
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:12,370
Scott: that seems like too much of a coincidence for a nerdy thing to be said.

88
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:12,989
Rym: Yes, it does.

89
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:21,529
Rym: This is why I was confused and it took some research to be able to go to Amazon and say yo guys Here's what I think happened.

90
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:27,810
Rym: I've done the research deal with it because when I went to them the first time they were like says your package is delivered.

91
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,623
Rym: I'm like, yeah, that's why I'm trying to contact you it.

92
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,351
Rym: I don't have the items I ordered.

93
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:39,988
Rym: they're like, but it was delivered and I was like, well, you see not really but kind of.

94
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:42,519
Rym: so Yeah, so I got slave one first.

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,675
Rym: I was like did Matt Morgan or someone send me this Game?

96
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,965
Scott: if I wasn't playing netrunner, I'd be playing that game.

97
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,190
Rym: That's kind of shady shit.

98
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,665
Scott: I saw some guys play in that game at PAX East.

99
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,430
Scott: They look pretty good.

100
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,417
Rym: You imagine like, you know we could do.

101
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,258
Rym: we could find a friend who we know would get addicted to netrunner and just mail It to them just mammal corset.

102
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:04,239
Scott: Yeah, just be like start sending out corsets to everyone Yeah, and then they'll be stuck buying all the expansion.

103
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,710
Rym: So at first I was like, oh, I guess someone sent me this.

104
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,256
Rym: I wonder if it was Matt cuz.

105
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:10,942
Rym: he's the most into this of anyone.

106
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:15,156
Rym: I know who knows my address But it had like no note in it.

107
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:15,979
Rym: No nothing.

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,974
Scott: Usually there's a note on the white receipt that says yeah Nothing the gift and mess.

109
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:24,736
Rym: So I just set it on the table and ignored it and then like a week later It's like wait a minute.

110
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,030
Rym: I ordered something on Amazon that never arrived.

111
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,949
Scott: What did you order that never arrived ahem?

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,381
Rym: So what I ordered on Amazon that never was it netrunner cuz.

113
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,689
Scott: that's when the same company it actually was not.

114
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,034
Rym: that would have Made a lot more sense.

115
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:49,096
Rym: It was a completely unrelated order of the mosquito expansion For the hive the ladybug expansion for the hive nice a new Jimmy wallet cuz mine finally wore out and they don't seem to fucking Make him any solos in Amazon.

116
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,667
Rym: Yeah, you can't buy them from the Jimmy website anymore.

117
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:52,209
Rym: I think they're done.

118
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,070
Rym: Go to the Jimmy website.

119
00:06:54,433 --> 00:07:00,950
Rym: They list almost everything is out of stock And if you actually try to order the things they list as in stock, you just get shopping cart errors.

120
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:03,676
Rym: Store like it doesn't work.

121
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:07,086
Rym: I know I I called the Jimmy number and no one answered.

122
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,330
Rym: I went on Amazon.

123
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,754
Rym: I found one dude.

124
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,339
Scott: your shopping cart is empty.

125
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,482
Scott: It is not orderable.

126
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,508
Rym: Yeah, so there's no guy.

127
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,130
Rym: think they're gone.

128
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,812
Rym: I think it's done.

129
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:20,730
Rym: So that last Jimmy I tried to order two Jimmy's because I need one and I want.

130
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:22,536
Rym: You know, it's an aside.

131
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,630
Rym: but on Kickstarter, it seems like wallets are the most popular thing to kick start.

132
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,594
Rym: There's like a million.

133
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,699
Rym: I made a wall.

134
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,310
Scott: I guess my next wallets gonna be a kick-started one.

135
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:31,158

Rym: they all are better.

138
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:39,620
Rym: if I didn't know about the Jimmy They're pretty great compared to a normal wallet, but you know what?

139
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:40,664
Rym: I've had a Jimmy.

140
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,050

Rym: it holds the right number of cards.

146
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:56,105

147
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:59,336
Rym: that has exterior access Mmm, just for Metro car.

Scott: Yeah, that's what people do.

157
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:25,570
Rym: We'll go into a joint business venture with me paid entirely in stock is actually a website.

158
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:33,840
Scott: I don't know if it still exists But it's actually a pretty new website that comes close to my stack overflow of lawyers idea But not quite what it is.

159
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,070
Scott: Is it sort of all these lawyers?

160
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:40,570
Scott: It's almost like you know those websites you go to to hire tutors where they list like the qualifications and their hourly rate.

161
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,370
Scott: It's like that for lawyers.

162
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:50,787
Scott: you tell them where you are and what kind of lawyer you want and it shows you all these lawyers and all their rates like Hourly and people are like 20 minutes free, you know 30 bucks.

163
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:52,193
Rym: well our.

164
00:08:52,294 --> 00:09:07,461
Rym: after that I actually kind of am in the market as it well as GeekNights because Yamato SRL is escalating to the point that I might have to issue some full-on DMCA counter notifications at which point The only recourse they have is to actually sue us.

165
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,290
Scott: I mean, let me search my delicious for so anyway.

166
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:16,909
Rym: And I ordered a razor death adder black 3500 high-precision 3.5 G infrared gaming mouse.

167
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:18,574
Scott: What's wrong with the gaming mouse?

168
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,623
Rym: You have steel series X AI fucking broke.

169
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:22,585
Scott: How did it break?

170
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,290
Rym: I wore it the fuck out.

171
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,669
Scott: How could it be worn the fuck out?

172
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:37,051
Rym: Yeah, so the fire button does not a hundred percent reliably click anymore, which literally my counter strike Performance dropped off about 80%.

173
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,700
Rym: Like one day I was playing counter-strike and I just wasn't like.

174
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,732
Rym: my kill ratio was one to one instead of my like five To one.

175
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:45,530
Rym: I'm like, what the fuck I'm doing terribly.

176
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:49,730
Rym: So I go into a server where no one's there and I go to a wall and I go click click click click click.

177
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:53,091
Rym: And it went shoot shoot nothing shoot Mm-hmm.

178
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:59,974
Rym: So I did some testing and yeah, the fire button is unreliable now and the cord frayed the fuck up and I had to Fix it with tape.

179
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,570
Rym: So I'm never buying a steel series mouse again.

180
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,990
Scott: I'm pretty sure any mouse you get will have that happen.

181
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,576
Scott: If you know this war you seem to like breaking your things on purpose to have an excuse to buy replacements I bought a less good mouse.

182
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:16,790
Rym: I bought a cheaper less high-quality gamer mouse to replace this one.

183
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,250
Scott: So I found the lawyer website.

184
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:30,483
Scott: It's called lawn law Dingo and you can go there and get simple questions answered cheap and you can also browse lawyers to find a lawyer That is can help you with whatever your dingo eat your.

185
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,915
Scott: and the thing is, you know, normally it's like Who's gonna trust this website?

186
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:35,179
Scott: Well, it's not really the website.

187
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,604
Scott: You have to trust its lawyer, right?

188
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:46,439
Scott: And the thing is I sort of feel confident in this because any lawyer on here is a lawyer who is Internet II enough to put themselves on here and

189
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:54,114
Rym: also not doing well enough to where they have real Clients to such a degree that they don't they have time for this bullshit Meaning.

190
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:58,032
Rym: they'll probably actually work with me and they might be cool enough to talk to me Maybe.

191
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:03,112
Scott: but yeah, I mean, you know, you can't hurt yourself by just calling someone on the phone if you see them on the site Right.

192
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:04,064
Scott: What's the worst they can happen?

193
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:04,530
Scott: They're a fake.

194
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,240
Rym: They're a real lawyer.

195
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,148
Rym: they send you an invoice for the five minutes of their time at $900 an hour.

196
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,806
Scott: Anyway, so yeah law dingo, I guess try it out.

197
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:17,428
Scott: See how it works.

198
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,636
Scott: room You can review it for us.

199
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:29,596
Rym: I'm not at the point of lowering up yet, but I'm preparing to lawyer out because Usually when companies file stupid lawsuits on copyright the people About anything.

200
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:37,510
Rym: Yeah The people in the right usually don't have the ability to fight and I never fault someone who does not have the ability to fight.

201
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:44,929
Rym: Not fighting but whoa betide you come after me and Scott because we've got enough money and enough righteous indignation to burn.

202
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,790
Scott: Usually the way it works is it's like let's say someone sues me, right?

203
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,290
Scott: Well, I could win but if I win it'll cost me all my moneys to win and I'll basically lose even though I was.

204
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:08,550
Scott: If I lose, of course, I also lose a whole bunch, but if I just settle with them, I give them a little bit of money I don't die, but they get free money, but even if they're wrong, so the question to always ask is are you right?

205
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,772
Scott: That's right.

206
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:13,390
Scott: If I feel that I am right like if I'm wrong, I'll just admit I'm wrong, right?

207
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:29,201
Scott: But if I feel that I'm right, which I usually do because I'm not gonna do something I think is wrong I will set myself on fire to get justice and I hope one that threat will scare people away and Two and two it'll be fun.

208
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:37,555
Scott: I actually will set myself I will burn all my money and go bankrupt if you come after me, right and you're wrong Yeah, and I think you're wrong.

209
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:42,189
Scott: So watch out anyone trying to sue me because I will take it all the way.

210
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,839
Rym: So This package did not arrive, but it said delivered.

211
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:51,370
Rym: and I had this other mysterious package that arrived on the day.

212
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,737
Rym: They said that one was delivered.

213
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,470
Rym: So first I look and the tracking numbers match.

214
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,217
Rym: That's the crazy thing.

215
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,509
Scott: They probably just put the wrong label on the wrong box.

216
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,072
Rym: Yeah, they will.

217
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,086
Scott: so they see someone else out there who ordered his x-wing fate miniatures.

218
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:05,009
Rym: He's also a nerd.

219
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:14,350
Rym: But in that box was an invoice With the price and everything and it was more money than my other order for these Star Wars pieces.

220
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:17,030
Rym: Nice and a different order ID from my order.

221
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:25,485
Rym: I had to explain all of this information to Amazon so many times for them to finally be like, oh Like maybe we sent you the wrong package.

222
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:31,730
Rym: I was like, yes That's nice This order ID that or ID copy paste.

223
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,469
Scott: I guess you get to keep this and they're gonna send you the new.

224
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:38,470
Rym: well They're sending me a shipping label to send this back really interesting.

225
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,563
Rym: And they already gave me a refund for the order that they didn't send.

226
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,927
Scott: so you guys reorder that.

227
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:55,630
Rym: I have to reorder it Manually because they no longer have the ability to resend orders that fail apparently Mm-hmm because most of their art most of the things people order are from third-party resellers and not from them direct.

228
00:13:56,232 --> 00:14:00,789
Rym: Or it's them doing fulfillment and the order IDs change and it was a giant pain in the ass.

229
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:03,599
Rym: Thanks Amazon for fucking up and doing.

230
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,508
Rym: I actually really need this gaming mouse like I'm.

231
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:11,061
Scott: You know, I'm not a new mouse doing well in counter-strike.

232
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,306
Scott: I bought the logitech.

233
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,550
Scott: I bought a new mouse for work.

00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,949
Scott: I bought a new egg Logitech yeah new egg.

235
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,805

236
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,090
Scott: I don't like any weird mice.

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,143
Scott: I get these the default logitech mouse.

238

00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,718
Scott: the what's it called?

243
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:33,445
Rym: I don't like humps.

244
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:33,706
Rym: I like.

245
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:34,810
Rym: I basically like pucks.

246
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:36,536
Scott: You're crazy.

247
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,916
Rym: I also need a thumb button Anyway at home.

248
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:41,942

00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:47,404
Rym: I have the g something else I really like my steel series, but it wore out way too quick.

250
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:50,169
Rym: for how much money I spent on this fucker Whatever?

251
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,839
Scott: Okay, okay Let's do some newses, so what do you got?

252
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,608
Scott: so this is company called ario?

253
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,294
Scott: I don't know if anyone's heard of them.

254
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,658
Scott: We may have mentioned them before.

255
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:07,950
Scott: I actually there's a billboard for them right outside on the Not right outside the window, but over by the subway where the end sort of starts to turn.

256
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,294
Scott: It's like right in that area.

257
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:10,296
Rym: I guess I never noticed.

258
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:15,009
Scott: yeah, so what ario does is they set up TV antennas and catch oh?

259
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,113
Rym: Oh, okay.

260
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:17,715
Rym: I know who this.

261
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:26,486
Scott: they catch the over-the-air TV, and you can pay them money And they will send you over the internet the over-the-air TV that you should be getting.

262
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,670
Scott: so let's say you live in an apartment.

263
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,690
Scott: It's really hard to set up a good antenna, but you're in a space like your apartment is in, New York.

264
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:39,930
Scott: You're entitled to those free over-the-air channels that are the radio waves of which are penetrating your apartment, right?

265
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,080
Scott: You were supposed to be able to watch those for free legally.

266
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:45,910
Scott: so what ario does is they put up an antenna for you.

267
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:53,708
Scott: They catch the TV and Then they stream those TV stations over the internet to you for a small fee.

268
00:15:53,868 --> 00:16:01,850
Rym: now one I would argue not giving any money to the TV stations themselves, and you know what I am totally okay with that.

269
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,481
Scott: And the court is seems to also at.

270
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,570
Scott: the court case is obviously far from over.

271
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:09,339
Scott: Yeah But so far ario is winning.

272
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:20,728
Rym: what I've read from brief summaries of this is that it Part of this is hinging around the fact that Fox Can't prove any harm to them because they're giving it away for free.

273
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:26,910
Scott: another thing He was judge also pointed out how you know they're not letting people watch TV stations from far away.

274
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,211
Scott: It's all.

275
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:33,010
Scott: you only get the ones that would be available in the spot that you live yeah, and you only get it for you.

276
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,713
Scott: It's not like.

277
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:39,421
Scott: you know you can do it, and then you know have people all crazy places You know start watching you can with a sling boxers.

278
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,817
Scott: I'm just saying right because I Know that's not the point right.

279
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:45,910
Scott: so the judge is like yeah, I see nothing wrong with this right.

280
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:58,172
Rym: This is just an extension of the recent Re-emergence of the weird debate over Whether or not it's okay to block ads on the internet right the same thing It's no.

281
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:09,332
Rym: once you in my opinion if you provide content in a way That is actually free and available then people have the right to consume that content however They wish.

282
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:12,963
Scott: well, we're gonna get back to that in a second with my second news right, but anyway.

283
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:15,089
Scott: so the area news number one.

284
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,531
Scott: You got two.

285
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,238
Scott: area news isn't in the second news.

286
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:21,048
Scott: yeah, so area news number one is that they're winning in court.

287
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:27,068
Scott: area News number two is that Fox in response to the fact that they realized they were losing this is this is rich?

288
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:36,270
Scott: Yeah, they said all right if we lose an area keeps operating We're just gonna stop broadcasting over the air and we'll go cable only with Fox.

289
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:40,207
Scott: And you know I have to say to that awesome go for it right.

290
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,503
Scott: yeah Because the Super Bowl is really gonna want to be broadcast on it.

291
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,050
Scott: You know it's only people with cable.

292
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:50,729
Scott: They're gonna know the NFL is not going to allow you to broadcast football games only on cable.

293
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,291
Rym: five I think it'll.

294
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:52,093
Rym: actually I don't.

295
00:17:52,875 --> 00:18:03,834
Rym: I'm hoping more and more that these companies that are so mad about anything related to internet distribution Actually do wall themselves off Just like all these news sites that are bit by bit Hiding behind paywalls.

296
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,763
Scott: cuz actually the news sites are starting to come out of the paywall.

297
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,388
Rym: a few of them are doubling down.

298
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,030
Scott: I'm sure.

299
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:11,500
Scott: But yeah, it's kind of weird there.

300
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,767
Scott: You know they're all trying different stuff.

301
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,230
Scott: They're all dumb.

302
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,250
Rym: Well the other thing is that the the area of business model?

303
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,414
Rym: I'm not a lawyer.

304
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,539
Rym: I am NOT a business analyst.

305
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,350
Rym: This is a pure raw opinion, so don't come suing me for anything.

306
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:29,507
Rym: I think it's the same basic business model as crunchyroll was originally.

307
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:30,210
Rym: in my opinion.

308
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:32,520
Rym: You know what this may or may not be legal.

309
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:33,565
Rym: who gives a fuck?

310
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:34,770
Rym: we're gonna do it anyway.

311
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:38,827
Rym: We're a fight the lawsuits and we'll probably win and get a pile of money in the end.

312
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:39,530
Scott: There's a guy.

313
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,984
Scott: I don't I'm not sure where he is it, but he's basically.

314
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:51,630
Scott: he's got a dish and He is rebroadcasting all the Mets games this year every single one right and he's basically adding value right to this number one.

315
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,922
Scott: His stream is the best illegal sports stream.

316
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,410
Scott: I've ever seen in terms of quality.

317
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,830
Scott: It's ultra HD, and it doesn't lag at all ever - he's keeping it sort of private like I found out about it.

318
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,629
Scott: so it's not that private, but he's pretty much keeping it with like a small group of Mets fans and He's building a community around it.

319
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:17,707
Scott: So it's like when I when you go to this thing and I did it at work once when there was a day game last Week there's a chat room and everyone's chatting and there's maybe only 50 people watching.

320
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:20,937
Scott: right and you're all watching this thing together.

321
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:26,498
Scott: and when a commercial comes on he pushes a button to cover up the commercial and Show you like scores from around.

322
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:26,920
Scott: that you know.

323
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,562
Scott: and it's like because he's a fan of the same team as you Right not just some European guy rebroadcasting to make money on ads.

324
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:36,150
Scott: He's just doing it out of the goodness, right?

325
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,488
Scott: You know he's like.

326
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,514
Scott: You know showing he's flipping to the games that like a Mets fan would care to see that aren't the Mets game And he's.

327
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:43,896
Scott: you know it's.

328
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:45,384
Scott: it's pretty much the awesomest.

329
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:49,621
Scott: so I Hope more shit like this happens, and you know what.

330
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,952
Scott: this is what the baseball people should be doing But they're not.

331
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:52,715
Scott: they block.

332
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,870
Scott: you know if I pay for MLB TV, which is actually not that expensive, right?

333
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,638
Scott: I Can only watch out-of-market games.

334
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:04,683
Scott: so if I'm in New York they don't let me watch the team I actually give a shit about.

335
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,602
Scott: it's like yeah I'm not paying you any money for those other fucking teams.

336
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,386
Scott: who gives a fuck.

337
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:11,535
Scott: I don't want to watch Marlin's friggin Giants.

338
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:12,559
Scott: fuck that shit right.

339
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,230
Scott: I would give you that money if you only showed me the Mets game.

340
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,619
Scott: Yeah, but since those the only ones you don't show me.

341
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,310
Scott: I guess you don't show me Yankees games either, but fuck those right.

342
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:25,677
Scott: I'm paying you nothing and I'm gonna watch this illegal stream guy Who's also providing a happy community to watch with.

343
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,904
Scott: you could do that, but you didn't.

344
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:29,228
Scott: but you didn't I?

345
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,310
Rym: Would pay and watch a lot of hockey if it was easier to watch hockey.

346
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:40,102
Scott: Anyway news number two which relates to your point about ad blocking.

347
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:44,860
Scott: right there are two incidents that have happened recently That are interesting.

348
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:53,110
Scott: now with ad blocking Some website some server sends HTMLs to you, and then you're with your web browser.

349
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,009
Scott: You decide what to do with those HTML.

350
00:20:55,331 --> 00:21:01,430
Rym: I mean in the old days like not everyone could display images some blind people have things transmitted in a different way, right?

351
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:11,298
Scott: what if your ISP were to set up some sort of squid proxy server and Modify the HTMLs on their way to you?

352
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:14,105
Scott: is that okay now?

353
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:22,810
Rym: I would argue no Because I am paying for direct access to the internet to connect to people that I want to connect to directly.

354
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,762
Scott: So there are two instances.

355
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:29,842
Rym: instance number one I can name a lot more instances going back about a decade right now.

356
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:33,788
Scott: instance number one is the not so bad instance But still troubling.

357
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:43,203
Scott: Comcast has done a thing recently where if you're hitting near your bandwidth limit They'll basically insert a JavaScript a really shitty one into every page you visit.

358
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:53,241
Scott: that will pop up a bandwidth limit Warning that tells you how much you have left and that you should stop internetting right, so That's not really the worst in the world.

359
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,870
Rym: Yeah, I'm still not okay with it.

360
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,351
Rym: Obviously it can be handled well you'd be.

361
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,055
Rym: it's rare for me to say something like this.

362
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:16,868
Rym: that is better handled by a text message or a phone call an application That will give you notifications on your computer if you should yeah, if you shouldn't have to install that yeah Call you or whatever or they should have reasonable prices and bandwidth policy.

363
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:17,630
Scott: that's also true.

364
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,505
Scott: Anyway, I digress but yeah, okay.

365
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:25,770
Scott: number two There's apparently some small-ass ISP out in the middle of fuck nowhere and what they're doing is evil.

366
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:33,062
Rym: They are inserting ads into major websites that don't belong there And that has happened so many times in the history of the internet.

367
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,390
Scott: right and the company that does the ads Hasn't commented and it's shady shady shady.

368
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:42,848
Scott: So it's they have screenshots like going to apple.com and there it is right at the bottom apple.com.

369
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:45,636
Rym: fuck them Something else.

370
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,750
Rym: the FCC destroys them and someone goes to jail.

371
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:49,582
Scott: I don't know if the FCC would go after them.

372
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,670
Scott: the guy called the FCC.

373
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:52,942
Scott: They say they call the FTC.

374
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:54,028
Rym: I was gonna say so.

375
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,510
Scott: There's at least one guy who noticed this on his parents computers.

376
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,305
Scott: He did all sorts of tests like SSL.

377
00:22:59,325 --> 00:22:59,930
Scott: it doesn't show up.

378
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,930
Scott: That'd be like if my only age only shows up on major websites.

379
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:07,725
Rym: Cable network was distributing the Super Bowl and when the Super Bowl ads came up.

380
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,190
Rym: I showed my own ads.

381
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:13,270
Scott: Well, I mean they do have some spots that are for the local cable channel.

382
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,230
Rym: They do but that would be like if I was putting ads in other places, right?

383
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,287
Rym: so That's all fun.

384
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,665
Scott: Yeah, really interesting stuff there.

385
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:25,089
Scott: So Yeah, what do you have for news?

386
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,042
Rym: so what I want to talk about?

387
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:33,110
Rym: because I I Realized that the Streisand effect people use that term a lot on the internet.

388
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:36,770
Scott: I was gonna use it for an April Fool's Day episode of GeekNights, but our episode wasn't on.

389
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,666
Rym: Hopefully we'll remember in a year or so, whatever.

390
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:39,747
Scott: but

391
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:56,084
Rym: So I want to bring this up because this is such an amazing example of the Streisand effect and it also Reiterates something that I've talked about a lot on GeekNights that for all we complain about the United States We still pretty much even with a lot of our terrible copyright stuff that

392
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:56,786
Scott: keeps getting worse

393
00:23:57,147 --> 00:24:01,139
Rym: have the freest Internet and free speech on the entire.

394
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,202
Scott: is that the slowest?

395
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:05,612
Scott: if we also had the fastest things would be Average.

396
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,515
Rym: we have the slowest.

397
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,000
Rym: I mean there there.

398
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,565
Scott: I don't have this one of the slowest.

399
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:14,029
Scott: we just have slow compared to other countries That are equal to us.

400
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:21,666
Rym: At the same time if you ignore all of our rural areas and small markets and only look at our big markets We're in we're near the top.

401
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:25,462
Scott: We're not No free in like in Netherlands.

402
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:27,130
Scott: they have gigabit, right?

403
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,882
Rym: But that bandwidth does not translate to the rest of the world.

404
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:38,170
Rym: when they connect to things further away Like in the United States, they have a lot less bandwidth and a lot of content is still in the u.s.

405
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,644
Scott: Korean's got it pretty fast.

406
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:43,138
Scott: I think a lot Many megabits per person.

407
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:47,919
Rym: They have a lot more local content than Scandinavia Japan a little faster than us.

408
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,030
Scott: I think right many megabits wirelessly, right?

409
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:54,749
Rym: But at the same time it really depends on where you look because there are neighborhoods in the?

410
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:54,910
Rym: u.s.

411
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,130
Scott: Japan and extremely fast internet and Japanese don't need area because their mobile phones can watch broadcast over-the-air television.

412
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,839
Rym: That's the separate thing all together.

413
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:12,889
Rym: I'm just saying but anyway this is some harsh shit and I already wasn't super happy with the government of France, but this goes to a new level.

414
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,838
Scott: I never had with the government of France.

415
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:31,850
Rym: what the some of the French government basically Contacted a random Wikipedia admin and their criteria Apparently for choosing this Wikipedia admin was they were able to identify the person's real name and address and that person lived in France.

416
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:38,070
Scott: Okay, so they found the only Wikipedia admin with publicly available information who lives in France.

417
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:47,708
Rym: And what they did is they basically took that person in and said delete this article about this military base in France or we will arrest you.

418
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,987
Scott: So why that you know, they could have just deleted that article themselves.

419
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:53,730
Scott: It's Wikipedia.

420
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:58,368
Rym: Um, I think the article had been deleted and it was reinstated because that's how it goes.

421
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,737
Scott: It's called the tough shit rule.

422
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:10,586
Scott: this admin apparently tried to explain to them The futility of this never mind the fact that this I would have been like, okay, I'll delete it Push the delete button and go home.

423
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:16,609
Scott: So basically that's what they did in the end and and then of course it comes back in five minutes later came back.

424
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:23,390
Rym: And now that is one of the most translated Wikipedia articles in the world.

425
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:28,430
Rym: Yeah It is now in the English Wikipedia instead of just the French specific one.

426
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:32,060
Rym: This military base is now a tourist destination.

427
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:35,529
Rym: nerds have been showing up and taking as many pictures of it as they can.

428
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,540
Rym: People everyone is talking about.

429
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,529
Scott: this must be something going on there.

430
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:45,429
Rym: You may not be old enough to remember who Barbra Streisand is.

431
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:51,206
Rym: Park then, you know, uh, that's some pretty old South Park.

432
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,650
Scott: Meka Streisand is old Meka Streisand.

433
00:26:53,911 --> 00:27:00,130
Rym: I would bet that at least a third of the kids who saw that episode have no idea what that's referencing.

434
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:06,166
Scott: I I'm pretty sure that Barbra's I mean, I don't know famous people Scott, but I know Barbra Streisand is.

435
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:08,688
Rym: we're 30.

436
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:16,107
Rym: I Know for a fact based on a conversation I had at anime Boston two years ago that a lot of kids have never even heard of.

437
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:19,542
Scott: like Celine Dion That's that Canadian lady who's in Vegas.

438
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:20,710
Scott: Even I know who that is.

439
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,953
Scott: Yeah Even I know who.

440
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:23,499
Scott: that is not on who people are Scott.

441
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,349
Rym: the internet today was abounding with people who?

442
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,850
Rym: Hated or loved Margaret Thatcher, but don't seem to actually know who she was.

443
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:31,694
Scott: Well, that's just people.

444
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:43,024
Scott: when I noticed when people don't know something and that the first thing they read about it on the internet is Everything is suddenly You know law and they'll defend whatever that first thing they read was like dude breed.

445
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:44,690
Rym: Bard really isn't the best place to go.

446
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,030
Scott: It's like maybe one of our listeners right doesn't know who Barbra Streisand is.

447
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,070
Scott: So if we say she's good, they'll say she's good and that'll be what they believe forever.

448
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,119
Scott: And if we say she's bad, then that'll be what they believe.

449
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,370
Rym: So guys Barbra Streisand is important for one reason.

450
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,516
Scott: She you'll get that South Park joke.

451
00:27:58,536 --> 00:27:59,438
Scott: That's the important reason.

452
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:03,950
Rym: there were pictures that she wanted not on the internet and not in newspapers.

453
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:08,965
Rym: No one gave a shit about those pictures until she started trying to sue people to get them taken down.

454
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:12,677
Rym: then the entire World cared about those photographs.

455
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:17,210
Scott: Yeah, cuz as soon as you say take those down everyone's like, oh someone wants the pictures taken down.

456
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,009
Scott: I wonder what's in those pictures?

457
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,078
Rym: Doesn't want this picture.

458
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:32,674
Scott: My curiosity is exploding suddenly And also even if my curiosity is not exploding my contempt and my desire for free Information is exploding.

459
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:47,248
Scott: So guys fight you I will spread them even though I don't give a fuck in this day and age in the year 2013 the Streisand effect is more powerful and you can possibly imagine Possibly you try to strike something down.

460
00:28:48,895 --> 00:29:05,649
Rym: In fact I would bet that there are a number of times where people try to invoke the Streisand effect in a false flag against themselves Because there is no sure way to get the entire world at least the industrialized world to talk about something Than to tell them not to talk about it.

461
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,787
Rym: That's right, and the internet is making this so easy and so awesome.

462
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:17,630
Rym: So France seriously, I Words cannot describe the contempt I have for the people who decided that this was a good idea.

463
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:26,300
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

464
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:32,954
Scott: so Ahem there's a guy and you know, there are many geekeries and on GeekNights.

465
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:34,660
Scott: We celebrate all the geekeries.

466
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:42,641
Scott: there's this dude named I guess George Sprave, at least that's the name of his YouTube account and his geekery is Slingshots.

467
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:44,888
Scott: he runs the slingshot channel.

468
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,593
Scott: slingshots are his thing.

469
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:56,279
Scott: That is an awesome thing to be the geek of power to this guy so Separately from the slingshot channel, which could be a thing in the day of itself.

470
00:29:57,102 --> 00:30:01,418
Scott: Bill and Melinda Gates have put forth the condom challenge.

471
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:06,900
Rym: basically They think that condoms suck, you know, there's a frat boy condom challenge.

472
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,111
Rym: That is a is probably not not that kind of condom challenge.

473
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,600
Rym: that challenge is how many condoms can you put on right?

474
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,780
Scott: They're basically saying condoms are flawed, you know, they're they're clumsy.

475
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:29,680
Rym: I didn't read a star in a research paper many years ago that basically said that condoms are like 99.9% effective if used properly, but they're actually only like 70% effective because people just can't fucking figure them exactly.

476
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:35,080
Scott: So, you know Bill Gates is like, hey, I'll give you a hundred thousand US dollars if you can improve condoms.

477
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:37,208
Scott: You know product design wise right?

478
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:40,482
Scott: Because obviously you're not gonna be able to educate those 30% of people who fuck it up Right.

479
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,094
Scott: All you can do is improve the condom.

480
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:47,310
Scott: So Slingshot guy has a way to improve the condom.

481
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,054
Scott: He wants his hundred grand.

482
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:51,200
Scott: Here's his YouTube video proposal.

483
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:57,500
Rym: So a while ago, we did a book club book on the Great Gatsby.

484
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:06,000
Scott: Actually, I found out today the Astoria Historical Society, which is in this mansion on Steinway called the Steinway mansion.

485
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,866
Rym: I've seen the Steinway mansion.

486
00:31:08,147 --> 00:31:10,093
Scott: It has a Greek Gatsby exhibit right now.

487
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:12,140
Rym: We should go to that this weekend.

488
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:13,699
Scott: We can go to that because that sounds pretty good.

489
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,540
Rym: Yeah, cuz Emily just read the Great Gatsby.

490
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:21,880
Rym: You know geek guys book club and she really liked it and I reread some parts and remembered that it I really like good.

491
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,911
Scott: Yeah, good book.

492
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:24,302
Scott: for a reason There was.

493
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:35,260
Rym: there was a kids that we talked about in the forum from a web series called crash course And it was a gentleman with some animation Basically explaining why the Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books ever written.

494
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:36,204
Scott: Oh, so it's I thought.

495
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:39,680
Scott: see I saw the links to these and I didn't watch them because I thought they would just be cliffnotes.

496
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:44,320
Scott: But is it actually explaining why it's great as opposed to here's the deal.

497
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:59,460
Rym: Crash course is three separate series this literary analysis series world history and u.s History, okay He has tons and tons of episodes on things like World War two the Mongols the American Revolution.

498
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,103
Scott: I want to watch that.

499
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,188
Rym: Mongols one Mongols.

500
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:16,659
Rym: I don't know as much about the Mongols on the Cold War Islam and they are one super well-researched two super well-produced three Incredibly entertaining and four there's a ton of them.

501
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:24,999
Rym: You should watch every video that's been uploaded by the crash course YouTube channel, I know what I'm doing what I can undo at work.

502
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:28,260
Rym: They're gonna get educated watched every one of these.

503
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:39,840
Rym: I think my favorite ones are the ones on US politics because he goes into just enough inside baseball To where you'll learn like interesting things that you wouldn't otherwise learn.

504
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:49,969
Rym: It's not just a superficial view but at the same time it's enough of a breadth of overview that you learn useful things and anecdotes and It's pretty accurate.

505
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:56,280
Rym: There are very few points He raises that I would take any umbrage with at all and they're so minor that I just couldn't be bothered.

506
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:56,542
Rym: It's.

507
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,439
Rym: these are so well done.

508
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:07,420
Rym: This is the level of flash and production values that we eventually strive for with GeekNights presents And I'm gonna try to get this guy on GeekNights to talk to him because these are so it's a good idea.

509
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,080
Scott: But yeah, I really want to know about the Mongols because I'd really don't know as much about them as I should.

510
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:18,830
Scott: He does this thing in the world history one where all I know about them is Genghis Khan conquered most of the world in my.

511
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,493
Scott: he lived in Mongolia.

512
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:32,819
Rym: every time he talks about and also My shitty wall you or anything He will always point out the exceptions to a rule like, you know empires can't be governed in this particular way Unless you're wait for it.

513
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:39,357
Rym: And then he shows this same 10-second montage of clips from some Mongols movie from like the 60s.

514
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,767
Rym: and The Mongols are always the exception.

515
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,457
Rym: They're like the odd man out in all of world history.

516
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:53,306
Scott: They're just Keep ignoring them because then every time your teacher who teaches you something you'd like aha What about the about the Mongols?

517
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,131
Rym: It's like yeah.

518
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:55,437
Rym: Yeah, they were the exception.

519
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:55,920
Rym: now shut up.

520
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,035
Rym: I want to go check that out now, but these are so great and they're funny too.

521
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:01,340
Rym: He's a really funny guy.

522
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,328
Scott: This is well cutting to clips from a 60s movie.

523
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:03,890
Scott: That's be funny.

524
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:05,738
Rym: Yeah, but he's a funny guy.

525
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:07,105
Rym: independently The writing's good.

526
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:07,607
Rym: It's.

527
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,920
Rym: I have nothing but good things to say about this.

528
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:14,159
Rym: John Green is a minor hero of mine and you should watch every video that he's up.

529
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,158
Scott: Does he really have to send those x-wing guys back?

530
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:17,922
Rym: I'll legally.

531
00:34:17,963 --> 00:34:19,027
Rym: I could probably keep them.

532
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:19,850
Rym: It's it's.

533
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:20,533
Rym: it's not an egg.

534
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,480
Rym: It's a slave one and it's a Millennium Falcon.

535
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:24,070
Scott: I don't think that's enough to play with.

536
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:24,775
Rym: no, it's not.

537
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:25,560
Scott: then forget it.

538
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:31,010
Rym: So in the meta moment, we're gonna be at anime Boston.

539
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:47,831
Rym: we are doing five lectures offhand, I think they're That's the first one anime openers from around the world how to how to recommend anime how to run an anime club all Anime are the same and judge an anime by its cover.

540
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,699
Rym: All right better start working on those.

541
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:52,806
Scott: We actually only really need to work on the.

542
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:53,850
Scott: all anime are the same.

543
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,097
Scott: the rest we can do off the cuff.

544
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:56,800
Scott: pretty much.

545
00:34:57,001 --> 00:35:01,591
Rym: I know I gotta put slides together of like talking points But I mean for judge an anime by its cover we can.

546
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:08,320
Scott: all we have to do really is well Here's the latest anime chart and cut it up into individual slides and then we'll do it out live.

547
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:09,745
Scott: We'll judge the cover.

548
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:11,472
Rym: do is the first half of that panel.

549
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,720
Rym: We're gonna do like that live and the second half.

550
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,576
Scott: We're gonna explain what we did maybe or we can do it as we're you know.

551
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:18,439
Scott: at the same time, right?

552
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,597
Scott: We judge it and then we say why we're judging it.

553
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:23,004
Rym: next one You know we can do in the.

554
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:39,409
Rym: in the end in the second half take some old shows that everyone has seen That we all everyone already knows the deal like cowboy bebop and show the equivalent sort of like what it will like what the cover Would be and point out why those covers elicit such a different Feeling and why those shows tend to be better.

555
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:40,092
Scott: That's too much work.

556
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:41,760
Rym: Anyway, I can work on that one.

557
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,583
Rym: I'll work on.

558
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:46,900
Rym: I'll work on the other four and you handle the complicated one with all the clips.

559
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:49,209
Scott: I'll handle on the complicated all the clips.

560
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:53,287
Scott: if you get the source movies, uh Actually, I've been working on that.

561
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:55,540
Rym: I got some really high quality of two of them.

562
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:56,991
Rym: I just need to get some of the ponds.

563
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,100
Rym: Darryl Surratt said he can help me out.

564
00:35:58,182 --> 00:36:04,727
Scott: Yeah I think the one the assassin island one because that one had a lot of the cliches of that type Because there's like they go to an island.

565
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,694
Scott: an island always works, right?

566
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:10,510
Scott: Especially compared to the one-piece movie Yeah, and the Slayer's movie, right?

567
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:10,932
Scott: Exactly.

568
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,860
Scott: It's always on an island separate from everything else.

569
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,360
Scott: Actually, we just use those three right the Slayer's movie the one-piece movie and the Lupin movie on the island.

570
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,829
Scott: Right because those all have those the.

571
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,495
Scott: there's a female on the island.

572
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:27,866
Scott: It's got the hots for Lupin Luffy slash He's got the weird cutaways.

573
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:30,935
Scott: It's a secret villain who's just on that island, right?

574
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:31,276
Scott: Okay.

575
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,515
Rym: Anyway, anyway, yeah Then you get a little insight into how we plan panels.

576
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:38,779
Scott: Sure Other meta moments after anime Boston is ConnectiCon.

577
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:40,666
Rym: We're scheduling now.

578
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:46,900
Rym: if you didn't submit your panel already the odds of you getting a time slot that isn't like 8 a.m on Sunday decrease rapidly.

579
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,945
Scott: third and week after anime Boston PAX Australia.

580
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:56,837
Scott: we have sound fuck under everything.

581
00:36:56,858 --> 00:37:02,359
Rym: three Panels slash lectures and we'll see how many get accepted two of which are what we've been guaranteed.

582
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:11,393
Rym: one that's for sure and Two of them are old standbys that have been reinvigorated for a modern era and I'm pretty sure Australians haven't seen them.

583
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:26,636
Rym: and the third one is something new that we haven't even really discussed because I don't think that'll be picked because I basically said if you want something totally new and Not something we've already done and you really don't want the other two, which we'd prefer to do You can have this one and then we'll have to write

584
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:26,696
Scott: it.

585
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:32,316
Scott: and then Actually like a month and a half after PAX Australia is packs Seattle.

586
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:32,897

Rym: We might have a private party at a house somewhere

595
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,732
Scott: and I think and we're

596
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,300
Rym: already planning our New Year's extravaganza for magfest

597
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,516
Scott: Okay, we're not giving the machine supremacy.

598
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,070
Scott: Whatever This Friday at 2 p.m.

599
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,659
Scott: Are the NS two?

600
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
Scott: NSL finals in Germany.

601
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,805
Scott: It is Nexol verse RK.

602
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:13,113
Scott: RK is the evil team base of the Yankees.

603
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:13,856
Scott: They never lose.

604
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,020
Rym: I'm rooting for them now.

605
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:15,930
Rym: I don't care that they're evil.

606
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:19,567
Scott: front-runner Nexol is the American team.

607
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:27,379
Scott: the players on that team are actually independent of nationality much nicer cooler people and I really want them to win and beat the evil team.

608
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,520
Rym: See I want them to win and beat the evil team but so badly.

609
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:40,630
Rym: Having been at RIT and then having been a part of the fan culture around the evil team I Kind of like being on the evil team.

610
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,236
Scott: So the mighty decks are gonna beat you.

611
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:42,979
Scott: that the end.

612
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:45,131
Scott: You know what in the mighty ducks wasn't?

613
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:46,298
Scott: that was the where it comes from right?

614
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:48,166
Scott: The bad Yes was called the evil team, right?

615
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:49,371
Rym: So no it was.

616
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,680
Rym: it was actually called the evil team in Shaolin soccer.

617
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:52,664
Scott: Oh, that's right.

618
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,229
Scott: Shaolin soccer was the evil team.

619
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,040
Rym: They were the evil team, but they weren't called or the evil team.

620
00:38:57,522 --> 00:39:00,252
Scott: Yes It's called the evil team.

621
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:10,320
Rym: Remember that episode RK is the Shaolin soccer evil team with the steroids Episode of South Park where the underdog team goes to play against the Detroit Red Wings.

622
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:14,355
Scott: Yeah, that's basically what's most likely to happen on Friday.

623
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:19,940
Scott: Yeah sadly But yeah, and there's actually like thousands of dollars in prizes.

624
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:27,349
Scott: So if you you know and NS2 is really the first video game I've highly enjoyed spectating outside of omega-thon finals.

625
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,840
Scott: So if you care at all, it's worth watching video game.

626
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,662
Rym: I've enjoyed Spectating.

627
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,036
Rym: I enjoy spectating Counter-Strike Pro matches in a big way.

628
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:37,900
Scott: I haven't watched too many.

629
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,765
Scott: I've only watched one or two.

630
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:41,159
Rym: I've been trying to play increasingly competitively.

631
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:48,538
Rym: So I either spend a lot of time watching the previous round or I spend a lot of time dead in the serious scrim watching everyone else.

632
00:39:49,703 --> 00:40:04,919
Rym: It's funny like I play on pubs and I'm basically neo like and unto you gods above and then I go to like the anarchy death server and I am easily like the second-to-last person on the server in terms of goodness the last person being bot Dave

633
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:07,147
Scott: Way to go about Dave

634
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:07,910
Rym: Bob Dave.

635
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,679
Rym: I hope you don't ever die here again.

636
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:22,480
Scott: the book club book is the player of games Coincidentally and sadly written by Ian M banks who after we selected this book we have learned is gonna die soon.

637
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:27,720
Rym: I hope against hope that this does not assert a precedent of the GeekNights book club being fatal.

638
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,787
Scott: Yes, otherwise, we should pick.

639
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:30,389
Rym: wait a minute.

640
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,292
Rym: We hate us.

641
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:32,115
Rym: Wait a minute.

642
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:34,143
Scott: I've got the conservative people You don't like.

643
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:43,240
Scott: Fitzgerald isn't alive anymore either, but he didn't start Announce that he was going to die dirt after I chose his book.

644
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:47,660
Rym: He's been dead for a while our Scott backers still alive so we're all good.

645
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,025
Scott: He's healthy very healthy.

646
00:40:49,206 --> 00:40:50,009
Scott: as far as we know.

647
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,559
Rym: no date announced yet for the next prince of nothing book.

648
00:40:54,444 --> 00:41:06,500
Scott: Not not either for We either kill people or we kill their writing ability, I think the trick is to never read this book clubs cancel.

649
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:08,260
Scott: Yeah, he's gonna get better.

650
00:41:08,822 --> 00:41:10,728
Rym: I mean the first Kingkiller book was okay.

651
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:14,219
Rym: the second one after we reviewed it is sex kung fu.

652
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,445
Scott: sure Some people really like that.

653
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:21,480
Rym: apparently more people like that than the Great Gatsby because apparently there is terrible readers.

654
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:27,990
Scott: they're shallow and They like fan service because they're fans anyway, so There you should go to front row crew.

655
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,620
Scott: calm if you listen to this show.

656
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:38,915
Rym: There was a problem that we as technologists in the world Solved before Scott and I were born and then with the advent of a different society.

657
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:40,619
Rym: We have now unsolved it.

658
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:44,280
Scott: So the basic fundamental problem here is I have some data.

659
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:54,819
Scott: I want to send this data to not just one person But a lot of people and I wanted to send it to all those people simultaneously and quickly.

660
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:56,666
Rym: How do I on that?

661
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:57,832
Scott: how do I do this now?

662
00:41:57,873 --> 00:41:58,275
Rym: Here's the trouble.

663
00:41:58,295 --> 00:42:05,120
Scott: we're talking obviously Primarily about video now in the old days because that is that videos the thing that's gonna take a lot of day.

664
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:10,760
Rym: We use broadcast because sure HD broadcast even today is a lot of bandwidth.

665
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:15,160
Rym: But it's one way and the amount of bandwidth is static.

666
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:17,572
Rym: It's as though you're streaming it once to one person.

667
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:19,120
Rym: just everyone can piggyback on that.

668
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:20,558
Scott: Yeah, I mean you have this piece of this.

669
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,853
Scott: You know part of the frequency of the spectrum in the sky

670
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,400
Rym: or on the cable or whatever

671
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:44,775
Scott: specifically dedicated to this and only that all the time 24/7 and all you do is take your antenna Drain the fucking power plant to boost the antenna and broadcast and keep the antenna on all day and Anyone who wants to watch it works Even if everyone in the city watches at the same time.

672
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:50,480
Scott: it works Even if everyone in the world assuming your antenna is that powerful and you have reflectors to reflect to the other side of the world.

673
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:52,689
Scott: Everyone watches all the same time.

674
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,057
Scott: You're that's it.

675
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,322
Scott: You're good It doesn't matter.

676
00:42:55,443 --> 00:43:08,086
Rym: and even with compression if you think about it the amount of data that is broadcast via Cable television alone like HDTV today is Ridiculous and staggering.

677
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:09,210
Scott: Yeah, think about this right now.

678
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,555
Scott: I'm in New York City, right.

679
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:18,499
Scott: unlike some other places in the world We have a lot of local TV stations coming over the air Right, like two of every major network is like pretty sure the Connecticut stations can reach us.

680
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:18,660
Scott: now.

681
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,683
Rym: You know, it's interesting when I think when I lived in Detroit It was the same deal.

682
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:29,019
Scott: think about how many radio stations am and FM right and think about how many satellites are Beaming their shit down at us.

683
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,308
Scott: We are basically being crazily and how many.

684
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:32,553
Scott: Wi-Fi is not a counter right.

685
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:32,793
Scott: and this

686
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:34,580
Rym: is a new because actually in the old

687
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:35,864
Scott: Way for decades

688
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:36,928
Rym: in some senses in

689
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,131
Scott: if not a century

690
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:50,909
Rym: before HD in some ways It could be argued that we were sending more data partly because of the lossy analog nature of all that crap and Just the really inefficient mechanisms used to

691
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:52,677
Scott: ever since they invented the radio.

692
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:53,380
Scott: This has been true.

693
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:00,265
Scott: We are being bombarded by all sorts of radio waves all the goddamn time and if you choose which one we can tune to any One of them we like.

694
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:02,078
Rym: so that's all well and good.

695
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,033
Rym: But then the future came and now I want to watch Game of Thrones.

696
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:15,740
Rym: right now Scott wants to watch Game of Thrones Starting about five minutes after me on his own computer and a million other people want to watch it at all sorts of different times.

697
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:20,877
Scott: Well, everyone can get a DVR and everyone will just has to have their antenna working at the time.

698
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:21,640
Scott: It's broadcast.

699
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:24,469
Scott: Remember what was broadcast and then they're all good.

700
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,639
Rym: Now that is actually the old model that worked very effectively called a VCR.

701
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:31,474
Rym: Yeah that you would just time shift that the data is still going out.

702
00:44:31,514 --> 00:44:33,000
Rym: You're subscribed to this giant.

703
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:38,079
Scott: It's like yeah, if you want that data You got to be on at the time that data is going out.

704
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:40,639
Scott: You'll get the data and then do with it as you please.

705
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:53,880
Rym: now It's interesting that even when the VCR came out there were immediate lawsuits to basically try to keep that technology out of the hands Consumers because the media industry and strangler was terrified of the idea that someone could tape something and watch it.

706
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,688
Scott: That's why it was actually another reason.

707
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:58,140
Scott: It was very rare to put like big movies on TV.

708
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:00,358
Scott: Like would be an event when a big movie was on TV.

709
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:02,528
Scott: Yeah Like on net broadcast television.

710
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:09,680
Rym: when Alice in Wonderland the animated movie was on Broadcast TV like me and all my little friends watched it at the same time

711
00:45:09,861 --> 00:45:18,379
Scott: It'd be like, you know, there'd be that Disney thing like on ABC like Tinkerbell would fly across the screen and you'd be like Oh shit, it's time for a real fucking movie on actual fucking TV.

712
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,460
Scott: You would schedule your life around a thing that would happen.

713
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:28,380
Rym: People would know that shit was coming when they had their VCRs ready And we're not talking scheduling around like oh Seinfeld's on at 7 got to be home to watch that.

714
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,893
Rym: It was like hey, you're all watching the Merlin thing on Saturday, right?

715
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,380
Rym: Yeah, they're gonna show it twice and that's it.

716
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:36,519
Scott: Those days are fucking over.

717
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:47,579
Rym: so no, I'm cool and internetty and I just want to click on stuff and watch it when I want to watch it and I want individual streams sent to me and we don't really yet have good ways to do this.

718
00:45:47,961 --> 00:46:00,189
Scott: No, now right because if different people aren't all watching at the same time you can't just spray the data out all at once right that doesn't work because someone's gonna turn it on and tap into the feed and Suddenly they're in the middle

719
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,322
Rym: now at the same time Really?

720
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:08,540
Rym: You could if we engineered the internet a little bit and there's some of the some of these facilities.

721
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:13,523
Scott: Then if we engineered the internet that way it'd be really bad for the other things using internet Visiting websites.

722
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:18,698
Rym: they exist in parallel and what you do is have something called a content distribution network.

723
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:21,547
Rym: We have those Yes, but they're not part of.

724
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:25,540
Rym: because of the way the internet is it's hard to do what I'm about to propose.

725
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,460
Rym: I'm not necessarily saying this is the best way to do it and I'm gonna really really simplify the idea.

726
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:34,632
Rym: but in IP You know IPV4 IPV6.

727
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:37,043
Rym: There's the concept of Multicast.

728
00:46:37,084 --> 00:46:38,429
Scott: that's hardly ever used ever.

729
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:46,195
Rym: It's used a lot internal to organizations Like if you've got some Tibco middleware, but I mean on the cap the capital.

730
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:47,800
Scott: I internet hardly ever used.

731
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,084
Scott: It's mostly used on.

732
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:53,260
Rym: the idea is that you have data that just go into your network all the time.

733
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:59,000
Rym: It just goes to your routers and your router knows who has requested that stream or not.

734
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:01,020
Scott: So basically anyone who's connected to the router.

735
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,286
Scott: Let's say it's a 10 port router.

736
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:04,256
Scott: the people on ports one through five.

737
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:09,380
Scott: Just tell the router Hey, I want to subscribe to that shit and then that comes in one hole on the router.

738
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:11,800
Scott: The router will copy and send it to all five holes.

739
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:19,061
Rym: I think I actually want to go in one step more detail than that because you wouldn't actually have five people connected to the Router.

740
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:19,845
Rym: you can act.

741
00:47:19,886 --> 00:47:21,434
Rym: networks to routers not devices.

742
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:21,936
Scott: Hmm.

743
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:26,940
Rym: It's true It's true, but this this kind of shows why this is such a scalable idea in theory.

744
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:29,270
Rym: So you've got your route err.

745
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:39,520
Rym: Yeah as opposed to your switch err Yeah, so the router knows, you know, it's getting the the stream from the source like it's Game of Thrones.

746
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,219
Rym: It's whatever the hell it's going to the router.

747
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,105
Rym: The router then knows.

748
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:50,265
Rym: the sweat basically from the switch will say things like this someone on this vlan It wants this data.

749
00:47:50,687 --> 00:48:00,136
Rym: now as soon as you're giving that data to that vlan at all Anyone on that vlan can get the same data with no increase in bandwidth usage at any level.

750
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:13,100
Rym: beyond that switches actually Individual ports because modern internet modern ethernet is basically full duplex one device per port Mmm, so as a result, once you send it to that subnet either everyone's getting it or no one's getting it.

751
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,820
Rym: And the switch does even further Optimization where the packages don't go out to places where there aren't people to listen in the first place.

752
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,780
Scott: So if 20 people in the office building all want the data, right?

753
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:32,118
Scott: We actually only need to have one copy of that data coming into the building from the outside and our internal networking Equipment will sort of copy it for everybody as it comes in now

754
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,102
Rym: This is

755
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:38,579
Scott: our bandwidth bill for our external internet will be 20 times lower than if we had 20 copies coming

756
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:38,900
Rym: in now.

757
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,428
Rym: This still doesn't solve some of the other problems.

758
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:44,057
Rym: For example, so this multicast stream starts.

759
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:44,820
Rym: It's going fine.

760
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,169
Rym: What if I subscribe five minutes late?

761
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:48,956
Rym: Usually there's no mechanism to get the part.

762
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:49,819
Rym: I miss mmm.

763
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,828
Scott: You'd have to have some sort of DVR built into the network now.

764
00:48:53,868 --> 00:49:06,062
Rym: It's interesting because In middleware as in corporate middleware things like 59 West TIB RV You know those kinds of things JMS even you had.

765
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:24,330
Rym: you can have concepts where you'll have multicast data like that But you have a secondary Channel where someone can start subscribing but then they can hit a secondary channel and request just the data they miss Mmm, so you can have architecture that requires storage to hold that data.

766
00:49:24,873 --> 00:49:25,960
Rym: Yes, but then you have not.

767
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,570
Scott: a lot of routers have big hard drives in them.

768
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:34,490
Rym: But then again, maybe you have a mechanism there where you have a caching server that sits next to your router.

769
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:37,690
Scott: I'm your network a big old box of drives and RAM under your router.

770
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,590
Scott: But maybe it only caches for the current day or the logs to our likes 24 hours of all the multicast data.

771
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:43,966
Rym: Basically, yeah Yeah.

772
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:52,517
Rym: And then it can retransmit just the data you miss or it can be pre-loaded with data to start people Subscribing or seeding things early.

773
00:49:52,537 --> 00:49:53,641
Rym: the sky's the limit.

774
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:55,730
Rym: The problem is that the sky's the limit.

775
00:49:56,051 --> 00:50:06,765
Rym: These are all proprietary things that are usually written or architected for individual use cases Like we built it out at my old company for market data to subscribe to market data.

776
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:08,470
Rym: It was a really great solution.

777
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:14,249
Rym: So if you wanted level 1 and level 2 market data from US equities markets, there is a solution for you.

778
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:21,440
Scott: Yeah, but let's say you know what it all this equipment right for normal Also within a network that we controlled a hundred percent right.

779
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:25,633
Scott: all this equipment for normal people would have to be set up at The ISP.

780
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:29,586
Scott: so the ISP is gonna install a special thing just to help Netflix out.

781
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:30,830
Scott: That's not cool.

782
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:34,945
Scott: Well, there's so many people that they could possibly help out the install one for Amazon.

783
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:36,450
Scott: Also, you come on iTunes.

784
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:41,670
Rym: So Google offers that as a service and almost all ISPs that are large enough take advantage of it.

785
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,603
Rym: They will put Google caching servers that cache big chunks of YouTube.

786
00:50:45,944 --> 00:50:47,389
Scott: Yeah, but Google's paying for that shit.

787
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:50,515
Rym: That's not a hundred percent clear.

788
00:50:50,555 --> 00:50:53,643
Rym: I've seen different reports of how the arrangement works.

789
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:56,050
Rym: Yeah, it's not a publicly available thing.

790
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,369
Scott: Yeah, isn't that sort of a not net neutrality?

791
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:04,690
Rym: Um, I would argue no because the way that works is basically you have an ISP, right?

792
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:07,350
Rym: Yeah, so a lot of your customers are coming to Google.

793
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:13,190
Rym: They're hit they're going through the peering of the internet and they're hitting Google's like customer gateway and streaming their data.

794
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:24,050
Rym: So it's in everyone's vested interest if you have a cache of that super high demand high bandwidth data Inside of the ISP's network to take off that sort of front load.

795
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:30,410
Scott: Yeah, but unless the ISP allows anyone to do this right and to make this deal It's not fair that Google can put their stuff in there.

796
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:39,164
Rym: But at the same time by doing that that frees up the actual External pipes for all the other content and ends up being better for everyone.

797
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:41,170
Scott: yet our internet still slow as fuck.

798
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,620
Rym: That's a separate problem, I'm still battling.

799
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,990
Rym: in recent remember way back and we talked about those tricks that seem to make YouTube faster.

800
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,760
Rym: Yeah, I'm still investigating that.

801
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,757
Rym: I've had long conversations with Verizon text and I'm not yet at.

802
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:06,430
Rym: I can't say I'm not at liberty to disclose my findings because I have not found anything That I would report on because I'm not confident enough in the things I've discovered.

803
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:15,030
Rym: Suffice it to say Everything's dysfunctional in the American Internet at this peering level of internet works, but that's a separate problem.

804
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:30,509
Rym: But at least in theory the idea of a content distribution network like that and Akamai and Amazon There's all these ways where you basically take your content and you distribute it to far away scattered endpoints So that users can get it first from there and then it is getting it.

805
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:42,574
Rym: So it gets the current copy of say your front-end database from your central server And maybe it only updates once every minute, but then you have billions of people updating every nanosecond From that gateway beyond.

806
00:52:42,614 --> 00:52:47,447
Rym: the customer is constantly hitting it, but you're not using bandwidth upstream from that caching server.

807
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:59,310
Rym: Yep now architecting that as you've probably dealt with because it's a big part of your job is Architecting and optimizing that especially if it's two-way communication is not necessarily the easiest thing in the world.

808
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:01,036
Scott: Usually you don't use it for two-way.

809
00:53:01,117 --> 00:53:02,944
Scott: use it for one way right, but two ways.

810
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:07,530
Scott: the holy grail it is So like if you got a website think about this, right?

811
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,523
Scott: There are some parts of the website that are different every time someone visits, right?

812
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:13,028
Rym: So ad rotation, right?

813
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:19,170
Scott: I mean like if you log into Facebook, right your newsfeed is different for every different person.

814
00:53:19,252 --> 00:53:20,109
Scott: It's not the same, right?

815
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:27,330
Scott: So you need when someone visits Facebook Facebook needs to generate that part of the page just for that person and that person alone.

816
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:31,350
Scott: Right, but the Facebook homepage doesn't fucking change.

817
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,779
Scott: Anyone who visits that shit is seeing the same exact HTML, right.

818
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,050
Scott: and also everyone is seeing the same exact like Facebook logo image.

819
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,950
Scott: They're seeing the same Facebook CSS file and that stuff is not trivial.

820
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,770
Rym: I mean guys our RSS feed uses almost as much bandwidth as gig nights, right?

821
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,759
Scott: It's like there's a lot of files that don't change.

822
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,250
Scott: every person visiting sees the same file and A lot of people are getting those files all the time.

823
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:04,321
Scott: So what you do is someone will visit your website and it'll be like IMGSRC equals Not facebook.com.

824
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,070
Scott: slash image slash whatever.

825
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:19,258
Scott: It'll be like CDN something something Facebook something image And basically that image even though the web page came from a Facebook server made you that page For just for you and send it to you.

826
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:36,710
Scott: all these other parts of the page that don't change ever are on some caching server that Facebook set up not at your ISP but near you geographically and You're gonna get all the images and CSS and JS files and things from there instead and that's hardly ever updated by Facebook.

827
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:44,236
Scott: So that means that bandwidth only has to go between you and there and not between you and the big Facebook server all the way At the Facebook data center.

828
00:54:44,598 --> 00:54:46,167
Rym: now, there's an even further complication.

829
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:52,834
Rym: all these ideas We talked about the counter distribution are kind of assuming that you don't care if other people, you know Everyone can see the data.

830
00:54:53,376 --> 00:55:00,779
Rym: but like a lot of broadcasts of things like HBO shows They only want certain people to be able to see the data.

831
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:10,295
Rym: meaning if they use any sort of content distribution network The internal traffic has to be inaccessible and probably encrypted Yep Which adds a whole nother layer.

832
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:14,150
Rym: and to illustrate this point because I realized as Scott and I were talking about this.

833
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:22,624
Rym: I don't think many people on the internet know the sort of sorted history of satellite television Let alone how satellites work right.

834
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:23,630
Scott: but think about this way, right?

835
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:27,562
Scott: So in terms of the you know, the encrypted send right.

836
00:55:27,843 --> 00:55:29,950
Scott: so your HBO, right?

837
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,138
Scott: You have a server that has the TV shows on it.

838
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:37,155
Scott: Yeah, a hundred people want to watch and the show is 20 megabits per second.

839
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:39,763
Scott: So that means you need 200 megabits per second of bandwidth.

840
00:55:40,064 --> 00:55:41,930
Scott: You don't have that much right?

841
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:42,933
Scott: You only have a hundred.

842
00:55:43,475 --> 00:55:43,937
Scott: what do you do?

843
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:45,402
Scott: Let ten people not watch.

844
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,470
Scott: you're gonna decrease the quality by half.

845
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,152
Scott: What are you gonna do?

846
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:53,670
Scott: So what you do is you sort of stream that data to the CDN's, right?

847
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,114
Scott: So there's one.

848
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:59,050
Scott: there's maybe three CDN's around the world US Asia and Europe, right?

849
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:06,533
Scott: so you really only have to send 60 megabits per second 20 to the first CDN 20 to the next CDN and 20 to the Third CDN.

850
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:15,090
Scott: and then those all those users those all that will be you know Getting to the CDN's which will copy and resend the data to all them separately.

851
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:28,610
Scott: So even though you do still need in total the all those CDN's aren't cheap Right, and they still have to have that total 200 megabits of bandwidth for all the users Which sucks compared to say the radio antenna?

852
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:32,382
Scott: Well, you still at your central server you own.

853
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:40,810
Scott: you need much much less bandwidth So each into no individual piece of equipment really needs to be that ridiculously crazy.

854
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,810
Scott: Imagine trying to get like everyone in the whole world right watching the Super Bowl off one server.

855
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:46,750
Scott: It's not gonna happen, right?

856
00:56:46,830 --> 00:57:02,059
Scott: You can split it up to a bunch of servers all across the world that are individually small and easy to set up and have You know a reasonable amount of bandwidth each and then no single piece needs to have a ludicrous amount of bandwidth Even though in total you have that ludicrous amount.

857
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:11,644
Rym: So I want to illustrate all these points by explaining how Satellite television evolved in the United States because this this is a nice one.

858
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:19,650
Rym: if you're interested in this because it's actually kind of a cool story You can read there's a Wikipedia page that will go into ludicrous detail about how this all works.

859
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:21,690
Rym: But I want to clear one big misconception.

860
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:26,543
Rym: If you have like a satellite receiver for TV, it's not or internet.

861
00:57:26,764 --> 00:57:28,770
Rym: It's not sending anything back to that satellite.

862
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:32,782
Rym: Your upstream is not slow because you're sending it to the satellite.

863
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:35,129
Rym: your little dish can't transmit for shit.

864
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:41,829
Rym: You have a modem that's connected via a regular old phone line to your ISP.

865
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,709
Scott: Why don't you just pair like a cable modem with the dish?

866
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,617
Rym: Some people have done things like that.

867
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:48,530
Scott: But then if you have a kid modem, why do you have a dish?

868
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:55,741
Rym: The only reason you would ever have a satellite internet is if you live somewhere where phone lines are Probably the best thing you can get me.

869
00:57:55,761 --> 00:58:01,633
Scott: whenever you see pictures of like, you know Most countries on earth don't really have the cable TV, right you watch, you know Any pictures of like.

870
00:58:01,754 --> 00:58:04,261
Scott: a lot of countries just everyone has dishes.

871
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:05,324
Scott: just satellite dishes.

872
00:58:05,345 --> 00:58:05,906
Scott: You were in India.

873
00:58:05,946 --> 00:58:06,990
Scott: satellite dishes everywhere, right?

874
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:07,731
Scott: Yep.

875
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:09,419
Scott: Yeah, see everyone just has dishes.

876
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,610
Scott: then get all the fucking channels in the goddamn universe.

877
00:58:11,931 --> 00:58:26,834
Rym: so in the in the 70s the way a lot of syndicated television would work is there would be satellites that would Broadcast the data because that was the easiest way to send it to all the different local networks both You know later cable providers But also over-the-air providers.

878
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:32,730
Rym: a syndicated show would be sent up to a satellite and then beamed over basically the entire United States.

879
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:37,270
Rym: Yep, because only rich television stations could afford satellite dishes.

880
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:44,510
Scott: Yeah, so there would be a few rich people like one person in my grandma's neighborhood would get this gigantic motherfucking dish on their roof.

881
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:49,368
Scott: Oh, just like that horror movie that was reviewed by Cinemassacre that we also saw with amber.

882
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:49,910
Rym: Oh, yeah.

883
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:55,880
Rym: So the reason for that is that so that they broadcast like that There was a really easy distribution mechanism.

884
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,984
Rym: No one ever thought to encrypt.

885
00:58:57,105 --> 00:58:59,734
Scott: the satellites were expensive But once they're up there, they're up there.

886
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:01,741
Rym: So in the later 70s a hobbyist.

887
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:02,604
Rym: I forget the dude's name.

888
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:13,918
Rym: He basically wrote software and Came up with devices that could take that satellite signal and turn it back into a usual usable picture That consumers could use.

889
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:25,104
Rym: so consumers who were savvy Realize they didn't have to pay for premium content and they could consume television From all over the world not just their local broadcast.

890
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,490
Scott: you put a big-ass dish on your roof.

891
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,869
Rym: You aim it at the satellites physically, right basically plugged it through device into your TV.

892
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:35,883
Scott: Yeah And then you could watch any Channel pretty much anywhere in the world that you could aim your dish at.

893
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:38,694
Scott: so I guess you couldn't watch something from the exact Opposite side of the world.

894
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,863
Scott: but maybe you could get a reflection and catch it.

895
00:59:40,883 --> 00:59:45,470
Rym: and it turns out a lot of things were broadcast In multiple markets and you could see a lot of things.

896
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:47,170
Rym: I mean expected you to aim real.

897
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,950
Scott: I mean, there are those ham radio guys who talked to Australia early in the morning, right?

898
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,709
Scott: So I bet if you early in the morning, you could probably see Chinese TV.

899
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:59,568
Rym: There was also a huge community in Canada that would do this because they couldn't get a lot of American TV.

900
00:59:59,909 --> 00:59:59,969
Rym: Mmm.

901
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:06,799
Rym: So obviously as soon as enough smart people were doing this they started to show their friends how to do it.

902
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,248
Rym: and then some companies started selling the equipment.

903
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:21,769
Rym: and Two things happen one bunch of lawsuits and a bunch of court debates and a bunch of congressional debates To the people who were sending out this data over the air started to try to figure out how to encrypt it.

904
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,890
Rym: Yep, and two things happen as a result of this one.

905
01:00:25,472 --> 01:00:34,270
Rym: There was a big debate in the public consciousness in the late 70s and early 80s This is largely forgotten today about whether or not this echoes back to the beginning of the episode.

906
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:39,149
Rym: You have a right to decode signals that are being broadcast into your own home.

907
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:43,909
Rym: Yep Funny how the same debates happen over and over again and never get resolved.

908
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:49,950
Scott: thing Remember if you want to save a lot on this bandwidth cost and not make copies of everything to send them to specific people.

909
01:00:50,352 --> 01:00:54,830
Scott: You can save by just spraying your data everywhere without worrying about who receives it.

910
01:00:55,091 --> 01:00:58,523
Scott: But then anyone can receive it who wants to.

911
01:00:58,924 --> 01:00:59,707
Scott: so what you?

912
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:00,550
Scott: the only way?

913
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:10,460
Scott: To limit it to certain people is to encrypt it send it out And then even though anyone can pick it up and take a look at it Only the people who have the key can actually look.

914
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,690
Rym: so you can see how this echoes all the debates we're having today.

915
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:20,610
Rym: There were arguments made and there were court cases around the idea that maybe it should be illegal to encrypt these broadcasts.

916
01:01:21,151 --> 01:01:31,249
Rym: Because then theoretically are you not trespassing by sending these signals into everyone's homes that they are not legally allowed Nor are they able to decrypt simultaneously?

917
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:33,556
Rym: Pirate television arrived.

918
01:01:33,797 --> 01:01:42,190
Rym: people started you know the hobbyists who made the original devices Pretty trivially figured out the encryption schemes and started selling black boxes.

919
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:51,235
Rym: Yeah, black boxes in that era meant devices that would decrypt cable TV or satellite signals Without a cable box.

920
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:55,990
Scott: right because remember if you encrypt and broadcast this thing right you're only sending one copy.

921
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,163
Scott: It's all encrypted the same way for every person.

922
01:01:58,244 --> 01:01:59,250
Scott: everyone is the same key.

923
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:01,788
Rym: So if I figure out the case someone gets that keys just like DRM.

924
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,176
Scott: It is DRM.

925
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:08,994
Rym: both my uncle and a friend of my dad's had oscilloscopes and crazy satellite dishes And they were.

926
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:11,103
Scott: one person pays for DirecTV.

927
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:12,570
Scott: everyone else gets free DirecTV.

928
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,802
Rym: They were cracking analog satellite and cable signals in the 80s.

929
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:18,045
Rym: Yep like that.

930
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,850
Rym: That is a level of hacker dedication.

931
01:02:19,952 --> 01:02:20,909
Rym: We don't often see it now.

932
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:25,085
Scott: There is still plenty of unencrypted broadcast and satellite television.

933
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:31,675
Scott: right like I remember at RIT They had a dish up and they would watch like Apple keynotes by satellite Which you couldn't watch in those days.

934
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:45,927
Rym: my point is simply this the history of satellite television and distribution The court cases the lawsuits of your people arrested the hackers the debates in society about whether or not you have a right to Data that's being handed to you.

935
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,605
Rym: We had that argument in the 70s, and it didn't go anywhere.

936
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:50,368
Rym: We had that argument in the 80s.

937
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,814
Rym: We had that argument in the 90s.

938
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:53,280
Rym: We had the argument in the 2000s.

939
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:54,786
Rym: We're having the argument now in the 2013s.

940
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:57,117
Rym: there's been no consensus.

941
01:02:57,137 --> 01:03:02,677
Rym: there have been very few definitive court cases and Frankly almost nothing has changed.

942
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:09,403
Rym: the technology has just gotten more sophisticated along the way Yep, so everything that apply no one wants to take.

943
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:15,949
Rym: no one wants a TV anymore cuz it sucks I know but everything that applied to the debates in the 70s and 80s about satellite TV.

944
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:20,210
Rym: Change some of the proper nouns the technology and post it to reddit.

945
01:03:20,773 --> 01:03:24,030
Rym: It'll sound exactly like what every kid is arguing about today.

946
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:32,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

947
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:37,706
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

948
01:03:37,926 --> 01:03:42,964
Scott: be sure to visit our website At frontrowcrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

949
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:50,609
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one But four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

950
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:54,125
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

951
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,146
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

952
01:04:00,266 --> 01:04:01,570
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
