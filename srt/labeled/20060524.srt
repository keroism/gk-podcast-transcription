00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,910
Rym: It's Wednesday May 24th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,960
Rym: We preview to anime or on high school host club and rec.

3
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:19,357
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:25,330
Rym: So we were coming back from the store today and Scott tried to make fun of me and my mother.

5
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:30,620
Rym: You thought I was gonna open with the thing about me getting a patent, but no I'm starting with this.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,639
Rym: He said you're gonna open with before yeah, and then this happened, so I have to start with this.

7
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:36,558
Scott: So your mom?

8
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,800
Rym: So But Scott bought like two apples, and they fell out of his bag, and they're rolling around in the back.

9
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:51,330
Rym: So when I unloaded the car I said Scott your apples fell out, and they were rolling around in the back and Scott says to me.

10
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,054
Rym: He says to me what exactly did you say?

11
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:01,999
Scott: I said Me and my mom were doing last night?

12
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,351
Scott: Yeah, rollin referring to the rolling around in the back.

13
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:12,180
Scott: now obviously the my was the slip of the tongue And I meant to say that your mom and not my mom, but it was funny nonetheless.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,536
Scott: Yeah, in fact if I would have said that's what me and your mom were doing last night.

15
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:17,800
Scott: It wouldn't have been funny.

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,759
Scott: We just got like yeah, yeah, but because I accidentally said my we were bestowed with much laughter, and it was well worth it.

17
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,429
Scott: So hooray for accidentally being more funny.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:38,724
Rym: Yeah in somewhat more relevant news You know for all of you know I quit IBM one week ago, and I've been working at a new awesome job like crazy Awesome job.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,991
Rym: I'll have so many days.

20
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:43,885
Rym: Yeah, and now I'm going on vacation To an amazement.

21
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:48,440
Rym: so one anyone who's going to be in North Carolina for an amazement this weekend.

22
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:52,856
Rym: I'm going to be there doing at least one panel, and I'll probably doing security and wandering around.

23
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:53,839
Rym: you can't miss me.

24
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:55,986
Scott: He'll make himself known.

25
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:58,698
Scott: you can see his picture on our forum at front row.

26
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,900
Rym: crew calm Yeah, but well what wasn't that crepey guy who was like hey, let's want to see room without his shirt on.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,847
Rym: How about you without your shirt on yeah?

28
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:07,469
Scott: Yeah?

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,955
Scott: I didn't turn Skype on today.

30
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,103
Rym: Yeah, I wonder why I'm gonna.

31
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:14,335
Scott: I'm gonna figure out a way where I can talk to intelligent people on Skype.

32
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:17,880
Rym: until then no But I left IBM on good terms.

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:25,540
Rym: I mean aside for the fact that I'm no longer supporting all the crap I built for them over the years there I like all the people that I worked with at least and they have my email address.

34
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:38,573
Rym: Well they emailed me and apparently I really can't talk about the details but one of the things I did while I was working at IBM they feel is patent worthy and They're trying to get a patent on it and IBM is good at that sort of thing.

35
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:41,431
Rym: so like they needed all my information So it'll be on the patent.

36
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:50,380
Rym: yeah So I may or may not be getting my first patent Far sooner than when I was gonna try to get to patents as part of a show on how the patent system is broken.

37
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:53,228
Scott: Yeah Completely useless pet.

38
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,980
Rym: I can't say what the patents about.

39
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:01,340
Rym: Other than that it is not something that I would consider patent worthy.

40
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,520
Scott: Yeah, it shouldn't be patentable.

41
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:12,617
Scott: But because the patent system is broken you can and because IBM is basically just as a patent machine They could just get patents that don't mean anything all over the place.

42
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,200
Rym: now I guess I'm fine with it because I'll put on my resume that I have a patent through IBM.

43
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:22,120
Rym: Yeah, hell, I'd be able to try to hire me back with that because they're real big on patents over there.

44
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:24,510
Scott: Yeah, I don't think you'd go back there though.

45
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:27,121
Rym: Hey if they offered me double what I'm paid right now I'd go back.

46
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:31,655
Rym: probably I'd still give my current work like eight months notice or something.

47
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,573
Scott: well tomorrow at work I'm supposedly gonna do actual work.

48
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,680
Rym: No bullshit.

49
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,003
Scott: No It's not bullshit.

50
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:43,180
Scott: the people from the New York office are coming and we're getting a t1 Verizon's coming and we're gonna do stuff.

51
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:47,019
Rym: Are you gonna be setting any of that up or you're just gonna sit there while they all set it up?

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,024
Rym: I'll probably do something.

53
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,315
Rym: Do you know how to deal with t1 stuffers?

54
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,280
Rym: Verizon gonna handle all that?

55
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:54,937
Scott: I guess Verizon's gonna do the telephony end of it.

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,986
Rym: Well, usually they'll give you a router.

57
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:58,969
Rym: No it whatever.

58
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,016
Rym: I imagine they're going to handle it all.

59
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:06,260
Scott: yeah, whatever Stuff to do we're gonna do a whole bunch of this stuff like rearranging all the furniture.

60
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,891
Rym: Yeah, so you're gonna get some people there meaning you can't just run around the office naked.

61
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:13,998
Scott: or there's been one person there for a while But it's not very exciting.

62
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:18,499
Scott: Now all the people you know important people good people are coming.

63
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,505
Scott: So any of the work continues?

64
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,972
Rym: yeah, I doubt it somehow.

65
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:24,715
Scott: yeah, I don't know.

66
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,420
Scott: I'm gonna ask for more work also.

67
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:35,157
Rym: I mean I'm doing more work at my new job now where I'm learning how to do the work Then I've ever done in my life and even that is really not much.

68
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:39,138
Rym: if I push myself I could probably do it all over a course of four or five hours every day.

69
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:46,278
Rym: I'm really convinced that no job is actually 9 to 5 worth of work.

70
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,759
Scott: You know what is if you work for your damn self?

71
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,537
Rym: Yeah, yeah Maybe we should just eventually work for our damn selves though at least for now now get this.

72
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,139
Rym: this is a cool thing.

73
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:11,539
Rym: the one Thing I always complained about in work was that they generally want you there for a full eight hours every day plus your lunch plus whatever and a lot of times they want you to work overtime and If you work more efficiently like they really don't let you just leave early.

74
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:26,994
Rym: The way my work works is basically I have to put in seven and a half hours worth of logged work Per day, and that's really the only requirement if I get all my work done somehow And I can somehow do that leaving early every day.

75
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:33,875
Rym: They don't seem to mind Awesome, so I think I'm gonna try real hard to get all my work done real quick and real well.

76
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,220
Scott: here go for it.

77
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,686
Scott: Yeah, we'll see how it happens.

78
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,454
Rym: It's a big difference between salary and hourly.

79
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,940
Rym: I'll tell you what yeah, there is.

80
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,692
Scott: So these are awesome But they're also not awesome.

81
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:51,191
Rym: Yeah, well I Generally am not going to work overtime, so yeah, yep Alright, yeah, but in actual news.

82
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:52,920
Rym: This is not tech news really.

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:00,560
Rym: I only bring it up because for those of you who are paying attention I tried for one week to always drive the speed limit no matter what you failed.

84
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,200
Rym: I stopped doing it after two days because I was almost killed.

85
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:12,760
Rym: I was almost run off the road by a tractor trailer on Monday and on Friday when I tried to drive to work people were passing me in the median.

86
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,319
Scott: I think you mixed your Friday and Monday, but that's fun.

87
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,466
Rym: No, I'm talking about my commutes.

88
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,800
Rym: I'm not talking about what happened Friday or what happened today.

89
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:22,587
Scott: No, I think you said Friday.

90
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:23,210
Scott: It doesn't matter.

91
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,977
Scott: What do you switch Friday and Monday?

92
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:25,700
Scott: did I yes?

93
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,466
Scott: You said Monday first, and then you said Friday.

94
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:28,792
Rym: I meant to say Monday first.

95
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,093
Rym: okay as in this previous Monday I was starting now and going backwards through time.

96
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:39,499
Rym: Ah all right Because one of those events happened on one of those days and what happened on the other day, okay, okay?

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,154
Rym: Anyway, I almost died and it wasn't worth it if I went 55 on the taconic.

98
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,939
Rym: I would probably not be here now.

99
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,052
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean those traffickers going faster than I was comfortable going.

100
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,818
Rym: and for people who know how fast I Drive.

101
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,199
Rym: That's scary Like real scary, that's really scary.

102
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:58,280
Rym: So I was speeding whatever.

103
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:09,353
Rym: But the reason I bring it up Is that Hillary Clinton who I've been kind of 50/50 on in terms of her political views for a while Yeah, similar here like oh, she's doing this.

104
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,519
Scott: She's doing that.

105
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,588
Rym: Video games all the bad stuff.

106
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:16,700
Rym: She does is very obviously pandering to the idiot vote.

107
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:23,778
Rym: Yeah, like I see her trying things and like saying oh I'm going to push for this and then failing on purpose because she does a lot of things that aren't visible.

108
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,260
Scott: like did you know?

109
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,900
Scott: She's on the Banking Committee in the Senate.

110
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:32,000
Scott: Nothing she does concerning banking is made public or pronounced very loudly because no one knows or cares.

111
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,440
Rym: No one knows or cares except for banks, but when she says something about video games, there's a brouhaha.

112
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:42,160
Scott: Yeah, so anything she does where there's a brouhaha is always something stupid and I'm 90% of the time against it.

113
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:46,771
Rym: Yeah, and most of the time I'm pretty sure she's against it, too I can't tell and it doesn't matter.

114
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:52,858
Scott: but as long as she's saying it That's how she's gonna vote and that whether she's actually against it or not doesn't matter now.

115
00:07:53,019 --> 00:08:00,650
Rym: today She did something that I have mixed feelings about but I Think this is pretty much the last nail in the coffin of.

116
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,672
Rym: she cannot be nominated by the Democrats to run in 2008 For anything she wants.

117
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,120
Rym: Well, she could probably stay in the Senate.

118
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,740
Rym: You know how hard it is to get kicked out of the Senate?

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,225
Scott: Yeah, but she's the New York Senate.

120
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,451
Scott: so I can vote for the other guy.

121
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:12,877
Rym: you can no one else will.

122
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:13,460
Rym: that's fine.

123
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,447
Rym: Besides the other guy is probably a Republican.

124
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,773
Scott: I'm gonna vote for the third guy.

125
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:17,897
Rym: There's no third guy.

126
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:18,680
Scott: Tommy G party.

127
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,710
Rym: Nah, yeah, they're kind of cool.

128
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,715
Rym: I guess they're.

129
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,128
Scott: they're not great But they're better than the other schmucks.

130
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,541
Rym: Yeah, there's really no political party I like.

131
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:31,136
Rym: I mean the libertarians are the closest thing to what I want except they're a little batshit.

132
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,280
Scott: They're crazy bad.

133
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:37,999
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I really don't like the way our schools are in this country And I have a lot of beef with the public education system.

134
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:44,502
Scott: But the answer is not to abolish it and the answer is not to put a bunch of money into it or take a bunch Of money out.

135
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:48,695
Scott: Yeah, the answer is to change it dramatically to something new.

136
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:56,159
Rym: like the right-wingers want You know a police state and the libertarians want no police and neither one of those is going to work.

137
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,848
Rym: Nope, the left-wingers want communism.

138
00:08:58,868 --> 00:08:59,651
Rym: That's not going to work.

139
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,337
Scott: I but the Democrats want something else.

140
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,200
Scott: They want a whole.

141
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,205
Scott: They want the same police.

142
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,152
Scott: you've got now only really inefficient.

143
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:10,248
Rym: I mean while the Republicans want the same police We've got now only costing less.

144
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,319
Rym: Yeah, but actually costing more but doing more.

145
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,695
Rym: Or well, really they want doing more and costing more.

146
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:26,060
Scott: Yeah Well, the Republicans say they want costing less they want doing more But they actually end up paying more because they want the doing more than they want the paying less.

147
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,320
Scott: They just say the paying less.

148
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,340
Rym: It's really scary to me that now when I think back to the days of Newt Gingrich Republicans, I think back fondly.

149
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:46,819
Scott: Yeah If I would have told you that like, you know, I mean when Clinton was in office I mean like I wasn't like all this is terrible, but you know, I wasn't like hooray for Bill Clinton.

150
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,315
Rym: Hooray I was like I was but that's a whole other story.

151
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:49,940
Rym: It's all our story.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,760
Scott: I was just like all right this guy, you know, whoever was the president I always was like and president sucks no matter who it was, you know.

153
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:05,303
Scott: But now if you would have told me now I would have been like goddamn whatever amendment number that was Let's throw it out.

154
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:09,575
Rym: Yeah, throw it out cuz then Bush will run again against Clinton and Clinton win.

155
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:11,273
Rym: Yeah, I Really?

156
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,040
Scott: It's really only two people ever to run for president FDR and Clinton who could just win win win win win every time.

157
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,496
Scott: Well, I guess maybe JFK but JFK could have.

158
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:20,080
Scott: he died.

159
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:34,880
Rym: I still love that one Photoshop where it shows Fox News then it shows the JFK assassination and the Fox News scroller says John F Kennedy dead of apparent suicide Just to make fun of Fox News cuz they've been in the news lately.

160
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:40,187
Rym: Yeah, anyway my news All right, Hillary Clinton's new thing.

161
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:45,360
Rym: Is that to save money on gas costs and to save lives, but that's secondary to it.

162
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:48,999
Rym: She thinks that we should go back to the 55 mile an hour speed limit.

163
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,667
Rym: now new Whatever your feelings are on speed limits.

164
00:10:55,048 --> 00:11:04,703
Rym: I can tell you with certainty that there is only one demographic of voters who will approve of this people over the age of 65 and Even some of them.

165
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:08,160
Scott: I have one grandma who goes slow and one grandma who goes fast?

166
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:14,388
Scott: Yeah So the grandma who goes fast isn't gonna like it only the slow Grandmas and grandpas are gonna like.

167
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:17,360
Scott: and oh and those people who don't want swings on the playground?

168
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,429
Scott: Oh, yeah, those people don't like speed limits either.

169
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,197
Rym: Well, I they like speed limits.

170
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:21,880
Rym: They like them a lot.

171
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,093
Scott: I mean, yeah, they don't like high speed limits.

172
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,139
Scott: They like low ones.

173
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:38,099
Rym: Now on FARC I saw in fact, I'm gonna link to the FARC article on this because I know it won't go away I saw perhaps the most perfect awesome rebuttal to the argument that the speed limit is too high ever.

174
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:44,549
Rym: It shows a picture of a United States freeway from 1957 or 58.

175
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:58,047
Rym: I was waiting for that and It shows the speed limit sign and the speed limit sign says minimum speed 40 maximum speed 80 and the caption above this picture says This is from back or no.

176
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:16,772
Rym: It says if cars that had drum brakes really powerful v8 engines No airbags no crumple zones No seat belts crap headlights crap tires and large heavy steel frames and no suspension of any reasonable ability can go 80 dot dot dot.

177
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:23,765
Rym: I agree, yeah cars are a lot safer now and Studies show like numerous.

178
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:29,000
Rym: numerous studies show that lowering the speed limit to 55 greatly increased the accident and fatality rate.

179
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:35,280
Rym: States that have raised their speed limit since then have seen dramatic decreases in accidents and deaths on the roads.

180
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,546
Scott: Because what had on a day on a highway?

181
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:43,664
Scott: we're talking about highways here not other roads because rural roads are death traps, basically Statistically speaking.

182
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:51,929
Rym: Yep, and if your road is outside houses or schools or real like hospital nun zones 25 miles an hour is perfectly reasonable.

183
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:53,435
Rym: And if you speed there you're an asshat.

184
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:54,620
Rym: That's not what we're talking about.

185
00:12:54,861 --> 00:13:00,999
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about roads with many lanes like interstates that are mostly straight and you know roads like.

186
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:06,400
Scott: What's a good example of a road that's not an interstate that's real big like the merit Parkway.

187
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,109
Rym: Yeah, however, not the taconic Parkway.

188
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,640
Rym: Yeah, that's the speed limit of the taconic Parkway should stay at 55.

189
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,387
Scott: There's because there's a kind of part.

190
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:14,949
Scott: we could be 65.

191
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,937
Scott: There's people on it drive with 90.

192
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:17,077
Scott: God.

193
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:24,031
Rym: Well, there's one section where should be about 45. it goes Like this crazy winding yeah.

194
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:25,900
Scott: Yeah, but you know you get different parts of the road.

195
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,108
Scott: That's that's okay.

196
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:33,780
Scott: on a major interstate road You know people the danger doesn't come from going fast or going slow.

197
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:38,220
Scott: The danger comes from people driving different speeds from each other.

198
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:48,600
Scott: So if everyone drove 90 it would be safer than if some people drove 70 and some people drove 55. now if somehow magically everyone drove 55 it would be just as safe.

199
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,362
Scott: It wouldn't matter.

200
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,451
Scott: The thing is a lot of cars.

201
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:58,380
Scott: It's just not reasonable to stay going 55 Especially when you're trying to get somewhere.

202
00:13:59,082 --> 00:13:59,965
Rym: I mean people's like.

203
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,129
Rym: I remember driver's ed.

204
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:06,205
Rym: a lot of people I remember Scott told me this story where they would basically tell kids Yeah, speeding doesn't get you there any faster.

205
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:07,067
Scott: Yes, it does.

206
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,371
Rym: I've caught about.

207
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:14,969
Rym: I've probably saved several weeks worth of lifetime By speeding on every road trip I've ever been on.

208
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,257
Scott: think about this if I go on route 90, right?

209
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,214
Scott: It's like a six hour trip to Rochester.

210
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:24,500
Scott: following the speed limit I can make it a four and a half hour trip by stepping on the gas.

211
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:36,650
Scott: Yeah, I'm going 80 or 90 that's an hour and a half and if I go round trip Three hours of saved time by speeding It's just completely unreasonable for me to go.

212
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,375
Scott: the speed limit of 55 slash 65 the entire way.

213
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,509
Scott: Not only that, but I wouldn't.

214
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:44,119
Scott: it's just stupid.

215
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:45,823
Rym: Now.

216
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:58,603
Rym: of course people will still drive somewhat slower in some cases but you just have to have the European style of driving where you stay to the right in a two-lane road you stay to the Right and if you're going faster than everyone you go to the left and if someone comes behind you in the left lane you get Out of their way.

217
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,760
Rym: Mm-hmm and a three-lane road you cruise in the middle.

218
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,792
Rym: The right lane is for trucks and merging the left lane is for speeding.

219
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:08,491
Rym: Yep in a four-lane road You follow the pattern there.

220
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:14,431
Rym: Yep Yeah, this 50 regardless 55 mile an hour thing's not gonna fly.

221
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:17,160
Rym: the vast majority of Americans don't like speed limits.

222
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:26,700
Scott: the other thing is that truck drivers want to get places as fast as Possible because that means they can do more jobs in less time and get paid more money and live better lives.

223
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,972
Scott: Yep In fact, if only limits go down they get mad pissed off.

224
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:36,035
Rym: the last time this happened when the u.s Instituted its 55 mile an hour nationwide speed limit deal back in what the 70s.

225
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:47,980
Rym: Mm-hmm The truckers unions got together and they put roadblocks rolling roadblocks on almost every freeway in the country driving exactly 55 and it caused mass chaos.

226
00:15:48,573 --> 00:16:05,420
Scott: Yep Imagine if two tractor trailers were on every two-lane interstate in every direction all going exact Exactly the speed limit that there's lines of cars for miles and miles all rolling slowly at 55 Taking hours and hours to get where they're going bumper to bumper.

227
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:16,402
Rym: This is why I think the speed limits are set too low and stupid Because we're now in a situation where if you follow the law to the letter you are more of a danger than if you break It yep.

228
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:21,518
Scott: Now you might say oh, you're only a danger because there's other people on the road going fast.

229
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,302
Scott: Well Yeah This.

230
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:31,640
Scott: the speed limits on roads Should be determined by safety and not by making money.

231
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:37,360
Rym: And also it doesn't remove liability for people who cause accidents because weather and conditions change the road.

232
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:53,864
Rym: So if you're going too fast Like say the speed limits 90 on a road and you're going 90 and it's snowing or you're going 90 and you're driving stupidly And you cause an accident Investigators if the accident is big enough can tell what caused the accident by Investigators.

233
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:57,300
Scott: they can go to a scene of an accident and they know exactly what the hell happened.

234
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,486
Scott: It's a fucking science.

235
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,339
Scott: one of those guys came to my math class once and he's like look at this.

236
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:02,965
Scott: I went to this crime scene.

237
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,315
Scott: I saw a car embedded in this other car at this angle.

238
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:07,920
Scott: the car crumpled this much.

239
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:15,250
Scott: It was this kind of car with these kind of tires that were this worn There was this much tread visible on the street, etc.

240
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,590
Scott: Etc.

241
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:16,031
Scott: Etc.

242
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:17,195
Scott: Here's my math.

243
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:22,000
Scott: Here's my little computer model I used with this little software in the detective office at the police station.

244
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,319
Scott: Here's a video of the accident that no one saw in the middle of the night.

245
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:30,644
Rym: Now my idea is very simple raise the speed limits to I forget the term But it's the

246
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:31,747
Scott: 85% 85%

247
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:47,487
Rym: the 80 so 85 percentile speed limit wherein you have engineers study roads watch the average speed of traffic and Generally with few exceptions the only exceptions being odd non apparent dangers like a road that's windier than it looks or a road that has Blind corners that aren't obvious or things like that.

248
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,332
Scott: There's always crazy exceptions.

249
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:49,994
Scott: Everyone knows.

250
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:52,300
Rym: Yeah, but engineers find those and mark them private separately.

251
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:52,582
Rym: Yes,

252
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,979
Scott: they do usually with big yellow signs with arrows on them

253
00:17:55,281 --> 00:18:02,087
Rym: But in general the safest speed for traffic to go is the speed that currently about 85% of drivers will go if there's no speed Limit,

254
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:12,112
Scott: yep so let's say there's no speed limit on a road only crazy ricers and people with Ferraris and Corvettes are gonna go like 120 150 or as fast as their car can go and you can

255
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,882
Rym: pull those people over anyway for being reckless and Dangering.

256
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:15,525
Scott: well.

257
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:24,540
Scott: and the other thing is if someone's driving a Ferrari and they're driving it properly It's pretty safe for them to go 150 if the road is, you know, straight and flat.

258
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:25,870
Rym: Yeah, of course most roads in the u.s.

259
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:27,301
Rym: Really can't handle 150.

260
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:32,740
Scott: Yeah, especially considering the other cars in the way, but if it's a super like 10-lane road, it's mostly empty.

261
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,511
Scott: Sure, go for it like an Autobahn type road plus.

262
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,760
Rym: I mean all the the stage that have raised the speed limit.

263
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,122
Rym: It's shown that if the speed limit is 55 people tend to drive 65. if the speed limit 65 that tend to drive 75.

264
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,120
Rym: If the speed limit 75 people tend to drive 75 because most people don't want to go faster than that.

265
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,473
Scott: I mean the fastest that I would ever go.

266
00:18:50,513 --> 00:19:02,761
Scott: and like a normal trip to work I mean when I'm going on super long-distance trips on extra empty roads that are real long and straight I'll go 90 or 100 for quite a bit not the whole time because you can't stay at 90 or 100.

267
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,820
Scott: It's not really if you're gonna turn at all.

268
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,340
Scott: It's not really safe or comfortable and you have to constantly, you know control the driving.

269
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,061
Rym: Yeah, you can't just zone out like you do when you're going 55.

270
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:22,777
Scott: Yeah, but if I go down, you know to work the fastest my car ever gets to is 80 You know and the roads 55. but most people are going 70 because it the road is really a 70 75 kind of road.

271
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,746
Scott: That's I feel perfectly safe.

272
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:35,156
Scott: driving 75, you know, I don't have to put a lot of energy into it I can zone out is no risk of really hitting anyone because everyone the left lanes go in that speed.

273
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,219
Scott: It's all good.

274
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:42,240
Scott: Well, I guess we kind of did our show on speeding You know because we're gonna do some other cool stuff in a real show on speeding.

275
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:46,854
Rym: Yeah Interviews and we've been collecting articles and scientific studies for the past several months.

276
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:47,336
Rym: Hmm.

277
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:48,740
Scott: Okay, so I haven't news.

278
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,225
Scott: It's anime related an animated.

279
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,409
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's anime day.

280
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,840
Scott: Hey, so Tokyo pop they make that ball that manga.

281
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:59,235
Scott: They used to make the good manga, but now this makes the good manga signature.

282
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,302
Scott: Yeah signature series All right.

283
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:04,652
Scott: Anyway, Tokyo pop used to put out DVDs.

284
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:14,809
Scott: They have initial D marblade boy GTO reign the Conqueror some other shows But then it didn't work out so well, you know why?

285
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:16,675
Scott: because Tokyo pop always screwed them up.

286
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,223
Rym: Ah Initial D.

287
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:24,860
Scott: If you don't know there's a big debacle about Tokyo pops initial D DVD releases in America.

288
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:30,760
Rym: It's pry in some that one of the worst things ever done to an anime other than possibly warriors of the wind.

289
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:43,338
Scott: Yeah, so what they did is normally when you put a DVD out in America you translate it you make a dub you make some subtitles you put it on DVD a few episodes per disc and You put some extras on there.

290
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:44,965
Scott: you make some DVD menus and you sell it.

291
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:45,930
Scott: It's pretty simple.

292
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:51,746
Scott: Tokyo pop thought it was a good idea to take initial D and remix it.

293
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,203
Scott: what they did is They dubbed it.

294
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,169
Scott: They changed the characters names.

295
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,124
Scott: They changed the amazing superhero beat music to this rap music They hired someone to make.

296
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:02,987
Scott: that's terrible.

297
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,640
Scott: It's terrible like not just because it's rap music.

298
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:08,510
Scott: I like a lot of hip-hop music.

299
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,118
Scott: This is bad music.

300
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:10,560
Scott: bad.

301
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:14,671
Rym: Your music's bad and you should feel bad exactly.

302
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,288
Scott: and all the racing scenes They did.

303
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:28,939
Scott: they basically took 1980s video editors and did like split screens and like wacky color changes and all sorts of quote tricked out effects.

304
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:42,800
Scott: So if you buy initial D on DVD from Tokyo pop You'll notice that when you boot the DVD up the menu says tricked out or standard watch Standard tricked out is an abomination to say the least.

305
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:53,356
Rym: They also edited the tricked-out version the Americanized version and took out various scenes that were inappropriate for whatever reason Scenes that were very important like Papa.

306
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:58,770
Scott: Yep so Tokyo pop really wasn't any good at releasing DVDs.

307
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,440
Scott: So it's not a wonder why they stopped putting out DVDs.

308
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,813
Scott: They stuck to their manga which made them a ton of money.

309
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,079
Scott: good business move.

310
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:11,396
Scott: What Tokyo pop is now done is they have sold their existing DVD titles to Funimation.

311
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:12,339
Scott: who knows how to make DVDs?

312
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:19,999
Scott: So Funimation is going to over the course of the future release GTO marmalade boy initial D, etc.

313
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:33,343
Scott: Tokyo pops previous DVD titles New DVDs that will be rebranded reprised You know reach a changed in basically every way to make them correct Hopefully.

314
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,478
Scott: and the first one they're gonna put out is Street Fury remixed on June 27th.

315
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,513
Scott: So I guess Tokyo pop wasn't making any money off their DVDs anymore.

316
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:42,838
Scott: They sold them all to Funimation.

317
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:49,520
Scott: now Funimation is gonna make money that you know Tokyo pop should have made before if they did things, right, huh?

318
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,892
Scott: So that's if you're a fan of initial D and you already bought the DVDs like me.

319
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:56,537
Rym: Oh, well buy them again.

320
00:22:56,557 --> 00:23:00,968
Scott: Yeah Probably I'm gonna try to see if I can.

321
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,040
Scott: if they do release better DVDs than the ones I have now.

322
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:09,080
Scott: I'll see if I can sell all of mine to buy the newer ones at like a low price.

323
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:10,984
Scott: Hopefully that'll work.

324
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:12,228
Scott: If not, I'll just keep what I got.

325
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,540
Scott: Yeah, I don't have to watch the tricked-out version.

326
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:20,494
Rym: I'm not about to rush out and buy that super new awesome crazy version of Ava.

327
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:22,700
Rym: No, I just bought the Platinum Edition.

328
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,077
Scott: Yeah, who cares about the limited ultra super extra plus edition with the t-shirts and it comes with a jacket?

329
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:30,743
Scott: yeah leather jacket I don't know.

330
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:31,347
Scott: It's crazy.

331
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:35,612
Rym: It's two hundred and fifty dollars I could buy.

332
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:40,986
Scott: what a PSP For 50 bucks more.

333
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,532
Scott: you go buy the low-end Xbox 360 for what?

334
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:46,565
Rym: $350 more.

335
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:48,233
Rym: I could buy the crappy ps3.

336
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:56,520
Scott: we could buy Mario soccer and Mario baseball and have a hundred and fifty dollars left over for what?

337
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,546
Rym: $550 more I could buy.

338
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,735
Rym: and a PlayStation 3 in Europe.

339
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:03,144
Rym: Yeah All right.

340
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:03,745
Rym: All right.

341
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,492
Rym: enough making fun of Sony for 250.

342
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:09,119
Scott: We could buy a we a we or a box of Ava.

343
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:22,027
Rym: So once again my thing of the day is old old old.

344
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:25,730
Scott: I guess you're just not good at finding things of the day anymore.

345
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,724
Scott: So you're digging up the old dregs from before the GeekNights existed.

346
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:38,495
Rym: I think it's more that in my previous job I was mostly doing development work meaning I sat in front of a computer all day with a Fark RSS feed and I knew what Was going on every second.

347
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:39,479
Rym: now.

348
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,664
Rym: I'm out doing stuff.

349
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,910
Rym: doing stuff means I'm not sitting in front of a computer trolling for links for GeekNights.

350
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:51,393
Scott: so what's gonna happen when eventually you run out of old things of the day to drag up and You know what?

351
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:51,674
Rym: when I'm

352
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:52,558
Scott: not things of the day

353
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:57,167
Rym: when I'm not tired and getting ready for a convention and busy and I have To check the internet when I get home from work

354
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,431
Scott: True

355
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:02,949
Rym: or when I actually fall into a routine at work, I can take a five-minute break to check the internet.

356
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:04,315
Scott: True also.

357
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:04,717
Rym: Yep.

358
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:05,521
Rym: It's all good.

359
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,450
Rym: I'm not giving up GeekNights just cuz I have a job.

360
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,687
Scott: We've had a job the whole time.

361
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:10,990
Scott: We've had.

362
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:18,250
Scott: Why would a different job all of a sudden mean a different story unless we got some sort of night jobs?

363
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:25,590
Rym: Actually, one of our friends on Kate made fun of my away aim away message today Because it's always like working for the man or something like that.

364
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:27,969
Rym: And she said Rym you are the man.

365
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:32,263
Rym: You're a white guy young who makes a lot of money.

366
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,930
Rym: You're the man you're working for yourself.

367
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:35,575
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

368
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:36,036
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:37,019
Rym: I am the man.

370
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,524
Scott: I am also the man.

371
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,570
Rym: We got to keep everyone else down.

372
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,750
Scott: We should just change it instead of GeekNights to the man nights the man nights with the men.

373
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:50,862
Rym: That kind of sounds like some sort of homoerotic porn pie.

374
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:51,786
Scott: just realized that.

375
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:52,167
Scott: yeah, yeah.

376
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:57,805
Scott: So first I make a joke about my mom and then I make a joke about us being gay.

377
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,109
Rym: father rapers.

378
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,590
Scott: Okay, you're supposed to say mother rapers and then I'm supposed to say father.

379
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:07,116
Scott: That's how the joke goes.

380
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:11,934
Rym: I just wanted to say father rapers father rapers It's fun to say that.

381
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:13,660
Rym: yeah father rapers.

382
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,282
Scott: Why he says it.

383
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:18,096
Scott: Yeah, I mean, okay Thing of the day think of it.

384
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,704
Rym: I got a thing because that's what the music was.

385
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:34,389
Rym: So my thing of the day is I We've talked about the Radis call off and on.

386
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,586
Rym: we've never talked about him in any sort of Informative capacity.

387
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,013
Scott: Well, let's do so.

388
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:54,040
Rym: the Radis call episode 1 appeared a long fuck time ago like late 90s like late high school for last millennia Back when stick death was awesome.

389
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,545
Scott: Stick death is my thing of the day for tomorrow.

390
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:57,267
Scott: Oh my god.

391
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:11,800
Rym: when you when flash was flash and director was director Back when if someone made a flash animation a million everyone in the world would watch it because it was awesome And there were like six of them on the internet and everyone used shockwave and flash was insane.

392
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:21,349
Scott: You had to wait for it to load shockwave calm Back when games like Pico's adventure Or Lenny loose jocks.

393
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:27,841
Rym: Oh my god pushin Brown pushin Brown I Mean.

394
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:33,680
Rym: this is back in the time of the internet when you used ICQ or AOL instant messenger.

395
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:40,980
Rym: And if you used ICQ and use Netscape three gold random people would message you and you talk to them because they were cool.

396
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:44,339
Scott: Is anyone using the internet in the 90s had to be cool?

397
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,798
Scott: Yeah, everyone stupid people in those days using it.

398
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:49,958
Rym: I mean back then not even all the AOLers were really on the internet.

399
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:53,371
Scott: yet No fully and half the AOLers are cool now.

400
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:55,680
Scott: anyone using AOL still these days is just stupid.

401
00:27:56,021 --> 00:28:00,118
Rym: So this guy Joe sparks made radis skull and devil doll.

402
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,690
Scott: now This is pretty much the premier flash animation.

403
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,418
Scott: We wouldn't have things like homestar runner if we didn't have radis skull.

404
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:15,396
Rym: now It was just this one silly contrived kind of goonie But yet awesome because it was the 90s flash thing about the radis skull.

405
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:16,240
Rym: who will kill you all?

406
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:25,210
Scott: It was a short cartoon where a giant floating skull floats up and a little tiny double comes and they're like hey I am the radis skull blah blah blah.

407
00:28:25,391 --> 00:28:26,876
Rym: and it was just silly and over-the-top.

408
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:27,899
Scott: and they did a rap.

409
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:05,982
Rym: It was really popular and later the song was pretty good.

410
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:08,230
Rym: Yeah, it's that kind of rap that I really like.

411
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,675
Rym: You know Beastie Boys kind of deal.

412
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:11,160
Scott: It's not like the Beastie Boys.

413
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:12,686
Rym: No, it's like some of the Beastie Boys.

414
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:13,930
Scott: No, not really.

415
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,494
Scott: No, yeah.

416
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:15,916
Scott: No.

417
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:18,527
Scott: Yeah, but it's much better than the initial D rap.

418
00:29:18,668 --> 00:29:20,677
Scott: God Much much better.

419
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,389
Scott: They should have hired Joe sparks to do it.

420
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:26,030
Rym: So he kept making episodes and they got better and better.

421
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,829
Scott: Yeah episode two is particularly good with the Halloween II.

422
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:36,590
Scott: Yeah, and so is the episode the rock heart episode in which there is some cg's in the background.

423
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:41,770
Scott: I guess it's all technically CG, but 3d cg's and radis skull has an awesome dream.

424
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:46,270
Rym: Oh my god radis skulls dream was probably the funniest thing to come out of the early days of the internet.

425
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:50,204
Scott: It doesn't help that the song in the rock heart episode is also probably the best song.

426
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:54,138
Rym: Yeah, it's a good song of its own merit Yep, and the lyrics are very clever.

427
00:29:54,258 --> 00:30:02,512
Rym: Yes any person has my favorite line and all of radis skull But the head off a dove in the tunnel of love.

428
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:03,215
Scott: That's a good one.

429
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,460
Scott: There's also the.

430
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:08,809
Rym: We laugh just thinking about the radis skull.

431
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,252
Scott: yeah, it was.

432
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:11,522
Scott: it was like Huh?

433
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:16,075
Rym: It was like I don't have a heart or any other body parts.

434
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:16,476
Rym: That's the.

435
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:17,940
Rym: I don't understand love.

436
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:30,311
Scott: Yeah, cuz he's just a giant floating skull and he's saying I have a heart or any other body parts And the little devil's like but I do Because he's actually has a whole body.

437
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,120
Scott: I'll warn you this angel thing.

438
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:34,480
Rym: Well, I want two little bits of trivia one bit of trivia.

439
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,106
Rym: Is that the the devil doll?

440
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:43,059
Rym: when he's dancing every time he yells or something his face like sort of Slowly morphs back into him smiling again.

441
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:48,095
Rym: That was a mistake that Joe sparks didn't correct and then he realized it and it looked good.

442
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:48,677
Rym: So we kept it.

443
00:30:49,279 --> 00:31:03,140
Rym: Yep, and - if you don't find this amusing one, you're a punk kid and Yep - just watch this and try to pretend that none of those memes you've seen have existed yet.

444
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,320
Rym: I mean, this is the early days of awesome internet things before all the other things that they existed.

445
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,304
Scott: There was radis skull.

446
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:10,970
Rym: This is internet protoculture.

447
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:17,940
Scott: This was I think this is pre all your base I believe so it could have been because it was that early, you know.

448
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,633
Rym: Well, I'll have to verify that later to find out I'm not entirely sure.

449
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:26,400
Scott: so I'm not gonna commit either way Yeah, but I think this is either pre all your base or right around the same damn time.

450
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:32,099
Rym: Yeah, this is old shit man old shit and you can get all the mp3s at the site.

451
00:31:32,347 --> 00:31:32,498
Scott: Yep.

452
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,809
Scott: The other thing about you have to know about radis skull is that they don't finish the story because of a stupid Copyright thing that we're not gonna get into.

453
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,211
Scott: Yes.

454
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:57,173
Scott: Joe sparks has an official website You can visit to find out more about his other things and radis skull and you can also purchase The radis skull book which contains the script of the final episode as well as some radis skull comics And I'm still waiting for the book to come from Amazon.

455
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,479
Scott: Maybe I should go check on that.

456
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:11,070
Rym: Yeah cuz the plight actually grows a plot and the plots about as clever as a show about a giant floating skull who wraps can be And the wraps in every episode are awesomes cuz the radis skull likes to kick it.

457
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:17,191
Scott: Yeah Okay, I have another anime thing great.

458
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,500
Scott: The anime thing of the day is this girl's website.

459
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,092
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's a girl's website only.

460
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:24,471
Scott: girls draw like gum gum gum pins and stickers.

461
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:34,973
Scott: now if you've ever been to a anime convention in artist alley many people sell pins and stickers and these are often hot buys because Number one, they're cheap and people are poor.

462
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:38,066
Scott: number two They're cute and people like cute things.

463
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:41,597
Scott: and number three there you can use them right away.

464
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:43,523
Scott: people love to buy stuff They can use right away.

465
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:49,505
Rym: I have a sticker or pin or button or something on every con badge with few exceptions I've ever gotten.

466
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,840
Rym: that's how I remember which con was which yep.

467
00:32:52,041 --> 00:33:00,592
Scott: every Otakon I go to I buy some sort of stickers in the artist alley and put them in my little con badge holder or Some sort of pin and put it on the lanyard or something like that.

468
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:08,355
Scott: Well, this girl gum gum is one of the best drawing of cute characters I've ever seen.

469
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,939
Scott: It's not the best but it's up there.

470
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:13,063
Rym: Yeah I mean a lot of her.

471
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:17,345
Rym: once you look at a lot of her art at all kind of looks the same as I'm sorry That's end to be of course.

472
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:20,979
Rym: I just particularly like her little picture of foo from.

473
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:30,299
Scott: She's the only one I've ever seen turn Tetsuo from Akira with his blobby arm full of you know nastiness into something cute.

474
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,519
Scott: So that's a big plus.

475
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:36,359
Scott: Now at this site you can buy of course pins and stickers.

476
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:48,469
Scott: So if you've never been to an anime convention artist alley or if you really really like pins and stickers from anime and video games And you don't go to conventions You can't get them or whatever your situation may be.

477
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:57,227
Scott: if you want to buy pins and stickers containing cute characters from anime and video games Go to this website Now.

478
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,200
Scott: really cheap and awesome.

479
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:08,219
Rym: We weren't paid to shill or anything because we're actually going to do an episode soon on shilling because we've been getting Emails from people who want us to shill their dreck on GeekNights.

480
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:13,800
Scott: We will not shill your dreck on GeekNights unless a you pay us a great deal of money.

481
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,780
Scott: But even then we will tell people that we were paid a great deal of money and that we are shilling you because of it.

482
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:30,126
Scott: Yeah, or be your stuff is legitimately good And then we want to shill it anyway Whether you told us to or not now to major retailers and/or video game Manufacturers and creators.

483
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:37,172
Rym: if you send us things to review we will review them thoroughly And honestly, I thoroughly is my word.

484
00:34:37,193 --> 00:34:37,936
Rym: I'm sticking to it.

485
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:39,179
Scott: My word is honestly.

486
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:48,091
Scott: So I will accept free things and basically sending us free things is a way to guarantee that we will review them in some way.

487
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:53,520
Scott: So if you're of the mind that all press is good press send free shit to Scott.

488
00:34:55,163 --> 00:34:57,034
Rym: That was the most diplomatic way to say that.

489
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:05,047
Rym: yep If you are of the mind wait a minute, I've got it, this is a slightly Obscure inside joke, but I'm sure Scott will get it.

490
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,099
Rym: I am confident that this box contains cell phones.

491
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:22,555
Scott: How much laughter we gonna put in the show.

492
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:26,612
Rym: I'm not gonna You know, I've noticed the most radio guys tend to just leave all that in.

493
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:29,739
Rym: plus we don't edit the show anymore, so whatever All right.

494
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:40,039
Scott: So If you send us free things we will review them But we will review them honestly and give our honest opinions of whatever you send us.

495
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:50,857
Scott: So if your stuff sucks You might not want to send it to us and if your stuff is awesome and you know that we'll say awesome things about it Sending it might be a good idea because then our audience will buy it

496
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:56,501
Rym: though I know that if I was just told this by a podcast I listen to I would send them a small box with poo in It

497
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:57,766
Scott: of course

498
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:00,720
Rym: because that's the obvious thing you do to someone who asks you to send them thing.

499
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,166
Scott: We can do an episode on poo.

500
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,275
Rym: I could do an episode on poo.

501
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:05,079
Rym: Let me tell you what.

502
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:07,750
Scott: yeah You were like a poop report reading fiend.

503
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,260
Rym: for like a year poop report was a great website.

504
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,891
Rym: I don't know if it's still up there, but that would to go check.

505
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,534
Rym: Yes.

506
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:14,097
Rym: Are you checking?

507
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:14,177
Rym: yep?

508
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,039
Rym: All right poop report is gonna be a thing of the day sometime in the future.

509
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:21,906
Scott: Spoop report calm right I think.

510
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:25,460
Rym: so there it is still there with the brown background still there.

511
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,078
Rym: They review toilet paper among other things.

512
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,966
Rym: Alright alright, so it's anime day whoo.

513
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,573
Rym: It's not monkey Tuesday for us.

514
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:35,015
Scott: No.

515
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:35,777
Scott: It's not okay.

516
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:36,479
Scott: It's not even Tuesday.

517
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:36,960
Scott: It's Wednesday.

518
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,633
Scott: Yeah, I only heard monkey Tuesday on Wednesday.

519
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:44,239
Rym: cuz I get those shows a day late Yep, and I no longer hear him on the radio because I'm not driving at 2 o'clock.

520
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,746
Rym: Yeah, or whenever that show was.

521
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:46,590
Scott: you have an iPod yet.

522
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:51,352
Scott: Yeah, I'm getting one soon alright, so We're gonna review two anime for you today.

523
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:51,936
Scott: preview.

524
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:57,694
Rym: well pre That's right cuz you've only seen one episode of each one And I think they're both good enough to where we're going to talk about them again.

525
00:36:57,714 --> 00:36:58,378
Rym: Are we?

526
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,544
Scott: Planning on watching much.

527
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,152
Rym: I'm gonna watch both of them to the end.

528
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:03,197
Scott: alright good for you.

529
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,013
Scott: alright I think that these shows were of the variety where once you've seen one episode.

530
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,819
Scott: You've pretty much seen most of the show.

531
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,350
Rym: I Don't know about one of them because the second one we're gonna talk about is alright Yeah, but one more so than the other.

532
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,520
Rym: yeah what they both have the potential.

533
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:21,913
Rym: But if the potential is not realized the shows will be only met.

534
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:29,940
Rym: yep, but alright It's worth it to watch the first episode of both of these shows yes, and it'll probably be worth it to watch more.

535
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,666
Rym: But if you're hedging your bets wait until we talk about it later after I watch it is who knows if I can't guarantee the Whole show is worth it.

536
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,457
Rym: now the first one is our on.

537
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:41,091
Scott: hi Well, it's our on high school host club.

538
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:46,811
Scott: now when you first see this show Just looking at the title you say the alarm bells go off.

539
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,818
Scott: Yeah, we it's yeah, we.

540
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,164
Scott: oh my god everything.

541
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:58,498
Scott: everything is pink and purple and Sparkly and every care and flowery with pretty boys and pretty girls in a pretty school for rich kids.

542
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:07,779
Rym: yeah We owe we owe we owe we like you can't imagine like imagine, Utah Where's you know someone standing there, and then rose blossoms go by multiply that by a million and?

543
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,859
Scott: Somehow despite all this the show actually isn't yaoi.

544
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,927
Rym: Not only is it not yaoi.

545
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,012
Rym: It is hilarious.

546
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,040
Scott: It is pretty funny.

547
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,054
Scott: It's the funniest show I've seen in quite a while.

548
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:21,020
Rym: and the first episode.

549
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,926
Rym: We can't even spoil the first episode because there is a humorous thing that happens in it With the light bulbs.

550
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:32,089
Scott: Oh, I want to make a reference to another show to say what it's like But then I think that might spoil it.

551
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:34,420
Rym: yeah, that's why this is a preview.

552
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,231
Rym: We really try to avoid ruining anything unless the show's crap.

553
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,319
Rym: There was no key rape in this show.

554
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:44,219
Scott: Let me say this without trying to spoil the first we're trying not to spoil the first episode.

555
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:49,319
Scott: Imagine if there's a show and you know in a Hitchcock movie the twist comes at the end, right?

556
00:38:49,880 --> 00:39:03,411
Scott: But in some shows the twist is the whole show and it's there from the beginning like if there's a show about a Car that can actually talk and then that's your example.

557
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,577
Scott: It's the best I could think of without spoiling.

558
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:08,120
Scott: okay now There's two ways to do that.

559
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:15,899
Scott: It's at the end You can be like surprised the car was doing all the talking or for the whole show You say the car can talk the whole time.

560
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:28,925
Scott: This is one of those shows where there's a gimmicky twist thing that is revealed in the first episode And it lasts throughout the show and therefore I think it's gonna wear off Because the gimmick is only.

561
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:32,459
Rym: I mean the gimmick was hilarious, but it was only one part of all that was going on.

562
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:37,560
Scott: It's true, but I don't know if the rest of it maybe if it was only like a 13 episode show it'd be perfect.

563
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:39,427
Scott: I don't know how many episodes it is.

564
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:42,980
Rym: Yeah, cuz I worry it'll fall into honey or a dango syndrome.

565
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:46,311
Rym: Yeah, honey or a dango was awesome And I watched a lot of.

566
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:50,456
Scott: it is pretty awesome But it's a manga and anime and a live-action and a movie.

567
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:50,838
Scott: I think.

568
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:56,855
Rym: yeah I think so But as the show goes on it gets less and less awesome in my opinion and more and more just.

569
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,300
Rym: alright god damn it end.

570
00:39:58,822 --> 00:40:00,290
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I saw this before.

571
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,878
Rym: oh she likes the guy.

572
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,728
Rym: oh Yeah, like it just doesn't go anywhere.

573
00:40:04,848 --> 00:40:07,820
Rym: our on has the potential to be really funny and stay funny.

574
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,043
Rym: It depends on how they execute it.

575
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:19,033
Scott: if they can keep making every episode as good as the first one instead of just sort of Slowly moving the plot along while making the same jokes over and over.

576
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,840
Scott: It'll be an awesome hilarious show.

577
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:29,624
Rym: It makes fun of Shonen eyeshows shoujo anime and fangirls Simultaneously Yep, sure does.

578
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:35,540
Rym: and it has a scene that is perhaps the most perfect representation of a maximized fangirl.

579
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,040
Rym: The world has ever seen this boy?

580
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:38,522
Rym: I think it's.

581
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:56,220
Rym: I forget exactly which character to involve but a boy was being real cute and possibly Almost shown in IE with another boy and these two girls are sitting there next to him Just kind of talking and watching Mm-hmm and they do something like really like the kind of thing that sets a fangirl off like crazily and It pans over to other characters talking.

582
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:03,440
Rym: but in the background you see these two girls and they're leaning toward each other with their hands like clasped in front of their necks like II and They're.

583
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:10,160
Rym: they have these huge like XD smiles and their heads turn bright red and they're rolling back and forth on their necks going.

584
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:20,630
Scott: Yep Yeah, so the show is about this rich rich school where rich rich kids go.

585
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:28,584
Scott: They have a host club which is where a host club is if you don't know is the thing that's common in yaoi shows And I don't know if it actually exists in Japan.

586
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:33,990
Scott: Although I'm sure it does Where a bunch of guys get together and will host ladies.

587
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:35,788
Rym: It's that simple.

588
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:51,121
Scott: yeah, so ladies will go to the host club and say I would like to be hosted by that member of the host club and then that member of the host club will host them in sort of a Geisha but with genders reverse sort of way.

589
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:58,099
Rym: So this poor kid accidentally runs afoul of the host club and ends up join.

590
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:05,401
Scott: poor kid is looking around the rich school because he goes there and ends up stumbling in into the host club room.

591
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:10,269
Scott: and things happen when he stumbles in there and They forced him to join the host club.

592
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:12,355
Rym: It makes fun of every stereotype.

593
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:17,850
Rym: like there's the typical bishonen guy and it shows him like talking about how he does his bishonen poses.

594
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:21,122
Rym: He's like I posed like this and then like this and I stand by the flowers.

595
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:26,465
Scott: and then there's the real the tiny kid for The girls who like little boys who's actually a senior in high school.

596
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:31,583
Scott: Yeah And then there's the the tall dark quiet guy.

597
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:36,021
Rym: There's the two twin brothers who pretend to be all Shown and I yaoi.

598
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,110
Rym: so they get the girls.

599
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:42,749
Scott: Yep, it's just they got them all the whole run-of-the-mill and they make jokes about each and every one.

600
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:44,888
Rym: It is hilarious.

601
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:48,350
Rym: Trust us watch this show at least one episode.

602
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,197
Rym: you'll laugh your ass even if you start.

603
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:57,996
Scott: if you're a guy and you watch the first few seconds of the show and you start to Feel really girly and you don't want to continue Continue it's worth it.

604
00:42:58,398 --> 00:42:59,021
Rym: We're not kidding.

605
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:00,730
Rym: We'll tell you if a show is bad.

606
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:01,373
Scott: Here's the thing.

607
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,490
Scott: If you're not really big on anime, this is not a show for you.

608
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,030
Scott: This is a show for people who are already anime fans because it's like an anime parody.

609
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:13,310
Scott: Yeah, the same way the Holy Grail isn't as funny if you don't know about King Arthur.

610
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,770
Scott: Yeah, this is not as funny if you don't know anime because it's making fun of anime.

611
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,387
Rym: Yeah, like if you've never seen any anime.

612
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:26,784
Rym: Excel saga or Combustible campus guard s guard dress just seems stupid because you don't get it.

613
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:28,310
Rym: Yeah, why is this weird?

614
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:28,973
Scott: You will only.

615
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:31,510
Scott: this is show first here for anime fans.

616
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:37,170
Scott: You want to be a super anime fan, but if you're any kind of anime fan at all this show will make you pee your pants.

617
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:41,130
Scott: So watch it with as many anime fans in the room as possible.

618
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,986
Rym: Yes, if there is an anime club near you showing it go see it with them.

619
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:47,844
Scott: Yep I think the Metro anime club in New York City is showing it.

620
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:48,607
Rym: Yeah.

621
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:51,550
Scott: Yeah I think they're already on episode like three or four or something.

622
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,339
Rym: Now the other show that we watched.

623
00:43:54,459 --> 00:44:05,919
Rym: actually we watched a whole bunch of shows and they were all For the most part above the line of watching at least a little bit more which was amazing after all the crap we've seen Yep, but we'll continue to watch some of them.

624
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,380
Rym: Yep.

625
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,286
Rym: The other show that we're gonna talk about today.

626
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:12,618
Scott: However is Rick R EC as in recording but only wreck.

627
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,954
Rym: now it looks from the opener like a yippie showjoey Semi romantic comedy.

628
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:19,577
Scott: That's what I thought.

629
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:23,110
Scott: I thought it was gonna be a yippy it be girly show based on the opener.

630
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:28,554
Rym: It is actually a fairly serious and realistic Romantic comedy.

631
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:28,976
Scott: Yep.

632
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:36,006
Scott: Now in the opener you see like a tree with a cat head and you're like, alright there's the cute creature for the show.

633
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:40,209
Scott: and But then you see a picture sort of like koto cha but a little grown-up.

634
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:43,245
Scott: Yeah, that's what it looked like from the opener.

635
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:47,750
Rym: now They show a picture in the opener of Audrey Hepburn from Roman holiday.

636
00:44:47,917 --> 00:45:04,428
Rym: Mm-hmm I didn't get that in the first go around and the first episode one the characters watch Roman holiday in the theater Mm-hmm, then the basic basic basic plot and scenes from Roman holiday reoccur in the show.

637
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:09,503
Rym: Like the show parallels Roman holiday in the way that an English teacher would shit would say.

638
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:11,388
Rym: that show parodies that movie.

639
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:17,102
Rym: Yeah And it doesn't really well and the show is really just kind of.

640
00:45:17,122 --> 00:45:24,369
Rym: I guess it's it's more classy Normal humor as opposed to you know XD or on high anime humor.

641
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:37,127
Scott: Yeah, so Roman holiday If you don't know is this movie about the supporter who goes to Rome because there's a princess visiting there who's gonna do some sort of speech thing.

642
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:46,225
Scott: and Somehow he ends up with the princess in his bedroom And he's like hotel and he doesn't know she's the princess.

643
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,874
Scott: and then halfway through the movie He finds out she is.

644
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:54,052
Scott: and then at the end of the movie she finds out he is and it's it's really good and really Old.

645
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:55,382
Rym: yeah, it's one of my favorite movies.

646
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:56,108
Rym: I really like it.

647
00:45:56,571 --> 00:46:02,159
Scott: It's one of my favorite movies, but it's a good movie and everyone should see it Especially before you see this anime.

648
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:08,610
Scott: if you don't watch if you don't haven't seen Roman holiday And you watch a wreck at least from the first episode you won't know what's going on.

649
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,187
Scott: But it seems like it carries on to the second episode as well even though we haven't seen it.

650
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:14,421
Rym: yep I have really high hopes for the show.

651
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:16,533
Scott: I Don't have the highest hopes.

652
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,363
Scott: I'm just kind of average like good.

653
00:46:19,764 --> 00:46:22,616
Rym: It just seems like a generic good Romantic comedy.

654
00:46:22,918 --> 00:46:28,769
Rym: yep, I don't want to keep calling it that but that's what it is and that's Yeah, there's a guy you know he has a job.

655
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,885
Rym: Remember when the boyfriend for the other girl appears.

656
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:32,690
Scott: Yeah, that was funny.

657
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,621
Scott: So the guy is waiting for a girl outside a movie theater.

658
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:37,206
Scott: instead this other girl shows up.

659
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,150
Scott: Who's the main character?

660
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,675
Scott: I think she's the main character.

661
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:39,875
Rym: Yep.

662
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:40,960
Rym: She's trying to become another.

663
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,903
Scott: hit her the guy.

664
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:53,309
Scott: She's trying to become a say you yeah she's trying to become a voice actor and Instead of you know going with the girl he was waiting for He goes with this wreck girl.

665
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,033
Scott: Her name is wreck.

666
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:55,975
Rym: They don't.

667
00:46:56,156 --> 00:47:01,250
Rym: actually it's funny because they don't actually tell each other their names until a certain scene.

668
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:05,553
Scott: That's right because it's kind of like Roman holiday.

669
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,599
Scott: yeah, they don't know who each other are.

670
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:14,265
Scott: so he goes to see the movie with this girl instead and Then I had his way out of the movie.

671
00:47:14,285 --> 00:47:18,625
Scott: He sees the girl He was waiting for and then he sees this gigantic guy pick her up instead of him.

672
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:26,364
Scott: Oh So he ends up going with this girl and having a good time Even though he's a little bit older than she is, but it's fine.

673
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:31,126
Rym: She's like 20 or something Yep, and then they go home, and then the plot is that all right?

674
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,090
Rym: they live near each other.

675
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:37,450
Rym: And then he's woken up by fire alarms and her apartment building is burned down or houses burned down.

676
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:41,965
Scott: so he takes her in and They hit it off.

677
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:49,019
Rym: And there was a moment where one of our friends Adam was saying he's like Please tell me this doesn't turn into porn.

678
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,028
Rym: please tell me this doesn't turn into porn and it doesn't turn into porn.

679
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:53,083
Scott: It turns into Roman holiday.

680
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,796
Rym: yep But it's very it's more.

681
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:57,302
Rym: It doesn't dance around the issue.

682
00:47:57,323 --> 00:48:00,474
Rym: I mean these are two adults and They do what adults do.

683
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:05,590
Scott: yeah, it's sort of a an open parody like space balls is the Star Wars.

684
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:10,549
Scott: It's like we are parodying this show, but it's not so much a parody as in.

685
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:15,008
Scott: they're Twisting it to make it humorous and wacky so much as that.

686
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:19,725
Scott: there I don't want to say homage because that's not really what it is, but it's.

687
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:22,810
Rym: I guess they're using it as Semi basis for what's going on?

688
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,649
Rym: Yeah, like it's a nice thing you can because you can reference things, but not have to actually do them.

689
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:32,245
Rym: But by referencing them you pull in all that stuff from the movie without having to do anything.

690
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:32,827
Scott: Yep.

691
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:42,889
Scott: Yep yep You can do a lot less stuff in your show just by saying Think about Roman holiday right now, and then you don't do anything in the show because people just thought about it.

692
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:50,729
Scott: If you haven't seen Roman holiday, though You're probably not gonna get anything out of this show cuz you won't know what the hell's going on.

693
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,758
Rym: Yeah, of course if you haven't seen Roman holiday.

694
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:53,682
Rym: You're a terrible person.

695
00:48:54,426 --> 00:48:55,450
Scott: I didn't see it till recently.

696
00:48:55,591 --> 00:49:00,178
Rym: I know I couldn't believe that I put it in Netflix and put it to the top of the queue when I found out Scott Hadn't seen it.

697
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:03,114
Rym: you hadn't seen Something.

698
00:49:03,135 --> 00:49:04,443
Rym: ah the sting there you go.

699
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:08,536
Scott: Yeah Someone makes an anime about the sting.

700
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,025
Rym: then you know I'll go see the sting.

701
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:12,510
Scott: you should see the sting right now.

702
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,116
Scott: It's awesome.

703
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,369
Scott: I can watch it like a hundred times.

704
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,981
Rym: Yeah, I said like you know you know what else you said.

705
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:23,692
Rym: you said in case you don't know I think five times Course.

706
00:49:24,313 --> 00:49:29,569
Rym: I think I finally started to get over my basically blah blah blah blah blah blah basically blah blah blah.

707
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:29,970
Scott: It's fine.

708
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,523
Scott: I had a teacher once who always said in essence in essence.

709
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,134
Rym: I had one teacher who said quintessential Every opportunity.

710
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,203
Scott: Wow I had another tough one.

711
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:40,649
Rym: I had another okay guy.

712
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:47,510
Rym: Okay except he He wouldn't stop saying okay until someone said like acknowledge him in some way.

713
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:53,281
Rym: One time the class was like no one would say he'd be like okay, okay, and some were like yeah And you go and you keep taught teaching.

714
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:57,649
Rym: one day No one said anything, and he stood up the front of the room going okay, okay?

715
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:02,027
Rym: Okay, okay Okay, and then he started teaching.

716
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:05,489
Rym: It was like his brain was broken for a second.

717
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,500
Scott: How do people get jobs teaching?

718
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:10,089
Rym: I don't know - ah?

719
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:14,430
Scott: So we're gonna talk any more about these two anime.

720
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:20,880
Rym: I don't think we really can without either ruining something or talking more than one episode worth of watching can warrant.

721
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:29,100
Scott: I Guess yeah, so or on high school host club and rec are both recommended shows.

722
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:33,740
Scott: rec amended They're not super highly.

723
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:35,127
Scott: oh my god, this is amazing.

724
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:37,356
Scott: recommended They're just great shows.

725
00:50:37,698 --> 00:50:42,315
Rym: they're definitely must watch the first episode of shows Absolutely if nothing else.

726
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:46,831
Scott: watch the first episode if you like it continue to watch and then if you really like it watch to the End.

727
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:50,989
Scott: but of course my guess is that each show?

728
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,061
Scott: Doesn't have 26 episodes worth of stuff in them.

729
00:50:55,221 --> 00:51:02,946
Scott: unless they come up with something to add in Like if rec follows Roman holiday, and when the Roman holiday runs out picks another old movie.

730
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:14,221
Scott: That would be awesome That would be awesome, but if they stick with just Roman holiday They've got ten episodes is a little even stretching it a little bit Unless they just break away from Roman holiday into a show.

731
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:18,275
Scott: that could do that too, but the show has to be good Yeah Which it has the potential to be.

732
00:51:18,335 --> 00:51:20,464
Rym: but we really can't say without seeing more of it.

733
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:34,741
Scott: and our on high school host club if They come up with new jokes And without becoming monotonous can go on for quite a while as long as they can continue to make jokes but More than 13 episodes, I don't think there's that many jokes in existence

734
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:36,265
Rym: to use our favorite phrase.

735
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:41,964
Rym: I am cautiously optimistic And now once again, I'm leaving.

736
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:47,890
Rym: I will be back Monday evening, so I will be on next Monday's GeekNights, but I will not be here tomorrow.

737
00:51:48,515 --> 00:51:53,859
Scott: So whether I make a GeekNights tomorrow Depends on whether I make a GeekNights tomorrow.

738
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,164
Rym: Yeah, we were gonna record it.

739
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:56,970
Scott: You know it'll be an all Scott GeekNights.

740
00:51:57,191 --> 00:52:01,730
Rym: Yep, I've learned that doing an all Rym GeekNights is not easy or trivial.

741
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:04,583
Rym: No, it's not because you feel I mean here.

742
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:05,950
Rym: We're basically just talking to each other.

743
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:08,949
Rym: We act the same way on the show that we acting we have friends over.

744
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:21,030
Scott: When you're just talking on your own to no one It's hard to come up with stuff to say besides Stuff that you would say in a crazy rant or a blog post, but then it's not really appropriate for a podcast.

745
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,750
Scott: You're just talking to yourself.

746
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:27,404
Scott: Plus when you record those kind of things is much better to write down than to say.

747
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:34,730
Rym: the worst thing is when you're recording yourself There's the desire and opportunity to self-edit to go back through and clean up everything.

748
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:36,158
Scott: Well, I wouldn't do that.

749
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,204
Rym: Yeah, but there's the.

750
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:38,170
Rym: there's the temptation.

751
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:42,050
Scott: I don't really have the temptation it because the laziness completely eliminates it.

752
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:46,600
Rym: Ah, I think my laziness is almost overcome by my desire to sound cool.

753
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:48,845
Scott: Oh, I don't really care about sounding cool.

754
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:52,877
Rym: I Know good job.

755
00:52:52,957 --> 00:53:00,889
Rym: I Just got a tape a goddamn pop filter to your face someday, that's no good.

756
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:04,470
Rym: All right, I think we're done.

757
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:11,635
Rym: That's it for tonight's show and if anyone complains about the fact that there may not be a GeekNights tomorrow You can die in a fire.

758
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:14,307
Rym: We've done like God we.

759
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:24,213
Rym: this is episode 115. we have done 116 times about 45 minutes worth of content and Pretty consistently.

760
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:30,956
Scott: I think we've only missed shows when there are conventions and things and then we always make up for it by having awesome Convention recap shows.

761
00:53:31,218 --> 00:53:31,378
Rym: Yep.

762
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:36,221
Rym: I'll definitely have interviews from an amazement Whoo-hoo, and just you wait until Otakon.

763
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:41,143
Scott: we're gonna have a week's worth of coverage about that I two damn weeks of yeah, like the pre Otakon week.

764
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:42,610
Scott: What do we expect to see it Otakon?

00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:43,193
Scott: Well, I don't know.

Scott: what do we expect to do it over at Otakon?

Scott: Is the week after Otakon I'm tired.

00:53:51,052 --> 00:53:53,369
Scott: What happened to a gun, oh my god, I don't remember.

Scott: And Otakon isn't even like e3 is like a stuff to know.

00:54:10,696 --> 00:54:11,581
Rym: We'll figure something out.

00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:17,009
Rym: What might happen is, you know We'll go to an internet cafe and upload mini bits that whole week.

777
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:18,737
Scott: Maybe it will still be able to get.

778
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,128
Scott: oh, no, maybe you can still get wireless out the window.

779
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:21,550
Scott: Who knows?

780
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:23,720

Scott: the geek fables bin will be full and fresh and steaming.

789
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,946
Rym: You realize we could probably do a week just on stories from the previous Otakons.

790
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:56,624
Scott: Oh, yeah That'll be the week the weeks leading up to Otakon.

795
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,530
Rym: We used up the first one, but we didn't tell the whole story.

796
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:16,520
Rym: We just told the story of how some of our for our former Acquaintances were kind of dumb and they made our Otakon less fun.

797
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:19,770
Rym: All right, remember the hotel room fiasco and the driving fiasco?
