1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,148
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 26th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:10,309
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:12,899
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,100
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight because I am actually in Japan.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,801
Rym: We are continuing with our coverage of the new 52, week 2.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:22,989
Scott: Boogaloo.

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,948
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,543
Rym: So as promised, week 2 of the 52.

9
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:35,130
Rym: We'll just go right down the list.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,242
Scott: I can't wait for this to be over.

11
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:36,768
Scott: Alright, so...

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,710
Rym: I feel like week 1 was... better?

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:42,430
Rym: Like, I enjoyed reading week 1.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,129
Scott: According to my... I don't remember, 'cause it's... or I read these a while ago.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,910
Scott: But looking at my little spreadsheet here, week 2 was the worst week by far.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,130
Rym: Week 2 was definitely the worst week.

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,229
Scott: Alright, so let's just go into it.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,790
Scott: The first one was Batman and Robin.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,930
Rym: So here's what pisses me off.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,850
Scott: Yet another Batman book.

21
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:03,367
Rym: Right away.

22
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,790
Rym: Obviously they know Batman is their strongest franchise because Batman is in, like, all these comics.

23
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,202
Scott: Yeah, like 30-40% of the books.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,798
Rym: Every Batman is different.

25
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,190
Rym: Like, way different in how he's presented.

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,950
Rym: And it's kind of annoying.

27
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,690
Scott: It's not the same Batman in all the different books.

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,650
Scott: It's the same thing with the Superman.

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,414
Scott: The action comic.

30
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,770
Scott: Superman was clearly not the Superman in the other books.

31
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,230
Scott: It's like, these are different people here, but you're supposed to try to tell me it's the same person?

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,268
Scott: I can't believe it.

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,570
Rym: The Superman was a little... like, there was too much of him being kind of sardonic and Robin being a punk-ass bitch kid.

34
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:43,770
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you don't know if you're getting Mad Batman or Sad Batman or- I was getting, like, Stern Dad Batman.

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,351
Scott: Right.

36
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,330
Scott: It's like, which one is gonna show up this time?

37
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,430
Scott: You know, I mean, fanfiction does a better job of getting characters right than this.

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,044
Scott: You know, it's like, if I go read, you know, a fanfiction of, say, Spider-Man, it's gonna be Spider-Man.

39
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,649
Rym: Spider-Man having sex with a tiger version of Spider-Man.

40
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:07,470
Scott: Even though he's doing weird things, his personality will be recognizable as Spider-Man.

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,570
Scott: 'Cause, you know, when people do fanfiction, it's 'cause they like the character, and they make the character like the character.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,682
Scott: Here, it's like, who is Batman, really?

43
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:19,430
Scott: What is Batman's personality?

44
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,570
Rym: But a miserable pile of sad.

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,990
Scott: It depends which of the 13 or 14 different books you read, 'cause there's a different Bruce Wayne in each one.

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,750
Rym: At least we know that the worst Batman was from last week on Justice League International.

47
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,229
Rym: That was like Guy in Batman's clothes.

48
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,488
Scott: That was Super Friends Batman.

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,953
Rym: Maybe that's it.

50
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:42,450
Rym: There are like 10 guys who are Batman, and they're all actually different.

51
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,050
Scott: Well, that actually, I think, from what I understand, is there was a Batman Incorporated something, where there were like franchised Batmans.

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,470
Rym: Well, isn't that like Nightwing?

53
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:54,553
Scott: I don't know.

54
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:57,447
Scott: I think that there were actually Batmans who were not Bruce Wayne.

55
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,310
Scott: Is it Batman?

56
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,803
Scott: But the thing is, all of these Batmans are Bruce Wayne.

57
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,670
Scott: Batman Incorporated was like, okay, you're Batman.

58
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,575
Scott: You're another Batman.

59
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,767
Scott: You're Batman Paris or something, but you're not Bruce Wayne.

60
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,990
Scott: These are all supposed to be Bruce Wayne and Batman.

61
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,440
Rym: I guess with this one, the plot started out.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,850
Rym: okay, but I really... I don't need to deal with... Batman dealing with his parents' deaths no longer interests me.

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,261
Scott: Well, that's something I liked in some of the other books.

64
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,170
Scott: It skipped over the origin bullshit.

65
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:31,826
Rym: And it kind of kept like, you know, this is the last time I'm going to celebrate the death.

66
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,190
Rym: I'm going to celebrate the life instead.

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,810
Rym: And that was all neat and good, but it's tired because Batman's a tired old character.

68
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:45,550
Rym: I don't care anymore that he's sad that his parents were killed by whoever killed them, depending on what continuity you're looking at.

69
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,270
Scott: Okay, so here's the notes that I wrote, right?

70
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,370
Scott: So first, a lot of the art looked like they were underwater when they weren't underwater.

71
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,083
Scott: There was like a haze over it or something.

72
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:55,890
Scott: I don't know what's up with that.

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,661
Rym: It wasn't that bad though.

74
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,250
Rym: I kind of like the art.

75
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,980
Scott: No, it's not too bad.

76
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,610
Scott: It was just average.

77
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:00,457
Scott: Okay, this is what I understand.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,550
Scott: You have all these different Robins, right?

79
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,250
Rym: I guess they're all dead from the past?

80
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,027
Scott: There's like four or five of them, and I think the dead ones are back to life or whatever.

81
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:09,469
Scott: I don't know.

82
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,577
Scott: But here's the question, right?

83
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:18,010
Scott: That Justice League number one... I keep going back to that Justice League number one because it was the first book that came out, right?

84
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,144
Scott: That Justice League number one was supposed to be how many years ago?

85
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,270
Scott: Five years ago.

86
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,188
Rym: So in the span of five years...

87
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,100
Scott: In the span of five years, there are all those Robins?

88
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:26,784
Scott: Really?

89
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:27,608
Scott: Really?

90
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,280
Scott: Not only that... Really?

91
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,530
Rym: This is supposed to be a number one.

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,809
Scott: You started from scratch and you've already fucked it up.

93
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,023
Rym: And I'm fine if you've started in media res.

94
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,110
Rym: I like that, in fact.

95
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:49,630
Rym: But I feel like too many of these number ones are trying to shoehorn in backstory that nerds already know anyway to have an excuse to use it in number twos and number threes.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,819
Scott: And not help itself by shoehorning in Adam West with the bat poles.

97
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:58,730
Scott: I'm surprised they didn't use the clock to open it and not the Shakespeare bust.

98
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,118
Rym: That was actually part of my problem with this one.

99
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:04,330
Rym: It was a little too campy in its plot.

100
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:05,514
Scott: It's weird.

101
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,750
Scott: It tried to take the campiness and put a dark shade in front of it.

102
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,874
Rym: That's exactly what I was going to say.

103
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:14,690
Rym: There's a veneer of dark, badass Batman, but underneath it's Adam West.

104
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:23,550
Rym: I think the biggest example of that was that the radiation was going to leak out and Batman just totally busts open the pool that happens to be above it.

105
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,210
Scott: That might as well have been shark repellent.

106
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,327
Rym: When he had the net to catch all the kids who fell through the hole, that did it.

107
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,982
Rym: But then they're dark when Robin effectively totally was like, "I'm going to fucking kill those guys.

108
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:36,944
Rym: Shut up, Batman.

109
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:37,846
Rym: You're not the boss of me.

110
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,189
Rym: I can kill people if I want

111
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:39,330
Rym: to.".

112
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,850
Scott: The other thing I didn't like was there's something going on in Moscow.

113
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:51,690
Scott: Obviously they're going to tie it in later, but it's like you're reading two separate things going on that aren't related at all within the entire comic.

114
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,301
Scott: A comic book is a single work, so you can have that disjoint.

115
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,728
Scott: show me one place, show me the other place over a trade.

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,378
Scott: But this is a single comic.

117
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,050
Scott: It has to make sense within itself.

118
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,630
Scott: All that Moscow stuff just felt thrown in and out of nowhere because it never tied together within the entire issue.

119
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,310
Rym: Well it did, in that the Moscow guy probably wanted the radioactive doomedads that Batman stopped from being stolen.

120
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,730
Scott: The only way you can assume that is because they happen to be in the same book on adjacent pages.

121
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,973
Rym: Which is why I assume.

122
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:26,110
Rym: Also because the guy lowered the two dead guys from before into that vat of acid.

123
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,570
Rym: Which was kind of a weird scene in the way it was drawn.

124
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,994
Rym: They're kind of hanging in space.

125
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:38,650
Rym: It felt like they were going with almost two different styles in Moscow and I guess Gotham.

126
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,530
Rym: Didn't feel like Gotham.

127
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,361
Scott: So anyway, I gave this a meh.

128
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,369
Scott: What did you give this?

129
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,299
Rym: I almost want to say it's bad.

130
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,384
Rym: It's not even worth my time.

131
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,167
Rym: I don't care.

132
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:48,930
Rym: I'm going to say bad.

133
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,156
Scott: Oh, bad.

134
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:49,470
Scott: Alright.

135
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,503
Rym: Because I wouldn't read number two even if we had it.

136
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,010
Rym: I just don't care.

137
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,873
Scott: I also don't care.

138
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:55,214
Scott: Alright.

139
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:56,861
Scott: Batwoman.

140
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,107
Scott: Not Batgirl.

141
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:58,910
Scott: Batwoman.

142
00:06:59,331 --> 00:06:59,692
Scott: Alright.

143
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:01,999
Scott: I don't remember this really.

144
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,810
Scott: It's been a while and I don't have the book on hand to bring it back to memory.

145
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,381
Rym: Batwoman is really pale.

146
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,510
Rym: I don't know anything about Batwoman.

147
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,927
Rym: But I was talking to Daryl Surratt about this and he told me that Batwoman, this one, was written before the 52 thing happened.

148
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,571
Scott: Really?

149
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:19,382
Rym: Which is why it kind of just picks up.

150
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,590
Rym: It's funny because it kind of works as number one.

151
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,370
Rym: Because it's completely in media res with zero backstory.

152
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,561
Rym: It's just, hey, Batwoman.

153
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,470
Rym: Here's Batwoman.

154
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,381
Scott: I wrote down, let's see, the plot can't stay focused.

155
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,650
Scott: And I wrote down that the art was actually awesome.

156
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,296
Rym: Yeah, it started out really strong.

157
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:37,763
Rym: Batwoman is investigating the ghost.

158
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,070
Rym: that's drowning people.

159
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,994
Rym: Right.

160
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:45,230
Scott: And there's like a teenage gang or something and she goes after her, right?

161
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,854
Rym: That was like an afterthought.

162
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:50,745
Rym: It was almost like an Adam West flashback to her and her equivalent of Robin.

163
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:57,830
Scott: There's like a weird serial killing kind of thing going around and she's chasing it and she ends up at some house.

164
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,286
Rym: But independently she's got her Robin who has a superhero name, I guess.

165
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,390
Rym: I don't know anything about the Batwoman.

166
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,857
Scott: I don't think that that person is a Robin.

167
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:10,390
Scott: I think it's actually a superhero girlfriend from another group or something.

168
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,330
Rym: But now she's training to be Batwoman's Robin.

169
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:14,769
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

170
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,746
Rym: But she had a uniform from before and Batwoman seems to do the same dialogue.

171
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,070
Rym: It might as well be Batman.

172
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,870
Rym: When she's in Batwoman mode.

173
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,163
Scott: Yeah, this is bad.

174
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,349
Scott: I don't want it.

175
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,482
Rym: The art was good to a degree.

176
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,450
Rym: I liked the...

177
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:33,328
Scott: Yeah, the art was great.

178
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:43,030
Rym: I really liked that two page spread of all the people talking around the center image of the kind of drowned woman Rusalka, almost like a stained glass thing.

179
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,230
Rym: But otherwise the plot really was not...

180
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,908
Scott: Make an art book, dude.

181
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:53,870
Rym: If the plot had just straight up been Batwoman investigates the ghost that murders children.

182
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,930
Scott: Yeah, they could have concentrated on it and only on like one murder as opposed to the whole string.

183
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,463
Scott: Oh, it could have been the whole string.

184
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:01,170
Rym: That would have been fine.

185
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:09,110
Rym: If it didn't also have the I'm training a Robin and all that other... If it had just been that story, like one episode of BTAS.

186
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,162
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

187
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:10,488
Scott: I don't know.

188
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,374
Rym: I mean, it was meh.

189
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:12,560
Rym: It wasn't bad.

190
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,109
Rym: I would read it, but I wouldn't buy it.

191
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:15,895
Rym: Definitely a meh.

192
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,150
Rym: I just... It wasn't grabbing me.

193
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,710
Scott: So far we got meh bad and bad meh.

194
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,850
Rym: And I wonder why she's so pale.

195
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,438
Scott: Alright, so Deathstroke.

196
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,949
Scott: I actually remember this.

197
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,410
Rym: I like this one kinda.

198
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:27,738
Rym: Really?

199
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,730
Rym: Because it reminded me of Cable.

200
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,790
Scott: Yeah, it sure did.

201
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,810
Scott: Basically you have this, you know, some government, another acronym organization.

202
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,370
Scott: He wants to hire, or government thing, wants to hire a guy to do something.

203
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,540
Rym: Ah, but Deathstroke's too old.

204
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:44,530
Rym: It's almost like a Dark Knight Returns situation.

205
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,170
Scott: He's too old for this shit, but he's the ultimate badass assassin guy.

206
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,610
Scott: He gets the job done like Golgo 13.

207
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,926
Rym: Alright, obviously spoilers.

208
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:52,210
Rym: Fuck you guys.

209
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,270
Scott: I actually wrote Golgo 13.

210
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,850
Rym: He basically is Golgo 13.

211
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:02,130
Rym: I kind of actually did not see coming him murdering his entire team at the end of the first issue.

212
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,908
Scott: I saw that coming.

213
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,630
Rym: I didn't know anything about this character.

214
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,970
Scott: He was basically... I didn't know anything about him either.

215
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,110
Scott: But I know he's like an incredible badass.

216
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:11,945
Scott: You know, the loner, awesome assassin Golgo 13 guy.

217
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,610
Scott: And suddenly he gets tricked into working with these kids.

218
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:22,522
Scott: Usually in those cases, it's like, you know, the guy will be like, "Oh yeah, I'm not working with these kids.

219
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:23,309
Scott: Get them the fuck out of

220
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:23,410
Scott: here.".

221
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:24,489
Scott: But he actually went along with it.

222
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,307
Scott: And as soon as he went along with it, I'm like, "Oh, they're all gonna

223
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:27,669
Scott: die.".

224
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,410
Rym: Well, I thought they were gonna die.

225
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,070
Scott: He wouldn't go along with it if he wasn't gonna teach them a lesson about how he works alone.

226
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,050
Rym: I thought they were going to die in the course of the mission or something.

227
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,010
Scott: If Golgo 13 got an assistant, they would be dead.

228
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:43,930
Rym: I did not expect them to be murdered by him just outright at the end of the issue.

229
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,429
Scott: Especially since because they weren't superheroes, you knew that they were done.

230
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,310
Scott: And then, you know, I was like, you know, when he killed them, I was like, "Oh, the slightly clever idea of instead of them dying on the mission, he killed them.

231
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:56,795
Scott: Okay.

232
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,442
Scott: Cool.

233
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:58,048
Scott: Whatever.".

234
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,730
Rym: He's a little too stereotypical badass though.

235
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,170
Rym: I feel like if I want to read this kind of story, I'll read Golgo 13.

236
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,639
Scott: Yeah, it's like...

237
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:10,026
Rym: If I want to read about an emotionless, unstoppable killing machine, that's what I'm gonna read.

238
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:10,672
Scott: Exactly.

239
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:14,689
Scott: He was such... Even though he was a badass, he was such a vanilla badass.

240
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:20,510
Scott: He didn't have any... At least Deadpool has humor or attempts at humor.

241
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,049
Scott: You know, failed attempts.

242
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,189
Scott: At least there is an attempt.

243
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,810
Scott: They don't even try.

244
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,390
Scott: It's just like, he's just a badass.

245
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:31,350
Scott: There's no... Even Golgo 13 has a style with his quiet and his dot, dot, dot.

246
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,930
Scott: And he's always raping some girl or whatever.

247
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,129
Scott: But this guy had nothing other than, "I kill people and I awesome at

248
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:38,209
Scott: it.".

249
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,377
Rym: "And I work alone.

250
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,747
Rym: I'm not too old for this

251
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:41,028
Rym: shit.".

252
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:41,483
Scott: Right.

253
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,090
Scott: Also, did you notice on the one page, they threw in a J. Jonas Jameson?

254
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,594
Scott: It's like,

255
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:46,858
Scott: "What?".

256
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,930
Scott: This is Marvel Comics, dude.

257
00:11:51,671 --> 00:12:00,130
Rym: Otherwise, the actual action that was going on when he boards that plane, it reminded me of Air Force One in that it was kind of...

258
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,926
Scott: Yeah, boarding the plane in flight is an old, "We need the extreme action scene.

259
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:05,309
Scott: Let's do

260
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:05,490
Scott: this.".

261
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:13,589
Rym: But the action was otherwise just kind of lame, and they threw in the weird alien plot and then immediately forgot about the word alien plot.

262
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,179
Rym: Granted, it's one issue.

263
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,690
Rym: I'm sure that's gonna come back.

264
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,310
Scott: Obviously.

265
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,249
Scott: Yeah, I had no intention of reading this.

266
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,590
Rym: Why didn't they just fucking shoot the plane down?

267
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,350
Rym: They did not need to send him onto the plane.

268
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,470
Scott: 'Cause it wouldn't have made it such a badass action scene.

269
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,970
Scott: He wouldn't have been a badass if he just shot a rocket at a plane.

270
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,628
Rym: It's just, it's meh.

271
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:32,923
Scott: I put meh.

272
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:34,749
Rym: I put meh on it.

273
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:41,069
Rym: Because I wouldn't mind knowing what he does next.

274
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:43,548
Scott: If someone told me.

275
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,609
Scott: I just don't care at all.

276
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,850
Rym: See, I can't say bad on something like this, because I got other things to say bad about.

277
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,610
Scott: Right, well, if he had some character to him, I would have put maybe even good.

278
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,209
Scott: You know, it was that, that just made the huge difference there.

279
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,705
Scott: It was just that there was no character at all.

280
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,369
Scott: In fact, those kids that died had actual character to them.

281
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:08,050
Rym: They were a stereotypical 24 assistant, basically.

282
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,462
Scott: Yeah, but actually I would have rather read a book about them, would have been meh.

283
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,289
Rym: You just read a book about them.

284
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,250
Scott: But a book about Deathstroke would have been bad.

285
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,408
Scott: Anyway, it's bad.

286
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,610
Scott: Alright, so, Demon Knights.

287
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:26,230
Rym: So, this is just straight up fantasy, but it's written like superhero comic.

288
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,590
Scott: Right, that's, it was so weird, 'cause like, when it started getting all fantasy, I was like, oh, actually, I'm kind of- This is, like, I was kind of digging it, like, alright.

289
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,922
Scott: Like, even though it's a little bit of that R.A.

290
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,350
Scott: Salvatore kind of fantasy.

291
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,085
Rym: But, like, the bad guys had their thing.

292
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:45,270
Rym: where they're, you get the sense that they're conflicted villains, like, they're doing evil for a greater good.

293
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,970
Rym: At least, they believe it to be a greater good.

294
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,510
Scott: Actually, it felt almost like a slayers plot without the comedy.

295
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,109
Rym: I was also reminded slightly of, take the plot of Bone, not the character.

296
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,786
Scott: Like a light surface level fantasy.

297
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:03,510
Scott: that's not, it's not, you know, a Lord of the Rings or a Prince of Nothing.

298
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,450
Scott: It's just an adventury party going to stabby stabby, you know?

299
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,730
Rym: Yeah, I mean, like, the child's death was regrettable, and all this, the villains were conflicted.

300
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,970
Rym: Also, the cover art was hideous.

301
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,449
Scott: I looked at the cover, and I was like, blech.

302
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,350
Scott: But then, when I looked in the book, I was like, oh, this is pretty great.

303
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,949
Rym: Yeah, I liked seeing Merlin, and I liked how the demon is like, uh, yeah, the guy who I'm possessing is kind of a fuckwit, but whatever.

304
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:36,350
Scott: Yeah, and he talks, they're in the inn, and the inn explodes, of course, and the girl is like, you know, she acts like she's friends with the guy who's possessed by the demon, sort of a birdie the mighty, almost.

305
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,729
Scott: But then when the demon comes out, she's like, yeah, let's just not let that jerk know.

306
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,829
Rym: Yeah, I like it rough.

307
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:45,919
Rym: They start making out, and then they fight, and then at the end, it's like, but it got a little derpy.

308
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:49,610
Rym: at the end, when the villains are like, we'll do what we always do when there's a problem.

309
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,170
Rym: We throw dragons at it, and then, oh, shit, a dragon appears and attacks the inn.

310
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,090
Scott: Yeah, I think that, you know, that derpiness combined with the fact that the plot was a little bit all over the place.

311
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,519
Scott: It didn't have enough focus.

312
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,668
Scott: I think that's what put it to meh.

313
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,290
Scott: If they would've just made it, like, you know, kept with that fantasy aspect more strongly, it could've been good, but it's meh.

314
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,490
Rym: Yeah, I would like it, but they got too much superhero on my fantasy.

315
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:14,948
Scott: Yeah, I think it's--.

316
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,230
Rym: Also, the action scenes, where they're actually fighting in the inn, were pretty incomprehensible.

317
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:29,367
Rym: Like, I couldn't tell what was going on, and I lost track of who was who, and it kept, like, focusing on all these other people that I worry that maybe people who know these characters would recognize them, but I had no idea.

318
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:35,290
Scott: I'd known about the demon, 'cause he was in Wednesday comics, but the Wednesday comics is nothing like this at all.

319
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:36,949
Scott: It might as well have been a separate character.

320
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,730
Rym: So, it came down to meh.

321
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,306
Scott: It's like demon Etrigan, yeah, meh.

322
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:41,925
Rym: Yeah.

323
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,550
Scott: Could've been good.

324
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,375
Scott: Could've been good.

325
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,061
Scott: Had potential.

326
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,150
Scott: Unfulfilled potential.

327
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,950
Rym: So, let's talk about the other Jeff Lemire.

328
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,525
Scott: So, Jeff Lemire, who has so far done no wrong.

329
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:52,449
Rym: Agent of acronym.

330
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,429
Scott: Agent of acronym group.

331
00:15:55,692 --> 00:16:00,349
Scott: Yeah, so the first, if you notice, like, the first two pages actually look like a Jeff Lemire book.

332
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,722
Scott: They do.

333
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:10,230
Scott: I'm pretty sure he drew those first two pages, especially that second page looks a lot like the sweet tooth, you know, with that dead dog there and everything, and the monsters coming out of the woods, right?

334
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,283
Scott: So, I was reading these first three pages, and I'm like, "Yeah, Jeff Lemire, all

335
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:13,546
Scott: right.".

336
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,740
Scott: After those first three pages, it's like, "Is it still Jeff

337
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:18,284
Scott: Lemire?"

338
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:18,405
Scott: Right?

339
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,090
Rym: It's like-- Yeah, I kind of wish it would've kept up with what it was doing.

340
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,970
Rym: It turned into a weird-- It reminds me of manga.

341
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,149
Scott: Really?

342
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,930
Scott: Like, random-- I was not reminded of that at all.

343
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:41,210
Rym: Partly because the mad scientist put himself in the body of a schoolgirl, and-- Okay, yeah, that visual aspect, sure.

344
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,469
Rym: And just kind of the way the mad scientist talked.

345
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,089
Rym: It reminded me of Washu from Tenchi Muyo.

346
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:47,648
Scott: Okay.

347
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:48,547
Rym: A lot.

348
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:54,490
Scott: Yeah, this reminded me more of, like, crappy Hellboy wannabe, right?

349
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,089
Scott: I think Jeff Lemire was definitely phoning it in on this.

350
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,429
Scott: Or at least I feel like he was.

351
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:07,707
Scott: It's just like, "Okay, "acronym org science organization "gets a group of powerful guys together "to go fight acronym bad guy

352
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:07,970
Scott: organization.".

353
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,010
Rym: Now, it could've been fun if it had been a little more over the top.

354
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,030
Rym: Exactly, that's true.

355
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,730
Rym: It didn't go over the top enough.

356
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:20,210
Scott: Right, it's like you had this mummy who was kind of silly and mysterious and some of these other characters, right?

357
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,510
Rym: And Franklin sounds like, "Where's my wife?

358
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,185
Rym: "Oh, whatever, I'm too old for this

359
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:23,347
Rym: shit.".

360
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,470
Scott: But see, that's what I'm saying.

361
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,150
Scott: It's like Hellboy goes to the extremes.

362
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:33,730
Scott: He either gets the really funny BPRD kind of Hellboy wisecracking or the incredibly dark Cthulhu Hellboy, right?

363
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,090
Scott: This was just sort of in between with both at the same time.

364
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,430
Scott: Hellboy shows you one and then the other, you know, back and forth.

365
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:45,048
Scott: This had them both at the same time all the time in the middle.

366
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,030
Rym: It never felt dark or serious.

367
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,610
Rym: It just felt like it was trying to be funny.

368
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:57,330
Rym: I mean, the whole explanation of we made our base in this tiny microscopic bullshit explanation.

369
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,610
Scott: Oh yeah, this is the one with the base and the floating ball, right?

370
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,469
Scott: Are you seriously telling me no one just come and smash that fucking thing?

371
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,429
Rym: You don't need to explain your bullshit to me.

372
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,250
Rym: and if you're gonna explain it, explain it in context.

373
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,970
Rym: Don't just, you know, tell me it and it's stupid.

374
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,606
Scott: And it didn't matter at all.

375
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,250
Rym: Maybe if it didn't matter.

376
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:22,510
Rym: Like, if they'd explained that and then like four pages later Frankenstein ate it or something, that would've been awesome.

377
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,130
Rym: But they didn't do that.

378
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:27,170
Scott: Just a bunch of proper nouns and nonsense.

379
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,509
Rym: I don't want to say bad because I kind of like the art, but I don't want to read more of it because I just don't give a shit.

380
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,429
Scott: I put bad.

381
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,890
Scott: Jeff Lemire, you know, no one's perfect.

382
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,310
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna agree with you and put bad because I'm not gonna read more.

383
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,088
Scott: Oh, man.

384
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,039
Rym: So, alright.

385
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:45,610
Rym: Alright.

386
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:49,790
Rym: I feel like we should do Green Lantern number one and Red Lanterns together.

387
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,250
Scott: Okay, we can skip around.

388
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,570
Scott: So, Green Lantern.

389
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:57,410
Rym: You told me that these were 52 number ones.

390
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,630
Rym: That this, I can start reading this and I don't need to know about your universe.

391
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,970
Rym: So, who the fuck is Sinestro?

392
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,950
Scott: I think it's Sinestro.

393
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:12,510
Rym: This made no goddamn sense.

394
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:16,010
Rym: I might as well have picked up Green Lantern issue 1008.

395
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,668
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

396
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:24,610
Scott: This is, you know, go listen to our episode we did about Green Lantern Rebirth because this Green Lantern is still the same shit even though it's how many issues later.

397
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,747
Scott: Same crap.

398
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,390
Rym: Like, everything is explained in the stupid derpy comic book superhero way.

399
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,388
Rym: All these characters, I don't know who they are.

400
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,990
Rym: Pointless exposition.

401
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,510
Rym: Ludicrous space sector gobbledygook bullshit.

402
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:39,949
Rym: What the hell?

403
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:48,270
Scott: This doesn't even seem to... And the thing is, at least it partially makes sense even though I know so little about Green Lantern.

404
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:48,894
Scott: Oh, it does.

405
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,530
Rym: Obviously, this is a bad guy.

406
00:19:50,911 --> 00:20:00,490
Rym: Who is forced to be a good guy, doesn't want to be but he's probably actually really good at heart for whatever reason and he's gonna be the reluctant good guy in the end.

407
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,388
Scott: But here's the thing, right?

408
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,770
Scott: There's two aspects to the continuity, right?

409
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:09,110
Scott: That, you know, you only get this comic because you read what came before.

410
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,450
Scott: One is the understanding, right?

411
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,810
Scott: I don't know what's going on because I don't know the history of Green Lantern.

412
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,210
Scott: This doesn't have that problem that much.

413
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,529
Scott: It has a little bit, but not that much.

414
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,450
Scott: The problem it really has is I don't care because I haven't read the hit, right?

415
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:33,830
Scott: It's like, unless you're already invested and you care about these characters and already know about them, unless you already care, this comic has no meaning for you.

416
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:42,489
Scott: It's like, what's the emotional impact of this guy saying this thing if I don't already care about Green Lanterns?

417
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,790
Rym: And I don't care.

418
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,485
Scott: It only has an emotional impact if you already know and care.

419
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:56,347
Scott: So even if you understand it, the fact that you don't care makes the whole comic just completely vacant of anything.

420
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,450
Rym: I read it and I felt nothing at the end.

421
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,629
Rym: Green Lantern is bad, but it bothers me too.

422
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:09,647
Rym: I don't like continuity between, you know, comics, the whole "I gotta read all these comics to make sense of it,".

423
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,810
Rym: but the Green Lantern stuff going on in all the other DC comics seems to have no goddamn relation to this Green Lantern stuff.

424
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,610
Scott: Well, that's no different from the Batman or the Superman stuff.

425
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,135
Rym: But it's like almost negative continuity.

426
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,110
Scott: Yeah, see, this is, you know, I was surprised at some of the other Geoff Johns books.

427
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,084
Scott: I've always hated everything he's ever done, you know.

428
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:35,510
Scott: We're actually kind of okay, but this one is typical Geoff Johns, don't give a shit.

429
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,530
Rym: But as bad as Green Lantern was, Red Lantern takes the page.

430
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,518
Scott: Was somehow worse.

431
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:41,930
Scott: Like, I wish I had double bad.

432
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,209
Rym: First off, I gotta bring this up again.

433
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:53,710
Rym: There's a page when the woman, the Red Lantern woman with the gigantic boobs and the skeleton wings What page number is it?

434
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,089
Rym: There's no page numbers.

435
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:06,290
Rym: It is page, let's see, if I count every page other than the cover, including the ads, but not including the cover piece of paper, one, two, three, four, five, six.

436
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:08,769
Rym: On page seven, she's picking poop out of her butt.

437
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:09,887
Scott: She sure is.

438
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,530
Rym: She just pulled her finger out of her butt and there's poop on it.

439
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:13,107
Scott: There is.

440
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:14,488
Scott: What the fuck?

441
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:15,629
Scott: What the fuck?

442
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:16,870
Scott: There's no other way to interpret that.

443
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,430
Scott: That's one of those accidental arts, right?

444
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,429
Scott: Because he just drew someone in a typical comic pose.

445
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,589
Rym: But why did they draw the poop?

446
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:28,470
Scott: He drew the typical comic pose of someone with their hand in a claw behind them to be menacing, like, ahh, right?

447
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:33,290
Scott: And it just so happened that the hand is supposed to be in front of the butt.

448
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,050
Scott: Not on the butt.

449
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:38,310
Scott: But the finger happens to align with the edge of the butt.

450
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,250
Scott: And they also did that thing where there's sort of sparks coming off the finger.

451
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,488
Scott: But they're black poop sparks.

452
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,250
Scott: It's because the finger's near the butt and the sparks.

453
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,789
Scott: it looks like she just picked some dingleberries out.

454
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,290
Rym: There are not black poop sparks on her other hand or on any of her other fingers.

455
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,309
Rym: It is just the finger that just picked the butt.

456
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,109
Rym: And I don't know what's going on.

457
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,370
Rym: There's, I guess there's a bunch of red lanterns and they're all insane except for one of them?

458
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,669
Scott: Yeah, it's just like there's a pack of wild dogs.

459
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:13,349
Rym: And they're almost, like, they say weird stuff like they're trying to think, but they can't.

460
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,130
Rym: They're full of rage and they're fighting with each other all the time.

461
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,350
Scott: I think the red lanterns are supposed to be, if my understanding is correct, the rage, right?

462
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,810
Scott: Each lantern is supposed to mean something.

463
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,670
Rym: But the main red lantern doesn't have this problem.

464
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,550
Scott: So it's like red lantern is rage and I think orange is greedy or something.

465
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,770
Rym: But the main red lantern is totally, like, with it.

466
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,750
Rym: And he's just kind of, like, musing over things.

467
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:38,270
Rym: But then, like, a fever pod explodes nearby and covers him in blood and the pain is unbearable.

468
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,103
Rym: And I just, fever pod?

469
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:40,870
Rym: Like, what?

470
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,090
Scott: Is this the one where the rings started running away from people?

471
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,009
Scott: Or is that a different one?

472
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,529
Rym: That's the other one.

473
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,970
Scott: Okay.

474
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,210
Rym: This is just weird bullshit.

475
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,103
Scott: Let me see it again.

476
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:51,450
Scott: I haven't looked.

477
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,984
Rym: And then it cuts to this weird flashback where the red lantern guy's like, "My whole sector got wiped

478
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:56,267
Rym: out."

479
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:59,270
Rym: And it shows his family getting killed in front of his eyes.

480
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:06,910
Rym: That is one of the most derpy, poorly executed examples of that I've ever seen.

481
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,272
Scott: Oh, wow.

482
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:10,090
Scott: There's, like, nothing really happens in this at all, does it?

483
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:11,090
Scott: No, other than the poop.

484
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,309
Scott: Like, I'm flipping through it and, like, there's nothing that happens.

485
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,115
Scott: It's basically just a bunch of red lanterns going, "RAH!

486
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:16,822
Scott: We're red lanterns!

487
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:17,328
Scott: RAAH!".

488
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,625
Rym: Yep, and the guy's saying, "It sucks.

489
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:20,169
Rym: Everything's

490
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:20,350
Rym: pain.".

491
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:20,793
Scott: And what the fuck?

492
00:24:20,813 --> 00:24:23,570
Scott: This cat, the double-page spread of the cat lantern?

493
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,510
Scott: It's like, that cat lantern is there just for, like, fanboy appeal.

494
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,189
Scott: Poop got a single page.

495
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,803
Rym: Like, "Oh my god, there's a cat lantern!

496
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:30,368
Rym: Lulz!

497
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,321
Scott: They should have made the cat long.

498
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:32,885
Scott: It would have been

499
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:33,248
Scott: funnier.".

500
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:38,587
Rym: I just... Naito manga makes more sense than this red lantern.

501
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:38,990
Rym: I just read.

502
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,570
Rym: However, this red lantern still is a paragon of linear storytelling compared to Legion Lost.

503
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,798
Scott: You want to go to Legion?

504
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,769
Scott: Alright, Legion Lost.

505
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,209
Rym: Oh, I guess we didn't actually review that yet, did we?

506
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:51,183
Scott: No, do you want to?

507
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:51,589
Scott: Let's go to it.

508
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:52,687
Rym: Give me my list back.

509
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,369
Rym: Legion Lost.

510
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,088
Rym: I wrote notes for these.

511
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,930
Scott: Legion Lost is the worst.

512
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,470
Rym: So I gotta say, I wrote a note for another one.

513
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,689
Rym: I threw away the notes I wrote from week one, since we're already passed on week two.

514
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,849
Rym: But for one of the other entries, I wrote, "What the

515
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:09,970
Rym: fuck?".

516
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,547
Rym: Oh, Olmec, I wrote, and I quote, "What the fuck did I just

517
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:12,809
Rym: read?".

518
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:13,447
Scott: Yeah.

519
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:18,350
Rym: I wrote that again and underlined it for Legion Lost.

520
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,303
Scott: Okay, so Legion Lost, here's my youngest.

521
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:20,948
Scott: read my notes.

522
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:21,190
Scott: Ready?

523
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:22,745
Scott: Samoflange.

524
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,970
Scott: Flashpoint Breakwall, proper nouns.

525
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,070
Rym: The girl with the antennas who transforms all the time is kind of cute.

526
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,334
Scott: "What is after release?

527
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,156
Scott: Bad art.

528
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:36,588
Scott: At least the others that weren't really number one were

529
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:37,290
Scott: comprehensible.".

530
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,530
Scott: I actually asked people at Comic-Con, I went to a guy that I know knows more DC Comics stuff than anyone.

531
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,224
Scott: And I asked him, "Legion

532
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:45,688
Scott: Lost."

533
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:51,769
Scott: And he's like, "Yeah, there are even people who know all about the Legion that couldn't understand what the fuck was going

534
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:51,890
Scott: on.".

535
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,636
Rym: Daryl Surratt said it best.

536
00:25:54,978 --> 00:26:02,030
Rym: It is a number one, and we were talking on chat today, in that it's as incomprehensible as any other number one in Legion Lost.

537
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:16,410
Scott: Yeah, from what I understand, the Legion of Superheroes is basically, in some years in the future, way in the future, from the ranks of the DC Universe, there's a whole legion of superheroes, like this big super team, right?

538
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:21,190
Scott: And they have flight rings, so even if they can't fly, they all get rings so they can fly.

539
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:22,970
Rym: Because otherwise, I don't know.

540
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,999
Scott: And they all get sent, and there's a ton of them.

541
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,863
Scott: Tons of them.

542
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,170
Scott: And they're all in this one team.

543
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,678
Scott: Like, imagine if Justice League was all the heroes.

544
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,970
Scott: And they all split up into teams and go on missions in different places.

545
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:42,390
Scott: And, you know, even if you read all the Legion comics in the beginning, even big fans of this sort of, it's almost like a sub-universe.

546
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,209
Scott: Like a demi-universe.

547
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,409
Rym: Because they time travel to multiple dimensions all over the place.

548
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,250
Scott: They time travel all over the fuck, and there's a ten billion characters, so people don't understand it.

549
00:26:52,410 --> 00:27:05,406
Scott: So this Legion Lost, in particular, is about one group of legionnaires who are in a time bubble, who they travel in time and get trapped in a place, and something happens there.

550
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,050
Scott: That's all I can figure out.

551
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,680
Rym: I don't know if anything actually happened.

552
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:09,947
Rym: I can't...

553
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,230
Scott: Aren't they trapped there because the time bubble is smashed?

554
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:14,876
Scott: The time bubble!

555
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:15,579
Rym: Something's wrong!

556
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:16,502
Rym: Don't let it crash!

557
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:22,905
Rym: And then it crashes, and some guy yells, "The Time Institute warned the Legion of Superheroes not to ride the time stream,

558
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,527
Rym: Timberwolf!".

559
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:26,513
Scott: Yeah, first of all, this has- "My bad!

560
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,265
Rym: Baphmadad will control your scuba-doo and kill the

561
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:29,606
Rym: fuckmadad!".

562
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,143
Scott: That's why I wrote down

563
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:31,530
Scott: "Baphmadad.".

564
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:40,566
Rym: It's just, everyone says things that can only be described as, "I will hit you, you little guy, with the samoflange, because samoflanges do

565
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:41,569
Rym: Baphmadad.".

566
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:50,950
Scott: Right, so, the thing is, this book has something that exemplifies one thing that is a problem across all superhero comics, or many of them, but this has it the most.

567
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,609
Rym: It's bad?

568
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,136
Scott: Yes, but it has the character.

569
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:56,262
Scott: that's not a character at all, right?

570
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,890
Scott: Remember how I talked about how Deathstroke was sort of vanilla?

571
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,030
Scott: But at least he was a badass.

572
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,990
Scott: In this, what you have is you basically have people standing there in costumes with powers, right, and names.

573
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:11,567
Scott: They're a superhero name, a superhero costume, and that's it.

574
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,590
Scott: They don't have any personality or anything.

575
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:19,250
Scott: You can just shuffle all the characters around between the speech bubbles, and it wouldn't make a difference.

576
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,870
Rym: It is much like Final Fantasy VI, where depending on who's in your party, different people say the same line.

577
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,870
Rym: Someone needs to say, "I'm sure glad my acting gig at the Time Institute turned into this.

578
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,241
Rym: Locate the Daphnorian DNA.

579
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,929
Rym: The ring sensor array isn't

580
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:34,150
Rym: working.".

581
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:37,962
Scott: Right, it's like none of the characters, there are no personalities.

582
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:40,690
Scott: All they are, these characters don't even exist.

583
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,463
Scott: They're just visual designs with powers.

584
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,350
Scott: That's all they are, and there's just tons of them.

585
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,350
Scott: There's tons and tons of characters, but none of them are actually characters.

586
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,915
Scott: Compare this to any good thing ever.

587
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:56,539
Scott: Look at, say, Lord of the Rings.

588
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,241
Scott: Right, it's like they actually have a character to them.

589
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:09,630
Scott: There's no character to these characters.

590
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:16,370
Scott: They're just a picture with a name and a list of powers, and you could shuffle them all up.

591
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,500
Scott: You could replace them all with pictures of Superman.

592
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,110
Scott: It wouldn't make any goddamn difference.

593
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:22,829
Scott: So, fuck this book.

594
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:25,870
Rym: I don't know what I can say beyond that.

595
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,630
Scott: By far, I think it might be the worst of the whole thing.

596
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,548
Rym: I could not tell you how many characters are in this.

597
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,016
Scott: I couldn't tell you any.

598
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:36,150
Scott: I can't even remember a single character from it at all.

599
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,596
Rym: I remember the shape-shifting girl.

600
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,344
Rym: For whatever reason, I remember her, and...

601
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,304
Scott: Maybe everyone was just her.

602
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,030
Scott: That's why they're all the same.

603
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,349
Rym: And there was a girl with wings.

604
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:45,272
Scott: Okay.

605
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,010
Scott: I'd have to look at it to remember anything.

606
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,298
Rym: The rest of them, I didn't.

607
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,526
Rym: Oh, there's a bug-looking guy.

608
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:50,130
Rym: I forgot about him.

609
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:50,729
Scott: Okay.

610
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:52,830
Rym: He says a bunch of random stuff.

611
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,092
Scott: Sure.

612
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,109
Scott: And the art was bad on top of that.

613
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,389
Rym: It was just really generic-y, comic-book-y, boring art.

614
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,150
Scott: At least some of the other bad books had the good art, like the Batwoman.

615
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,257
Scott: This one, just bad.

616
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:04,661
Scott: 100% bad.

617
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,139
Scott: Fire all these people.

618
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,068
Scott: I'm sorry, guys.

619
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,670
Rym: I want to know if there's anyone in the world who likes this comic, and if so, I really want to know what they like about it.

620
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:16,370
Scott: I did see some people who liked it a lot.

621
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,608
Scott: They must be the biggest Legion fanboys in the goddamn universe or something.

622
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:21,009
Scott: I don't know.

623
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,890
Scott: Or maybe that's what they like, is they like non-char--?

624
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:29,270
Scott: I read the incredibly famous Christ in Infinite Earths, right?

625
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,089
Scott: So I bought it and read it, just because it's so famous and important in comic history and everything, right?

626
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:39,530
Scott: And it has every DC comic superhero from the late '80s in it, or whatever, as all of them.

627
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,270
Scott: But the thing is, on most of them aren't actually characters.

628
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:48,790
Scott: They're like this, where they appear on the page, and maybe they say something, but there's no character to them.

629
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:52,525
Scott: It's like, "I'm going to do a story about the Rocketeer,".

630
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,710
Scott: and I drew a picture of the Rocketeer.

631
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,199
Scott: And that's it.

632
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,105
Scott: He's on the page.

633
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:56,487
Scott: Look at him.

634
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:56,930
Scott: It's the Rocketeer.

635
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,893
Scott: It's like, "Oh, it's just a picture of the

636
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:58,637
Scott: Rocketeer.".

637
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:11,930
Scott: He's not acting like the Rocketeer X. It's like, I could make a Back to the Future comic, and I could draw the Professor and Marty there, but if they don't act like the Professor and Marty, just like, "Hey, hey, let's go travel in time.

638
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,502
Scott: Okay, we've traveled in time.

639
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,148
Scott: There is danger

640
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:14,329
Scott: here.".

641
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:20,469
Scott: It's like, if they're not acting like, "Oh my God, Marty, what are we going to--" then it's not actually them.

642
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,310
Rym: That was actually a pretty good Professor voice.

643
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:23,909
Scott: Yeah, I know, right?

644
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,736
Rym: Yeah, it was good.

645
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,430
Rym: So yeah, I'm giving this one a good.

646
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:29,550
Rym: Just to fuck up your rating system.

647
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,810
Scott: You actually want me to put good for Legion Lost next to your name?

648
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:32,125
Scott: Nah.

649
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,688
Scott: Okay.

650
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:33,930
Rym: I couldn't consciously.

651
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,438
Scott: All right, Grifter, which I don't really remember, but-- It was really boring.

652
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:41,170
Rym: The art was okay, but it was so boring, I don't care.

653
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,175
Scott: All right, so here's my notes.

654
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:44,308
Scott: "Find you with a creepy mask on.

655
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:44,610
Scott: Easy.".

656
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,828
Scott: I think this guy was-- all right, he was trying to hide, but someone was trying to hide himself.

657
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:55,970
Rym: All right, so he's a grifter, and he does this really generic, like, grift that wouldn't work on anyone.

658
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:57,253
Scott: You know what?

659
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:02,128
Scott: I don't even remember there being a grift, which shows just how bad this was.

660
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,119
Rym: And then he gets kidnapped by aliens.

661
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,750
Rym: They try to put an alien in his body.

662
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:07,830
Rym: He wakes up during it and runs away.

663
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,625
Rym: Now they can sense him, and he hears their voices.

664
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,350
Rym: They live style.

665
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:14,930
Scott: Yeah, there was-- I wrote, "They live," with an exclamation point.

666
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,026
Rym: So he's sitting there, and a random person will turn to him and be like, "Find you.

667
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:18,569
Rym: Find

668
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:18,690
Rym: you.".

669
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,641
Rym: And he's like, "Shut the fuck up.

670
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,288
Rym: Get away from me, you

671
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:20,470
Rym: bastards.".

672
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,476
Scott: Yeah, I remember that part.

673
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,990
Scott: I also wrote down that the art was great.

674
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,495
Scott: I'd have to see it again to remember that, but-- It was cool.

675
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,090
Rym: It was kind of gangly, the characters.

676
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:33,730
Scott: Yeah, but it's like-- the fact that I remember nothing from this book at all.

677
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,590
Scott: Like, at least Legion Lost was so bad that I remembered how bad it was.

678
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,950
Scott: Grifter was just so nothing that I'm having a hard time remembering anything about it.

679
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,290
Scott: I couldn't even remember what the character looked like until I looked it up on Google Image Search.

680
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,629
Scott: And Rym left the book at work, so I can't look at it now.

681
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,210
Rym: It just didn't give me a compelling reason to care about his narrative.

682
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,757
Rym: I don't care what the aliens want.

683
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,490
Rym: It wasn't really-- none of that was presented.

684
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,408
Rym: Now, I think what they were going for is a, "You don't know what they

685
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:57,649
Rym: want.".

686
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,370
Rym: That's why it's so horrifying, but-- Yup.

687
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,590
Rym: Also, he jumped out of the plane before it took off, and that action scene just didn't really make any sense.

688
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:13,290
Rym: The side character dialogue was dumb, and I'm going to say bad just because it was really boring.

689
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:16,099
Scott: Mr.

690
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,830
Scott: Terrific.

691
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,098
Rym: Might as well be Static Shock.

692
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:22,150
Rym: It was the same "I'm smart, look at my science" bullshit.

693
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,710
Scott: But he's the third smartest guy in the universe or whatever, right?

694
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,794
Rym: As he keeps telling me.

695
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,299
Rym: And I don't care.

696
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,110
Rym: He's got these three balls, and he throws them around.

697
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:36,590
Rym: He tricks the guy that's chasing him to go to a metal thing, just like in Static Shock.

698
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,422
Scott: And it's like he's got these magic balls.

699
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,670
Scott: All his powers reside in these magic balls.

700
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,075
Scott: Magic balls are him.

701
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,220
Scott: Magic balls.

702
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,350
Scott: The third smartest guy in the world has magic balls.

703
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,190
Rym: Wouldn't you if you were the third smartest guy in the world?

704
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,688
Scott: I would have a lot more magic balls.

705
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,507
Rym: More than three?

706
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:52,916
Rym: Yeah.

707
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:02,073
Rym: So he tricks the bad guy into going by the big metal thing, and then-- And the guy's like, "What?

708
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,417
Rym: You magnetized

709
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:03,738
Rym: me?".

710
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,046
Rym: And the guy's like, "Yeah, I did.

711
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:06,587
Rym: I guess you know

712
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:07,350
Rym: science.".

713
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,074
Rym: Like, no.

714
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,770
Rym: None of you know science.

715
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,455
Scott: No, not even the third smartest.

716
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:14,949
Scott: If that's the third smartest guy in the universe, that explains a fucking lot.

717
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:20,130
Rym: But it was the same "I science you, you little guy" with my Baphidad crap that I hate.

718
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,940
Scott: Also, what's the origin story?

719
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,409
Scott: I thought we were getting away from the origin stories in all these other books.

720
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,422
Scott: But here we go, talking about the origin of Mr.

721
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:27,705
Scott: Terrific.

722
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:28,268
Scott: It's like, what the fuck?

723
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:30,510
Rym: But it was a boring origin.

724
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:31,670
Scott: Yeah, who gives a shit?

725
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,670
Rym: And he's a boring character.

726
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:38,230
Scott: I think the idea of making a book about a really smart--just a guy who's really smart could work out.

727
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:39,417
Rym: They did, Scott.

728
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,309
Rym: He became the mayor of New York.

729
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,250
Scott: Sure.

730
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,579
Scott: But I'm talking about also in Fantastic Four, right?

731
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,085
Scott: Fantastic Four often is good.

732
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,510
Scott: Not always, but often is good.

733
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:49,992
Scott: Because Mr.

734
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:53,206
Scott: Fantastic is really smart, and they do stories about how smart Mr.

735
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:53,889
Scott: Fantastic is.

736
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,310
Scott: And how his smartness and his diligence at working so hard pulls him away from his family and all that kind of, you know.

737
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,841
Rym: Yup, yup.

738
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,990
Scott: And he solves problems with actual clever things as opposed to just making a Baphidad, although he often makes a Baphidad.

739
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:09,874
Scott: But yeah, this Mr.

740
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:14,509
Scott: Terrific is nowhere--even the worst Fantastic Four story is ten times better than Mr.

741
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:14,730
Rym: Terrific.

742
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,890
Rym: It was all Baphidad, and I was really annoyed by the dialogue of the bystanders, even more so than in Grifter.

743
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:23,825
Rym: Because there's a scene where he's up there, and the crowd's like, "Who's that?

744
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:24,508
Rym: Nice

745
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:24,950
Rym: ass!".

746
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,010
Rym: Like, they're checking out his ass, and just the things they're saying don't make sense.

747
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,490
Rym: No one would say things like what they were saying.

748
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,370
Scott: Nope.

749
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,670
Scott: No one would say anything like any of these characters in any of these books would say.

750
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,484
Rym: Nah, Batman would say what Batman said in Batman #1.

751
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:44,230
Rym: Well, actually, Detective Comics #1.

752
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,510
Rym: Batman would say what Batman said in that comic.

753
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:48,442
Scott: Anyway, so Mr.

754
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:49,690
Scott: Terrific, what are you giving--I say bad.

755
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,265
Scott: It's a meh.

756
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,064
Scott: Are you giving meh?

757
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,210
Rym: 'Cause it was not--it wasn't actively as bad as a lot of this other stuff.

758
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:02,530
Scott: I think also I read all these week twos in a row, and I think my mood might have affected my string of bads here, but yeah, bad bad bad.

759
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,527
Rym: I read 'em in two strings.

760
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,365
Scott: I can't change my mind without re-reading it, but I'm gonna say bad.

761
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:12,250
Rym: So, Resurrection Man seems like a really cool concept that they're running into the ground.

762
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:16,030
Scott: You actually think the concept is cool if a guy who doesn't die and keeps coming back?

763
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:17,375
Rym: I think it could be cool.

764
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:21,670
Rym: as--take the Highlander concept, which people really dig, and-- I don't dig it that much.

765
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,410
Rym: But you actually kill the guy, and he just wakes up, you know, Shadowrun the SNES game style a couple of days later.

766
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:36,450
Rym: But no, every time he wakes up, he has some super power, and again, the plot was kind of boring and incomprehensible.

767
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,061
Scott: Okay, so first of all, the art in this was horrendously awful.

768
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,426
Scott: I showed you the rib boob.

769
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:45,689
Rym: I guess I didn't notice that, 'cause I was trying to figure out what was going on.

770
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:55,569
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, some of the art in this is just hideous and inconsistent and doesn't stay on model, really, and I can't tell who's who a lot, and it's just like, what the fuck?

771
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,164
Scott: Yet again, there's another comic with an airplane involved.

772
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,330
Scott: How many of those are there?

773
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,209
Scott: All of them, I guess?

774
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,768
Scott: The art style also seems to change from page to page a lot.

775
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,550
Scott: I don't know, it's just all over the place.

776
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,490
Rym: I also like the story of maybe, you know, Final Destination style.

777
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,830
Rym: You know, they're trying to kill him dead, 'cause he's supposed to be dead.

778
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:21,830
Rym: But it's like they took that story, and they put superhero crap into it.

779
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,070
Scott: The thing is, what's disappointing about this is this is written by Abnett and Lanning.

780
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:35,070
Scott: Now, Abnett and Lanning actually wrote a whole bunch of Marvel comics, all the more recent cosmic outer space Marvel comics that I actually like a lot.

781
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:37,719
Scott: They went downhill over time.

782
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:39,688
Scott: They started off good, and they went down to meh.

783
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,114
Scott: But I actually liked them.

784
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:45,530
Scott: But this Abnett and Lanning book is not good.

785
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,699
Scott: So, there you go.

786
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,430
Scott: Just 'cause, you know, no one's perfect.

787
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,998
Scott: Jeff Lemire wrote a bad book.

788
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,750
Scott: Abnett and Lanning wrote a bad book.

789
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,850
Rym: It just, I don't know, it feels like one of those pulp comics from a long time ago, and they're trying to recapture that, I think.

790
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,069
Scott: I like pulp comics from a long time ago.

791
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,787
Rym: But it's just, it's a little too...

792
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:05,549
Scott: Like a nice Flash Gordon?

793
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:15,370
Rym: I just feel like the storytelling in this general sense, it's kind of hard to explain, but it feels like a lot, like Demon Knights had the same problem.

794
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:21,669
Rym: Like, it feels like this kind of, the DC crap just edges its way back in, even if the story would have otherwise been good.

795
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:30,048
Rym: Like, they do this certain kind of portrayal of the story that just reminds me, "Oh yeah, I'm reading a superhero comic book that's actually kind of

796
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:30,510
Rym: generic.".

797
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,930
Scott: Well, I think what these people, I get the feeling that a lot of these books like this, right?

798
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:50,990
Scott: The books that aren't necessarily superhero books directly, but are still DC Universe, they're looking at Sandman, and they're looking at Alan Moore's Swamp Thing, and how those books were able to be sort of, you know, dark and sort of mystic and magical.

799
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,613
Rym: You're right!

800
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:54,970
Rym: I hereby dub this a wannabe of that kind of comic.

801
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,074
Scott: Right?

802
00:38:56,195 --> 00:39:08,050
Scott: All these books like that are looking at those two examples that had a little bit of superhero world, they're in the DC Universe, but they managed to keep most of it out, but a little bit in, and it totally worked.

803
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:23,010
Scott: And they're looking at those books and trying to be that and totally failing because Abnett and Lanning, as much as I liked some of their previous works, are not Neil Gaiman, and they're not Alan Moore, nor can they be.

804
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,854
Scott: They should stick to being Abnett and Lanning, which is, you know, if they had stuck to being Abnett and Lanning and done, say, "You know what?

805
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:41,126
Scott: Actually, I like their outer space stuff in Marvel so much, maybe you should have had the Geoff Johns do the Resurrection Man, and had the Abnett and Lanning do the Green Lantern, maybe it could have been the first goddamn good Green

806
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:41,448
Scott: Lantern.".

807
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:49,870
Rym: I would have rather seen Jeff Lemire do the Resurrection Man, because they need to focus on the guy being sad and alone because he keeps on dying.

808
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,147
Scott: Yeah, something like that could have worked out.

809
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:52,550
Scott: Anyway.

810
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,021
Scott: So, for Resurrection Man, what do you have?

811
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:07,290
Rym: I'm gonna go with Med, just because in Week 2, some of the stuff was so bad that I'd feel really awkward putting Resurrection Man in the same category as Legion Lost.

812
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:15,130
Scott: I know, just because that's why you need a 5-star system is the best, because in a 5-star system, you'd give it a 2, and you'd give the Legion Lost the 1.

813
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:23,989
Rym: I'll say Med, because I would read one more of this to see if it goes anywhere or gets interesting, but I would not read any more of Legion Lost if you paid me to.

814
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:24,836
Scott: That's true.

815
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:25,690
Scott: Okay.

816
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:26,610
Rym: Suicide Squad.

817
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:27,488
Scott: Suicide Squad.

818
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,190
Rym: I didn't know that was Harley Quinn until they said her name.

819
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,336
Scott: Same thing, exactly.

820
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:38,208
Scott: I did not know at all, because the character design was changed, and she wasn't acting like Harley Quinn at all.

821
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,691
Rym: Not at all.

822
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:48,510
Rym: I liked her hammer, and some of the flashback-y stuff was more like her, but the her in the present of this comic was just boobs with a hammer.

823
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:49,886
Scott: Yeah.

824
00:40:50,392 --> 00:40:53,990
Rym: And the story is kind of… cliche?

825
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:54,969
Rym: Yeah.

826
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:05,830
Rym: We've got a Suicide Squad of criminals that we've put explosion collars on, only in this case we injected them so we wouldn't have to draw an explosion collar, and we send them to do suicide missions that they'll always survive.

827
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:06,870
Scott: Okay.

828
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:07,529
Rym: It's hardcore.

829
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,050
Scott: So first of all, right, King Shark is fucking awesome.

830
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:12,730
Rym: Yeah, King Shark.

831
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,649
Scott: Just because he's a fucking shark.

832
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,196
Scott: King Shark is….

833
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:19,730
Rym: I also like the dynamic.

834
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,670
Rym: The characters, to be fair, are actually characters in this.

835
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,110
Scott: That is true.

836
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,090
Rym: They have personalities.

837
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,930
Rym: King Shark is basically….

838
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:28,250
Scott: I wish they would have gone more all out with that.

839
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:28,900
Scott: It would have been better.

840
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,698
Rym: King Shark is like Dr.

841
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,270
Rym: McNinja crossed with Radiscoll.

842
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:32,706
Rym: Yeah.

843
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:40,810
Scott: Actually, I kind of liked where this was going up until the reveal that they were all Battle Royaleed or whatever.

844
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:40,934
Scott: Right?

845
00:41:42,014 --> 00:41:43,350
Scott: It was like, "Oh, this is getting good.

846
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,049
Scott: Oh, that's what it is.

847
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:46,324
Scott: Ah, dang

848
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:46,405
Scott: it.".

849
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,069
Scott: You know?

850
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,710
Scott: It's like they were going in a good direction, but then it wasn't actually.

851
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,989
Scott: The reality was better than the lie.

852
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,930
Rym: I'd rather them have a more complex hook to be there.

853
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,170
Rym: They're not forced to be there.

854
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,210
Rym: There's no just, "Oh, the explosion collar.

855
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:01,781
Rym: You gotta do

856
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:01,985
Rym: this.".

857
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,498
Rym: But more….

858
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:07,208
Scott: I would have rather had just be like, "Let's fucking make mischief,

859
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:07,670
Scott: bitches.".

860
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:08,450
Scott: Oh, yeah.

861
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,850
Scott: And have them sort of be all out, sort of kooky, making mischief, fucking shit up.

862
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:12,428
Rym: Oh, my God.

863
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,109
Rym: I would read that.

864
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:13,770
Scott: Yeah, right?

865
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,850
Rym: Harley Quinn goes around just being Harley Quinn.

866
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:16,530
Scott: Right.

867
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,810
Scott: With fucking King Shark and these other dudes.

868
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:18,914
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:29,170
Scott: If you just let them loose instead of reining them in to be yet another forced together acronym team to go fight against the other organization.

870
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,030
Scott: If you would have just let them loose, but kept them together because they were all going….

871
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,630
Scott: Maybe they were all getting revenge on the same person or something.

872
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:37,650
Scott: You know, maybe….

873
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,130
Scott: You know what you could have done?

874
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,310
Scott: One page, you're all trapped.

875
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,230
Scott: You're all going to work for me.

876
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,590
Scott: Next page, we totally just smashed your stupid system on fucking King Shark.

877
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,650
Scott: And then them getting their revenge on… Oh, fuck yeah.

878
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,109
Scott: Let them loose.

879
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,149
Scott: So, there was potential there, which actually I put meh.

880
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:58,810
Rym: I also put meh because I liked the characters enough to where I wouldn't….

881
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,330
Scott: You had another….

882
00:42:59,330 --> 00:42:59,419
Scott: Yeah.

883
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:06,669
Rym: I think you encapsulated my thoughts, too, that I don't feel like the characters are going to be given enough room to thrive to where I'll care.

884
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,330
Scott: Yup.

885
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,310
Scott: Also, fucking King Shark.

886
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,750
Rym: King Shark is the best.

887
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,867
Rym: When he just fucking bites that guy's arm like….

888
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:15,509
Scott: They should have just made fucking King Shark the book.

889
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,130
Scott: Ten to twenty-two pages of biting.

890
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,210
Scott: That would have been great.

891
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:20,888
Scott: Best book.

892
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,670
Rym: King Shark and Radiscoll, an epic adventure.

893
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,910
Scott: Okay, so Superboy, the last book of this week.

894
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,310
Scott: So, a lot of people… Is this Astro Boy or what?

895
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:31,950
Rym: It's Astro Boy.

896
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:33,069
Rym: Now, here's the thing.

897
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,146
Scott: This is Astro Boy the same way the Lion King is.

898
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,150
Rym: Many people hinted to me saying, "Oh, yeah, Rick's obviously going to like…".

899
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,549
Scott: I mean, just look at this fucking page.

900
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:43,650
Scott: It's Astro Boy without the hair.

901
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:44,102
Rym: Yup.

902
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,088
Rym: Come on.

903
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,550
Rym: But I did like the….

904
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,470
Scott: The art's actually really good.

905
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:48,788
Scott: I like it.

906
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:56,209
Rym: I did like the fact that the whole Smallville thing kind of gets explained that it was a virtual reality to figure this guy out.

907
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,090
Scott: Well, because, yeah, this is going on, right?

908
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,690
Scott: It's like this isn't a story of Superman's youth.

909
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:04,850
Scott: This is a story of someone who is not Superman.

910
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,590
Scott: He's like a robot android something Astro Boy.

911
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:22,529
Scott: But, they want him to be like Superman, so they need to give him similar memories or experiences to Superman, so he gets the virtual reality, you know, Smallville in sort of the Matrix style, which is sort of like, "Oh, that's pretty

912
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:22,670
Scott: cool.".

913
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:31,410
Scott: But actually, I would have rather read that, you know, that Smallville comic than read the Astro Boy comic because I already read Astro Boy.

914
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:31,691
Scott: Now,

915
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:32,194
Rym: there's

916
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:33,118
Scott: kind of an aside,

917
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,706
Rym: but I've noticed and I didn't point it out in all of them because I didn't, you know, I stopped noting it after I saw it so often, but

918
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:40,590
Scott: a lot

919
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:51,129
Rym: of these comics are making very quick oblique references to fan culture or current events in ways that reek of trying to be pop-cultury edgy.

920
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,209
Rym: Like in this one, the white haired girl is like, "I totally wasn't a Mary

921
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:55,430
Rym: Sue.".

922
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,194
Scott: Yeah.

923
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,290
Rym: It's like, "Yeah, really?

924
00:44:57,852 --> 00:45:00,023
Rym: That didn't… That line kind of came out of

925
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:00,507
Rym: nowhere.".

926
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:02,530
Scott: I do want to give some props to this book.

927
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,430
Scott: This book was a very high meh, almost good because… Almost good.

928
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:06,930
Scott: Yeah.

929
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:12,310
Scott: The props I want to give it are, number one, there was no fighting in it and there was only one explosion.

930
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:12,670
Scott: Yep.

931
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,130
Scott: Almost every other book has like an obligatory action scene.

932
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,250
Scott: There was like five pages of superhero battling.

933
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:19,869
Scott: No battling in here.

934
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,410
Scott: None whatsoever, right?

935
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,048
Scott: There's one explosion and that's it.

936
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:26,130
Scott: Also, I wrote boots.

937
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,650
Scott: Is someone wearing cool boots or something?

938
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,527
Rym: There were some really good….

939
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,950
Rym: Multiple people had really good footwear in the art.

940
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,169
Rym: I also had a note about that.

941
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:32,606
Scott: Oh, yeah.

942
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:33,730
Scott: I like that footwear.

943
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,770
Scott: Also, proper nouns ahoy.

944
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,810
Scott: Yet another acronym organization working on evil science or good science.

945
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,965
Rym: But I did like how I….

946
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:45,510
Rym: The expected story of, you know, they're going to kill him.

947
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,508
Rym: She sets him free.

948
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:50,489
Rym: It was building up to that in the beginning and then immediately that was not it.

949
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,850
Rym: He, you know, when they try to kill him, she doesn't stop them.

950
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,628
Rym: She's like, "Oh, well.

951
00:45:53,912 --> 00:45:54,197
Rym: This is

952
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:54,624
Rym: sad."

953
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:57,710
Rym: And then when he blows up, all those people die.

954
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,010
Rym: She doesn't let him free.

955
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,350
Rym: She puts him back in the fucking lab.

956
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,849
Scott: I actually kind of wish they would like….

957
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:05,510
Scott: It would be really cool if they took this book, right?

958
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,130
Scott: And you could even leave the Astro Boy story.

959
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,570
Scott: But what you do is you make that girl the focus.

960
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,450
Scott: Like everything is from her perspective.

961
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,650
Scott: And like the Super Boy is like just sort of barely in it in the background.

962
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,830
Rym: He's the force of nature.

963
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,890
Scott: He's sort of like not even there, but it's all about this girl.

964
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,908
Scott: Like you show her going home at night and the Super Boy is just sort of there-ish.

965
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,290
Scott: You know, that would have been fucking awesome.

966
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,410
Rym: Because then you could do a whole thing where his thoughts are really just her projecting.

967
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:34,570
Scott: And because the girl's actually pretty cool.

968
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:34,864
Rym: Yeah.

969
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:44,030
Rym: But like her projecting on him and her having, you know, expecting all these reactions to situations or expecting all these sorts of things, but really it's just her projection.

970
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:45,090
Rym: She can't understand him.

971
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,087
Rym: He's totally alien to her.

972
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:46,885
Scott: Yeah, and he's….

973
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,190
Rym: But no, they didn't go in that direction.

974
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:57,050
Rym: And, you know, to go from you saying props, my biggest con with this, and it's funny because everyone told me that they thought I'd really like this one.

975
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,830
Rym: And they're probably going to be surprised that I give it a met.

976
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:01,590
Rym: It wreaks a little too much of effort.

977
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:05,170
Rym: Like it's trying too hard to be poignant and serious.

978
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:08,550
Rym: And it's not doing it terribly elegantly.

979
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:09,179
Rym: Maybe.

980
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,750
Scott: I like the arts.

981
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:10,668
Rym: I like the arts too.

982
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:16,330
Rym: It was a little too, you know, the monologues of Super Boy were a little too forced.

983
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:17,357
Scott: Oh, yeah.

984
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:18,368
Scott: What am I?

985
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,328
Scott: Who am I?

986
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:20,770
Rym: Oh, this is a simulation.

987
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,509
Rym: What do you see?

988
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:23,207
Scott: What do you see?

989
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:25,430
Rym: But in this case, he's like, what do I see?

990
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,968
Rym: I see this and this and this and this and this.

991
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:28,989
Scott: Yup.

992
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:34,246
Rym: So I'm going to have to give it a met just for that because it could have been so much better, but they didn't go….

993
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,990
Scott: I also gave it a met, but it was almost good.

994
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:42,590
Rym: It's funny to me how I've given one of these comics a met because it wasn't crazy enough.

995
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:46,069
Rym: And yet the ones that I hate the most are the craziest ones.

996
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:47,226
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

997
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,130
Rym: There's a certain kind of crazy, like there's over the top crazy, like if….

998
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,350
Scott: I think what it is, is it's just about, it's not about that you like crazy or you like uncrazy.

999
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,870
Scott: It's like given this sort of raw material, what direction do you take it?

1000
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:09,970
Scott: And it seems like they take the raw materials in the opposite direction of whatever direction they naturally want to go in to make a balance.

1001
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:12,950
Scott: Whereas what they should do is they should just take it to the extreme.

1002
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:15,950
Scott: If something wants to go crazy, let it be crazy.

1003
00:48:16,153 --> 00:48:17,150
Rym: And then you get Legion Lost.

1004
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,368
Rym: It wants to be what it is and it is what it is.

1005
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:22,210
Scott: At least it's for somebody.

1006
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,409
Scott: Yeah, I have to give it that.

1007
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:26,289
Scott: In 52 comics, not all of them are going to be for everyone.

1008
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:32,230
Rym: I mean if you really like incomprehensible bullshit, Legion Lost is probably one of the better comics you could read.

1009
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,343
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are 52 of them.

1010
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:43,350
Scott: There's no way they could possibly all be good nor would I expect them to be because that would mean they would all be catering to me, which is not a good idea.

1011
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,589
Scott: You want to have some of them cater to different groups.

1012
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:49,305
Scott: So, you know, but I don't know.

1013
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:50,610
Scott: Whatever.

1014
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,269
Scott: You still should let them go in the direction they naturally want to go.

1015
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,348
Rym: I think that's pretty much it.

1016
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:56,647
Scott: That's it for week two.

1017
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:02,840
Scott: Next time on week three we got Batman, Catwoman, more Green Lanterns.

1018
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,389
Rym: Oh my god, that Green Lantern shit.

1019
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,550
Scott: More Legions of Superheroes and Wonder Woman with the cool cover.

1020
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,829
Rym: I feel like week one is my favorite week.

1021
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,410
Rym: Week four is my second favorite week because I kind of liked Aquaman.

1022
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,457
Scott: Well, we'll see.

1023
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:19,489
Scott: We'll get there.

1024
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,370
Rym: But seriously, Blue Beetle, that's the only one I didn't read yet from week three.

1025
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,903
Rym: The fuck's the Blue Beetle's deal because I see him.

1026
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:26,750
Rym: He comes up a lot.

1027
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,065
Scott: It's a guy who's got sort of this mechanical... It's like an outer space...

1028
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:31,769
Rym: So Iron Man.

1029
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:38,789
Scott: No, it's a magical scarab that came from outer space and you turn into Iron Man that way instead of being Iron Man because you're rich.

1030
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:41,007
Rym: Okay.

1031
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:48,070
Scott: Imagine if an alien artifact came in the window and you took it and it turned into cat armor.

1032
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:57,510
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1033
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,650
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1034
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:08,070
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1035
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,990
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1036
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:15,350
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1037
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:19,246
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1038
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,570
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1039
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,670
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
