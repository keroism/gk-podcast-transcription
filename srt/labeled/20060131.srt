1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,947
Rym: It's Tuesday January 31st, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:20,389
Rym: tonight We nominally talk about gaming clubs with our returning guest Emily, but we mostly just run off on a whole bunch of tangents.

3
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,407
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,677
Rym: So we're here and once again.

5
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:27,348
Rym: We have a guest Emily who's been on the show before.

6
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:36,591
Emily: yep Hello So I don't really have much of a thing of the day except if you want to hear about how to chop onions the right Way.

7
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:42,868
Emily: I found a video about the correct way to chop onions But I figure you know that might not have a sufficient quotient of geek.

8
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:49,410
Scott: well We did do a whole episode on food one time on food wasn't really so much about food, but it was supposed to be.

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,441
Scott: Yeah, like it was funny stories about any food stories.

10
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:56,110
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it was just an excuse to get Adam on the show.

11
00:00:56,415 --> 00:01:01,645
Emily: Yeah, well I've just you know come to the conclusion that my food skills are less than adequate.

12
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:05,309
Emily: so I was like poking around online searching for the correct way to stir-fry.

13
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:14,549
Emily: but Anyway instead of doing a thing of the day so much I thought I'd relate an anecdote a weird thing that happened to me yesterday.

14
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:35,005
Emily: Cuz I've you know I've been back home for the last couple of weeks because you know I'm going abroad And I'm not back in school and so I just came back to New York to start to you know wrap things up And you know I had to go see a few of my teachers And you know see my roommate for the last time and everything like that.

15
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,753
Emily: and so I Was.

16
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:43,650
Emily: it was kind of funny too because I bought my computer and then She's got a sexy little.

17
00:01:47,851 --> 00:02:00,535
Emily: It's just an iBook oh, but it's so so so so wonderful, but anyway, so I The credit card cut me off because I'd never made a purchase over like $30 or something.

18
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,925
Emily: and they're like whoa computer sale what.

19
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,210
Emily: and then they shut it off.

20
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:11,035
Emily: So I had to you know after this big dramatic exit of like goodbye goodbye everyone I shan't see you for so long.

21
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:16,130
Emily: I come running back upstairs like five minutes later being like I can't get in the subway.

22
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,118
Emily: I have no money.

23
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:17,964
Emily: Give me two bucks.

24
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:23,110
Rym: You know I remember my credit card did that to me when I first ordered my computer when I was in high school.

25
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,261
Emily: Oh, it was so bad like $3,000.

26
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:29,711
Rym: They must have thought there's no way a kid in high school is $3,000.

27
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:34,730
Scott: Well, I had problems where the addresses would be messed up, but I never had problems with spending too much money.

28
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:39,910
Rym: Well a lot of credit cards mostly debit cards more than credit cards like almost exclusively debit cards.

29
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,989
Rym: I'll do this if you take out too much money all at once They'll fight your account and lock it until you call them and tell them that you're not that no one stole your card.

30
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,110
Scott: I guess it's a good thing that I have a credit card and not a debit card.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,870
Emily: then I was late for my train and you know I get up to Grand Central and I'm just kind of hanging around.

32
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,081
Emily: I have about half an hour until my train comes.

33
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:00,810
Emily: so I'm in the you know the Great Hall.

34
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:12,210
Emily: It's kind of watching the people Kind of out of the way leaning against the wall And there's this girl next to me reading a book like she's sitting on the floor a couple a couple of yards away And I'm not paying any attention.

35
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,750
Emily: You know I'm just kind of watching and spacing out and got my computer.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,678
Emily: And so she you know this guy in a leather jacket comes up and says something then walks away And you know not paying attention.

37
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:28,304
Emily: and then a few minutes later You know he's kind of creepy looking, but there's people all around.

38
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:29,429
Emily: I'm not paying any attention.

39
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:36,070
Emily: and Then a few minutes later this guy comes back, and he's acting like kind of weird.

40
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:43,493
Emily: He's like and he says in this like creepy hitting on a woman sort of voice like hey lady That's a nice book.

Emily: There weren't a whole lot of people where we were.

56
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:31,244
Emily: we're kind of like in a corner out of the main In place where people go, but anyway it was like what the heck This is like really really out of line here, and so I'm like what a creep.

Emily: But if he had been like a real jerk who is trying to like Be like what was that?

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,743
Scott: Go kick you.

74
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:47,235
Scott: That's a lot like the The purse snatching story.

75
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:51,350
Emily: yeah, that's what Rym said you know and that's what makes me feel really good about New York.

76
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:58,910
Rym: Like everybody's down on the city I mean look at this every time something bad is about to happen everyone around just kind of steps up and does the right thing.

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,857
Emily: What's like I'm like after 9/11?

78
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,787
Emily: it's like people really pulled together, and they'd help each other out.

79
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:09,845
Scott: I was always like What just people led stereotypes, and they were scared because there was he suburbanites.

80
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,229
Scott: he's always been that way.

81
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:26,870
Emily: well Even in the 80s in the early 90s I mean even in just the past decade It's gotten a lot better as far as crime rates and just cleaned up a lot.

82
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,130
Emily: But you know and some people have mixed emotions about like the Disney vacation and the Giuliani years or whatever.

83
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,719
Emily: But you know it's.

84
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,730
Emily: it's a good place to live.

85
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,510
Rym: It's really I think a bright and shiny Times Square is at least a lot cooler than a porn shop filled time.

86
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,690
Scott: Yeah, and I mean yeah, I just I just miss my three-card Monty.

87
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,150
Rym: That's that's a wonderful

88
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,211
Scott: Yes,

89
00:06:52,592 --> 00:07:04,133
Emily: well I guess I'm just coming from the angle of like you know I live in Manhattan So I can't really speak much for some of the neighborhoods like in the Bronx and stuff because some of those are still a little Iffy, but

90
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:04,575
Scott: you

91
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,260
Emily: know New York's a good city.

92
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,728
Scott: You know what I really want to learn seriously.

93
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:18,686
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean I love Baltimore, but god damn there are a lot of angry homeless people following me around Whenever I walk outside.

94
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,474
Scott: It's like I had.

95
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:29,783
Scott: I remember I worked at a summer camp once and the other counselor was from like The worst place in all of Chicago area like the worst place, and she was like.

96
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:30,626
Scott: you know.

97
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:41,002
Scott: people think that you know you Suburban people think that like you go to a neighborhood Like Harlem where there's a bunch of black people all standing around in the street And they think that that's like a slum, and it's scary and dangerous.

98
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:41,062
Scott: No.

99
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,348
Rym: There's people in the street.

100
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,954
Scott: Yes That's not dangerous.

101
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,378
Scott: That's a great place to go.

102
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:56,461
Scott: you know where I where I've been you know every single window has bars over it No one's out on the street and the snipers in every window You know.

103
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:04,210
Emily: you gotta say though Even like you know alphabet city in the East Village and stuff that's cleaned up a lot since because my uncle used to live there.

104
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,199
Emily: He was telling stories about.

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,681
Emily: he kind of liked living in the building He was living in because it was.

106
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,696
Emily: it was run by drug dealers But they had snipers on the roof.

107
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:23,129
Emily: so all all other petty crime kind of cleared out and as long as you didn't mess with The drug people they'd leave you alone, and it was kind of like your building was protected by

108
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:29,670
Rym: In a city of God when Lil Zay and Benny kind of cleaned up the town even though they were selling drugs.

109
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:34,144
Scott: Yeah, it's like any mafia Mafia or gang in charge.

110
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:40,669
Scott: they don't let any other Mafias or gangs come in and as long as the police don't try to come in no one really fights or kills each other.

111
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,890
Scott: There's not a lot of violence It's.

112
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,930
Rym: so what do you do when a cruise ship with a thousand Yakuza on it parks in your Harbor?

113
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:46,749
Rym: Dumb dumb dumb.

114
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,439
Rym: Yeah We've had people complain about inside jokes before.

115
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,085
Rym: so yes, that was an inside joke.

116
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,490
Rym: read a manga called sanctuary.

117
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,006
Scott: It's out of print, but I can get it for you if you really want to.

118
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,095
Rym: yeah Can I spoil it?

119
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,842
Scott: It's like the best manga ever one of the best mangas ever.

120
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,043
Scott: well.

121
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:09,828
Rym: It's certainly it's not up there with.

122
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,182
Rym: you know Cantarella?

123
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:15,177
Emily: oh My god, I don't know why I've been.

124
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:20,398
Emily: I read Cantarella volume 2 when we were in the anime So you did read it.

125
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,910
Rym: Yeah, I did read most of it.

126
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,338
Emily: That's what I was making fun of when I was drawing all those little One I remember.

127
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,050
Rym: do we actually talk about Cantarella on the show?

128
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:31,587
Rym: Yeah, Cantarella is awesome.

129
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:45,899
Rym: Yeah in like a way that you just like want to laugh about it, but anyway in actual news The optimist keyboard which we've been nutting about for pretty much as long as we've known about Everyone has been nothing about who's seen it.

130
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,850
Rym: Yeah, it's finally kind of coming out.

131
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:57,374
Scott: Well, basically it's a but if you don't know it's supposed to be this keyboard where every key has a little monitor on it Made with o LEDs.

132
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:05,323
Scott: so like you're playing quake instead of having ABCD or AWS D They'll actually be little arrows and instead you know each.

133
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:20,130
Scott: instead of one two three four five You'll actually see like the little chain blade thing and the little pistol and the rocket launcher on your keys You know matching the icons on the screen or say you're using Photoshop or audacity or some kind of media entity type thing.

134
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,184
Rym: Your keyboard seven letters will have you know, the zoom in button.

135
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:32,380
Scott: just sitting there looking at you It makes a lot of sense because you know You only need the keyboard that you use it a lot But a lot of times the keyboard doesn't have any functionality.

136
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,479
Scott: like if I'm using I don't know Photoshop Start typing in the middle of the you know picture.

137
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,382
Scott: It doesn't do anything.

138
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,890
Scott: It only does something if I'm using like the text tool.

139
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:54,510
Scott: Yeah So binding all those things on the screen the buttons on the keyboard really makes it useful Considering it's a lot easier to just push a button then move the mouse click move the mouse again.

140
00:10:54,912 --> 00:11:00,261
Emily: Well actually like at school a lot of the editing suites We have specialized keyboards and like.

141
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:10,038
Emily: well even my final cut Express came with a bunch of peel-off stickers that you could put over your keyboard saying, you know, yeah this function This is the razor function.

142
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,250
Scott: This is this eliminates all those stickers.

143
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:21,607
Rym: My nasty keyboard I used for like over a decade that had those marker I'd written things all over the keyboard for like mega TF and quick - yeah.

144
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,895
Scott: So anyway, they were gonna make this thing and they made a picture of it and everything they designed it But it's not out yet.

145
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,283
Scott: What they did make is a little thing.

146
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:37,375
Scott: That's USB and it has three buttons which have monitors on them and It's basically kind of a tech demo.

147
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,859
Rym: slash prototype slash.

148
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,407
Rym: buy this to give us money to make the real thing.

149
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,510
Rym: buy it to look cool.

150
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,909
Scott: I guess it might be useful to someone but not really useful to me.

151
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:50,690
Rym: I think it should be really useful to those ricer equivalents for computers.

152
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,818
Rym: People have the cold cathodes and everything all over.

153
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,886
Scott: their PC might be useful if it was wireless.

154
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:55,850
Scott: because then think about this.

155
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,776
Scott: Right, you could have a little thing next like your bed and you pick it up and it would have a button For like.

156
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:14,298
Scott: then on the screen It would say how many new emails you have and you could push the button to launch your email thing maybe something that reads your email out loud to you from your computer or The other button.

157
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:20,441
Scott: Yeah, you know, you're really stretching it Rolling in it and you push it to update the news.

158
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:22,830
Scott: or you know, you could come up with some pretty good stuff.

159
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,318
Scott: It has uses but nothing worth buying.

160
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,645
Rym: It's low resolution and it doesn't refresh quickly.

161
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,010
Rym: It's basically just a tech demo.

162
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:34,150
Rym: Yeah, you can actually see physically what this keyboard is going to be like but they are making it and selling it.

163
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,494
Rym: So yeah, I think it's gonna be $100.

164
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,030
Rym: It's kind of hard to tell from the website.

165
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:45,870
Scott: $100 to three buttons really doesn't cut it because I spent less than $100 and I get a mouse and a numpad Yeah, which doubles as a calculator and a thermometer.

166
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:53,860
Rym: I mean I guess to me if the Optimus keyboard as the original concept was ever comes out on the market I'd pay a good 200 bucks for that thing.

167
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,468
Scott: I think I don't think it's gonna cause 200 bucks.

168
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:00,863
Scott: Yeah, that's why I'm kind of leery of the current rate of three buttons for $100.

169
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:07,179
Scott: That means a hundred and four buttons for Yeah, wow, you're real good at math.

170
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,448
Rym: I like how you just came up with that figure so quickly.

171
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:19,161
Scott: Mm-hmm You know just out of the blue 104 divided by three That's about thirty four thirty five.

172
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:20,647
Scott: so thirty five hundred dollars.

173
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,162
Scott: so You may or may not know about this.

174
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:35,016
Scott: there's a thing called Star Force and Star Force is this software that comes with PC games certain PC games to prevent you from Copying and wheresing the PC games.

175
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:39,410
Rym: It's basically all of all those copy protection programs that have been out in the past.

176
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:44,103
Rym: The it seems to be the most effective and at the same time the most horrible.

177
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:59,280
Scott: So what this does is Installs a new driver Which is kind of funny actually and it which I'll talk about in a second and the driver kind of replaces your CD-ROM IDE driver things But it doesn't work.

178
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,763
Scott: So great.

179
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:14,810
Scott: So what ends up happening is you end up failing to read CDs and your IDE drivers and modules start failing and Windows like reverts all the way back to 16-bit mode at which point things just don't work.

180
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:25,883
Scott: And there have even been numerous reports of like Hardware destroying like your DVD roms will just die Because this thing uses the shitty drivers that just screw everything up.

181
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:31,575
Rym: and before you call shenanigans on that I'd like to note that it is fairly Trivial.

182
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,940
Rym: it's not so trivial anymore.

183
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:33,663
Rym: But back in the day.

184
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:40,549
Rym: It was fairly trivial to ruin CD-Rs and DVD readers and monitors by giving them improper input.

185
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,984
Rym: You take an old monitor and give it certain frequencies.

186
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,450
Rym: it'll just destroy itself physically.

187
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:50,428
Scott: So you basically have a thing designed to prevent people from copying CDs.

188
00:14:51,571 --> 00:15:11,277
Scott: that in effect destroys many DVD roms and ruins computers and makes computers crash because it's unstable and poorly written and a lot of PC game people are using this and There's a new movement to boycott any game that uses star force and a lot of game companies are stopping the use of it But it's still out there.

189
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:12,261
Rym: I mean, it's.

190
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:16,958
Rym: I mean if any of you read penny arcade Tycho has been railing about it fairly often lately.

191
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,230
Emily: So what's an example of a game that all right seven sins a neato?

192
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,134
Rym: Africa core versus desert.

193
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:27,004
Rym: rats beyond divinity blitzkrieg rolling thunder breed chaos.

194
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,087
Scott: You don't have to read the whole list.

195
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,070
Rym: code name outbreak.

196
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,801
Scott: Yeah, it's in the idea that lots of them.

197
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,504
Rym: All right, wait a minute.

198
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:38,322
Rym: It's in the Garfield game Destroyed by Garfield.

199
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,129
Rym: Oh my god.

200
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,177
Scott: Point is is Today or the other day boing.

201
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:48,713
Scott: boing made a story about Star Force and they said yeah, it's it's malware Whatever.

202
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:58,250
Scott: So the guy in charge of Star Force is his Russian guy I think or Eastern European at the least sent them an email that was like, oh I will sue you.

203
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,474
Scott: You called it malware.

204
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:00,758
Scott: I called the FBI on you.

205
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,225
Scott: Yeah now obviously he's just lying.

206
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:04,650
Rym: That's the classic sign.

207
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,864
Rym: I mean sometimes you'll get a real cease-and-desist order from someone.

208
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,049
Scott: it looks like it's from a lawyer.

209
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:15,370
Scott: Well, it has lawyerly talk and not the kind of lawyerly talk in a Nigerian scam a real lawyerly talk.

210
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:28,721
Rym: But I guess rule number one because Jack Thompson does this a lot too Is that if you get any sort of legal threat like that and it ever includes something along the lines of I called the police Or I called the FBI or I called the Secret Service.

211
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,130
Rym: You can safely ignore it because it's bullshit.

212
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,228
Scott: yeah, it's someone just trying to scare you and being stupid and evil.

213
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:42,418
Scott: and If it's a real cease-and-desist, it'll be very lawyerly and very official and Then you should actually be scared of that.

214
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:52,289
Rym: because that means you know, unless there's something awful They've received hundreds of perfectly legitimate cease-and-desist that they've not only ignored but posted on the website and mocked publicly.

215
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:57,090
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but that the point is is that if it's something like this, I mean you can go read this thing online.

216
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,921
Scott: it's just hilarious.

217
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:09,050
Scott: and Apparently this guy has sent similar things to all kinds of people who say that star force is bad and Everyone's making fun of this guy now because he's such an idiot

218
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:15,289
Emily: Like you can't cover up bad information by just you know, telling people not to talk about

219
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:15,369
Scott: it.

220
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,597
Scott: He's not telling people not to talk about it.

221
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,542
Scott: He's scaring people into not talking about it.

222
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:24,087
Rym: Well, yeah, he's telling people not to talk about it Because if people do talk about it.

223
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:31,952
Rym: Maybe the companies that buy his terrible program will hear about this and realize that oh one it doesn't work - it actually harms my Customers.

224
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,160
Rym: and three the guy who makes it's kind of a nut job.

225
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,690
Scott: They should sue the guy who makes it like for real.

226
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:37,774
Scott: You know, it's.

227
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,802
Scott: it's like sometimes they sue people and it's stupid.

228
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,670
Scott: This guy should get totally screwed.

229
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:50,267
Rym: I mean I guess for anyone who's looking at for perspective on this a lot of people who are in the know Consider it as bad as if not worse than the Sony rootkit.

230
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,209
Rym: Yeah So use that as a nice.

231
00:17:53,853 --> 00:18:00,658
Scott: The sunny rootkit would screw you over but it wouldn't destroy your DVD burner Yeah, or even you're just plain old CD-ROM or whatever.

232
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,723
Emily: you had nasty stuff on your.

233
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:11,288
Rym: I'm still shopping around for a computer and I Found pretty much I can buy a super awesome dual layer DVD burner of awesome speed for like 40 bucks.

234
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:21,723
Scott: Oh, yeah That's because you know This blu-ray hdvd thing is putting down the prices of the normal burners Which is fine because I have no desire for blu-ray or hdvd whatsoever.

235
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:35,410
Emily: That's why I totally got the Lower end iBook though because basically the only difference was that the 14-inch had the combo drive And that's just like a DVD burner and I'm like, it's not worth.

236
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,835
Emily: Okay, but I love.

237
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,963
Emily: my new computer opened it last night.

238
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:46,650
Emily: I was like jumping around the room.

239
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,222
Rym: Yeah, I I was trying to make my computer and I keep looking like.

240
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,114
Rym: I built it today in a new egg and it was About.

241
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,390
Rym: it should have been about five hundred dollars total.

242
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:04,223
Rym: But I fell into the trap that all computer geeks fall into when they're designing a computer online Where you know Rams not that expensive on four gigs.

243
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:04,664
Rym: Why not?

244
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:05,809
Scott: You don't need four gigs.

245
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,425
Rym: I know I ended up going with two gigs and they're like.

246
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:08,988
Scott: two is fine.

247
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,136
Rym: Three hard drives raid five.

248
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,520
Rym: I'll get the claw hammer.

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,684
Rym: It's not that much more.

250
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,188
Scott: Yeah, it is actually.

251
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:15,690
Rym: no, it's not.

252
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:20,290
Emily: So what would you use all that RAM for other than like podcast nothing even if he had four.

253
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,290
Rym: I'll point out that I was not literally saying I'll get four gigs.

254
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:35,890
Rym: it was just like it was an example of a computer geek sitting down and Just slowly expanding the scope of what they wanted just because they're not really looking at the price as much as they should.

255
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,015
Emily: I need RAM.

256
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:43,627
Emily: I'm the one of everybody who needs RAM because I do all the 3d I get exactly what I need and no more.

257
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:48,081
Rym: I gotta say PC3200 RAM is about 80 bucks.

258
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:48,825
Rym: It's almost nothing.

259
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:53,193
Scott: Yeah Yeah, 80 bucks times four There's.

260
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,819
Scott: three hundred and twenty dollars is quite a bit.

261
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,686
Scott: You can buy almost a whole computer for that.

262
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,927
Emily: Yeah, I'm here I'm be a skin-flint Yankee.

263
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:09,024
Rym: The main thing that got me was that the claw hammer is only $80 more than the lowest lowest end Athlon that'll fit in.

264
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,930
Scott: you know, there's is quite a bit in terms of CPUs.

265
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,621
Scott: There's some CPUs that can be had for $80.

266
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:16,257
Scott: Yeah So that's quite a jump.

267
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:20,571
Scott: I'm you I usually go up as long as the jumps are in the 10 to $20.

268
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:21,738
Scott: You know less than 20 bucks.

269
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,629
Scott: I'll keep going higher on the CPUs.

270
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:38,085
Rym: But as soon as there's a jump more than $20 see that's what it was I started at the lowest end CPU that'll fit in my computer and every jump up was 10 to $20 Until the claw hammer that I've settled upon the next chip up was $300.

271
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:38,185
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,351
Scott: Yeah It's.

273
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:45,654
Scott: it's sort of like this graph where it goes up a little bit a little bit a little bit and then it goes crazy Like the next job.

274
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:54,270
Scott: It's like up by up by a dollar up by $2 up by $5 up by $10 You know and each next chip is only a couple dollars more than the last.

275
00:20:54,691 --> 00:21:01,769
Scott: But then you look at it from beginning to end and you're like, oh all those little $2 is add up to like 50 bucks But that's okay.

276
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:14,240
Scott: but then eventually you see the next chip is like $50 more than the previous one and you got to say alright, it's not $50 faster than the previous one But it is $50 more.

277
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,166
Scott: so I'm not gonna get it.

278
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:21,894
Rym: though honestly, what I might do is I'll buy the lowest end chip that'll fit in that socket and Then a year from now.

279
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:34,778
Rym: I'll put the fastest chip that'll fit in that socket, you know that strategy Works in theory, but it not really because what happens what ends up happening is well keep in mind with computers for me I'm pretty much on a six-year upgrade scale.

280
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,842
Scott: Yeah, me too.

281
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,310
Scott: But you know, what happens is that chip?

282
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,309
Scott: That's the slowest one that goes in the socket will be too slow for anything you do.

283
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,550
Rym: It's more than three times faster than my current chip.

284
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:51,590
Scott: You have no idea this laptop here that I got from work as a crazy fast CPU, right?

285
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,057
Scott: It is the old.

286
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,310
Scott: the CPU is the only bottleneck for me on this thing.

287
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,150
Scott: It is constantly at a hundred percent is pissing me off and it basically makes it completely useless.

288
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,841
Rym: Well, see for me currently my bottleneck is actually RAM and hard drive.

289
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:06,448
Scott: you still you're gonna have a CPU bottleneck.

290
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:10,040
Rym: Trust me Only for encoding mp3 is most of what I do.

291
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,385
Rym: It's just very hard drive intensive.

292
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:12,470
Rym: That's why I'm getting the raid box.

293
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,316
Scott: It's more CPU intensive than you think.

294
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:18,030
Scott: you just don't realize because right now your CPU is getting maxed out.

295
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,516
Rym: No, it's not not even close.

296
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:25,443
Rym: Yeah, no when I do most of my audio filtering on the podcast My CPU sits around 40% and my hard drive is going.

297
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:26,468
Rym: chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

298
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:34,111
Scott: Yeah Yeah, you know what if your hard drive wasn't going chugga chugga chugga and you had an s8 a drive your CPU would be Going.

299
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,476
Scott: oh, I can't do anything.

300
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:42,483
Rym: You know what it doesn't because the cheapest chip that goes into my the motherboard I'm looking at is probably gonna be perfectly adequate for at least a couple years.

301
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,347
Scott: Yeah, what chip?

302
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,110
Scott: what chip is it?

303
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,033
Rym: It's uh, Athlon 64 3200.

304
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,776
Scott: that's not really the.

305
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:51,469
Rym: it's not the cheapest one that'll go in but it's it's very cheap.

306
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,357
Scott: Oh, so it's not the cheapest one.

307
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:57,475
Rym: Well the cheapest one that'll go in they don't sell on Newegg anymore Really?

308
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,583
Rym: Yeah, at least I didn't see it.

309
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:02,320
Rym: I Sorted by price and that was the cheapest one that was listed in stock.

310
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:07,017
Scott: I would still go look at some like Comparisons of chips to make sure.

311
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:10,711
Scott: because yeah, I did and I saw because it's an athlete, you know, cuz yeah I did.

312
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:15,589
Rym: I look at all the different cores and I looked at all the benchmarks and this isn't a computer show So I didn't really want to get into it.

313
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:22,410
Rym: But they're all very similar and the differences in the benchmarks are almost nothing until I get well beyond what I'm willing to spend.

314
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:23,993
Scott: Yeah, well that's the thing.

315
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:29,109
Scott: it I always mess that up recently when I look at benchmarks is because the graph doesn't.

316
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:34,188
Rym: Yeah, you look like a giant jump in the graph and then you looked at the scale is in like two hundredths of a second.

317
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:39,767
Scott: Well, no, usually what I have been is I look at the graph and it's a tiny jump and then I look closer and it's like a hundred.

318
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:46,793
Rym: Now I was looking and there's really very little difference in the range of chips that I'm willing to pay money for in terms of Performance.

319
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,064
Rym: if I jump beyond the range, I'm willing to pay.

320
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:53,850
Rym: there's a crazy jump If I get the at like the Athlon FX whatever but I don't need that.

321
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,678
Scott: Really it's like a thousand dollar processing.

322
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,822
Scott: Yeah, screw that.

323
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:01,428
Rym: Yeah, let's not get into it.

324
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,530
Rym: cuz you know This is happy get whatever you want.

325
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:12,550
Scott: But I'm just telling you getting the plan of getting the slowest one and then upgrading to the fastest one doesn't usually work because the fastest one stays crazy expensive.

326
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:23,550
Rym: Yeah, well it worked for me because honestly the PC I got now has pretty much one of the slowest chips that'll fit in it and I could have bought for very little money and extremely the fastest chip that'll go into this motherboard.

327
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:27,330
Rym: And the only reason I didn't is because this computer is so old that it's falling apart.

328
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:33,310
Rym: Anyway, you know things like this once I get my new computer I'm probably gonna buy whatever Athlon will fit in this computer when I make a server.

329
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,475
Scott: I thought about doing that too.

330
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:40,856
Scott: I can put the Athlon XP 3200 in my computer, but It's still out years later.

331
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:42,262
Scott: There's like a two or three year old computer.

332
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,250
Scott: that thing is still two or three hundred dollars.

333
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:49,207
Rym: It hasn't gone down in price at all really because the the fast ones that'll go into my computer are 50 60 bucks.

334
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,541
Scott: Well, that's because your computer is so old.

335
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:53,586
Rym: My computer is six years old.

336
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,470
Rym: That's about my upgrade.

337
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,358
Scott: My computer is two or three years old.

338
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,030
Rym: Yeah, like I said, I'm using your original plan.

339
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,384
Scott: You said oh, I'll buy the slowest one and then a year later.

340
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:02,290
Scott: I'll upgrade to the fast.

341
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:03,056
Rym: No, I was.

342
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:11,093
Scott: my plan wasn't specifically that I said a year or a year or two that no you need to literally wait six years And you know what.

343
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:14,849
Scott: then I will but you're not gonna live with that slow processor that whole time.

344
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:25,829
Scott: Yeah, barely you ever.

345
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:30,442
Scott: You know out and about the town or maybe drive down a highway or something.

346
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,144
Scott: You got a pee.

347
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:32,950
Scott: There's no convenient bathrooms.

348
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,320
Scott: There's a nasty bathroom or whatever and you resort to.

349
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,330
Scott: you know, peeing in the woods peeing in an alley something like that.

350
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:43,622
Scott: Well some guy developed what I think is a pretty awesome solution.

351
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,809
Scott: It's called the pee tree.

352
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:52,030
Scott: It's basically this giant porcelain tree and you pee on the tree.

353
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,309
Rym: That's just fantastic.

354
00:25:54,813 --> 00:26:02,026
Scott: And the way the tree is made because the material you know The the liquid just kind of go flows down the tree nicely without getting all over the see.

355
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:06,789
Rym: I'm looking at the picture and one I imagine drunk guys just peeing on people across from them instead of peeing on the tree.

356
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,270
Scott: Well, if you're drunk, but you know, come on, even drunk guys can hit the toilet most of the time.

357
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,665
Scott: No, they can't most of the time.

358
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:13,725
Scott: no.

359
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,730
Scott: But anyway the tree, you know.

360
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,066
Scott: but the other thing is that the trees are big enough that won't happen.

361
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,129
Scott: and the tree has a little trough at the bottom of it where the P collects and then goes in the sewer.

362
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:30,130
Scott: and I think it's pretty good because a lot of other countries they have like these public urinals just like in the street like little booths.

363
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,909
Scott: You just go in and pee and it's sometimes it's really hard to pee in this country.

364
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,192
Rym: Yeah, well, it's.

365
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:40,450
Rym: it's like every business is afraid of having people who aren't gonna spend money coming in and using their bathroom.

366
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,879
Scott: I don't know why you're afraid of that.

367
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,068
Rym: They're afraid that everyone's just gonna vandalize them.

368
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:53,950
Emily: Yeah Well, it is kind of the case that people And it's also to keep like the bathrooms cleaner, I guess, you know.

369
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,781
Emily: So people don't just go in and use them as a public toilet.

370
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:58,629
Emily: It's like keeps the number of people down.

371
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:04,232
Rym: Yeah, well plus if I mean if there were public pay toilets you can bet there'd be a hobo who finds a dollar and lives In it.

372
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,910
Scott: Oh, yeah, that is a problem with the hobos.

373
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:08,900
Scott: But come on, not every there are many.

374
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:10,870
Scott: most of the country is a non hobo area.

375
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:13,989
Scott: They're only hobos in like hobo towns, you know.

376
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:21,890
Rym: So I got to say even a lot of times now I think about it when I visit New York City like to visit you and I Got a pee and there's nowhere to pee unless I go and pay for something somewhere

377
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:26,129
Emily: They used to have like public pay toilets like deposit a quarter and you can

378
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:26,270
Scott: pee.

379
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,374
Scott: They had that though I would totally like.

380
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:33,529
Scott: I wouldn't live in it like a homeless guy but I'd find a way to get in and hack the.

381
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,769
Scott: you Know the lock or whatever it is.

382
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:45,670
Emily: I would pee for free, you know Toilet seat is locked and then you then you put the the little coin in and it opens.

383
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,701
Rym: Wow, you know I can see so many problems with that.

384
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,589
Rym: I mean, alright, so you gotta see.

385
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,098
Rym: wait You got to put a quarter in to open it right?

386
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:53,306
Rym: You just pee on it.

387
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:56,675
Emily: Yeah People probably did.

388
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:02,760
Scott: I had an idea once that we should make like at the rest stops There would be like a free bathroom and a pay bathroom.

389
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,695
Rym: So people who were like, oh, you know this again Yeah, are you this to death?

390
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:07,578
Rym: It's infeasible.

391
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,802
Rym: I know give it up.

392
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:09,364
Scott: Give it up.

393
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:12,975
Scott: It's good in in in concept Possible to execute.

394
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,048
Rym: Alright, he had this idea that you could somehow have like a

395
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:16,530
Scott: premium

396
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,102
Rym: Toilet stall in a rest stops that you have to pay to get into

397
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:28,553
Scott: so that people who were all like Fussy would pay extra and we basically take all their money because they would spend it to go in the nice toilet That was clean.

398
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:31,950
Emily: What did have like couches like a perfume?

399
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,787
Scott: Stall yeah, so like all the other ones would be like unflushed or clogged and one that you had to.

400
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:48,478
Rym: well, no Yeah, Scott, I remember very specifically that you're involved Extortion like she said actually making the other bad.

401
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:52,110
Rym: No, never my idea when I was in fact the primary.

402
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,833
Scott: No, it wasn't.

403
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:54,198
Scott: you're just making shit up now.

404
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:57,430
Rym: We've we've argued this to death to death.

405
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:04,213
Scott: The only thing that was a extortion e was the fact that we would clean the the other one more frequent the pay one more Frequently.

406
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:08,145
Rym: then yeah, wasn't your other idea that you have to pay to get out to know?

407
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:11,708
Scott: But that would be a good idea.

408
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:18,626
Emily: You know, it would only work if it was like, you know a separate premium like lounge like.

409
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:19,989
Emily: have you ever been in?

410
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:23,849
Emily: the bathrooms at like the Eastman theater.

411
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:25,777
Rym: Actually, you know what?

412
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:27,330
Rym: I've never had to pee at the Eastman theater.

413
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,770
Emily: Yeah, well the Eastman theater has like these chandelier bathrooms And it's like it looks like a restroom with couches and stuff like that.

414
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,010
Rym: Was there an attendant the guy who stands there in hand you a towel?

415
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,673
Emily: No, but you know close.

416
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,298
Scott: I've been to fancy bathrooms like that.

417
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:43,265
Scott: Radio City Music Hall has fancy bathrooms.

418
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,208
Scott: Actually.

419
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:46,602
Emily: Yeah, so You know.

420
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:48,896
Rym: So I could see.

421
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:53,965
Scott: so we go to a rest stop and there's a. there's a ballroom Bathroom next to the normal public toilet.

422
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:58,154
Emily: Yeah You could do.

423
00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:59,200
Emily: it is what I'm saying.

424
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,070
Rym: Yeah, cuz you need what I think you need a person.

425
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:11,490
Rym: There's no mechanical device that can allow a person into a place to pee Especially a guy and yet not allow them to pee without paying because they could just pee on the thing that takes their money.

426
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:35,055
Rym: All the vending machines would really stay Apparently Used to back in the day.

427
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:41,407
Rym: if you poured salt water into most vending machines, they just give you free stuff really It's just totally break them in.

428
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:53,890
Rym: I know they fixed this problem recently or recently like I think of ten years ago Because most vending machines have a little sign inside if you look that says it's basically warning salt water will not give free food.

429
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,158
Scott: I've never seen that in my life.

430
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,585
Rym: I've seen signs like that everywhere.

431
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,430
Scott: I'm sure that's not a snow.

432
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:04,287
Rym: I've seen them personally made not my cousin's brother's sister's dog, but I've never ever seen that.

433
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:09,604
Emily: yet to point it out to me I've seen you know funny pictures that are like do not push the venue.

434
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:13,661
Scott: Yeah, I see don't put your hand Slot because it'll get stuck.

435
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:14,969
Scott: That's that's a good one.

436
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:18,466
Rym: I saw like the one with like the crushed stick figure under a knockover coke machine.

437
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:19,230
Scott: Yeah, it's a great one.

438
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,641
Scott: Don't try to push it over.

439
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:21,709
Scott: It'll fall down and kill you.

440
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,447
Rym: But yeah pee is mostly salt and uric acid and water.

441
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,476
Emily: so Wet is like pee.

442
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,685
Emily: you pee out your armpits every day.

443
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:33,970
Rym: that explains.

444
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:41,508
Scott: Anyway, the tea tree is cool, and I hope someone installs a pea tree somewhere for me to pee on.

445
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:45,945
Rym: so This doesn't look like pea tree from the land before time does it?

446
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:50,942
Scott: no It's a giant white piece of ceramic not a course pterodactyl.

447
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:51,864
Rym: who likes to eat cherries.

448
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,730
Scott: Maybe it's a porcelain pterodactyl.

449
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,762
Rym: And my other concern is this is great for men.

450
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,529
Rym: What about a woman who has to pee?

451
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,719
Scott: Women don't seem to have a problem finding places to be.

452
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,040
Scott: do they?

453
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:04,290
Rym: are you serious Scott?

454
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,016
Emily: Have you ever seen the line?

455
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:10,931
Emily: That's like for all you the Joke.

456
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:12,920
Scott: not everyone in that line is there to pee.

457
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:14,909
Scott: women go to the bathroom to do all kinds of other stuff.

458
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:18,029
Scott: Oh my god, no it takes longer.

459
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:26,710
Scott: See here we are going on a rant here because you know Scott has just exceeded his quotient of sexism.

460
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,606
Emily: For all you listeners who are not aware Scott is the king of the sexist joke.

461
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:36,385
Emily: like I was nice I stayed home today because you know I figured going in the city.

462
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,550
Emily: I had other stuff to do.

463
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:43,430
Emily: I wanted to play with my new computer, and so I stayed at the house, and you know I looked in the fridge.

464
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:44,796
Emily: There's you know all the stuff.

465
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,590
Emily: I'm like maybe I'll make dinner, so I cook and he comes in the door.

466
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,677
Emily: He's like yeah, that's the way it should be.

467
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:56,193
Emily: you know the woman made us, but not what's sadder is even So easy?

468
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:56,976
Emily: no, it's.

469
00:32:57,176 --> 00:33:05,264
Emily: it's like well as easy as it may be it's still like Grotesquely, you know you're like a relic from the 1950s.

470
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:17,962
Rym: Actually Think the operative thing here is that even when Emily's not here, and I have dinner ready, and he comes home He that he says the same thing to me.

471
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:22,347
Emily: Yeah We all know Scott's the wife in the relationship.

472
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,099
Rym: Yeah, yeah What the Necco?

473
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:25,883
Rym: they call it now?

474
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,029
Emily: He is the okay?

475
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,875
Rym: Yeah, but actually there's a funny anecdote related to that because RIT has a very.

476
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:34,658
Rym: I mean, I'm not.

477
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,787
Scott: I think we sold this one the jeopardy.

478
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,159
Scott: the jeopardy I think we told that.

479
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:38,989
Scott: I don't think we told this.

480
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,457
Rym: Well tell it anyway because we might.

481
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:49,009
Rym: I think we told it on one of the unaired lost episodes of GeekNights Maybe but basically the the feminist group at RIT.

482
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:53,945
Rym: They are a little bit beyond what I would consider rational feminism.

483
00:33:54,286 --> 00:34:04,810
Scott: I think it's just because Yes, it's because the people who have a full-time job of working for the women-centered RIT are a little whoa Yeah, and they're all men too who run it.

484
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,593
Rym: it's kind of weird.

485
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:11,253
Rym: a couple of them that like all the heads of it are men and the advisor is a man and He's the biggest.

486
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,822
Rym: I mean I've met some simple dicks in my life.

487
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:16,553
Rym: This guy is the most horrible dick I've ever met.

488
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:20,090
Rym: he was just a giant jerk every time I ever spoke to this person.

489
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:38,367
Rym: it was the most adversarial relationship I've ever had with anyone, but We just we noticed that this group was doing a women's history month jeopardy, and you could sign up teams and compete on it and We decided that we were going to do something hilarious and by hilarious.

490
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:39,070
Rym: I mean offensive.

491
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:43,350
Rym: We were gonna go and we came up with this kind of like oh, what if we did this?

492
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:50,656
Rym: Oh, what if we did this and we just stand there with this big grins on our faces and no matter what the question was One of the answer was whatever.

493
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,283
Rym: the answer was yeah, because it's jeopardy.

494
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,609
Rym: see I would have lost right there.

495
00:34:54,251 --> 00:35:02,890
Rym: Something like Pete would just ring in and say back in the kitchen To which you know obviously isn't the answer and then I would ring in and say where she belongs.

496
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:11,810
Rym: And we wondered how many times we could do this before they just kicked us out And and then we talked ourselves into actually doing it like let's actually do it.

497
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:14,749
Scott: And then you realize that the jeopardy was over like an hour ago.

498
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:17,590
Rym: So we spent an hour coming up with a stupid idea.

499
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:23,088
Rym: Then we spent another like 20 minutes actually working up the courage to go out and I was ready to do it.

500
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:23,790
Rym: that offense.

501
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:29,763
Rym: I just needed a team and then we were completely shot down by the fact that we missed it because we spent so much time Talking about it.

502
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:44,090
Scott: It would have been funny no, but seriously like if I tell a joke like you know a joke about maybe punch out in bicycles It's not because I'm racist or I actually think that people have a different skin or something.

503
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:50,335
Emily: The thing is though a lot of times you you have misinformation About women.

504
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,794
Emily: you say these things that even if they're not a joke a lot of times You're not joking.

505
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:55,906
Emily: you just say these really obscure things.

506
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,636
Emily: You're like Why would you think women do that?

507
00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,378
Emily: or why would you?

508
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:03,029
Emily: it's like just intense stereotype like why?

509
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:03,089
Scott: oh?

510
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,780
Emily: God, let's let's see you're so alright.

511
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,330
Rym: What are women do in the bathroom Scott?

512
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,629
Scott: Put on makeup, and they look in the mirror.

513
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,437
Emily: Women take so long in the bathroom is one.

514
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:19,059
Emily: men have more places to go because they have urinals - it takes women longer because they Have to take off their pants and sit down.

515
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,269
Emily: then you know go through this whole thing.

516
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:23,888
Emily: Biological difference.

517
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:26,983
Rym: Once I was at a band event and we're all like.

518
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,254
Rym: we had eight buses full of kids And we all had to pee.

519
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:34,800
Rym: so we stopped at this rest stop and the girls all lined up And there's really no way to speed up what they were doing.

520
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:36,265
Rym: and the men we all had to go.

521
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:43,422
Rym: so bad that we used every urinal yeah, and the sinks and People took turns at the sink, but how are they?

522
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:44,950
Scott: there are more urinals than toilets?

523
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,578
Scott: Why don't these urinals take less space?

524
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,690
Scott: Why don't they just make the women's bathroom bigger?

525
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:49,329
Rym: You know what?

526
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:53,917
Emily: Actually there were some things that they were saying.

527
00:36:53,977 --> 00:37:02,438
Emily: businesses are trying to go back in and increase the floor space of you know per foot to Versus the male's.

528
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:05,210
Rym: yeah, actually I saw an article on FARC about that not too long ago.

529
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:14,009
Rym: They were talking about how the rules originally were that men's and women's bathroom equal square footage And then this much square footage of bathroom per square footage of occupied space.

530
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:18,950
Emily: And here's here's a good example that this was the time that you made me so mad on the train.

531
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,909
Emily: You almost made me like, you know hit you like I hit you in the knee or something like that.

532
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,170
Emily: Yeah, that was our big train fight and people were like looking at us.

533
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,964
Emily: But the whole yeah, cuz boys play with Barbie doll or?

534
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,550
Emily: no, that was not the way it went.

535
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:39,318
Emily: It was boys play with video games and girls play with Barbie dolls And that's why there are no girls in the sciences.

536
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:40,040
Scott: video games.

537
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,987
Emily: Well, that's what I said.

538
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:47,077
Scott: and you said oh no Matchbox cars not Barbie doll.

539
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,662
Emily: No video games.

540
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,027
Scott: and I didn't say video games.

541
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,010
Scott: There are girly video games.

542
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,148
Emily: No, he's trying to rationalize it.

543
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:55,733
Emily: We were on the train.

544
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,741
Emily: He was just set on this thing.

545
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,487
Rym: All right, Scott what Barbie horse adventure?

546
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:08,750
Rym: Yeah Scott that most of the girls we know are quite hip to gaming.

547
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,902
Scott: Those are the girls we know that are like old.

548
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:17,073
Rym: and talking about little kids here When I was a little kid all my actually when I was in first grade I it was.

549
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:20,606
Rym: she was my girlfriend and I. you could see me make the quotes.

550
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:21,428
Rym: cuz we were just friends.

551
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,152
Rym: cuz I was a Little.

552
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,244
Rym: I was a little Mac pimp when I was in first grade.

553
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,250
Rym: I followed all the girls around.

554
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,529
Emily: Yeah, he was the lone blue shirt in the sea of jumpers.

555
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:30,490
Rym: Yeah, I went to a Catholic school.

556
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:42,101
Scott: No But that argument anyway All I was trying to say was that the fact that girls play with Barbie and boys play with matchbox cars is not entirely Due to the commercials that they watch during TV shows.

557
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:49,404
Scott: there is also there is something other reason besides Society and graining that idea into children that that is the way it is.

558
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,330
Emily: I think society is a great part of it.

559
00:38:51,410 --> 00:39:02,196
Emily: I also think there are some psychological differences But all I'm saying is a lot of times the way you present this stuff comes across as incredibly Insufferably sexist.

560
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:03,182
Scott: Well, I don't know.

561
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,409
Scott: No one else seems to think so.

562
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:18,414
Scott: Yes, they do Scott You don't see me beating women or Scott.

563
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:23,210
Rym: you often make very good logical arguments about things.

564
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:29,264
Rym: However, you often as your evidence will make up a meta a hypothetical situation.

565
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,830
Rym: that is absurd to the point of being offensive.

566
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:40,074
Rym: I'm not bringing up the classic one that all of us cite because I don't really feel like bothering with it on the air But good God.

567
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,446
Scott: Well, that's the other thing is I don't think that anything is offensive.

568
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,610
Scott: I think people are offended.

569
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,393
Emily: No, I'm just.

570
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:50,729
Emily: I'm just mainly messing with you because like like I said tonight you've been on a roll.

571
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,559
Emily: What was the gun emcee thing?

572
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,690
Emily: It's like her boobs are big cuz she's pregnant.

573
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,738
Emily: He was making reference.

574
00:39:58,778 --> 00:39:59,581
Emily: cuz we're talking about.

575
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:11,047
Emily: she's smart enough to be the captain of the spaceship And I said, oh that Scientific American article about you know, the woman's Intelligence changing when they become pregnant, you know that there are different psychological.

576
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:14,288
Scott: and then I was like There must be something to that.

577
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:24,962
Scott: Eating pizza and pickles, you know Scott you just made a joke poorly and we Didn't get it wasn't much of a joke.

578
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,429
Scott: It was just more kind of like an a.

579
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:29,442
Emily: So let's let's stop picking on Scott.

580
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,833
Emily: yeah talk about something though I'll admit there's.

581
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:35,590
Rym: no I'm glad you came up because I don't know what it is with you people.

582
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:44,189
Rym: You must be sadis, but I got more feedback about yesterday's episode than about any other freaking episode We've done and everyone was telling me.

583
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:50,689
Rym: All it was was me and Scott arguing with each other about Wikipedia about Wikipedia and about Nintendo DS.

584
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,239
Rym: Instead of doing the show we wanted to do.

585
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,837
Rym: we just yelled and screamed at each other and I cut out a good 20 minutes Of arguing.

586
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,451
Scott: that wasn't even a good arguing I mean.

587
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:02,890
Scott: we said I think we ran through the whole argument in Wikipedia and then ran through the whole thing again from the beginning.

588
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,137
Rym: Yep, but then we ran through it yelling at evidence.

589
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:05,859
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,688
Emily: Yeah when these when it comes to argument these two are pros.

591
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:10,900
Rym: Why do you people want to listen to us?

592
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:11,765
Rym: Are you that's?

593
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:12,550
Scott: I don't know.

594
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,350
Rym: They're just nobody nobody cared about when we did a nice series on how to build a computer.

595
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:17,493
Rym: Everyone cares about.

596
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:18,275
Rym: Scott.

597
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:19,118
Rym: remember yelling at each other.

598
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,983
Emily: It's the conflict, you know every.

599
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:26,236
Emily: they always tell us this and you know screenwriting class But I don't conflict.

600
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,179
Emily: the drama.

601
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,982
Scott: no, I don't know.

602
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:31,266
Scott: strangers want to hear that though, that's the thing entertaining.

603
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,338
Scott: See any feedback from strangers on that episode.

604
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,270
Scott: No, I only saw feedback from people we know all I gotta say about Wikipedia.

605
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,890
Emily: I'm writing that article about Flemish giant rabbits.

606
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:50,750
Rym: Yeah Cuz I gotta say I learned one weird thing about rabbits on Wikipedia and it's that rabbits are instrumental to the lemon farming industry.

607
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,548
Emily: I'm gonna go farm me some lemon.

608
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,543
Scott: They protect the lemons from parasites or something.

609
00:41:55,583 --> 00:42:01,570
Rym: No, no, no, it's actually Yeah, it's their their urine and they're dropping and poop all over the lemon fields.

610
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,914
Rym: Yes, and for what?

611
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:03,195
Rym: the?

612
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:11,119
Rym: the chemical makeup of those components is a very conducive to citrus Bright because the rabbits are eating citruses.

613
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:11,701
Rym: No.

614
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,210
Rym: No, I don't think rabbits particularly like a lemon.

615
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:20,470
Scott: Yeah, well, no, but that's the thing is they don't eat the lemons, but they eat other things that are vegetable fruit type matter.

616
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:26,850
Emily: I always thought rabbit urine was very acidic in general, but Rym said it's because it has a lot of nitrates in it.

617
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:27,775
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

618
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:32,417
Rym: I mean, I'm obviously going on what I remember from a Read a few days ago.

619
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:33,743
Scott: You should ask a rabbit ologist.

620
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,342
Emily: Oh I'm a rabbit ologist for real.

621
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:38,810
Emily: No, I just read a lot of.

622
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,879
Emily: I'm probably of anybody in this room.

623
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:43,922
Emily: I'm probably the best first.

624
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:45,890
Rym: I would say the the breeding habits.

625
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:48,439
Scott: I don't know if you're a real rabbit ologist.

626
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,529
Emily: I don't have a degree in rabbits.

627
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:58,430
Rym: I would say that she knows more about rabbits that I know about dogs and I freaking love dogs.

628
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:02,082
Emily: I'm obsessive to the point of being kind of scary about it.

629
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:02,965
Scott: But yes for sure.

630
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:03,527
Emily: Yep.

631
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:03,928
Emily: Yeah.

632
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:06,457
Scott: So anyway, what's the episode today?

633
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:09,327
Rym: Yeah was going to be about since it's gaming day.

634
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,109
Scott: It's still about.

635
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,349
Emily: we bought the chair fund.

636
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:14,003
Scott: okay, we're gonna get there.

637
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:17,800
Rym: so I Want to talk about totally forgotten about that.

638
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,868
Scott: Okay, let's talk about this gaming group.

639
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:20,430
Scott: That's near here.

640
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,728
Scott: We like board games and in college you had people to play board games with.

641
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,710
Rym: yeah Like we had a whole club of hundreds of people just playing board games.

642
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:28,237
Scott: It wasn't hundreds, but it was big enough.

643
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,583
Rym: It had hundreds of members.

644
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,728
Rym: They didn't all show up.

645
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:35,290
Scott: Yes So we had places to play board games.

646
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:45,702
Scott: We would love to play board games with and board games require usually three and sometimes up to seven people, you know It's hard to make a two-player board game for lots of mathematical.

647
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:48,010
Scott: there are a few two-player games that I'm gonna try out.

648
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,776
Scott: I think they might be good but I don't know how long that lasts us.

649
00:43:50,837 --> 00:44:00,029
Scott: but the the for the four-player game seems to be like the best games because it's You know, there's no none of that two people ganging up on the third player business and it's just generally good all around.

650
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:05,247
Scott: so We didn't have anyone to play games with when we were here because only two of us and we were desperate.

651
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:10,670
Rym: like I moved here Too over two years before he did and I was searching I couldn't find gamers anywhere.

652
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,290
Scott: So finally I found this group of gamers.

653
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:26,610
Scott: I found out that they existed or had once existed and they were called maws the mid-hud scenario wargame society and It took me like months and months and months to actually contact them because they were so out of touch with reality.

654
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,900
Rym: I guess their website was a tripod site.

655
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,370
Scott: Well, their website tripod site didn't exist.

656
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,438
Scott: They had a website before that was destroyed.

657
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:38,180
Scott: the tripod site is destroyed like what in a fire I don't know but it no longer existed.

658
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:39,810
Scott: there were links to it that were all dead.

659
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,597
Rym: How does a website get destroyed?

660
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:43,423
Scott: they put it on some hosting and they cancel it?

661
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:44,005
Emily: Yeah.

662
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:44,768
Rym: Yeah.

663
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:47,980
Scott: Wow So then they got the tripod site very recently.

664
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,830
Scott: then it was terrible and then now he got them a real site.

665
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:56,600
Scott: but the point is is I went there and You know, they're old crusty wargamers, but they're not you know.

666
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:04,350
Scott: personality wise they're pretty good compared to some other old scary guys I've you know seen and played games with uh, yeah the people at our way we used to know.

667
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:07,883
Scott: Yeah, like these guys have okay personalities and they're fun to play games with.

668
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:15,987
Scott: but even though they look kind of scary And old which they are kind of scary and old and they you know, they play sometimes scary war games Which I don't like so much.

669
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:31,741
Scott: So I've been there twice so far playing at the local game store and you know these guys are sort of complaining that they can't get more members and After observing two of their meetings it's plain to see why They don't talk to anybody.

670
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,492
Scott: I Was sitting there.

671
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:43,970
Scott: we were playing this giant train game and there must have been over the course of the day Like over ten people coming over and looking at the train game and going ooh, and they were obviously very interested.

672
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:46,362
Scott: Did anyone have a conversation with them?

673
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:51,189
Scott: No Did anyone even so much as say hi only I did.

674
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:59,810
Scott: You know, I tried to have a conversation with this one cool old guy who came around but you know Then he got up and left because no everyone else is paying so much attention to this game.

675
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:03,049
Scott: And I was like, hey you guys here to recruit or you're here to play games.

676
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,975
Scott: so Yeah, now they're.

677
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,987
Scott: they have more scary things about them like the chair thing the chair thing that she.

678
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,995
Rym: basically They collect dues.

679
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:20,084
Scott: They used to collect dues and when I when someone says they collect dues for a club I think oh they're gonna buy advertising they're gonna buy games.

680
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,495
Scott: They're gonna buy a banner They're gonna do something.

681
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,663
Rym: So we asked them what their dues are for.

682
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:24,965
Rym: they said.

683
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,150
Scott: Oh, that's the broken chair fund And i'm like broken chair fund.

684
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:36,892
Scott: Oh, I thought it might have been like some sort of tradition like they have a broken chair They pass around or something silly or it might have been, you know, one of those terms that It's.

685
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,777
Emily: it's words, but it means something else.

686
00:46:38,877 --> 00:46:45,439
Rym: Yeah, but no it's quite literally because many of them are rather uh rotund very uh majestic.

687
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,020
Rym: it was literally and They would often break chairs.

688
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,810
Scott: Um, the other thing is I realized these people don't have a lot of money.

689
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:58,670
Scott: I know it's because they buy too many games or what but um, they didn't seem extremely wealthy.

690
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:06,721
Rym: That seems to be a trend among uh, not so much video gamers but German board gamers who aren't role-playing gamers and larpers.

691
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:13,830
Rym: and it's like once you leave college and you're a board gamer It's hard to still make money, which I don't see but apparently that seems to be the case.

692
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,654
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

693
00:47:15,714 --> 00:47:20,070
Scott: I was the only one there like I was the only one there who didn't mind just going eat out anywhere.

694
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:21,303
Scott: I was like, yeah, let's go to the neko.

695
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,905
Scott: and they were like, whoa So, you know too too high class, yeah, I guess they couldn't.

696
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:26,730
Scott: they didn't want to do that.

697
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,415
Scott: I don't know.

698
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:29,190
Scott: one guy was unemployed though, so I can understand him.

699
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:37,070
Emily: I wouldn't think it's like the most expensive hobby under the sun though You know that you got some people going yachting and of course, maybe it's a different demographic.

700
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:46,861
Rym: Well, what i'm starting to think is that it seems that most people who like board games The ones who are like they like board games But they also have those other factors of being successful in life.

701
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:56,009
Rym: Like they're just good at something or whatever Tend to go when they leave college and give up all their fun hobbies and have a normal boring job and work hard at it.

702
00:47:57,152 --> 00:48:00,730
Rym: And because I know a lot of people at ibm who seem like when they were young they were really cool.

703
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:11,270
Rym: They were into these german board games back 20 30 years ago And now they're married to people who hate board games and they never play them anymore And all they do is work go home talk to their family watch tv go to sleep.

704
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:14,919
Emily: This sounds like you're being jaded from your experience at ibm.

705
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,001
Rym: Yes god.

706
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:16,402
Rym: Yes.

707
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:23,643
Scott: It's like they all fight with their wives and No, but I even see it like uh miserable and sad.

708
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:30,350
Scott: sometimes when you listen to podcasts or read blogs You see people who are interested in geeky things and like their wives or girlfriend.

709
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,890
Scott: It's always like how do I get my girlfriend to do this with me?

710
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,055
Scott: How do I get my wife to do this?

711
00:48:34,156 --> 00:48:34,900
Scott: or boyfriend?

712
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,649
Rym: i've seen a lot of the other way around too.

713
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:42,910
Rym: Yeah, there's a cool geeky girl and she she marries or goes with some like dumb old jockey schlub guy who doesn't care.

714
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:44,175
Emily: Yeah, I don't know.

715
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:47,487
Emily: I see more more the other way around like I see a lot of geeks.

716
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:48,170
Rym: There's a skew.

717
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,590
Emily: Yeah, I see a lot of geeks with non-geek girls and you know, I I'm open to trying new things.

718
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:55,722
Emily: You know, sometimes you guys yell at me.

719
00:48:55,762 --> 00:48:57,010
Emily: you're like, how could you not know this?

720
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,457
Emily: But you know scott yells at Rym.

721
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:04,599
Scott: So then I don't feel so bad, you know Anyone who doesn't know something they should know?

722
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:04,679
Rym: no.

723
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:06,025
Rym: No, I think I should just edit that statement.

724
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:07,130
Rym: scott you yell at anyone.

725
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:11,162
Scott: I yell at anyone who knows who doesn't uh know something they should know.

726
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:13,270
Rym: All right listeners, you know our things today, right?

727
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,722
Rym: well, uh Oftentimes i'll see a thing of the day like like.

728
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:19,410
Rym: I see a thing like oh that's gonna be awesome.

729
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:26,030
Rym: And I send it to scott to see what he thinks and he responds that's old archaic archaeological news.

730
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:29,927
Scott: And I think oh, hey Rym, uh, and then he says with that news.

731
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:30,570
Scott: It's an antique.

732
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:34,189
Rym: And then he says something like I saw that an hour ago.

733
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,530
Emily: Yeah You're gonna turn into a gargoyle.

734
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:39,053
Scott: No, I don't think so.

735
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,179
Rym: I see no crash gargoyle.

736
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:44,630
Scott: Oh the light on the the eye book is like going bright dim.

737
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:45,688
Rym: It's breathing.

738
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:47,774
Scott: It's breathing.

739
00:49:47,974 --> 00:49:48,597
Emily: I love that.

740
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:49,359
Emily: I I don't know.

741
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,323
Emily: It's such a little.

742
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:52,390
Emily: it's it's purely cosmetic.

743
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:55,861
Emily: But when I first got my iMac and I saw that it was

744
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:58,549
Scott: just like rotate your chair so it doesn't like shine in my eye

745
00:49:59,215 --> 00:49:59,478
Emily: Shine

746
00:49:59,499 --> 00:49:59,903
Rym: in your eye.

747
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:03,073
Rym: It's getting right It's not it's.

748
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:07,690
Rym: not only is it the weakest like white led it's behind plastic.

749
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:10,039
Scott: It gets pretty bright when it's at its maximum, right?

750
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:10,521
Rym: No, it doesn't.

751
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,263
Emily: No, it doesn't.

752
00:50:11,283 --> 00:50:12,869
Emily: you're all the way across the room.

753
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,958
Emily: Yeah No, no He's got his eye up to it.

754
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:19,270
Rym: He's like it doesn't hurt my eye.

755
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:20,636
Rym: Anyway meter from it.

756
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:22,967
Scott: So so we got off topic at the gamer guys.

757
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:27,329
Emily: Yes So I I'm geek enough I can run with the rest of them.

758
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,269
Emily: I I make the grade.

759
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:31,237
Emily: Okay, so moz.

760
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:34,590
Scott: so these is these scary gamer guys and i'm trying to straighten them out.

761
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,776
Rym: We basically kind of took them over as in.

762
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:40,989
Rym: we built him a website and a forums and we run their mailing list.

763
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:41,310
Rym: now.

764
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:44,570
Rym: And I I see I foresee a transfer of power.

765
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,084
Scott: Yeah, the transfer of power though their election next is in october 2007 election.

766
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:50,890
Rym: They have like five members.

767
00:50:51,291 --> 00:51:03,210
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't matter because as soon as see as long as I am the guy who actually talks to people Then eventually i'll be the public face that actually says something that people know and i'll be friends with all the new people.

768
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:06,744
Scott: And as soon as I recruit more new people than there are existing people.

769
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:07,948
Scott: That's that's the end.

770
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:10,823
Rym: Yeah I mean i'd like to say i'll do that too and I will.

771
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:16,298
Rym: but you see the funny thing is Despite all the work we've done for this group I've never met a single one of them because

772
00:51:16,379 --> 00:51:17,683
Scott: every two of their meetings ever

773
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:19,710
Rym: every time they've met i've gone out of town

774
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:22,463
Scott: You know, and i'm probably going to be out of town the next time they meet too.

775
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,535
Scott: So it's kind of like Conventions.

776
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:26,849
Rym: we have social lives.

777
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:32,310
Scott: Yeah, it seems like a lot of the people though in the group have families and things and don't show up, too.

778
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:33,916
Emily: But you guys what?

779
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:35,764

784
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:52,359
Scott: If you don't know if you have a hotel room i'm not going.

00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:57,679
Scott: I'll stay home and get something done.

787
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:00,087

809
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:57,048
Scott: She's totally going all around the country because adv is redubbing macross and they got her to do the english dub.

Scott: I'm gonna finally see him.

819
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:20,203
Rym: actually Yeah, you should try to strike up a conversation with him.

820
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:22,638
Rym: since you won his contest You'll have a way to get his notice.

Rym: See if we can get an interview with him or something.

824
00:53:27,326 --> 00:53:28,130
Scott: That could be cool.

825
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,590
Scott: He's the problem with interviewing him is he's 10 000 times smarter than any of us.

826
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,072
Rym: You know what?

827
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:33,554
Rym: That's good.

828
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:36,729
Rym: Then we'll we'll set him going on something and then we'll get a nice recording of it.

829
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,059
Emily: Yeah, and just kind of you should emily.

830
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:40,264

832
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:41,550

00:53:46,404 --> 00:53:49,493
Emily: Well, that might be cas but uh, It's it.

836
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:51,743
Scott: his classes are probably the hardest classes to get into.

837
00:53:51,763 --> 00:53:57,325
Scott: they're like giant lectures at night You know with like lots of people and it probably doesn't count towards your major at all.

838
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,296
Emily: Yeah media studies Well, it could be a gen ed though.

839
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:06,401
Emily: All right, you know because I do have a certain amount of humanity He always I have to he always announces when he has a new.

840
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,650
Scott: when he he only teaches like one class per semester.

841
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:17,605
Scott: So the next time I see one of his he always announces on his website because you can get all his course Materials on his website so you can take the class along at home if you want to.

00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:18,950
Scott: you know instead if you can't go.

843
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:22,482

846
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:33,319
Rym: and actually if we get uh, Any sort of portable recording stuff for GeekNights before that weekend, perhaps we'll do some impromptu interviews at it.

847
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:34,184
Scott: Yeah, that'd be cool.

848
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:39,499
Rym: or at all the other little because we're not doing appearances in any of these cons coming up We're just kind of going to them as as normal guys.

849
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,304
Scott: Yeah, too bad.

850
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:45,468
Scott: the comic geek speak guys are the official podcast the new york comic con So they'll be probably interviewing all over the place.

851
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:46,150
Scott: That's fine.

852
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:46,993
Rym: That's fine.

853
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:47,957
Rym: We got otakon.

854
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:48,780
Scott: Yeah, we do.

855
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,478
Scott: So these gaming guys.

856
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:57,200
Scott: Let me let me talk about one of the games I played with these guys we played.

857
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:02,550
Scott: We'll talk about the train game because that was the biggest Train game was railroad tycoon.

858
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:04,860
Scott: This thing is three boards.

859
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:08,173
Scott: It was so big it had three boards.

860
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:09,460
Scott: You ever seen a game with three boards?

861
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,539
Rym: No, uh battle tech.

862
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:13,645
Scott: You know what.

863
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,458
Scott: it was bigger than three battle tech boards.

864
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:16,786
Scott: It's pretty big.

865
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:17,671
Scott: It was so huge.

866
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:23,245
Scott: So it's basically giant hex map with cities and You would have money.

867
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:32,060
Scott: and if you didn't have enough money to do what you wanted you to take shares from the bank And then you had to pay like a thousand dollars of your money per share per turn.

868
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:38,280
Scott: So taking too many shares would cut into your profits And your victory points would be your like income.

869
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:44,194
Scott: So if you didn't have enough victory points, you had too many shares You would lose money every turn and had to take out more shares.

870
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:44,998
Scott: and that's what happened to me.

871
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:51,952
Scott: I lost But you just spent money to build track And then you would ship cubes along the track to get more points.

872
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:54,420
Rym: do the cubes actually fit in the little trains?

873
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:56,707
Scott: No, it's not like that.

874
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:59,019
Rym: Ah, it's just cubes and what good is it?

875
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:01,195
Scott: It was all right.

876
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:06,040
Scott: I don't think it was like my favorite game ever, but it was pretty good.

877
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:13,730
Rym: Well, I think part of our problem is that between puerto rico and tigris and euphrates We've pretty much come upon the current perfection of gaming.

878
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:18,947
Rym: Yeah, at least that type of gaming this game apex This yes, this game.

879
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,111
Scott: I think would be really fun.

880
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:29,240
Scott: if you have a lot of people like five or six people And you all want to get around a big table and like, you know, yell about cubes and stuff for like a while

881
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:34,555
Rym: Why don't we just get a bunch of wooden cubes and take a chessboard and move them around and yell

882
00:56:34,676 --> 00:56:35,800
Scott: because you wouldn't have any trains?

883
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:37,729
Emily: Anybody out there?

884
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:38,718
Emily: No bug room.

885
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:45,299
Emily: Oh, yeah, you're trying to figure out what bug room is because my sister my sister was doing this.

886
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:55,910
Emily: She's pre-med and biology so she was going on a job shadow thing in an emergency room With one of our doctor friends in wisconsin and scary.

887
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:56,532
Emily: What?

888
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:56,913
Emily: why?

889
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,718
Scott: emergency room guts and things?

890
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:03,425
Emily: Oh, yeah Well, some of the things were pretty intense But anyway, she had some stories.

891
00:57:03,726 --> 00:57:13,800
Emily: but my cousin, you know since she was staying with my aunt my cousin is really A whole bunch of geeky friends really into dnd and a lot of german board games.

892
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,160
Emily: But they were playing this chess thing.

893
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,895
Emily: It's like with two chess boards and you could switch pieces in and out.

894
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:25,977
Emily: and it was called bug room I think and I had never heard of it and I can't really find any information on it.

895
00:57:26,058 --> 00:57:29,087
Rym: So Hmm, I mean one thing I got to say from what?

896
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:35,628
Rym: from the vague description we got it seems to sound a lot like It's not chess, but it's it's.

897
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:38,919
Rym: it is to chess as the Carcassonne expansions are to Carcassonne.

898
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:44,295
Rym: As in you use chess pieces and chess boards and some chess rules But it doesn't play like chess because it's crazy.

899
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:45,742
Scott: How do you?
