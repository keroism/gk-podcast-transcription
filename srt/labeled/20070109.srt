00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,749
Rym: It's Tuesday January 9th.

2
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,580
Scott: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:20,700
Rym: Tonight we preview Castlevania portrait of ruin for the DS and excite truck for the Nintendo Wii.

4
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:23,697
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:31,570
Scott: And yet again our semi-annual holiday Steve jobs of us is behind us.

6
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:33,680
Rym: I don't know what it is with these Mac people.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:46,740
Rym: I mean, I understand that Apple makes cool things and I understand I mean we camped out for like four hours for a chance of touching Miyamoto once But we didn't camp out overnight and at least we were gonna get something.

8
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:50,380
Rym: The people camping out overnight to see Steve Jobs didn't get anything.

9
00:00:50,781 --> 00:01:01,059
Scott: They got the same thing you could get by going to a website for free and now there's so many websites Mirroring this thing that it is no like delay or lag or 404s or anything.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,347
Rym: God, not only were people aiming me all of the updates in real time But someone was posting him in our forums.

11
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:11,760
Rym: I was on a website and Scott and I were talking about this.

12
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,410
Scott: Yeah, I was like, dude, why are you posting this in the forums?

13
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,779
Scott: Everyone can read and gadget just like you can.

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,979
Scott: do We really need to mirror this thing anymore?

15
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,675
Rym: Yes, because obviously people Google for it.

16
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:22,218
Rym: They'll get us.

17
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:34,115
Scott: Hi guys But we'll talk more in detail about the iPhone and the ITV Next week after the dust has settled.

18
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:46,140
Scott: Yeah, you know on Monday Tech day, but just let it be known that we are not the biggest fans of these Incredibly hyped up events and keynotes and things see part of it.

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,969
Rym: I would blame on the fact that we're kind of up.

20
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:48,773
Rym: I don't know.

21
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,160
Rym: What's the word cynical?

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:58,767
Rym: Maybe a little bit world-weary a little bit pessimistic sometimes Accurately, so yeah something like that.

23
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:18,329
Rym: Yeah, I mean we had the chance and actually we failed We've talked about this before to get signed things from Miyamoto when he was at the Nintendo Store because we being rational logical adults concluded that Rather than camping out on the streets of New York City in Rockefeller Center all night No one would be that fanatical.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,994
Rym: and if we just took an early train into the city we could easily get one of the 200 spots.

25
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:30,932
Rym: and Well taking that early train proved that there are a lot of people far more dedicated to far more trivial things than us in the world.

26
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:33,229
Scott: Then people be crazy.

27
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:34,880
Rym: Yeah, I don't get it.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:55,217
Rym: I don't get it at all, but I remember even last year at IBM I was sitting there watching some IRC channel where the updates were coming through and simultaneously my cube mate cool Korean guy is Sitting there with his back to me and every time a chat came in on my thing He'd go like whoa whoa, and then I look and he's looking at the exact same IRC channel.

29
00:02:55,237 --> 00:03:01,257
Scott: Yeah Why are people just so excited if you CES is going on right now.

30
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:04,490
Scott: at CES There are more new and amazing products.

31
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,160
Scott: I mean did know did you hear about the Windows Home Server?

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,067
Rym: Actually, I did because I redid it's pretty cool.

33
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,856
Scott: I River came out with a whole bunch of stuff.

34
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:14,865
Scott: Samsung came out The whole bunch of stuff I heard.

35
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:17,200
Scott: there was a hundred and something inch LCD screen.

36
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,286
Scott: That's what I heard and there probably is.

37
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,756
Scott: it's only a prototype though, but why does you know that?

38
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,020
Scott: iPhone pretty cool?

39
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:34,676
Scott: ITV not as cool But people makes like a big deal out of two things as they make out of the entire rest of the consumer electronics industry.

40
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:38,875
Rym: well remember Normal people don't even know any of this happened.

41
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:45,563
Scott: Nope normal people They don't even realize that there are new electronics products being entered into the world as we speak I mean Walt.

42
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,779
Rym: while the the internet was going crazy most people were just going about their business.

43
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,026
Scott: All right, so it's game day.

44
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,872
Scott: forget is forget those technologies.

45
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:59,071
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk about them another day No a week from yesterday.

46
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:02,550
Scott: give or take Give or take a few hours.

47
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,240
Rym: Yeah, I definitely give or take a few hours.

48
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,331
Rym: We've been kind of erratic and putting up the show lately.

49
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,135
Scott: All right, so my news.

50
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,040
Scott: I'll do my news first.

51
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,884
Rym: I can do yours first.

52
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:09,245
Scott: Yep.

53
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:10,490
Scott: So second life.

54
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:12,017
Scott: We know I've never played it.

55
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:12,439
Scott: You played it.

56
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:15,254
Rym: You see I already have what's called a first life.

57
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:15,676
Scott: Yeah.

58
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,772
Scott: Yeah Well, I haven't played it and I didn't news on it before.

59
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,459
Scott: remember about the giant penis attack?

60
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,469
Scott: Yeah, that was quite.

61
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:29,200
Rym: I did that for humorous reasons But now there's an actual you kidding that was one of the greatest moments in the history of the Internet.

62
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:35,277
Scott: perhaps it could be in the top 50 but this news about second life is actually pretty serious and pretty awesome.

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,215
Scott: as You know second life is an MMO, but not really so much the RPG just the MMO part.

64
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:46,265
Scott: It's massive multiplayer online Walking around doing stuff.

65
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:50,176
Rym: It's more like a. I guess a moo is what I would call a second life.

66
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,971
Scott: who knows whatever Acronym you want to use to describe a second life.

67
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,080
Scott: I could care less, but they're all very specific.

68
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:02,472
Rym: I mean, you know mush muck mud moo All the other ones that don't actually mean anything and it's object oriented to a degree.

69
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,137
Rym: so I would call it a moo.

70
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:10,055
Scott: perhaps anyway Second life has decided to open source itself now.

71
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:14,411
Scott: at first that seems crazy Because well they make money with second life.

72
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:22,040
Scott: if people could just get the code to second life They can run their own servers run their own clients and never pay any money to Linden Labs.

73
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,267
Rym: Yep, they won't need to buy any Linden dollars.

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:35,840
Scott: I guess that's true that oh well Some people are gonna play second life on some other servers and not pay Linden Labs any money and I guess that's just fine.

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:43,411
Scott: However, I don't think that's going to hurt them in the long run because well How many people are you gonna get to play on your pirated?

76
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:50,060
Scott: Well, not pirated but completely legal Second life server probably not as many as on the second life server.

77
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:59,580
Scott: So people who want to play in an environment with other people They're probably gonna need to spend some money to get some Linden dollars to do stuff and I don't think their revenues will be affected.

78
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:07,520
Scott: In fact, I think their revenues are going to be affected positively Because of the second thing it says in this press release now.

79
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:12,134
Scott: Most games you play even online games like counter-strike.

80
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,600
Scott: They don't charge you a monthly fee.

81
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:19,828
Scott: You buy the game and you're done and they make their money from selling you the game MMOs like World of Warcraft.

82
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:22,360
Scott: they sell you the game and then they make you pay a monthly fee.

83
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,920
Scott: The reason they make you pay the monthly fee is because in order for this game to work They have to have a giant server farm somewhere and that giant server farm is expensive as all hell.

84
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:42,420
Rym: Well, also they make more money that way because their business model is not give you a great game that when you're done with you Quit but give you a game that will string you along enough to where you'll play for the rest of your life.

85
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:52,717
Scott: Yes, and of course, you know Even if they just charged like a hundred dollars for the game and then they stop charging you They would still fail to profit because the server farm cost so much.

86
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:53,400
Scott: now.

87
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:08,800
Scott: It has often been thought by many smart people including myself that hey if you could somehow have the MMO But not need to manage this giant server farm You could save a lot of money and actually becoming like ludicrously profitable.

88
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,638
Scott: That's like a jillion dollar idea if you can make it work.

89
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,330
Scott: Well, the idea itself is not a jillion dollars.

90
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,173
Scott: Anyone could come up with.

91
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,800
Scott: the idea is how do you make it work?

92
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,144
Scott: Is what's worth a jillion?

93
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,755
Rym: Yeah, and if you don't I mean the idea isn't just oh.

94
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:21,860
Rym: now the hostings for free.

95
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,684
Rym: We get more money.

96
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:30,040
Rym: consider that also say you still spent the same amount of money you were normally spending on your hosting and your bandwidth on content.

97
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:40,638
Rym: You'd have the baddest as MMO ever and I can guarantee both of us would play it and there wouldn't be any more GeekNights And you could also get more people to join because you had so much new content, etc, etc, etc.

98
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:51,638
Scott: so having an MMO without needing a server farm or needing less of a server farm is Insanely profitable if someone were capable of doing it.

99
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:57,140
Scott: Well open sourcing second life is a step on the road to achieving this goal.

100
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:02,800
Scott: Apparently they're developing something called the second life grid, which is a vision.

101
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,603
Scott: they have a vision.

102
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:16,440
Scott: their vision is that people because they have the code to second life will run their own servers and All these servers will somehow connect to form the bigger world that is second life, you know.

103
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,541
Scott: So I might run my little area and even if my server is a little different than someone else's server You know.

104
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,812
Scott: if it works with the second life client people can get to it.

105
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,080
Scott: and you know, the rules might be different.

106
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:32,477
Scott: There might be flying people or something, you know, cuz I changed the code but still works.

107
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:33,500
Scott: It's still second life.

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Scott: I mean, what's the worst someone could do with the second life code?

109
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,779
Scott: I guess if they really want to do they could go and make a different MMO and charge people to play it.

110
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:50,055
Scott: But you can't really do anything to hurt Linden Labs the makers of second life with the second life source code unless you find some security holes and

111
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:56,640
Rym: yeah some sort of way to I don't know launder Linden dollars or make things for free and then sell them to people.

112
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:06,300
Scott: Because of the GPL 2.0 If you found such things you would be legally obligated to release your source code and how you did it so they could fix it.

113
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:12,980
Rym: Well, no If you didn't if you chose not to distribute or allow access to your server to other people you wouldn't be obligated to share.

114
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,800
Scott: But let's say you modified your client to get free Linden dollars on the official servers.

115
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:32,400
Scott: You know you you just you modified the code of your client And if they caught you doing that not only could they get you for cheating you get rid of your account and such and such But if they really wanted to they could take you to court for breaking the GPL which doesn't happen too often.

116
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,949
Rym: But there might be ways around that there might be.

117
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:39,612
Rym: but I'm just especially since you're not just if you don't try to distribute it Or so yes, I'm just saying on paper.

118
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:40,217
Scott: They could.

119
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:47,260
Scott: Anyway, this is way cool because it's totally messes with your mind that hey someone's got a product.

120
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:49,186
Scott: They release the product.

121
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:49,988
Scott: you know it's.

122
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,737
Scott: it's free to play second life unless you want to do something.

123
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:53,840
Scott: that requires Linden dollars.

124
00:09:53,961 --> 00:10:05,649
Scott: But they made it even more free and as a result They're gonna make more money because now they have all these people helping them to build this second life grid and also fix security Holes and second line it.

125
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,059
Rym: We'll see what actually happens.

126
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,579
Scott: We will see what actually happens.

127
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:18,446
Scott: But I imagine that second life will become more awesome because there has been some criticism of second life recently in their Reporting of the number of citizens.

128
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,030
Scott: You know it's like they're like.

129
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,340
Rym: oh because no other MMO totally blatantly lies about How many people are in their game?

130
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,300
Scott: I know, but people are ragging on second life about it recently and not ragging other MMOs about it.

131
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:52,511
Rym: Well the thing is it's funny how the way MMOs go since I'd say maybe not the majority But a very substantial number of people who play MMOs are not otherwise gamers or at least they don't play a lot of other games And they tend to look at things like how popular their MMO is and if the MMO isn't so popular They might not want to play it anymore.

132
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,140
Rym: They want to be on whatever's hot right now.

133
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:56,344
Scott: I don't know about that.

134
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,127
Scott: I think it's just.

135
00:10:57,388 --> 00:11:00,520
Scott: I think what it's more like is people are already playing MMOs.

136
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,953
Scott: They like the MMO that they're playing that they're used to.

137
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:09,840
Scott: you know when whenever people change MMOs they tend to not like it and they tend to want that new MMO to change to be what their old MMO.

138
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,447
Rym: Well I remember in the early days you know back when there was a bunch of competing MMOs that were all doing kinda Well relative to each other.

139
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,945
Rym: it wasn't like today where there's the powerhouse world of warcraft And then effectively nothing else.

140
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:32,600
Rym: they would either guard their numbers to the bitter end kind of like the anime industry Or they release the numbers only when they were good or the numbers would suddenly start disappearing if they started falling.

141
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:37,985
Scott: I think the way where the numbers matter is not to existing MMO players But to new MMO players.

142
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:41,156
Scott: because you're coming into MMOs you're right like huh, which MMO should I play?

143
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:44,507
Scott: the one that has a Thousand people you know do I want to go?

144
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:50,180
Scott: and you know play in a world with a thousand other people or play in a World with a million other people?

145
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,579
Scott: You know and the million other people tends to get the win.

146
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:55,082
Scott: Does that?

147
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,487
Scott: because that's what MMOs are about.

148
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,715
Scott: is people wanting to go and hang out with lots of other people?

149
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:06,240
Scott: and I think also You know open sourcing Second Life will just bring a lot of people who want to play with the code.

150
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,575
Scott: I mean a lot of people probably had no interest in Second Life.

151
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,566
Scott: now that it's open source They'll probably go ooh.

152
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,560
Scott: Let me look at that source and see what's going on in there.

153
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,528
Rym: I mean I'll even admit Second Life is probably the closest thing to the world in Snow Crash that we've yet seen perhaps and That's really cool to me.

154
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,759
Rym: What wasn't cool to me was paying money for it.

155
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:29,680
Scott: Yeah, you don't have to pay money for it unless you want to buy anything that requires Linden dollars.

156
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:35,120
Rym: Yeah, you could just walk around without paying money, which wasn't exactly what I was interested in.

157
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,850
Scott: No, if you don't pay money, it's just a big chat room.

158
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,219
Scott: you walk around and talk to people kind of like most MMOs.

159
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,490
Scott: exactly IRC is free people.

160
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,140
Scott: No need to use Second Life.

161
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,794
Rym: Well, no no no you got to perfectly emulate the MMO experience.

162
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:55,840
Rym: you have IRC open But you also have to have a bot that's constantly making up names and asking for Gil and shit.

163
00:12:56,663 --> 00:13:08,195
Rym: Ah, and then on top of that you need spam sex whisper bots constantly harassing you And of course last and certainly not least you got to get a copy of progress Progress Quest and keep it open in the background at all times.

164
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,040
Scott: I already do that.

165
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,631
Scott: Let's see what level I am in progress.

166
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:11,780
Rym: Are you really still running that?

167
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,392
Scott: I'm really still running progress crest.

168
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,923
Scott: I am currently level 76.

169
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,334
Scott: I am a level 76 enchanted motorcycle or paladin.

170
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,220
Scott: Can you guess what my highest stat is?

171
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,270
Rym: I don't know charisma or strength.

172
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,744
Scott: No, my con is 16,457. not bad not bad at all.

173
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,246
Scott: I am an act XL VI.

174
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:35,212
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm not gonna read off any more of this because it's just stupid.

175
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,180
Rym: No, there's an awesome raid coming up.

176
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,991
Scott: Yeah, well don't make me cast level LV curse family on you.

177
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,059
Rym: what number do you think LV is Scott?

178
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,603
Scott: Oh Let's see.

179
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,510
Rym: You don't know do you X?

180
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:50,096
Scott: I think L's.

181
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,160
Scott: L's a thousand, right?

182
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,043
Rym: What's M then?

183
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:55,829
Scott: all right M's a thousand.

184
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,503
Scott: so L 500. no no 100.

185
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,706
Scott: I thought C was a hundred.

186
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,412
Rym: Uh, yeah C is a hundred.

187
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:04,174
Scott: What could L be 50?

188
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:08,860
Scott: Yeah, L is 50 All right, so I got a little 55 curse family.

189
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:10,442
Scott: Why is it?

190
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:13,290
Scott: I hate freaking roman numerals when they go on the 50s.

191
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,594
Scott: That's always annoying.

192
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,559
Rym: Anyway, well, they go on the fives, too.

193
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,061
Scott: Yeah Right.

194
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:25,900
Rym: So my news is kind of a. it seems like on a semi-regular basis websites for various reasons.

195
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,670
Rym: We'll decide that they need some publicity.

196
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,560
Rym: in order to get some publicity They'll do some sort of top 10 list.

197
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:32,504
Scott: Here's

198
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,812
Rym: our list of the top 10 games ever

199
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:35,555
Scott: and

200
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:43,433
Rym: they almost always will have a generic list that tends to list very popular current things or things that are in the consciousness of the Internet

201
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,160
Scott: and

202
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:58,940
Rym: Almost always the number one or the number two thing will be something controversial even outright wrong Because even though the list may be crap It talks about things that people are interested in so people all link to it and dig it up and have a grand old time.

203
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,731
Scott: It's funny cuz on dig I see like three different kinds of stories.

204
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:07,367
Scott: like about about 15% of the stories I see on dig fall into three categories.

205
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:19,159
Scott: There's here's my lit top 10 list of something how to something right or something tutorial and How to make a how-to list or tutorial that will get on dig.

206
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:31,306
Rym: Well, a lot of people seem to be following that advice Because right here is a fairly piss-poor list from computer and video games com About the worst game endings ever.

207
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:38,369
Rym: now when I heard this the first games I thought of were I don't know Simon's Quest pretty bad one.

208
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:51,015
Scott: every Atari game ever Mmm-hmm half of the Nintendo games ever karate kid pretty much any game where the ending was either Nothing, just you know, I mean freaking Dig Dug is the worst ending game over.

209
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,345
Scott: Well, that's not the end That's the end.

210
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,800
Rym: No, that's just when you lose if you beat the game.

211
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,577
Rym: Well, I guess you can't beat the game because an infinite number infinite replay.

212
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,425
Scott: Yeah I mean, what's the ending of pac-man?

213
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:02,328
Scott: the game crashes.

214
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:02,769
Scott: the end?

215
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,556
Scott: Yeah, it's like that's the worst.

216
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:05,760
Scott: every the game just crashes.

217
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,269
Rym: I know kaboom at a pretty good end.

218
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:12,252
Rym: if you get to a high enough score The bomber makes a face at you and the game continues.

219
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,199
Scott: that is better the ending than pac-man.

220
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,469
Scott: That's because the bomber makes a visit.

221
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,920
Rym: So this follows pretty much these straight-up formula.

222
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:26,188
Rym: I'm not gonna read the whole this but like number 10 fable, which I never even played A perfect dark perfect dark.

223
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:31,465
Scott: the ending wasn't good, but the game had an ending which is more than pac-man Which it just crashes.

224
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,513
Rym: Yeah, I mean they're talking about the worst endings ever.

225
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,240
Rym: All right Metal Gear Solid 2.

226
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,318
Scott: I'll give them that Metal Gear Solid 2 was fucked up and bad But you know what?

227
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:43,760
Scott: It's still not as bad as all those Atari games that had no ending at all.

228
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,807
Rym: Also Metal Gear Solid 2 is ending.

229
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:49,840
Rym: while it might have been bad from a semi-objective, you know observer standpoint.

230
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,920
Rym: Yeah, the plot just crazy screwed in terms of watching it or the internet humor about it.

231
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,730
Rym: It's a great ending any ending.

232
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,134
Scott: No game has the worst ending.

233
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,720
Scott: what World of Warcraft?

234
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,288
Rym: What is the ending of World of Warcraft?

235
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,824
Rym: because I thought of like four jokes and I couldn't think of a good way to make All of them.

236
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:10,630
Scott: I don't know.

237
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:11,638
Scott: I'll just leave it at that.

238
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,529
Scott: No, you know what other game is a really bad ending daikumud.

239
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:17,156
Scott: Daikumud is a really bad ending ever.

240
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:18,602
Scott: quest also It's got.

241
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:22,537
Rym: the bad ending of daikumud is a divorce and a bitter lonely life.

242
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,192
Scott: Oh You know a game also second life as the worst ending ever.

243
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,539
Scott: also now because you can make money off a second I would say that the ending to pac-man is a lot worse than the ending to World of Warcraft.

244
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,698
Scott: I mean being better because at least in pac-man it's like aha.

245
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:37,180
Scott: Look at that.

246
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,144
Scott: I crashed the machine.

247
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,790
Scott: only three other people have done that ever.

248
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,400
Rym: but World of Warcraft has crashed on people before.

249
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:47,149
Scott: Yeah, but not because you were awesome Or maybe you were so awesome.

250
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:50,914
Scott: pac-man only crashes when you're awesome and you roll the score over All right.

251
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,680
Rym: So the end of World of Warcraft I imagine looks exactly like the end of the South Park episode about World of Warcraft.

252
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:02,484
Scott: It is a bad ending All right, but yeah, I mean those.

253
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,607
Rym: these endings aren't bad bad.

254
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:05,088
Rym: They're just.

255
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:06,269
Rym: they're funny bad.

256
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,191
Rym: or they're Controversy bad or they're bad.

257
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:10,540
Rym: to make this article popular.

258
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:19,319
Rym: But the issue I take is that the number one game the game that they say has the worst ending of any game ever is Super Mario Brothers.

259
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,214
Rym: They you know, thank you Mario.

260
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:23,239
Rym: Your quest is over.

261
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,740
Rym: We present you a new quest push button B to select a world.

262
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:36,779
Scott: That is not bad because number one you get to see the princess who you haven't seen yet ever ever - you feel really good.

263
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,607
Rym: Yeah, I mean back then it's I mean today.

264
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:50,100
Rym: people complain about the end of a game if it isn't basically a four-hour perfect movie File that comes right after an insanely difficult but not impossible awesome square boss fight.

265
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:53,592
Rym: Yeah back then beating a game was enough.

266
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,298
Rym: if you beat a game it was.

267
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:55,860
Rym: I mean now It's.

268
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,246
Rym: there's not the foregone conclusion.

269
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,530
Rym: If if I buy a game, I'm gonna beat it.

270
00:18:58,631 --> 00:18:59,956
Rym: It was I beat it.

271
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:02,385
Rym: Holy shit No one I knew beat it.

272
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:03,388
Rym: I'm the only one.

273
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,452
Rym: Oh my god.

274
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,720
Scott: Yeah, think about this Zelda one right ending.

275
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:11,380
Scott: You walk into a room and then you stab some fire, right?

276
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:19,408
Scott: so wait first see the whole thing about beating a game in those days was that it was so hard to do and So crazy and so rarely done.

277
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:22,800
Scott: at least, you know in the minds of the kids playing who were the only people playing?

278
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:31,976
Scott: Well, not the only but most of the people playing were kids that you saw at the end of a game There would be like two rooms with stuff that wasn't seen anywhere else.

279
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:32,980
Scott: It was completely new.

280
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,564
Scott: So it was like holy shit.

281
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,069
Scott: Look at that Ganon dude.

282
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,117
Scott: It's frickin green pig and he disappeared.

283
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,904
Rym: Holy shit What do I do?

284
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:41,526
Scott: What do I do?

285
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,020
Scott: and then you kill him and you're like what the fuck is that red triangle?

286
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,044
Scott: Oh my god.

287
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:46,828
Scott: Oh my god.

288
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:47,895
Scott: There's a red triangle.

289
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:53,696
Scott: It's the Triforce And then you a door would open and you'd go in and you would see Zelda.

290
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,583
Scott: you had never seen Never.

291
00:19:55,864 --> 00:20:05,915
Scott: you didn't know what she looked like and there she was and there was fire there in a room You had never seen before and you could stab the fire and it would go away.

292
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,500
Scott: Oh my god.

293
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:12,293
Rym: Also, Zelda was wearing a dress the same color as whatever you were wearing.

294
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:17,970
Scott: if you had the green suit her dress is green But if you had the blue ring her dress is white.

295
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,896
Scott: if you're the red ring cuz you're awesome.

296
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:21,100
Scott: her dress is red.

297
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:32,928
Rym: Well, no have beating the game with a red wing red ring Makes you the opposite of awesome because you weren't manly enough to just skip all that and beat the game taking four damage from basic monsters.

298
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:39,680
Scott: no because Because I was a little kid and I said I have to get every goddamn item in this game.

299
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:43,419
Scott: I am NOT leaving until I get that red ring that I know is in this dungeon somewhere.

300
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:54,049
Scott: Anyway, and then you stand next to Zelda and you both hold up Triforces and then text goes by that says stuff that you never read before Final

301
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:01,459
Rym: Fantasy one I remember when I finally beat that game and that was after years and fucking years and starting over and getting lost.

302
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,907
Rym: and oh my God, all the ending is.

303
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:09,867
Rym: is you know, there's blue text boxes that pop up whenever you talk to people Like four of those full of text.

304
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:10,328
Scott: Yep.

305
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:10,890
Rym: That's it.

306
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:11,873
Rym: That's the game.

307
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,280
Rym: That's the end and I was amazed by that.

308
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,076
Scott: Yeah Beating games was all.

309
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,560
Scott: it was like Unlocking the final chapter of a book.

310
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:33,020
Scott: imagine if you were reading a book or watching a movie and the very end of it was locked away and you couldn't access it and After a long and difficult trial, you know that tested your skills and abilities and efforts it unlocked.

311
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:34,384
Rym: Yeah, and not even that.

312
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:38,376
Rym: imagine if it was like that, but most people never even unlocked it.

313
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,988
Scott: Yeah, it didn't matter What was in there as long as it wasn't nothing.

314
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,678
Scott: it was awesome because you got it.

315
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:45,260
Scott: There it is.

316
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:49,040
Scott: It's like opening a treasure chest and you found some amount of treasure.

317
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:50,865
Scott: You're happy wasn't.

318
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:58,889
Rym: until the Super Nintendo days were like Final Fantasy 4 and those games started having these long endings and then people would think of the ending of a game.

319
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:09,560
Rym: the longer it was the better and I remember people on the internet going Nuts about the fact that Final Fantasy 6 aka Final Fantasy 3 had like a half-hour sequence at the end.

320
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:15,800
Scott: It's like people want like this such a great reward for their meager effort of beating the game.

321
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,978
Scott: The game itself is the reward.

322
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:23,211
Scott: Hello, if the game itself isn't the reward all you want is the ending.

323
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:25,198
Scott: just go watch the ending on YouTube.

324
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:30,600
Scott: remember though That wasn't an option when we were I know but I'm just saying if all I want is the ending go watch it on YouTube.

325
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,460
Scott: The point is the game itself.

326
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:34,146
Rym: Yeah, but this list is crap.

327
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:39,709
Rym: and Mario Super Mario Brothers not only for the day But I'd say of all video games ever.

328
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:49,359
Rym: if you average the ending of every video game ever Especially if you wait that graph based on the difficulty of getting said ending Super Mario Brothers has one of the best endings ever.

329
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:55,459
Scott: Yeah, especially since that after you beat it you start the game again, but there are beetles instead of goombas.

330
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:03,891
Scott: Yeah Oh shit, I mean, you know Playing it now you go up beetles instead of goombas, but as a kid, oh my god The game is beetles instead of goombas.

331
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:06,404
Scott: Whoa Crazy.

332
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:14,867
Rym: I better pause it and invite all my friends over God, I remember how many times would I when I'm about to kill the final boss I'd pause the game and call my friends Billy.

333
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:16,592
Rym: I'm gonna be Zelda two bitches.

334
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:17,355
Scott: Oh my god.

335
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:22,339
Scott: I Couldn't even beat Zelda one without like the support of friends in the room.

336
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:23,925
Rym: God you would all every.

337
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:32,459
Scott: I was like the third try on Gannon and there were some people over my house or a barbecue And like my brother and some friends are sitting there and I finally beat it and we were all like

338
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:41,425
Rym: oh My god, I remember is always the eternal race between me and my brother who would beat a game first and I Call my brother

339
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:46,879
Scott: when I beat Mega Man 2 on that like early Saturday morning And I had to beat it before the cartoons came on.

340
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,988
Rym: Yeah, I know that it was like I tried.

341
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:53,430
Scott: it's like my third or fourth try and I finally got to dr Wylie and I'm like all shits.

342
00:23:53,833 --> 00:24:00,637
Rym: when I was in fourth grade I used to go home for lunch because just because I went to a Catholic school and for various reasons I lived right next to I could just go home for lunch.

343
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:06,733
Rym: Remember one day I went home from lunch and I was playing Final Fantasy 4 Which I thinking about how long ago that was.

344
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,279
Rym: that makes me feel really freaking old.

345
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:23,859
Rym: But I had to beat that antlion and get to a safe spot before my dad drove me back to school With an an argument ensued where my dad's like you got to go back to school and I'm saying no But then I'll have to do this all over again.

346
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:28,397
Rym: That's a fate worse than death and my dad turns the SNES off and drives me back to school.

347
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,143
Rym: That's right I was.

348
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,812
Rym: that was one of the worst things that ever happened to me.

349
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:44,718
Scott: You live a bad sad life Dad.

350
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,528
Scott: I could tell which thing today you're doing.

351
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,812
Rym: Ah, yes, you can.

352
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,980
Scott: indeed then what's the name of that song?

353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,206
Rym: That'll be puckle bells cannon indeed.

354
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:04,600
Rym: You might recognize it from such hits as every goddamn song in the world.

355
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:05,403
Scott: Yep.

356
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:06,127
Scott: Yep.

357
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:06,308
Scott: Yep.

358
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:06,489
Scott: Yep.

359
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,756
Rym: Everyone's heard this song.

360
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:08,540
Rym: Everyone knows this.

361
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:12,379
Scott: I think you might not know that you've heard this song, but you have heard this song.

362
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:17,940
Rym: So, uh, there's this comedian, you know, he's one of those guitar comedians kind of like how Dana Carvey used to do that.

363
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,360
Scott: It's like some hip college guy or something.

364
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:23,639
Rym: Yeah so he gets up there and he's doing you know stand-up comedy with the guitar.

365
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:29,475
Rym: and This is a clip of probably the end of his long bit because this is definitely kind of a.

366
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:33,534
Scott: it's most definitely the finale because he Says as much yeah, but I mean this is the home run here.

367
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:39,798
Rym: This is his best bit and basically, he just bitches about Pachelbel and Pachelbel's cannon.

368
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:45,019
Rym: indeed and I don't want to ruin anything, but I'll see you in hell Pachelbel.

369
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:52,571
Rym: What more can I say?

370
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:56,320
Rym: the song is Ubiquitous and the stand-up humor is hilarious.

371
00:25:56,441 --> 00:26:04,140
Scott: Yeah, the feeling I get from the guy is that he's probably not my favorite comedian in the world But this bit is a funny bit, especially if you understand music a little bit.

372
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,758
Scott: Yeah Somebody's going All right.

373
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:32,616
Scott: I don't want to talk anymore about the iPhone today But in the course of my looking at websites about the iPhone which lasted about 30 minutes today I discovered a new website that someone was using to compare the size of the iPhone To the size of other things such as the iPod the Zune the Nano cell phones decks of cards

374
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:33,499
Rym: Scott's penis

375
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,080
Scott: my penis.

376
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:40,062
Scott: The site is called size easy S I ZE ASY.

377
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:41,445
Scott: they took out one of the ease.

378
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,591
Scott: so it's not size easy.

379
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:45,417
Scott: It's just size easy.

380
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:47,127
Rym: I see what you did then I do.

381
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:47,980
Scott: I see what they did there.

382
00:26:48,301 --> 00:27:22,391
Scott: it's a very nicely designed web 2.0 ish site and it lets you enter in the dimensions of a three-dimensional rectangular Object, you know something a rectangle with a depth and then it allows you to compare that rectangle with the depth to other rectangles with depths that you specify and Standard everyday Objects such as decks of cards boxes of matches credit cards wine bottles CD cases monitors Doors paper etc.

383
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:23,314
Scott: Now.

384
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:24,700
Scott: Why is this useful?

385
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:37,487
Scott: Well, because we do a lot of online shopping these days and when you're online shopping Something you'll often see and like sites like Newegg or Amazon and such is you know what are the dimensions of this object?

386
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:44,407
Scott: and it'll say 10 inches by 12 by 2 and It is not always perfectly easy.

387
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:52,100
Scott: unless you have a ruler and some paper near you, you know to picture in your mind Exactly how big that is, you know, is it gonna fit on my shelf?

388
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,176
Scott: You got to get out a ruler, you know, is it gonna fit in my pocket nicely?

389
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:57,120
Scott: I don't know.

390
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:03,020
Scott: Unless you have it in your hand You don't really grasp the size of it and pictures are always deceiving.

391
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,165
Scott: You know you look at a picture of the Motorola Q online and then you see it in the store and you go Holy shit, that's thin online.

392
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:10,048
Scott: It didn't look so thin.

393
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:10,730
Scott: Holy crap.

394
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:22,155
Scott: So, you know, I was bit by this once I bought the Logitech Z 5500 5.1 surround sound system for my computer, which I highly recommend.

395
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:22,376
Rym: Yes.

396
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:27,353
Rym: It's a very good speaker system Scott However, the best sound system in the house, but the subwoofer.

397
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:29,360
Scott: the subwoofer is ginormous.

398
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,358
Rym: It's bigger than two of our friends.

399
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:34,127
Scott: It is bigger than two of our friends.

400
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:39,020
Scott: This thing can double as an ottoman or footrest of an ottoman is a footrest.

401
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:49,640
Rym: You know for a second maybe just because I was reading of course more Byzantine history and Ottomans, I pictured an ottoman just kind of bent over.

402
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:57,239
Scott: if you took the speaker out of it, you could perhaps use it as a Christmas tree stand, but it is very large.

403
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:06,508
Scott: and You know, I didn't understand how large it was because I bought it online and I was just looking at a picture You know engaging with my mind the size of it.

404
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:26,371
Scott: if I had actually had access to size easy.com when I bought this thing I probably would have realized the subwoofer was too large and bought perhaps the next system down Smaller subwoofer because as it is I have turned the base way down and if I turn it up I can make the old lady downstairs believe there is an earthquake.

405
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:29,138
Rym: All right, it's easily four times the size of my subwoofer.

406
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:30,182
Scott: easily It's.

407
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:34,459
Scott: it's four times the size of my previous subwoofer, which is the correct size.

408
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,873
Rym: So to hit back on the I guess classic format of our gaming days.

409
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,558
Rym: We're just gonna talk about two games.

410
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,260
Rym: We've been playing.

411
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,472
Scott: Yeah, because we got a new board game.

412
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:44,740
Scott: We're gonna talk about next week.

413
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,266
Rym: Yeah, we picked up a copy of battle.

414
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,360
Scott: Oh, don't say oh, well, well, you know, I wanted to be surprised.

415
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,047
Rym: Oh, well, they don't want to surprise people.

416
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,378
Rym: We want people to go who they're gonna talk about that game.

417
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:55,693
Rym: All right All right battle or is a great game.

418
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:59,960
Scott: Yeah next week We're gonna talk all about battle or which we just got and we have played one time.

419
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,708
Scott: But we're gonna play it right after we're done with this show.

420
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:02,874
Scott: Yes for the second time.

421
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:04,759
Rym: Let's hurry the fuck along then All right.

422
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:12,652
Rym: So today I'm going to talk about excite truck and I'm going to still talk about Castlevania portrait of ruin for the DS.

423
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,300
Scott: who wants to go first into rock-paper-scissors?

424
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:16,910
Rym: All right, rock, huh?

425
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,617
Scott: Hey, we got both scissors.

426
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:19,220
Rym: Huh?

427
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:20,586
Scott: I win.

428
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,197
Scott: Okay, that means you go first.

429
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:22,419
Scott: what?

430
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:24,565
Rym: Alright fine.

431
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:34,240
Rym: So I I reviewed a long time ago Castlevania dawn of sorrow for the DS which I contend is probably the best of the Metroidvania games.

432
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:44,936
Rym: I might get some flack from the people who like Symphony of the Night, but I'm sorry This is just a fantastic freaking game and the fact that it's portable and that I can just stop playing and save at any moment Was just perfect.

433
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:49,553
Rym: Portrait of ruin is not as good as Castlevania DS right now.

434
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:53,425
Rym: It is not that good Compared to that game.

435
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,354
Rym: However, it's right there under it.

436
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,020
Rym: It's still a great game on you.

437
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:00,572
Scott: You didn't really play the GBA once did you?

438
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:04,680
Rym: I have played them But I've never owned them or played them for more than a few minutes.

439
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:11,540
Scott: The thing is they've got this Cartridge that has the first two GBA ones on it and they didn't include the third one.

440
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,136
Scott: So it's like if you can get all three of them on two cartridges, but not on one.

441
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:17,360
Scott: It's sort of annoying.

442
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:20,950
Rym: Well if you like I mean I'd recommend everyone who has a DS to get.

443
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:30,900
Scott: if you like the Symphony of the Night GBA style Castlevania games you should pretty much just buy them all because none of them are that much worse or better than any of the others.

444
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:42,255
Rym: though if you haven't played many of these games or if your idea of Castlevania is a game that has a Belmont in it Then I'd suggest you get Castlevania DS and try it if you like it.

445
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:43,720
Rym: get portrait of ruin.

446
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:51,420
Rym: If you like both of them and you want more Go get all the GBA ones and Symphony of the Night and all that because they're still all really really good games.

447
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:54,280
Rym: I'm not knocking them don't even consider the possibility.

448
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:55,864
Scott: You know, it's like.

449
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,269
Scott: it's just more of the same though.

450
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,140
Scott: Don't expect, you know, something revolutionary and new and better.

451
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:07,016
Scott: Yeah, but it's like if you like Final Fantasy 4 play Final Fantasy 6. it's more the same mostly.

452
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,688
Rym: so portrait of ruin is Like all these games.

453
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:18,020
Rym: it has kind of a gimmick and unlike Castlevania DS where the gimmick was you draw these seals on the screen to seal in the bosses.

454
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:19,807
Scott: Oh good, because I hated drawing those seals.

455
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:20,489
Scott: That was annoying.

456
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,513
Rym: I kind of liked it.

457
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:21,935
Rym: Actually.

458
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:26,717
Scott: I thought it kind of like I was trying to whip the boss and then all of a sudden I had to pull the stylus out.

459
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,240
Scott: draw on the screen.

460
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,615
Rym: Well one I didn't pull the stylus off I just used my finger.

461
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:32,123
Scott: I eventually use my finger But I don't.

462
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,134
Scott: I don't like using the finger.

463
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:33,719
Rym: see to me.

464
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:36,703
Rym: To me.

465
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:44,520
Rym: it added this element of like I'm fighting I'm fighting and suddenly this thing comes up and now it's panic mode Because I've already wasted two seconds going.

466
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,340
Rym: What's this all right, and then I try to draw it before the boss comes back and fighting some of the later bosses.

467
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:55,093
Rym: I'd have to redraw that thing like seven times.

468
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,620
Scott: I never had to do it that much you suck.

469
00:32:58,301 --> 00:33:00,671
Rym: Anyway portrait of ruin the gimmick.

470
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,760
Rym: They don't use the stylus really at all.

471
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:07,660
Rym: They removed all that from the game Which is probably good because a lot of the DS uses of the stylus were kind of gimmicky.

472
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:14,660
Rym: It still uses the two screens the same way, but the new gimmick is that you control not one person, but two people.

473
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:18,607
Scott: Oh, I hate that because then one person always ends up doing something You don't want to do see.

474
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:28,155
Rym: now you might think that because every game I've ever played where you control two people was either Move one guy switch to the other one move that one switch back and it becomes annoying.

475
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,566
Rym: hellish game like that Vikings game for The SNES.

476
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,180
Scott: well there are some games that do it.

477
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,876
Scott: Okay, like double dash where you know they draw two characters on the screen But really you're controlling one like using the ice climbers and smash brothers.

478
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:48,038
Rym: not so annoying Yeah, but games like that Viking puzzle game for the SNES yes, or the caveman puzzle game for the turbo graphics Yeah, yeah.

479
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,354
Rym: But the way this game does it is number.

480
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:54,575
Rym: in Castlevania DS You could hit X to switch between your two loadouts, which was great.

481
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:55,620
Scott: That was really good.

482
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,166
Rym: Yeah, like that's.

483
00:33:56,226 --> 00:34:06,125
Rym: that's what made that game for me Honestly mm-hmm because I love tweaking inventories and that let me double tweak my inventory and the inventories are easy to tweak and not Complicated or annoying.

484
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:10,199
Rym: this game doesn't throw away any of that stuff plenty of weapons in fact.

485
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:12,577
Rym: It uses the inventory even better in that.

486
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:17,780
Rym: now It's not like that the other game where you just use the biggest heaviest weapon all the time.

487
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:33,971
Rym: Skeletons say are weak against crushing weapons But they're strong against swords and trees are weak against axes but strong against maces and you got to keep switching off weapons depending on what you're fighting and Unlike the other you know DS where it didn't really matter.

488
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:36,380
Rym: just use the strongest weapon you can reasonably deal with.

489
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:41,440
Rym: You got to change weapons and really think about what situation you're in and what weapon would best deal with.

490
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,725
Scott: Was it easy to change them?

491
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:45,014
Scott: or do you have to go to the menu come out?

492
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:46,600
Rym: well to change weapons?

493
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:51,688
Rym: You've got to go to the menu and come out But you don't really have to change weapons much.

494
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,036
Rym: within a screen or within one fight.

495
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,806
Rym: all right like for an area You'll figure out all right.

496
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,659
Rym: I should really be using a halberd for this part, okay, okay?

497
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,119
Rym: But in stating X instead of switching an inventory switches between the two characters.

498
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,024
Rym: Forget the names.

499
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:10,151
Rym: whatever the plots of Castlevania games are pretty much.

500
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,595
Rym: Just stupid at this point.

501
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,158
Scott: beat Dracula, please.

502
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,948
Rym: no It's never even Dracula.

503
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,987
Rym: It's always beat this other guy And Dracula's around.

504
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,520
Rym: so if there's some funny bits in this game where?

505
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,600
Rym: Death who apparently in the Castlevania universe now is good friends with Dracula.

506
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:30,200
Rym: You're in Dracula's castle to fight this Bronner guy who's taking it over and death appears, and you're like crap.

507
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:37,117
Rym: We got to kill death and death is like hey What are you doing here, and you tell him then he's like wait what I better go.

508
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:37,780
Rym: look into this.

509
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:40,459
Rym: I don't like anyone other than Dracula being in my castle.

510
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:49,367
Rym: Yeah But hitting X which is between the two characters and the one character is the same Effective guy from DS.

511
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:50,591
Rym: run around pick weapons.

512
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:51,073
Rym: look cool.

513
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:56,734
Rym: the other characters this girl It was a magician and her set of weapons is totally different.

514
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:03,619
Rym: you get books And the first book you get is an encyclopedia and you hit people with it straight up.

515
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:12,320
Rym: Okay, but the later books like now I got Don Quixote and when you open it a knight charges out at a windmill it does fire damage.

516
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:15,695
Rym: That's okay, and all the books are just kind of cool and neat.

517
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:24,779
Rym: and in addition She instead of stealing soul whatever's from enemies and casting them She collects spells or you can just buy spells and she straight-up cast spells.

518
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:26,733
Scott: You can add the spells useful.

519
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:27,600
Scott: Yes, okay?

520
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,999
Rym: You can also hit a to bring your ally down.

521
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,246
Rym: now They're both on the screen.

522
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:37,768
Rym: your ally will follow you in a very rational Realistic non annoying way.

523
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,740
Rym: if it gets stuck it just teleports to where you are immediately.

524
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:44,094
Rym: So there's no dealing with that, and it just generally fights.

525
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:48,100
Rym: if it takes damage You don't take hit point damage you take magic point damage.

526
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:53,939
Rym: So even if the game fucks you and it gets stuck on a monster for a minute It's not just gonna kill you just lose your magic.

527
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,004
Scott: How do you get magic back?

528
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:59,580
Rym: same as every Castlevania game tonics waiting or hearts all right waiting okay?

529
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:02,519
Scott: You just kill all the bad guys and stand there for a while.

530
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,925
Rym: Now there's also a lot of stuff like.

531
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:12,117
Rym: the puzzles will often involve using both people and you can go stand somewhere summon your ally But hold down an a at the same time.

532
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:16,859
Rym: They'll stay there, and then you can go off and do business and then switch back to them.

533
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:22,927
Rym: Or if they're both on the screen at the same time and you want to switch You just trade places with them.

534
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:26,279
Rym: you just suddenly you're controlling the other guy who might have been halfway across the screen.

535
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:36,184
Rym: Not gonna go into too much detail about it But suffice to say the mechanism of doing that works about as well as you could expect which is far better than I had hoped hmm.

536
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,450
Rym: and also the other.

537
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,274
Rym: I mean they removed a lot of the Killing monsters farming them to get their souls up.

538
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,764
Scott: Thank God That was.

539
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:52,779
Scott: the only bad part of that Castlevania DS is you had to get all these souls and like you'd want a particular soul from a monster But you didn't get a soul every time he killed it.

540
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,920
Scott: So you'd end up like leaving a screen coming back killing the monster.

541
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:08,551
Scott: I remember there's this one monster had a really good soul that let me throw Axes and I just kept leaving the screen coming back killing it leaving the screen coming back killing it for like 30 minutes until I Had full maximum level on that soul.

542
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:09,880
Rym: see there is still some of that.

543
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,004
Rym: I mean you can level them up But it's not as annoying.

544
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:16,640
Rym: and also you really care because the main thing is you don't have to do that to upgrade weapons.

545
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:19,093
Rym: Instead you just get better weapons.

546
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:20,179
Scott: Where do you get them?

547
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:28,797
Rym: You can find them you can buy them or there's an interesting thing they added where you can talk to the guy who's the voice from Soul Calibur 2.

548
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:32,720
Scott: and Wait, which voice from Soul Calibur 2?

549
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,242
Rym: The narrator.

550
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:46,760
Rym: Oh, okay, and he'll give you quests which range from collect these three items to do a Hadoken for me Right now to almost die and he'll give you things you can get special weapons from him special items from him.

551
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:51,328
Rym: You can also learn a lot of techniques from him to where during the game You have all the normal Castlevania crap.

552
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:57,700
Rym: You can also do Street Fighter 2 style Combo attacks, which really seems to add a lot to the game.

553
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,215
Rym: I'm running through an area fighting guys with swords.

554
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:05,120
Rym: suddenly There's one skeleton instead of you know going into the menu switch into a mace.

555
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:11,339
Rym: I just do kind of a double Street Fighter 2 super move and my guy kind of jumps at him and kicks him.

556
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:13,307
Scott: Hmm, it's really fun.

557
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:15,939
Scott: I'm still trying to think of something the guy from Soul Calibur 2 said.

558
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:21,975
Scott: oh He always said things in level started like yeah, like a sacred quest a master key.

559
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:26,156
Scott: Yeah, random words random words before your battle fight.

560
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,975
Rym: Yeah, well, he says stuff too and he might be a Belmont or something.

561
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,240
Rym: I haven't even read the text.

562
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,812
Rym: I don't even care anymore at this point.

563
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:34,800
Rym: I run into plot.

564
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,248
Scott: I just want to play to hear the guy's voice.

565
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,319
Scott: now cuz I'm gonna go look and see who that is.

566
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:39,346
Rym: Yeah, we should.

567
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:40,574
Rym: we should try to interview him.

568
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:43,348
Scott: I guess yeah He's a voice actor.

569
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:44,094
Scott: We know right watch.

570
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:44,900
Scott: He's like our best friend.

571
00:39:47,382 --> 00:39:50,460
Rym: He probably makes at least a million space dollars a year probably.

572
00:39:51,184 --> 00:40:02,254
Rym: So, I mean the game is pretty much just a standard metroidvania With a bunch of little gimmicks that make it interesting enough to where even if you're tired of all the same old There's just enough new stuff to make this interesting.

573
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,447
Rym: Hmm I haven't beaten it though.

574
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:09,280
Rym: I must say that it has so far the best boss in any Castlevania game ever.

575
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:16,445
Scott: Oh really other than better than a completely average vampire bat from Castlevania 1.

576
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:24,034
Rym: why in fact one of the bosses is a giant and by giant I mean, you can't see it all on the screen at one time.

577
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:28,310
Rym: ball of Naked dead human bodies.

578
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:40,659
Rym: Oh, yeah, you showed me that now Not only do they fall out of it and wander around trying to attack you by the hundreds But if you hit it with a mace you shake just hundreds and hundreds of them off of it.

579
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:44,599
Rym: Yeah, and it's dripping blood and screaming the whole time.

580
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:45,843
Scott: That's pretty good.

581
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:47,228
Rym: It's quite fantastic.

582
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,074
Scott: All right, let me tell you about site trick now.

583
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:49,476
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:49,677
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:55,418
Scott: All right, so One of the launch games to the Wii was excite truck and people are like, all right.

586
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,560
Scott: All right They're obviously just stealing the name from excite bike and it has nothing to do with excite bike because it's trucks.

587
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:03,589
Rym: Well surprisingly, I don't think many people made that connection.

588
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:07,020
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of scary also kind of like the Beatles.

589
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,805
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

590
00:41:09,005 --> 00:41:13,020
Scott: Anyway excite bike does have an connection to excite truck, which I will explain.

591
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:20,713
Scott: Anyway, you know and they looked at this game and it look, you know before I got it I looked at it and I said, all right, that's obviously just a launch game.

592
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:22,280
Scott: It's not the greatest game.

593
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,286
Scott: You drive a truck.

594
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:25,580
Scott: It might be fun, but there's not gonna be too much to it.

595
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:26,780
Scott: I'll buy it anyway.

596
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:37,234
Scott: And I did and I must say it's actually one of the better Wii games that I have and I've got like six Wii games Actually, you know what next to Zelda and Wii Sports.

597
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,560
Scott: I think it's you know, one two.

598
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,529
Scott: This is the third best Wii game there is right now.

599
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,880
Scott: Yeah, let me that I have and I have six Wii games.

600
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,307
Rym: It's better than monkey ball.

601
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,196
Scott: Well, anything's better than monkey ball.

602
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:49,167
Scott: monkey balls ass Alright, it's not perfect though.

603
00:41:49,428 --> 00:42:08,040
Scott: Anyway in excite truck you drive a truck you push two Which is a if you hold it like an NES controller, right and two is go and B. You know a is go B is break, even though it's two and one You tilt the controller left and right to steer and that actually works really well.

604
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,080
Scott: I mean at first you're gonna notice yourself doing it and you're gonna have a little trouble.

605
00:42:12,522 --> 00:42:21,298
Scott: But I mean at this point in the game when I play it, I don't even realize I'm doing it Like yeah, Scott says at first we're talking like 30 seconds and then you forget.

606
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:30,960
Scott: Yeah It's like I completely forget that when I'm playing this game I'm not steering left and right with my thumb or with a wheel, but I'm actually just tilting this thing back and forth.

607
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:35,356
Scott: I don't notice it when I play but I do it because I'm really good at excite truck.

608
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,980
Scott: suddenly, you know It's it's really crazy.

609
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:49,060
Scott: So, you know while a lot of the fun of the Wii is moving the controller, you know in Wii Sports You're very conscious of the fact that you're swinging the wiimote around and excite buck.

610
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,036
Scott: You are tilting the wiimote and using it full-on for all your excite buck excite buck.

611
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:56,380
Rym: I think you did whatever.

612
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:05,280
Scott: You're not conscious that you're doing it once you have learned the skill which that I mean one that's definitely the failing of monkey ball.

613
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:10,980
Rym: You never are not acutely aware of the fact that you're manipulating the strange and foreign controller.

614
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:14,520
Scott: Yeah, I think it's because monkey ball handles it very poorly.

615
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,010
Rym: But to me because Scott's played excite truck a lot more.

616
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:28,505
Rym: but I from what I've played the one observation I can make about the game It's really the only thing I can say about it is that the game seems like a typical whatever racing game Until you go airborne.

617
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:29,027
Scott: Yes.

618
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:41,863
Scott: See now you can tilt the controller left and right to steer left and right But when you hit a jump you pull back on it to get some more air or you pull forward you push it down forward to.

619
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:46,929
Scott: you know go down for the ground and A lot of the game is flying.

620
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,220
Scott: a whole lot of the game is flying.

621
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,864
Scott: I mean you saw that excite truck speed excite bike speed run that we put on the other day where the guy just hits the Jumps and flies.

622
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:59,239
Scott: that's an excite bike was all about was hitting those jumps and jumping over.

623
00:43:59,299 --> 00:43:59,460
Scott: shit.

624
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:08,056
Scott: Yep, landing at the right angle bouncing properly Yeah was leaning forward and backward hitting the ramps at the right speed and getting huge distance off of them.

625
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:12,737
Rym: excite truck Same thing but it does it so well.

626
00:44:12,757 --> 00:44:17,495
Scott: Oh, man Like the execution of the jumping in this game is so perfect.

627
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:27,535
Scott: when you get big air Like the music will fade out because this game has some pretty average, you know But not painful rock music going on and engine noises.

628
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:39,680
Scott: when you get big air like the music volume will go down and the game will kind of slow down and Your car will be way up in the air and the camera is always in just the right position.

629
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:43,705
Scott: It's like they didn't try to do too much with this game But what they did?

630
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,735
Scott: they perfected absolutely.

631
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:48,386
Scott: the camera is perfect the controls are dead on.

632
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:58,740
Scott: the music isn't annoying the tracks while there's only like Six or seven different environments, you know, all the tracks are very interesting and some of them are you know?

633
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:00,215
Scott: difficult and fun to do.

634
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:02,969
Scott: The thing is that's bad with this.

635
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:05,980
Scott: game is well for oh, I forgot something boosting.

636
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:08,112
Scott: Remember if you ever played excite bike.

637
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:14,275
Scott: you push a to go But no you push B to go and to normally and a to boost right to go better.

638
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:15,700
Rym: What was it the other way around?

639
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,307
Scott: I don't remember either an excite bike.

640
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,494
Scott: the original one button was just go.

641
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:24,677
Scott: the other button was go faster But when you went faster you started to.

642
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:39,000
Scott: you know your bike started to heat up and if it reached a certain point you would pull over to the side of the road because you were overheated and You would have to push a a whole bunch of times in order to get back on your bike Or you'd have to wait for it to cool off and then you could go again, you know.

643
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,482
Scott: So you didn't want.

644
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:41,711
Scott: you wanted to boost but you couldn't do it too much.

645
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:43,980
Scott: you overheat same thing and excite truck.

646
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:55,640
Scott: You have a boost meter you push the arrows which you're not using them for steering so you push them to boost which you're pretty much gonna boost as much as you want and This water that you can drive into to instantly cool off.

647
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,159
Scott: So if you're on a track with a lot of water, you're gonna be boosting a hell of a lot.

648
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:06,180
Scott: You can also boost at the like eight just like the beginning of jumps with perfect timing to get these turbo jumps.

649
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:09,260
Scott: And that's how you're gonna go fast and get big air, you know.

650
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,721
Scott: And if you land nicely you get like it'll say nice landing and you get a free boost that doesn't heat you up And

651
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:19,320
Rym: you'll be amazed when you start jumping around just the feeling you get from being airborne

652
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,380
Scott: Especially when you unlock some of the cars that have a law a very high air statistic.

653
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:30,880
Scott: I mean the cars have four stats and They don't matter so much except for the feel of the car.

654
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,080
Scott: None of them are really unbalanced until you get really good at the game.

655
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,200
Scott: Then you unlock the second set of cars that are the better cars, but all those are equal as well.

656
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,357
Scott: But the cars that have big air have big air.

657
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,700
Scott: I you can fly like over large portions of the track if you hit jumps in the right way.

658
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:51,813
Scott: So yeah, it has the same boosting mechanic as excite bike.

659
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,760
Scott: it has the same jumping mechanic.

660
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,974
Scott: It has the same cool off when you hit certain things mechanic.

661
00:46:57,496 --> 00:46:58,079
Scott: It's got.

662
00:46:59,363 --> 00:47:08,420
Scott: You know if you crash an excite truck You have to push one button really rapidly and if you do it rapidly enough Then you'll be back on the track and going really fast.

663
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,035
Scott: You'll get a free boost which is just like excite bike.

664
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:14,471
Scott: where you fall off your bike You have to push the button really quick in order to get that.

665
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,660
Scott: make the guy run faster to get on his bike again.

666
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:23,460
Scott: So while you might not speak the connection with excite bike and excite truck might not be obvious to the casual observer.

667
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:27,013
Scott: It is very much in the same vein and everything.

668
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:31,991
Scott: the problem with excite truck Is that perhaps its most promising aspect.

669
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,160
Scott: the multiplayer is kind of bad?

670
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,460
Rym: You see Scott was playing the game a lot more than me and I finally sat down and you know first time ever played.

671
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:48,798
Rym: I'll play some multiplayer with Scott and I beat him Every time we played and even I had to admit that I was not racing nearly as well as he was.

672
00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:49,380
Rym: so why was I?

673
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,761
Rym: Winning?

674
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:52,249
Scott: well the way excite truck works.

675
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:53,633
Scott: that is different from excite bike.

676
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,760
Scott: excite bike was all about coming in first place.

677
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:57,235
Scott: Go as fast as you can.

678
00:47:57,861 --> 00:48:02,678
Scott: Excite truck is also about going as fast as you can but it is also about collecting stars.

679
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:07,826
Scott: You collect stars by doing various things such as Stars.

680
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:13,027
Scott: right if you drive near trees But do not touch them you get stars.

681
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:16,779
Scott: if you do it for like a significant amount of time you get more stars.

682
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:18,887
Scott: the most Stars you can get it once is five.

683
00:48:18,987 --> 00:48:22,120
Scott: So let's say I drive near a tree and then I'm back on the road.

684
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,539
Scott: I'll get like one star.

685
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,627
Scott: It'll say tree run one star.

686
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:32,720
Scott: if I drive through a forest and I don't touch any trees It'll be like super tree run and I get five stars.

687
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:41,440
Scott: If I keep driving through the woods and I keep not touching any trees It'll be like super tree run super tree run super and I'll get five ten fifteen stars.

688
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:48,300
Scott: And that's how you get a lot of stars, and it's not just driving through trees getting big jumps that gets you stars.

689
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,690
Scott: Sometimes rings will appear and you can jump through them.

690
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:55,580
Scott: That'll get you stars crashing into other trucks.

691
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:57,188
Scott: You crash into them hard enough.

692
00:48:57,228 --> 00:49:00,168
Scott: You can get a super car smash five stars Etc.

693
00:49:00,189 --> 00:49:00,270
Scott: etc.

694
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:05,847
Scott: There are many ways to get stars, you know And there are many ways to modify the track.

695
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:07,653
Scott: when you there are exclamation points on the track.

696
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:12,367
Scott: if you hit them track changes Usually giving opportunities to get more stars.

697
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:17,138
Scott: in the one player excite truck coming in first gives you 50 stars.

698
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:22,379
Scott: So while it is advantageous to drive through trees and jump high etc.

699
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:25,289
Scott: It is much more important to come in first.

700
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:37,120
Scott: because well 50 stars and in the one player mode You're trying to unlock the next track and there is often a requirement You know get a hundred and ten stars on this track in two laps and then you can have the next track.

701
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,380
Scott: So that 50 stars is pretty big in the multiplayer.

702
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,532
Scott: It is also a game of collect the most stars.

703
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:47,933
Scott: whoever gets the most stars wins But coming in first gets you a measly 15 stars.

704
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:51,708
Rym: So Scott would win by a lot.

705
00:49:51,748 --> 00:50:05,479
Rym: then I'd be like, I don't know 15 seconds behind him yet Because I was reckless and crashing into things and flying over trees and flying through trees and drifting all over the place because I wasn't There and so well, I'd have like 80 more stars than him.

706
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:13,180
Scott: Yeah And I mean sure once you beat the track Their start used to get a star for like every second that the other guy doesn't finish.

707
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:21,725
Scott: So if I beat Rym by 20 seconds I get 20 more stars and that makes up a little bit for the fact that I'm not getting 50.

708
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:26,300
Scott: But it didn't matter because I was driving very fast on the road and getting big air.

709
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:31,360
Scott: Rym was driving very slowly through a lot of trees which got him a lot more stars.

710
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:36,240
Rym: So even though he drove either that or I was driving fast and constantly crashing into things.

711
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:43,919
Scott: Yeah crashing actually gets you a star or two if you get a nice crash and it also Crashing lets you get back on the track with a nice boost.

712
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,871
Scott: I mean very often crashing can be a way to come.

713
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:59,180
Scott: in first place, you know, if you do it add Strategic moments in strategic places, you know, I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've crashed while in second place Smash that button and then it puts me back on the track in first place.

714
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:04,235
Scott: So the multiplayer is sort of not fun because it doesn't reward you for driving.

715
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:07,529
Scott: Well, it just kind of Rewards you for driving poorly.

716
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,479
Rym: Yeah, I wish they at least had had.

717
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:18,216
Rym: I mean I can see why a lot of people like it's the excite truck multiplayer in that Where people who aren't very good at the game it makes it very fun.

718
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:22,894
Rym: Oh it sure does I mean, it's still fun to play even though winning or losing doesn't mean anything.

719
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,580
Rym: It's still fun to race against someone.

720
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:30,932
Scott: the other problem with the multiplayer is Number one, it's sort of a combination problem.

721
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:45,200
Scott: The screen is split in half Obviously a necessity but the controls are not the same, you know I talked about how in the one player it's so perfect the way you handle the car and where the camera is at all times Not so much in the multiplayer.

722
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:56,160
Scott: I mean I would drive in the single-player on a track with this car and do it amazingly The same handling on the same track in the same car and multiplayer no dice.

723
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,130
Scott: You know you you're freaking flying all over the place.

724
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:02,160
Scott: The car is much looser much more difficult to drive.

725
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,780
Scott: Also, it's much more prone to crashing.

726
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:09,799
Scott: I mean, I'll play one player and I'll hit a big jump and land on a rock and keep going.

727
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:14,980
Scott: in Versus mode if you touch something a little bit your car explodes and crashes.

728
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:16,648
Scott: It is no give at all.

729
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:17,974
Scott: or first play.

730
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:23,900
Scott: in single-player You can hit the car pretty hard against some stuff without completely killing yourself.

731
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:30,080
Scott: So it gets really annoying for anyone who's really good at the single-player mode to play the multiplayer mode.

732
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,878
Scott: You just get upset at yourself and you get upset at the game and it's not as fun.

733
00:52:34,702 --> 00:52:38,980
Scott: However, that's okay because the single-player mode actually has a lot to offer.

734
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:42,509
Scott: there's a lot of tracks as a lot of cars to unlock.

735
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:54,570
Scott: the difficulty increases easily and gradually from a very You know any from a very low level to a very difficult level and the game is constantly Rewarding you with new tracks and new things to experience.

736
00:52:54,590 --> 00:53:01,366
Scott: So as long as that single-player remains fun You're probably gonna have something more to do, you know I thought the game was gonna run out once.

737
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:06,735
Scott: I beat super excite mode and it didn't because I still have another mode to unlock And a lot more cars to unlock.

738
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:12,158
Rym: Yep I imagine we'll review at least portrait of ruin more thoroughly in the future.

739
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,815
Rym: after you know We beat them and we both played them and such.

740
00:53:15,118 --> 00:53:18,480
Scott: Yep Anyway, I think that pretty much covers the site track.

741
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:23,061
Scott: You have a Wii and you're looking for a game and you like racing at all You know.

742
00:53:23,122 --> 00:53:30,479
Scott: and if you're not interested if the multi the lack of multiplayer isn't gonna upset you too much Excite truck is worth whatever they're charging for it.

743
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,679
Rym: Yeah, it is definitely one of the top games to be out on the Wii right now.

744
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:47,177
Scott: And even if you know what I think was if it's still 50 bucks and you're not too excited about Driving a truck and hitting big air, which is a whole lot of fun Yeah, if you wait till it's 20 or 30 bucks, then you should definitely buy it.

745
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:48,320
Scott: Oh hands down There's.

746
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,381
