00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,620
Rym: It's Thursday June 8th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,129
Rym: We talk rather generically about concerts and live music.

3
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,107
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:22,213
Rym: You know it's funny.

5
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:28,667
Rym: How as soon as we say we've just about picked a logo of the deadlines this weekend We're pretty much done with this.

6
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:31,580
Rym: Suddenly the submissions come flooding in.

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,250
Scott: maybe we should have just set a deadline in the beginning.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,808
Scott: Yeah And that would have forced people to send them in.

9
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:41,024
Scott: It seemed like without a deadline people are like oh, I'll just wait forever.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:45,398
Scott: and now it's okay You have until Sunday night right?

11
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:45,939
Scott: is that we said?

12
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,208
Scott: that's what we said Sunday at midnight meaning what June?

13
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,047
Rym: Whatever, I don't know what day it is.

14
00:00:54,673 --> 00:01:05,372
Rym: At least probably you want to get it in before then because if you submit it at that time We're probably gonna decide like Saturday or Sunday June 11th new Midnight.

15
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:09,626
Scott: Eastern Standard Time, that's GMT minus 4.

16
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,810
Rym: Well are we EDT right now?

17
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,406
Scott: Yes, that's why it's GMT minus 4 instead of 5.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,803
Rym: Yes You should have said Eastern Daylight Savings Time as opposed to Eastern Standard Time.

19
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,167
Rym: That's right EST EDT.

20
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,030
Rym: That's right.

21
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:20,572
Scott: You're right.

22
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,906
Rym: that thing that most people who try to use NTP don't do properly.

23
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:24,790
Scott: That's correct.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,605
Scott: That's why I always just when I set a time zone on a computer.

25
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:30,639
Scott: I just set New York That way the computer knows.

26
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,330
Rym: yep, no used to not be that way.

27
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:33,434
Scott: That way.

28
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:38,310
Rym: you said to manually switch between EST and EDT or there were a lot of programs that would do it.

29
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:42,828
Rym: It was kind of amazing that Windows did it on its own even though it didn't really do it so well.

30
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:47,269
Scott: all the time I just say my time zone is America's slash New York, and I'm all good.

31
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,290
Rym: No, I'll save it for another day.

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:57,175
Rym: But I have a rant about how we should always be an EDT and we should just drop EST entirely but Or just keep EST.

33
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:01,730
Rym: no, we should go to Daylight Savings Time mode and stay there forever.

34
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:04,577
Scott: Why not stay in non Daylight Savings Time?

35
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:09,570
Rym: because staying in Daylight Savings Time means that we generally get more daylight hours all year round.

36
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:13,789
Rym: In fact, we the US did do that in the past.

37
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:16,680
Rym: They switched to EDT and they stayed that way.

38
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:30,308
Rym: and the only reason we undid that Was and I kid you not because Parents were lobbying that it was endangering their children by because the children had to wake up while it was still dark out and go To school and they're being hit by cars.

39
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:32,835
Scott: Were they being hit by cars.

40
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:35,263
Scott: is the rate of car hitting changed?

41
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:36,246
Rym: You know what?

42
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,430
Rym: I really don't know.

43
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:42,458
Rym: I'm pretty sure the argument was just a Bullshit, I tend to agree.

44
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,644
Scott: Yeah, but I still there could have been.

45
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:45,707
Scott: really is you know what?

46
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,169
Rym: you know what?

47
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,253
Rym: that's fine That's Darwin.

48
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,980
Rym: Yeah, I learned at a young age.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,270
Rym: Don't step in front of large moving objects.

50
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:58,296
Scott: I also learned that I did not wait for the school bus in the middle of the road No speaking of large moving objects.

51
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:03,509
Rym: I read a news article today about a coming crisis in the United States.

52
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:06,289
Scott: Is this fear-mongering?

53
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:09,249
Rym: No, this is something that's actually going to happen.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,095
Rym: Okay Now stay with me on this.

55
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,301
Rym: currently our roads in the u.s.

56
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:21,510
Rym: Especially in urban centers are pretty taxed as it is and There are many places where there just aren't enough roads and it's hard to get around.

57
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,710
Rym: But at the same time there is no alternate means of transportation.

58
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:30,210
Rym: Driving is really the only way to get around the United States with rare exceptions in large urban centers.

59
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:34,316
Rym: now Driving especially in the u.s.

60
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:40,297
Rym: Is somewhat difficult in that traffic is moving very fast Even though illegally most of the time.

61
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:55,466
Rym: there are a lot of windy roads a lot of rules there are a lot of car collisions in this country and The most dangerous both to themselves and others demographic per capita on the road is people over the age of 65.

62
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,794
Rym: I Agree old people.

63
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:03,930
Rym: No, no offense to anyone but old people really they it's proven they don't drive as well.

64
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,224
Rym: They are in general now.

65
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:09,633
Rym: There are a lot of specific Counter-examples, but yeah you can find.

66
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:17,209
Scott: if I wanted to I could find a person of any age who couldn't drive at all and I could find a 90 year old guy who was the best driver you ever seen.

67
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:21,629
Scott: But I'm sure Michael Schumacher when he's 90 can still outdrive all of us.

68
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:28,826
Scott: But the point is is that on average old people can't drive for shit And if you don't believe me go to Florida now.

69
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:33,664
Rym: at the same time They're actually almost neck-and-neck with the second most dangerous group teenagers.

70
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:34,587
Scott: Yep.

71
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:35,089
Scott: Yep.

72
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,550
Rym: Yep Now the teenagers just don't know what they're doing and the old people know what they're doing.

73
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,117
Rym: They just physically can't do it anymore.

74
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,423
Scott: But the fact remains that both groups are dangerous Now at least more dangerous than the other than everyone else.

75
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:53,990
Rym: Yes far above average statistically now Because young people can't vote.

76
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:08,249
Rym: I mean you can't vote until you turn 18, but you can drive depending on where you live as soon as you're 14. now because of this teenagers have Increasingly bad restrictions on their licenses and it's been getting worse and worse as time has gone on.

77
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:19,795
Rym: When I was in Michigan, I was a kid when I was 14 like end of 14 I got a car and I turned 50 now and then 15 ish driver's license per learner's permit thing the day I turned 16.

78
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,049
Rym: I got my driver's license.

79
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:31,630
Rym: Now you don't really get your driver's license until you're 18 and there are people trying to push it to 21 But the fact that was your 21 because the 18 19 and 20 year olds will come out to vote.

80
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:35,110
Rym: Yeah, but you can push it to 18 because no one younger than that can vote against it.

81
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:35,768
Rym: That's correct.

82
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:43,270
Rym: Now in addition to being the most dangerous group of people on the road the elderly are the most prolific voters in the country.

83
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,510
Scott: That is also correct.

84
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,388
Rym: so it is very difficult to restrict their ability to drive both from a practical standpoint and from a political standpoint.

85
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:59,949
Rym: any politician who advocates anything like Testing people and to prove that they can still drive every 10 years gets voted right out because all the old people don't like it.

86
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,530
Rym: Yep now normally this works out because there aren't so many elderly people on the roads.

87
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:10,249
Rym: But there's a something coming that people aren't really thinking about so much yet.

88
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:15,424
Scott: The baby boomers are getting old and they're going to retire and become old people.

89
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,367
Scott: there's Florida.

90
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:28,910
Rym: in the next 20 years There's going to be a sudden dramatic influx in the number of elderly drivers Partly because there's gonna be a whole bunch of people getting old all at once because there was a boom in the population.

91
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,999
Scott: Yeah, if you think driving is getting worse, and there are more and more old people driving around slowly There are now two and this one is.

92
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,650
Rym: this isn't really empirical, but it seems very interesting nonetheless.

93
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:50,909
Rym: Baby boomers as a generation tend to very much value their independence tend to have very long drives to commute tend to live far away from urban centers and have to travel a lot by road.

94
00:06:50,929 --> 00:07:08,023
Scott: as A result they are probably not going to give up driving no matter how bad they are at it and the generation prior to them is living longer and longer and Is also going to continue driving as they get older and older now.

95
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,230
Rym: It's not an easy issue to solve.

96
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:19,350
Rym: I mean you can't just take away like oh after your 70 Logan's run You can't drive anymore, and you really can't even even if you restrict it based on skill or ability.

97
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,705
Rym: You're now stranding countless people who really in the way America's set up.

98
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:24,689
Rym: They have no way to get around.

99
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,250
Rym: now They are trapped in their home.

100
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:30,732
Scott: Yeah, if my grandma didn't couldn't drive, and I mean she can kind of drive She.

101
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:34,330
Scott: you know she's not the best driver in the universe, but she drives better than a lot of other old people.

102
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:49,846
Scott: Actually my other grandma drives better than I'd say 90% of old people But I know plenty of old people who can't drive at all like they drive worse than 13 year olds now drive in the initial d arcade game.

103
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:50,669
Rym: What do we do?

104
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,822
Rym: I mean, I'm very much an advocate of every 10 years.

105
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:55,590
Rym: You should be tested to prove you can still drive.

106
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:57,677
Scott: I'm the advocate of every 10 years should be.

107
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:09,630
Scott: you should be tested and then once you get old you should start getting tested every Year or every two years more frequently as you cross the line into where you are losing physical abilities such as vision and hearing.

108
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:24,250
Scott: However that could be considered age discrimination among many circles, but here's the thing Discrimination and prejudice in any ism racism sexism Whatever is bad because what you were doing is you're judging people based on a criteria.

109
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:25,775
Scott: That doesn't mean anything.

110
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:29,507
Scott: a black person is no more or less capable than a white person.

111
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:36,610
Scott: in most Circumstances I say ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of circumstance because that other point oh one is being black bastard.

112
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:46,019
Scott: Yes, it doesn't matter if you're black or white if you're a computer program What the hell You never heard that Michael Jackson song.

113
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,204
Scott: no black or white, okay, whatever You know a black person isn't necessarily better computers than a white person.

114
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:57,118
Scott: a woman isn't necessarily better It you know driving than a man.

115
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,827
Scott: It's it all depends on your driving skill.

116
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:00,750
Rym: Wow you went skill.

117
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,409
Rym: You actually avoided making a funny sexist joke.

118
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,877
Scott: I expected women can't drive.

119
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,141
Rym: I don't know what you're gonna.

120
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:08,281
Rym: Say.

121
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:12,539
Scott: I just kind of one guys say hey, yeah But you know what.

122
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:15,655
Rym: neither can UGE day Asian something.

123
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:19,850
Scott: well Asian women half of them can't drive for shit and half of them are like race car drivers.

124
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:23,410
Scott: Uh-huh, but anyway at least every single one I've ever met.

125
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:42,337
Scott: Okay, but the point is that Oldness does have an effect on driving skill and therefore it is perfectly okay to discriminate Against old people because it does matter except it isn't because it's a democracy and they can just vote and say no No, we're not doing that.

126
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:43,603
Scott: democracy ain't perfect.

127
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:44,809
Rym: Yeah, so what do we do?

128
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:56,524
Rym: do we do we go against the principles of democracy and do something that is an anathema to the population or Do we let the population have their way knowing that will only hurt them in the end?

129
00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:01,403
Rym: and even then no matter what we do If we take if we don't do anything the roads get more dangerous.

130
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:06,974
Rym: if we take their licenses away We have now basically condemned them to a slow lonely death mm-hmm.

131
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,700
Rym: well obviously the answer is we need mass transit, but Yeah mm-hmm.

132
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,789
Scott: Maybe the old people who can drive should drive around the old people who can't.

133
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:29,650
Rym: Maybe the old people who vote in such record numbers every year and are really the true deciders of American domestic policy Should vote for mass fucking transit.

134
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:38,170
Scott: Maybe if we could force them and take their cars away Then they would vote for mass transit if they were all stranded.

135
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,878
Rym: But we can't force them without taking away their ability to vote, but if we take away their ability to vote They're not gonna vote for the mass transit.

136
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,888
Rym: Why oh, why does she swallow the fly?

137
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:51,990
Rym: There's really All right, yeah, I was just a rant.

138
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:52,927
Rym: I don't have an answer.

139
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:56,670
Rym: well I have an answer, but no one other than probably you listeners is gonna go along with it.

140
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,401
Rym: Yeah, that's transit mass fucking transit.

141
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,108
Scott: my answer is the trainee.

142
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:05,790
Scott: people Assume that democracy equals freedom.

143
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:12,750
Scott: You can have a free society in a free government without it being a hundred percent or mostly democratic government.

144
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:18,630
Scott: Just the same way you can have communism without a dictatorship although you know that there's things to say about that.

145
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,799
Rym: Yeah, well communism has worked very well in very small scales.

146
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,650
Scott: Yes, especially when it's not it doesn't have a dictatorship associated with it.

147
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,782
Rym: I mean our house is generally communist.

148
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:28,708
Scott: I guess.

149
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:32,089
Rym: But so with two people you can pull it off.

150
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,784
Rym: So I you can expect any day to find Scott dead with an ice pick in his eye.

151
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:40,344
Scott: I Don't have any incentive to do the housework anymore.

152
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,770
Scott: Oh wait this I don't do the housework.

153
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,501
Scott: I guess communism's failings even show with two people.

154
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:56,250
Rym: see actually not too long ago We I think it was with Scott Johnson We were talking and we've determined that Scott right here Scott of GeekNights is actually a living tragedy of the Commons.

155
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,021
Rym: Scott is the tragedy of the Commons.

156
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:07,370
Rym: we considered calling him TC for a little bit Whatever and anytime there's a common Scott is there defouling it I?

157
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,439
Scott: Gotta take advantage.

158
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,188
Scott: what can I say?

159
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:24,955
Scott: That's why I'm in such in favor of a commons in which there is no tragedy, but the point is is that I personally I'm in favor of some form of government that is somewhat democratic and somewhat technocratic or Meritocratic.

160
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:30,040
Rym: I'm more and more a fan of the government in the book I'm reading right now, which I'll probably talk about when I finish the book.

161
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:39,409
Scott: yes, even though I normally Like you know people always compare technocracies and meritocracies to just having a giant computer run the government.

162
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:44,376
Scott: But I've read too many stories Where that doesn't work.

163
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,165
Rym: yeah, but they're all stories.

164
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,009
Rym: No one's ever tried it.

165
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,882
Rym: I know I know plus it's hard to pick the first set of people.

166
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,390
Scott: stories are so convincing especially Phoenix.

167
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:59,470
Scott: So convincing yeah, because there's always some robot right a story to convince the old people they can't drive.

168
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,302
Rym: They'd have to be able to read it.

169
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:06,530
Rym: damn Okay see we're very pro feet freedom.

170
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:14,836
Rym: But you can take away certain freedoms like I'm okay with the government or somebody taking away Everyone's freedom to murder each other.

171
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,545
Scott: that yeah, it's not a freedom.

172
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:18,909
Scott: That's a protecting of her right.

173
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,870
Rym: yeah well No there is a freedom to murder But that also infringes on a right and every time you can give up a freedom to get something.

174
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:29,290
Rym: Every time you give up a freedom you get something in return as long as what you get.

175
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,689
Rym: Oh, it might not be something good.

176
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:35,487
Rym: You can give up your freedom to free speech and get a horrible life But you can still do it.

177
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,370
Rym: And I guess people need to realize that every freedom has an associated risk.

178
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:43,067
Rym: The freedom of murder has the associated risk of people will murder.

179
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:50,797
Scott: the thing here Is that I don't think freedom enters into the driving discussion because driving drive driving is a privilege Not a right, but travel is a right.

180
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,970
Scott: travel is indeed all right, and that's that makes a problem.

181
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,228
Rym: Yeah, so what do we do when the only way left to travel in this country is something that is not a right but a privilege?

182
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,520
Scott: That's not about that before GM.

183
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,389
Rym: Oh, yeah, you know what we should have thought of.

184
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,904
Rym: yeah We should have thought about a lot of things.

185
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:12,546
Scott: you know Anyone who doesn't understand the background history of this issue, and why there are only roads in America?

186
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,270
Scott: go watch Who Framed Roger?

187
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:15,213
Rym: Was about.

188
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:19,750
Rym: I thought you're gonna say some documentary, and I was gonna say a documentary about the same issue.

189
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,015
Scott: Yeah, cuz that really happened.

190
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:24,642
Scott: there were streetcars everywhere in fact.

191
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:27,228
Rym: There are remnants of streetcars and fish kill right next to us.

192
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:36,666
Scott: yep and GM bought them all and got rid of them all and replaced them with shitty-ass Buses so that everyone would buy cars and build roads and highways.

193
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:42,210
Rym: yeah, they bought successful train lines and shut them down and put crappy buses in place.

194
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:45,810
Rym: And they made them crappy on purpose to make people hate them enough to buy cars.

195
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,101
Scott: And they also made the buses so.

196
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,533
Scott: even if people just bought buses They were still good.

197
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:54,990
Scott: yeah, and that is why we don't have trains, and that is why we're having this problem.

198
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:56,700
Rym: Yeah, it's so sad.

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,830
Scott: just take helicopter lessons.

200
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,380
Rym: You know helicopters are real freaking hard to fly.

201
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,982
Rym: I know.

202
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,354
Scott: that's why we should start taking lessons now before the old people kill Us with their cars.

203
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,390
Rym: Why don't we just learn how to fly planes or a thousand times easier?

204
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,290
Scott: Not as versatile.

205
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:12,298
Rym: They're quite versatile.

206
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:15,094
Scott: You can't land on top of a building with them Yeah, but no one.

207
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:18,045
Rym: there's no one we know who would let us land on their building.

208
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:19,370
Scott: Oh, yeah, there is who?

209
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,010
Scott: We could land on the BCC and go to Otakon.

210
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:23,757
Rym: I don't think that.

211
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,730
Rym: maybe if we become big enough guests after they can easily do it.

212
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:27,272
Scott: It's it.

213
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:30,368
Scott: I know a lot rich people with helicopters.

214
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:32,917
Rym: We're not rich.

215
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,789
Scott: I know, but they just call ahead.

216
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:36,950
Scott: Normal people don't have helicopters.

217
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,602
Scott: You call ahead to any helipad.

218
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:43,702
Scott: what wait a minute was it's in a Hospital helipad or an emergency helipad?

219
00:15:44,003 --> 00:16:01,283
Scott: you just call ahead to it And then you get a landing whatever and then you go to it, so we'll pull up and are like gasoline powered Lawnmower modified into a helicopter damn straight Okay alright, so let's let's skip the let's finish that rant alright.

220
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:03,249
Rym: Yeah, I just wanted to rant about it.

Rym: They've only announced two musical guests so far Yep, and we talked a bit with Jim Vowels the chair of Otakon a while ago And he didn't say much, but he seemed real excited about upcoming Bits about the concert.

223
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,400
Scott: I can guarantee there will be more Musical guests at Otakon and that they will all be.

224
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,650

Scott: It wasn't bad.

233
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:21,270
Scott: You know it's just normal j-rock kind of action.

Rym: Now this whole gothic Lolita thing is actually been taking off in the US at conventions, too Mm-hmm.

253
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:54,625
Rym: if you don't know what that is you'll find out at Otakon or just Google for it.

254
00:18:54,826 --> 00:19:07,229
Scott: It's pretty distinctive Yeah, so it seems like this girl has some musical talent, and I might enjoy listening to her sing but her style is search for the truth worthy.

255

Scott: You can all be the judge of that.

258
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,770
Rym: So the thing of the day drought is finally ended.

259
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:40,089
Rym: I have a thing of the day that I thought was cool, and I didn't have to resort to looking for something old.

260
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:46,790
Scott: Oh my god, I'm still in the thing of the day drought I kind of picked something normal, but it's awesome anyway.

261
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:54,389
Rym: Whatever now people who know me know that I have between one and one point five eyebrows.

262
00:19:54,409 --> 00:20:00,690
Scott: as In I have to I would say you have between one point two five and one point seven five eyebrows.

263
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,990
Rym: Well it depends on how much I groom and how much someone plucks the middle of it out.

264
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:14,890
Rym: Yes, if someone plucks them you are down to one eyebrow two eyebrows because I Know I am a wuss and I can't even pluck my own eyebrow because it hurts too much, and I almost cry.

265
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:16,736
Scott: That is true.

266
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:17,360
Rym: It is.

267
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:20,473
Rym: I'm just but anyway I Have it.

268
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,030
Rym: what is called a unibrow like one?

269
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,307
Rym: I have one big eyebrow that goes across even though it's thin around the nose, so it's it kind of.

270
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,250
Rym: it's in between.

271
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,458
Rym: It's not a full-on.

272
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,045
Rym: I wouldn't call it a monobrow But it is a unibrow.

273
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:35,977
Rym: Keeps the sweat out of my eyes.

274
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,770
Rym: I find it very utilitarian and functional I agree.

275
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:44,414
Rym: Now I discovered this website Monobrow.com.

276
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:50,756
Rym: it is a testament to men and women who have women Oh God who have but one eyebrow.

277
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:55,590
Rym: yeah, and let me tell you they put my unibrow to shame.

278
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:57,014
Scott: They do indeed.

279
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:57,936
Scott: There's some of them.

280
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:58,137
Scott: Do?

281
00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:59,861
Rym: there's this one guy on the front page.

282
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:07,164
Rym: It is just a solid thick one All the way across in a perfect arch with absolutely no differentiation at all.

283
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:08,870
Scott: this thing is like 3/4 of an inch tall.

284
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:09,935
Rym: It's one hell of a.

285
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,884
Scott: it's just a big long rectangle.

286
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:12,869
Scott: Holy crap.

287
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:17,670
Rym: Now the best thing is you can submit monobrows and they have the monobrow of the week.

288
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:18,714
Scott: We should send yours in.

289
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,024
Scott: I'm gonna send myself and grow it out and send it in.

290
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:25,829
Scott: maybe we should get some of that spray That turns into hair, and then I don't want any more hair.

291
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,037
Rym: I spend enough time shaving.

292
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,665
Scott: That's the way to become the monobrow of the week.

293
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:30,529
Rym: I don't know.

294
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:35,647
Rym: Maybe it'll be like oh, there's a subtle monobrow or it's pointy could be could be.

295
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:36,129
Scott: I don't know.

296
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,197
Rym: Gotta get someone to help me pluck it again.

297
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,952
Scott: I have two separate eyebrows, but they're large And powerful.

298
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,436
Rym: yes mine.

299
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:47,223
Rym: I've combined their powers to keep sweat out of my eyes.

300
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:48,807
Scott: It's pretty much exactly like Burton Ernie.

301
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,790
Rym: Yeah Wait that means you're the slovenly one.

302
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:55,415
Scott: Ernie's the one everyone likes.

303
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:56,218
Scott: no one likes Bert.

304
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,322
Scott: He's all annoying.

305
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:58,125
Rym: Bert's awesome.

306
00:21:58,246 --> 00:21:59,250
Rym: No Bert's the man.

307
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,221
Scott: Bert hangs a little.

308
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:01,928
Scott: Tom bin Laden.

309
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,818
Scott: Ernie hangs with the rubber ducky on the bathtub.

310
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,188
Rym: Bert joined the KKK - yeah in fact I have a I have a funny Bert story, and then you do your thing of the day.

311
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,923
Rym: Now way back when I was in high school I think it was - was 10th or 11th grade thing was 11th grade, but it was.

312
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,428
Rym: it was early 11th grade or late 10th grade I don't remember.

313
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:23,788
Rym: Well, I feel old that I barely remember my high school years.

314
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:47,004
Rym: Anyway, I made with a bunch of friends this long photo montage thing for a class of history and part of the history we had to do was slavery reconstruction Gilded Age and We decided you know we had all these pictures of you know lynchings and various things set to music and historical stuff thrown about and Snuck in.

315
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:47,289
Rym: there.

316
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:57,894
Rym: There's one picture of a bunch of KKK guys standing around a real picture, but super imposed on the picture was Bert lol and No one noticed.

317
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:59,419
Rym: teacher didn't notice it at all.

318
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:10,050
Rym: we got our a. he noticed it not the day We presented it But a month later when we were asked to present it again to the school board because they were impressed with it.

319
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:20,639
Rym: Oh, yeah, and then during the presentation mr.. Lurch turns to us And he gives us this look right after Bert is off of the screen And he looks at us and he mouths the word.

320
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:28,747
Rym: I think he mouths something like I'll see you later Something like that and afterwards he comes out and like we leave the room.

321
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:32,422
Rym: He's like So why did you sneak Bert in there?

322
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:33,770
Rym: I'm gonna have to punish you for that.

323
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:38,184
Rym: And we were like watch your original Bert's been in there from the beginning.

324
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:39,630
Rym: you gave us an A on that Bert.

325
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:40,604
Rym: You can't take it away now.

326
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,448
Scott: Did you actually say you gave us an A on that Bert?

327
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:49,483
Rym: yes I didn't actually say it, but a friend of mine actually said the words.

328
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,189
Rym: you gave us an A on that Bert.

329
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:52,408
Scott: Awesome.

330
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:54,877
Scott: That's classic.

331
00:23:54,978 --> 00:24:10,825
Scott: fear the power of the monobrow Alright, so in keeping with the talking about concerts today I have linked to an awesome video from ancient black-and-white times of Led Zeppelin performing communication breakdown lot.

332
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:28,963
Scott: now While this particular video is incredibly wicked awesome and Led Zeppelin is like the greatest rock band ever to walk the earth And this is like one of the greatest songs, and it's a particularly good performance The video is not high quality video wise.

333
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,370
Rym: what do you want is some ancient time?

334
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,602
Rym: I know there's probably dinosaur stepping on the cables behind it.

335
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:33,964
Scott: well.

336
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:40,974
Scott: No, but there were a bunch of your parents Or perhaps you all.

337
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,141
Scott: you old listeners all make you feel old.

338
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,070
Rym: yeah, you know what a lot of our old listeners are also foreign.

339
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:50,185
Scott: They weren't here no, but Led Zeppelin is British.

340
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:51,430
Scott: I guess kind of anyway.

341
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:54,956
Rym: We don't have so many British listeners though.

342
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,641
Scott: Yeah, we have a few.

343
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,005
Scott: we have a few all right.

344
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:16,679
Scott: my point is is Not just this video, but my thing of the day is that YouTube is a haven for many many many Concert videos and concert bootleg videos that you could not see on DVD VHS Television movie theater anywhere.

345
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:24,425
Scott: search for the word live or possibly concert bootleg or search for the band you're looking for.

346
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:30,669
Scott: there is a particularly good video that I enjoy which has James Brown and Wilson pick it together.

347
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:38,318
Scott: The particular advantage of this is even if you know stuff isn't You know?

348
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:48,540
Scott: The point is a lot of these videos have dead people in them and They died before I was born.

349
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,390
Scott: I didn't have an opportunity to see their concerts.

350
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,660
Rym: That was the least eloquent way you could have put that.

351
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,603
Scott: I know I did.

352
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:56,350
Scott: I changed my mind, and I wanted to word it.

353
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:05,259
Scott: Wilson pick it recently died and John bottom died around the time I was born.

354
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,889
Rym: in fact our freaks and geeks made a reference to that.

355
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:17,342
Scott: yes And well you know the Beatles are dead most of them half of them Ringo still kicking yeah, and so is Paul McCartney.

356
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:21,324
Scott: yes, but you know the point is a lot of people are dead And you can't see them anymore.

357
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:23,035
Scott: wait a minute News flash.

358
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,882
Rym: a lot of people are dead a lot of me.

359
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:26,950
Scott: just musicians are dead famous ones.

360
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:28,808
Scott: I still see them on YouTube.

361
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,116
Rym: Good thing meatloaf hasn't died yet.

362
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:33,664
Scott: You can see him on YouTube also.

363
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:34,206
Scott: I bet it.

364
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:35,270
Rym: You know what I haven't even looked.

365
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:37,179
Scott: Yeah, I bet we could find some good ones.

366
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,822
Rym: I don't know.

367
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,470
Rym: his videos are kind of long.

368
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:43,310
Scott: Well you don't want to watch the music videos you want to watch the concert.

369
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:47,210
Scott: You know the guy with a camera at the concert true, but I wouldn't mind watching the music videos.

370
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,721
Rym: I haven't seen those in a long time.

371
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,930
Scott: some of them were just kind of long and boring.

372
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:53,415
Scott: Oh, yeah, them were also awesome.

373
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:58,190
Scott: Yeah, I think that the first one ever was the best one the one that showed on the midnight.

374
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:58,652
Scott: Whatever.

375
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,103
Scott: yeah, I forget what that was called.

376
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,730
Rym: You know what I'll do a show on meatloaf sometime.

377
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:04,650
Rym: I could do a whole Thursday on meatloaf.

378
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,436
Scott: It's all you I'll.

379
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:10,250
Rym: half of it'll be dedicated to the man and half of it will be dedicated to the meal.

380
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:35,170
Rym: We'll be dedicated into the band after the blimp, okay Anyway it we decided While I was at work today that we were gonna talk about live music Mm-hmm partly because it's a real easy topic for us to talk about until we run out of time.

381
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:39,529
Rym: And then that's a wrap for the week and also its concert season.

382
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:47,655
Rym: well It's always concert season But even though I'm saying it now on the air so I can't forget we got to buy tickets to Camelot And we have to buy tickets to the pillows.

383
00:27:48,257 --> 00:27:49,622
Scott: Oh shit right the pillows.

384
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:55,949
Rym: Yeah, tell you what you dig you get the pillows I'll get Camelot all right and all of our listeners out there remind us.

385
00:27:56,672 --> 00:28:07,990
Scott: Yes, and if you want to know about these concerts Camelot, and who's the other band Camelot's the only one I cared about I think yeah, it's performing in Poughkeepsie, New York, which is very close to us.

386
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:10,217
Scott: In when do they?

387
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:11,829
Scott: that's a long time for now isn't it?

388
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,194
Rym: It's in September.

389
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:17,770
Scott: the pillows are performing in New York City at the knitting factory later this month.

390
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:23,968
Scott: If you don't know the pillows do all the music in FLCL among many other.

391
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,996
Scott: Awesome song.

392
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:26,963
Rym: they're really badass.

393
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:28,010
Scott: They are really badass.

394
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:32,890
Scott: I like they were one of my top picks for you know band to appear at Otakon.

395
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:35,998
Scott: Yeah So the fact that I can just go see them in New York is like woohoo.

396
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:45,763
Scott: now if Otakon gets say I don't know Asian kungfu generation or Maybe a Yumi then and it's all good.

397
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,290
Rym: I don't know if they could get a Yumi.

398
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,003
Scott: I don't think they could but they said they might get other venues.

399
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,319
Scott: Yeah, if they get the football stadium Because no one's using that in the summer.

400
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:55,902
Rym: I don't know.

401
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,928
Rym: is the Yumi ever played in the

402
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:57,269
Rym: u.s.?

403
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:58,333
Scott: I don't know.

404
00:28:58,453 --> 00:28:59,737
Scott: someone find that out for us quick.

405
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:03,950
Scott: Yeah, cuz I anyway, but anyway, let's start talking about different types of live music.

406
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,981
Scott: Let's start with the easy one the DJ party.

407
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:08,606
Scott: All right now the rave.

408
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,369
Scott: They're similar.

409
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:10,475
Rym: All right We'll skip on.

410
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,245
Rym: you know weddings and all that crap.

411
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:13,090
Scott: Yeah, screw that.

412
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:21,278
Scott: We're talking about a nightclub or an anime con an anime con or an actual raves Or what?

413
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,149
Scott: any of those things?

414
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:35,270
Rym: Yes Okay, yeah When you I don't really like that kind of dance or that kind of live music because it's not really live music.

415
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:39,510
Rym: I mean a lot of people talk about the skill of the DJ spinning.

416
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:45,987
Rym: But honestly if I'm on the dance floor and I'm dancing to music and the music changes to different kinds of music over the night.

417
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:51,569
Rym: I Really couldn't care less if it was a person up there or win amp.

418
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:59,842
Scott: Yeah, it I like electronic music But I don't really care about the performance of the electronic music.

419
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:03,393
Scott: if a DJ does it once records it and plays it again It's the same thing.

420
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,439
Scott: No one's playing instruments.

421
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:14,990
Rym: So I mean granted they always you know, the DJ will know They'll craft the music to bring the crowd to some sort of understanding and take them on a musical journey.

422
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:19,170
Scott: But the crowd management and all that sort of stuff, but you can do that.

423
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:25,070
Rym: I don't see it as it's cool, but I don't really particularly like it as a performance art.

424
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,085
Scott: But I do like the music and I do like dancing.

425
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,241
Scott: now when you go to these things The ear here's what you got to know.

426
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,621
Scott: number one Don't wear too many clothes.

427
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:36,109
Scott: You will get sweaty from dancing.

428
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:40,843
Rym: Yeah, number two wear fucking deodorant - if you don't like dancing don't go.

429
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:49,190
Rym: Okay, if you don't like dancing don't go for Don't try to form a circle of people around someone who looks like they're dancing cool.

430
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,349
Rym: No, I will personally appear.

431
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:57,168
Rym: I will rise up like a demon in the night at whatever rave you're at and beat you down if you try that.

432
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,088
Scott: Mm-hmm Do not.

433
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,459
Scott: This could be how not to suck at concert.

434
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:02,543
Scott: How did that suck at concert?

435
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:03,888
Rym: I think that's what this is turning into.

436
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:15,830
Scott: All right You want to don't worry about how well you dance but know that if you dance well You should make adequate space for your awesome dancing.

437
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:22,133
Scott: And if you dance poorly, you know, just don't stand in the middle of the dance floor trying to make a show of your poor Ass dancing.

438
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:22,816
Scott: Yep.

439
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:30,930
Scott: No one will make fun of you for dancing poorly off to the side with you know Whoever, you know trying to hit on chicks, but or men depending.

440
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:40,690
Rym: But if you try to be like a woo and you suck Well, a lot of these things will have a stage area which oftentimes people can dance up there, too.

441
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:49,510
Rym: Now if that's the case and you're in any way Uncomfortable about your dancing abilities do not get on that stage.

442
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,630
Scott: If you've never taken a dancing class, you probably shouldn't go up there.

443
00:31:52,771 --> 00:32:02,710
Scott: And if you're one of those guys, you know who you are who can do acro You can do a backflip or any of that sort of stuff, but you can't actually dance.

444
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,095
Scott: Don't do that shit.

445
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:15,604
Scott: It's annoying and everyone goes and rolls their eyes except for little kids Which is why that stuff flies in anime cons, but it won't fly at a real rave Or a real party.

446
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:20,065
Rym: Yeah We're not gonna talk about the rave scene or anything cuz I don't really care about it.

447
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:25,161
Scott: Basically you just go You dance you have a good time when you get tired.

448
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:25,822
Scott: Stop.

449
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:30,340
Scott: Take a drink rest dance some more Hang out with people go home.

450
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,229
Scott: That's what that's like.

451
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:38,070
Rym: Now my favorite kind of live music is the small venue concert.

452
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:41,061
Scott: Rock and roll can't see any kind of music.

453
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:43,149
Scott: Well, depending on the kind of music could be different.

454
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:47,776
Scott: It was a small venue Say folk music.

455
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:51,766
Scott: you would sit at your table and you would tap your fingers on the table.

456
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,233
Scott: applause appropriately True.

457
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:58,230
Rym: Well, I'm just talking in general because I've been to yes jazz concerts.

458
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:00,436
Rym: I've been to j-rock concerts.

459
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,401
Scott: if it's a rock concert.

460
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:10,601
Scott: It is significantly different because there will be some mosh action Potentially depending on the rock and its heaviness.

461
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:18,155
Rym: now before we continue whether any metal is included We're gonna talk about these kind of concerts, but I'd like to say right now Always bring earplugs.

462
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,140
Rym: You might not need them.

463
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:24,010
Rym: But if you do and you don't have them it sucks.

464
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:32,949
Scott: Yeah, if you're going to a rock concert any amount of rock even May I say light rock or soft rock?

465
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,174
Scott: earplugs are a good idea.

466
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:39,748
Scott: now if you go to any kind of concert even ones you need earplugs.

467
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,977
Scott: if You just go without earplugs.

468
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:47,923
Scott: It might hurt at first but you can get used to it But that will damage your hearing severely and permanently.

469
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:58,110
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've gone to a few account actually, I went to a despair is right concert with Emily and we forgot to buy earplugs and It was still really awesome and my ears recovered because the concert wasn't that long.

470
00:33:58,592 --> 00:34:01,989
Rym: But you don't want to do that more than a couple times in your life at most.

471
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:14,717
Scott: Seriously going to one Say, I don't know a CDC concert ever without earplugs unless you're in the way way way Back and it's a big place.

472
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,746
Scott: Your hearing is permanently damaged.

473
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:17,409
Scott: period.

474
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:20,402
Scott: The end earplugs are awesome.

475
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:23,259
Scott: You really want to get are They?

476
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:24,630
Scott: they make special earplugs.

477
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,010
Scott: They cost a lot of money, but they're worth it and that they decrease the volume of all frequencies equally.

478
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,697
Scott: So the music sounds perfect.

479
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:39,009
Scott: a lot of times you get the wrong kind of earplugs and they might muffle certain frequencies more than others.

480
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:45,708
Scott: So you'll lose perhaps some bass or some treble or mid range or who knows and it music will be all a.

481
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,527
Rym: I just said Earplugs like that for back when I played the trumpet and it probably saved me a significant amount of hearing damage.

482
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,958
Scott: Yep But they're not really good for a concert.

483
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,389
Rym: No, no, but they were real good for playing.

484
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:03,070
Scott: Yeah They're designed for that because that mostly the ones that say specific instrument earplugs are the ones you want to avoid.

485
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:12,298
Scott: They actually make ones that say concert earplugs, and I'm not 100% sure but I think drummers earplugs are also Decrease all frequencies equally.

486
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,210
Rym: when in doubt any earplugs will work and they work pretty much.

487
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:26,107
Scott: Yeah Even if you will hurt the music of the concert better to save your ears and Enjoy the concert for what you can hear then, you know to take the alternative.

488
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:29,498
Rym: Yep granted We all forgot earplugs to that Laraku concert.

489
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,482
Scott: That's true.

490
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:31,665
Scott: But we were kind of far back.

491
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:32,347
Scott: So it was okay.

492
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:39,710
Rym: Yep Okay, but small venues are a lot of fun and whenever people hear concert they always think you know the stadium concert.

493
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,136
Scott: No stadium is very different.

494
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:44,388
Scott: arena and Rita and Stadium are the same thing on the outside and inside.

495
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:50,173
Rym: but yep But people always seem to picture that when you say concert and they always think oh I go to Ticketmaster I buy my big tickets.

496
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:53,121
Rym: small venues don't work that way.

497
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,250
Rym: a lot of small venue concerts are quite literally just walk in.

498
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:02,150
Rym: You got to be 21 at most of them just because that's how they make their money off of bars and selling you alcohol.

499
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:06,057
Rym: So if you don't drink These things are a gold mine of music.

500
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:16,470
Scott: because you just pay a low price because they expect you to drink you get in Enjoy awesome concerts and then you bust out and you didn't pay for any alcoholic beverages, but don't buy the water from the bar.

501
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,133
Scott: It's a ripoff.

502
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,524
Rym: Yeah, if you're gonna buy the water, you might as well buy the alcohol.

503
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,267
Rym: They cost the same.

504
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:23,110
Scott: I know And you barely get any water.

505
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:24,210
Scott: Hope there's a water fountain.

506
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:33,101
Rym: But the nice thing about a concert like that is usually in a small venue you'll be sitting or standing I don't know 10 15 feet from the artists.

507
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:33,884
Rym: They're right there.

508
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:35,810
Rym: They'll usually talk to the crowd after the concert.

509
00:36:36,313 --> 00:36:39,569
Rym: It's usually really fun and usually catch like five or six bands in a row.

510
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,059
Scott: Yeah, small venue place will never have.

511
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,030
Scott: well pretty much no concert will ever have just one band.

512
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:51,085
Scott: There's always a bunch of opening bands and you know, maybe even a closing band.

513
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:55,962
Scott: Yeah, you know if it's like a Bar late at night after the main act goes away.

514
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,970
Scott: There'll be some other closing act.

515
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,539
Scott: Just kind of mellow things out, you know center been home.

516
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,630
Rym: So what small venue concerts have you been to Scott?

517
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,699
Scott: Let's see, we went to.

518
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,225
Scott: I went to the enter WK concert.

519
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:08,270
Rym: Oh, yeah, I missed that one.

520
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:15,688
Scott: Yeah, that was like the perfect concert in terms of execution, you know, the place had an upstairs and the downstairs There's a stage.

521
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:20,368
Scott: You know, there are people who didn't want to get all in the mess could stay back at.

522
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:26,030
Scott: you know About halfway through the place near where the bar was the crowd pretty much ended right where the bar began.

523
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:30,990
Scott: And starting at the bar up to the stage is a mass of people all making a nice mosh pit.

524
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:32,257
Scott: But it wasn't one of those.

525
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,525
Scott: see mosh pits here.

526
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,430
Scott: let's talk about mosh pits now.

527
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,434
Rym: All right real quick is what.

528
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,618
Rym: this is kind of a rambling episode.

529
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:41,797
Scott: people when people say mosh pit people a lot of people haven't Seen one or been in real one get a bad idea.

530
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,270
Rym: mosh pit does not mean beat the ever-living shit out of the people around.

531
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:46,097
Scott: You know, that's not true.

532
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:51,198
Scott: Mosh pit does not always mean There are levels of.

533
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:57,872
Rym: mosh pit is correct and know what you're getting into know what the crowd is and Don't one.

534
00:37:58,093 --> 00:38:01,248
Rym: don't get into a mosh pit that's bigger than you can handle or worse than you can handle.

535
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:04,444
Rym: but two Don't escalate a mosh pit that doesn't want to be escalated.

536
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,308
Scott: That's right.

537
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:12,170
Scott: My the mosh my mosh pitting level is a bunch of guys bumping into each other and not stopping for a good ten minutes.

538
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:19,990
Rym: I Don't sound gay The evidence is really.

539
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:28,110
Scott: That's what a monster is a bunch of people, you know, you just bump into each other you push each other around.

540
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,770
Rym: Yeah, but the fact that you specifically said guys as opposed to people whatever.

541
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:49,181
Rym: When I say guys I mean that in a very general way My mosh my ideal mosh pit consists entirely of me and thousands upon thousands of beautiful women, okay, okay Me too, but I meant realistically yeah, but it's.

542
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:51,829
Rym: it's a. it's a way to experience the music.

543
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,033
Rym: wait It's kind of.

544
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:56,789
Rym: it's almost I don't want to say like tribal or to your roots, but it's very.

545
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:04,883
Scott: It puts you in a different state of mind, you know, and it's Even if I'm at a concert that has some nice comfortable mosh pits.

546
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:07,074
Scott: You don't do that the whole time, you know It's like all right.

547
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:07,817
Scott: Here's a good part.

548
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:08,783
Scott: Let's make a little mosh pit.

549
00:39:08,843 --> 00:39:10,732
Scott: All right, and then a few minutes later You're like, all right.

550
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:14,810
Scott: Let's just jump up and down and wave our hands in the air, you know make little horns.

551
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,880
Scott: Jesus threw up the horns.

552
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,404
Scott: No way.

553
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:20,596
Scott: Yeah You know, but then you know.

554
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:24,813
Scott: and then a little ballad comes on, you know, you light up your lighter you open up your cell Phone.

555
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:29,817
Rym: Yeah, but the goal of mosh pits is not to hurt each other It's to have fun except for some mosh pits.

556
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:32,003
Scott: if you go to a scary death metal concert.

557
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:34,270
Scott: There will be people with nasty spikes.

558
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:43,805
Rym: Yeah, rings of spikes on them, but even then really big biker and trucker guys They're trying to hurt each other, but they also expect that to be true.

559
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,090
Rym: for people to try and hurt them.

560
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,454
Rym: Yeah, two-way street you

561
00:39:46,494 --> 00:40:02,568
Scott: can tell looking at a mosh pit if it's a bunch of teenage to college age people maybe some 30 year old people and You know, they seem to make a little clearing with a bunch of people bouncing around in the clearing, you know then that's that you're pretty safe unless you're really small or really weak.

562
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:06,389
Scott: and If it's a bunch of people larger than you just don't go near there.

563
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:10,330
Scott: No one's gonna drag you into a mosh pit that you shouldn't be dragged into.

564
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,450
Scott: You know, if you're too close to one and you get caught in it, then that's you know, you shouldn't have gone there.

565
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:24,595
Rym: Now the first real like big mosh pit we ever experienced was when me and Scott and who else when I think was Greg Yeah, and Julie.

566
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,420
Rym: Yeah, and what was brother?

567
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,721
Rym: Yep.

568
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,693
Rym: Yep, and we went to a tool concert in Albany and this is an arena concert.

569
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,456
Scott: it took up the Pepsi arena.

570
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:39,380
Rym: arena concerts are big and Big big it take up the.

571
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:42,561
Scott: it was basically they play hockey and stuff here It's big.

572
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:50,790
Rym: now the thing about arena concerts is The real advantage of a small venue concert is that the sound quality is usually really good and really right there.

573
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:56,024
Rym: And in an arena concert, it's just so big loudness almost always Trump's good.

574
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:56,907
Rym: Yep.

575
00:40:57,167 --> 00:41:04,470
Rym: It's more of a Experience the band with a hundred thousand people or ten thousand people as opposed to sit and listen to the music.

576
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,524
Scott: It's not really a better or worse experience.

577
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:07,450
Scott: It's a different experience.

578
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:11,590
Scott: Yeah Now one thing you have to know about arena concerts is that you can get general admission.

579
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:16,842
Scott: Usually if it's a rock type of thing You can get general admission or seating if you get.

580
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:23,290
Scott: if you don't want to be in any scary mosh pits or anything Just get a seat sit down listen to the music and no one will think worse of you.

581
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:31,875
Scott: In fact, no one will think anything of you because they won't see you Just be sitting there in the dark listening to your band that you like and if you want you can stand up in front of Your seat dance around a bit.

582
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,890
Rym: Yeah, if you're adventurous you can jump into general admission.

583
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:46,250
Scott: They when you get seats a lot of people get seats scope out the security and as soon as the concert starts for real They jump right into the GA and most of the people don't get caught and no one cares.

584
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,454
Scott: They expect that.

585
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:52,710
Scott: if they don't expect that there will be enough security to prevent you from doing so and you won't do it.

586
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:59,820
Rym: Yep, but this was our first like this was a Big concert and we were general admission.

587
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,630
Rym: We were right down there in the pit with all the tool fans.

588
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:04,498
Scott: Yeah, you're basically on the floor.

589
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:11,741
Scott: They cover a hockey running hockey rink Sized area with basically interlocking rubber mats.

590
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:16,075
Scott: I think it was some sort of rubber that way They don't they could just wipe it clean.

591
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:24,325
Scott: Yeah from all the human slime on it, you know, and then everyone, you know Does all kinds of head banging and smashing and mashing.

592
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:25,830
Rym: now a concert like that.

593
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,435
Rym: You're running a lot of interesting elements.

594
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,538
Rym: There are some gentlemen.

595
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:32,770
Rym: I use the term very liberally to the front of us smoking marijuana.

596
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,619
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna happen at a. now.

597
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,584
Rym: answer the.

598
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:36,690
Rym: that's not the story.

599
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,588
Rym: The story is they kept puffing on it and puffing on.

600
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:44,105
Rym: apparently They only had one little joint and they got down to this like tiny little bit.

601
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:45,610
Scott: It was smaller than a dime.

602
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:51,081
Scott: I don't mean a dime bag I mean a ten cent thing with Eisenhower like it was.

603
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:51,702
Scott: that it was.

604
00:42:51,923 --> 00:43:00,293
Rym: it was like the size of the head of an eraser On a pencil like it was this little nub and one guy passes to another guy and he drops it and it falls on the Ground.

605
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:01,483
Scott: they had it on the.

606
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:01,846
Scott: it was.

607
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:08,470
Scott: imagine They're a pink eraser from the end of a pencil on the end of a paperclip and they were passing the paperclip around.

608
00:43:09,234 --> 00:43:18,246
Rym: So then it falls on the ground and they go around looking for it Like they just crawled around looking for this thing amidst the horrible slime that is humankind.

609
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:18,747
Rym: Yep.

610
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:22,197
Scott: Oh My god, I don't know what they thought they were gonna do.

611
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:24,002
Scott: eat the last little bit of it.

612
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:26,309
Scott: Yeah, it was on fire.

613
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,518
Scott: What they was like eating ash?

614
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:28,900
Rym: Yeah.

615
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:29,783
Scott: Okay.

616
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:30,385
Rym: Well, that was all.

617
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:33,145
Rym: phantomas was on phantomas.

618
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:38,423
Rym: That was the worst band I've ever heard.

619
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:39,570
Rym: all right anyway.

620
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:43,823
Scott: Now here's one piece of Scott advice for any rock concert whatsoever.

621
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,046
Rym: Is this your frickin carabiner?

622
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:45,969
Scott: Well, it's related.

623
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:54,720
Scott: Okay only bring in things which you Hope to leave which you don't care if you don't leave with them.

624
00:43:55,442 --> 00:44:04,645
Scott: So if you take something to the concert and You would be disappointed if it remained at the concert for all eternity and you couldn't take it out with you.

625
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:05,989
Scott: Don't bring it.

626
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:16,970
Scott: You should take this is this is what I recommend you take to a rock concert minimal wallet ready Sneakers that you don't care if they are completely stepped on and torn to shreds.

627
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:25,058
Scott: Socks because if you don't have socks, you're gonna have some mad smelly fungus action Jeans, I don't care what the weather is.

628
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,344
Scott: You need to protect those legs.

629
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:35,810
Scott: Yeah, right a White t-shirt or other plain t-shirt that you do not care if this last time you ever wear this t-shirt in your entire life.

630
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,021
Scott: You should pretend that taking the t-shirt into the concert.

631
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:41,630
Scott: It is going to be set on fire and then you are going to leave.

632
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:48,569
Scott: One form of identification with a photo perhaps your driver's license.

633
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:52,307
Scott: Enough money to get a cab home.

634
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:56,336
Scott: No The ticket to the concert.

635
00:44:56,798 --> 00:44:58,565
Rym: now, what do you key to your car?

636
00:44:58,585 --> 00:44:59,890
Rym: Yeah, you know, what do you not bring?

637
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:12,545
Scott: You do not bring a coat Because you will want to take it off and you can't cuz nor to put it and Wearing it sucks and it'll just get ruined and it smell like smoke.

638
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:13,088
Scott: It's bad.

639
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:13,690
Scott: Don't bring a coat.

640
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:15,814
Scott: Don't bring anything.

641
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:16,938
Scott: You don't want to be damaged.

642
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:18,604
Scott: Don't bring anything made of metal.

643
00:45:18,644 --> 00:45:20,370
Scott: Don't bring anything that's expensive.

644
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:22,639
Rym: Don't bring your iPod.

Scott: to bring your iPod.

646
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:32,230
Scott: Don't bring a recorder or camera or anything like that unless you're a professional Concert bootlegger and you can get away with it.

647
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:37,969
Scott: Don't bring drugs unless you're a professional druggie and you can hide it and get away with it.

648
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:41,120
Rym: My anti-drug is Robitussin.

649
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:43,669
Scott: Yes, don't bring Robitussin.

650
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:50,735
Scott: Do attempt to sneak in things like water even though you probably won't be able to Do.

651
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,289
Rym: not bring a carabiner.

652
00:45:53,026 --> 00:46:00,546
Scott: No Don't bring anything made of metal that Someone might think could potentially be a weapon because the bigger the concert the more likely they are to.

653
00:46:00,586 --> 00:46:14,590
Scott: just they don't care Anything that they'll put the line real low, you know, if you have a metal Earring that they don't like they'll make you take it off and they'll probably just throw it away or turn you away.

654
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:15,549
Scott: That's your choice.

655
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:19,550
Scott: So don't bring anything questionable at all.

656
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:33,920
Scott: Yeah Plus not having that shit makes it a lot easier to enjoy the concert without Constantly fiddling with shit, you know, you see people in there with headphones and they're you know They're mosh and they're like, oh no my headphones mosh.

657
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:34,764
Scott: Oh, no my headphones.

658
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:35,930
Scott: Yeah, it's much better.

659
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,968
Scott: You know wearing jeans in a t-shirt you get everything stuck in your pocket where you know, it's it's good.

660
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:42,995
Scott: It's secure You're good to go.

661
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:44,122
Scott: You don't have to worry about shit.

662
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:47,276
Scott: You can just have fun at the concert Not constantly fiddling with crap.

663
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:48,419
Scott: It's much better.

664
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,001
Scott: Trust me.

665
00:46:49,783 --> 00:47:01,553
Scott: I mean, I know P. at the Andrew WK concert I think one of the people who went with me Wore a leather coat and it had these straps on it and I think one of the little buckles on the straps was lost Gone forever.

666
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:03,699
Scott: Goodbye, you know, you don't bring that shit.

667
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:12,846
Scott: if you are more of the cultured geek Yeah, you might go on perchance to see an orchestra on perchance.

668
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:13,067
Rym: a.

669
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:18,761
Scott: on perchance For chance you might see an orchestra or visit one.

670
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:19,062
Rym: Yep.

671
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:19,985
Rym: I've seen many.

672
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,649
Scott: I've seen three or four.

673
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,856
Rym: one You don't need earplugs.

674
00:47:23,279 --> 00:47:24,910
Scott: You do not need earplugs to go see an orchestra.

675
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,225
Scott: In fact wearing your plugs would probably make it terrible.

676
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:29,855
Rym: now I'm not really gonna.

677
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,722
Rym: I mean, you know what orchestras sound like.

678
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:33,329
Rym: go see the kind of music you like.

679
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:43,990
Rym: and All I really want to say is that if you're going to see a symphony orchestra and you are not dressed nicely Once again, I will rise up from my horrible demon lair and destroy you.

680
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:51,540
Scott: It is the exact opposite of going to see the rock concert where you must wear jeans and a t-shirt Or the t-shirt of the band.

681
00:47:51,580 --> 00:48:00,869
Rym: I guess I forgot that I feel old But I really it bothers me when I go to a nice concert and I see just Shlubby kids and jeans and t-shirts like just shuffling in and sitting down picking their nose.

682
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:05,126
Scott: Yep I don't mind if you wear just nice pants and a collared shirt.

683
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:06,049
Scott: You're good to go.

684
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,240
Scott: Yeah, even a short sleeve collared shirt is fine.

685
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:10,089
Rym: I'll often wear a sport jacket or something.

686
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:13,770
Scott: You know, it depends on how fancy the concert is and where it is.

687
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,030
Scott: If you're going to Carnegie Hall sitting in the front row probably want to wear a suit.

688
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:28,680
Scott: Yeah, if you're going to you know local state symphony orchestra in the convention center sitting in the mezzanine You can wear, you know slacks and a collared shirt.

689
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:31,087
Scott: Yeah, let's leave whatever maybe even a polo shirt.

690
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:31,970
Scott: That's fine.

691
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:35,130
Rym: Now the same really applies to I don't opera ballet.

692
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:43,130
Scott: Yes, one thing though that you almost always consider when going to see an orchestra perform is the timing of your applause.

693
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:49,529
Scott: Nothing is worse than when you don't know and you applaud at the incorrect time.

694
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:50,853
Rym: now Here's the the.

695
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:54,925
Rym: the complex answer is watch the conductor and you'll know exactly when to applaud.

696
00:48:55,767 --> 00:49:02,030
Rym: if you're not sure That my my rims own advice is a bunch of other people do wait until the rest of the clouds.

697
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:08,407
Scott: The crowd is applauding then applaud and the amazing example of this is of course ten planets.

698
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:23,923
Rym: Oh Gods I've seen the planets well heard the planets perform live twice on two different occasions in two different venues and at both events Some people just started clapping in between planets.

699
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,673
Rym: now that you do not do that The rules are.

700
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:31,430
Rym: I'm not gonna get technical but I could be very like horribly technical about this.

701
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:35,347
Rym: You do not clap between movements of the same piece.

702
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:38,484
Rym: Mm-hmm You do not clap between parts of the same.

703
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:40,533
Rym: Ah, well it Nevermind.

704
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:44,567
Rym: you don't clap between until the conductor puts his baton down or turns around and looks at you.

705
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:45,390
Scott: That's correct.

706
00:49:46,232 --> 00:49:50,284
Rym: You don't really care about the different names for the different types of cons of parts of concert.

707
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:50,505
Scott: No.

708
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:51,007
Scott: No, we don't.

709
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:53,718
Scott: Yeah Even know or care.

710
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:55,930
Rym: if anyone wants to know I'll explain it in the forums.

711
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:58,137
Scott: But that is one thing you have to be very sure of.

712
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:06,330
Scott: when you go to see some sort of classical music being performed Is you clap at the appropriate times and at all other times you shut up.

713
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:11,190
Scott: It's not like going to see a movie where you know a little whispering at a funny part in the movie is okay.

714
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:20,136
Scott: There's something like that, you know making noise when people are there to experience some sound is Disturbing the sound greatly.

715
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:22,483
Rym: So now it varies right?

716
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,530
Scott: I don't even care if people next to me in movies talk.

717
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:30,267
Scott: You know normally as long as they don't do it constantly, but it got a. you know music like that.

718
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:31,940
Scott: Oh Just hit you.

719
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:44,417
Rym: Well, it's different for different types of this kind of music orchestral music you clap when the conductor turns around bows there'll be some sort of signal and a Musical like Broadway.

720
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:52,426
Rym: It is perfectly okay to clap After a virtuoso song or after a song within an act even before the current.

721
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:54,660
Scott: between acts, of course Yeah, the intermission.

722
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,230
Scott: but even during an act I mean an actress or an actor finishes or as soon as often, you know To Broadway play and they're like and now the play is starting.

723
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:05,050
Scott: Yeah before even anything happens.

724
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:12,230
Rym: But Broadway is really the only place where you people will clap or applaud during an act after someone finished something.

725
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:14,810
Rym: Yeah, well also actually jazz concerts.

726
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:21,330
Rym: It is acceptable and in fact encouraged to clap and applaud after a soloist finishes in the middle of a song.

727
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:22,716
Scott: That's true.

728
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:24,083
Rym: That is very much expected.

729
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,410
Rym: Don't feel shy about that.

730
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,650
Rym: Of course when in doubt don't do it because he might not be done soloing.

731
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:36,029
Scott: It might be some sort of bebop new wave jazz Where if it's kind of music you're into and you're comfortable with you know what to do.

732
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:41,853
Scott: yeah, if you're going to a new experience go with the crowd or Be an idiot.

733
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:47,450
Scott: now problem is normally I would say who cares if people think you're being stupid and normally I wouldn't care.

734
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:52,168
Scott: The thing is there can be dire consequences Though it's changed a lot over time.

735
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:56,730
Rym: Hundreds of years ago in you know France, especially in France.

736
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,097
Rym: This seems to be the hotbed of this though.

737
00:51:58,137 --> 00:51:59,182
Rym: Italy was pretty bad too.

738
00:51:59,845 --> 00:52:00,870
Rym: when people went to the Opera.

739
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:08,963
Rym: They it was actually a social occasion and the Opera be going out on the stage But they'd mostly ignore it and sit and talk and have all their intrigue and cry.

740
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:17,139
Scott: when you watch movies that show Old-timey people going to operas like you know movies about Mozart and shit It wasn't like that.

741
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:22,420
Scott: people didn't sit there with their little glasses Perfectly quiet and silent and noble watching the Opera.

742
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:25,470
Rym: It wasn't really until the days of Beethoven that that shifted.

743
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:28,080
Rym: Yep, I mean the Opera was a social occasion.

744
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:36,110
Rym: you went you sat down as soon as everything started You'd wander off and do whatever crap intrigue you were doing or talk to people or you're playing on your side.

745
00:52:36,572 --> 00:52:38,179
Scott: Yeah, all the noble shit.

746
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:43,307
Rym: I mean it wasn't like it is in the count of Monte Cristo But it's not that far from the truth at all.

747
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:46,475
Scott: nope All right.

748
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:47,980
Scott: any other varieties of concert.

749
00:52:48,923 --> 00:53:00,310
Rym: uh jazz concerts are not really Particularly special though I am a big fan of the jazz lounge concert But basically you go and eat dinner and there's music playing while you're eating dinner.

750
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:10,767
Rym: Yep, like a piano piano jazz or and just lounges as opposed to clubs or venues You're expected to socialize whatever during a lounge concert.

751
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,559
Scott: Yep And remember you can always.

752
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:15,310
Scott: it's it depending on the lounge.

753
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:23,249
Scott: You can go up to the guy playing the piano or whatnot and put some money in his little tippy jar And get him to do what you want depending on what's going on.

754
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,560
Scott: Yeah, it isn't dueling pianos going on or something like that.

755
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,470
Scott: you obviously don't go up and say hey play this one.

756
00:53:29,591 --> 00:53:34,887
Scott: But if you're in a Casablanca type of situation Sam what's up?

757
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:47,790
Scott: And of course if you're that guy who yells play free bird You're awesome, but the second guy who does it isn't Because the first guy who yells it is the guy who thought of it first.

758
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:50,310
Scott: Everyone has to do it at least once at a concert.

759
00:53:50,471 --> 00:53:58,270
Rym: I just remember at RIT after a hockey game We stopped by the some concert that was going on at the Ritz, which was this bar on RIT's campus.

760
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:01,744
Rym: We all stopped by it and some guy was playing some music.

761
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:06,829
Rym: I think it was a cover band mostly and Some drunk frat guy yells play free bird.

762
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:13,450
Rym: The guy stops playing walks over drags him up on stage and says, all right, I'll play it you sing it.

763
00:54:14,872 --> 00:54:17,167
Rym: Didn't even know the words didn't even know how free bird went.

764
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:20,890
Rym: Nope He just heard the word free bird and thought it'd be cool thing to yell.

765
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:29,623
Rym: awesome All right We should probably wrap this up a bit since we ended up talking more about how to not suck at going to concerts as opposed To concerts we like.

766
00:54:29,987 --> 00:54:34,443
Rym: yeah What's your favorite couple of concerts ever of all the concerts you've been to?

767
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:35,788
Scott: all the ones I've been to?

768
00:54:35,808 --> 00:54:39,765
Rym: yeah Not the you know concerts you haven't been to but you assume we're awesome.

769
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:40,427
Rym: I'm talking about concerts.

770
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:44,430
Scott: You've been to Because they didn't go to too many super awesome ones.

771
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:49,350
Rym: I mean, I would really say the laraku concert at Otakon was particularly awesome.

772
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,615
Scott: Yeah, that one was pretty awesome.

773
00:54:51,057 --> 00:54:53,227
Scott: The Andrew WK concert was worth the money.

774
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:53,950
Scott: Very awesome.

775
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:56,900
Rym: Yep, actually on Emily's birthday a while ago.

776
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:04,210
Rym: We went to the Blue Note to see Oh God What was his name famous jazz pianist and it was freaking amazing?

777
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,755
Rym: We were sitting close enough.

778
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:08,448
Rym: I could have reached up and just pounded on the keyboard and run away.

779
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:12,429
Rym: You should have Hit a lot of money to get into that place.

780
00:55:13,412 --> 00:55:13,815
Rym: Not so much.

781
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:15,084
Rym: See the places like that.

782
00:55:15,124 --> 00:55:15,970
Scott: You paid a lot of money.

783
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,289
Scott: You deserve to be able to bang on that piano Yeah, but places like that some of the key.

784
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,910
Rym: It's funny the tickets to get into the concert weren't that much but the meals there were real expensive.

785
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:26,603
Rym: Of course, the food was really good.

786
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:48,289
Scott: But yeah that and that laraku concert there was a I Concert like if you go to see like Bruce Springsteen or Any of those new musicians old people listen to like the stuff your parents listen to.

787
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:59,243
Scott: those kind of concerts generally are all seating and pretty much as people stand up and kind of wiggle around and You know cheer and you know, that's about it.

788
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:03,404
Scott: You know, yeah, you know That's only how pop music concerts are.

789
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:07,650
Scott: if there's no Standing room if it's just seating out pop music you always have the.

790
00:56:11,142 --> 00:56:16,884
Scott: That's the only difference in concerts like that are stand around Possibly wiggle.

791
00:56:17,024 --> 00:56:18,247
Scott: There's no real dancing.

792
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:26,834
Scott: There's no moshing just standing up potentially wiggling hand waving Clapping in tune with the music, you know that usual sort of thing.

793
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:32,730
Scott: It's just sort of a natural Everyone goes with the flow not too much energy sort of deal.

794
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,440
Scott: Yeah, so it doesn't require that much explanation.

795
00:56:37,386 --> 00:56:41,039
Scott: But in case you haven't been to a concert like that That's what you should expect.

796
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:45,009
Rym: Any other types, I don't know.

797
00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:46,154
Rym: I think we're winding down here.

798
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:47,740
Scott: Oh, oh I got one more type.

799
00:56:47,941 --> 00:57:00,520
Scott: All right, if you go to some badass funk concert with some And some flavor going on then you totally gotta get with the groove and do some funky dancing.

800
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:02,038
Scott: That's how that works.

801
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:06,851
Scott: Just pretend you're on American Bandstand or something and let loose.

802
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:12,858
Rym: I don't think many of our listeners know what American Bandstand is Awesome, because I barely know what it is.

803
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:15,407
Rym: You know, what's great?

804
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:26,291
Rym: every time I start to feel old I realize that every time I say I feel old after something it makes the people older than me feel really old Yeah, which makes me feel very young.

805
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:27,156
Rym: Hooray.

806
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:38,420
Scott: Haha I would tell you what to do at a hip-hop in concert But I have never been to a serious hardcore hip-hop and the closest thing I got to was a nerdcore concert at Katsucon.

807
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:44,060
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can see on TV what goes on there, but I don't know how much to trust that.

808
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:44,603
Scott: You know what?

809
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:46,860
Rym: I know I know what to do at a nerdcore concert.

810
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:50,517
Rym: Yeah, you jump around and scream like an idiot and you hold your DS in the air.

811
00:57:50,557 --> 00:57:51,059
Scott: There you go.

812
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,264
Scott: That's what you do.

813
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:59,912
Rym: Remember when we all pulled out our DS's at that entertainment system concert Awesome and the guy sing it like the guy in the guitar was you playing real?

814
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:07,240
Rym: furiously looks up and he sees us all Waving around holding our DS's and he stares at us and gives us the look of you guys are awesome.

815
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:10,910
Rym: Yep, that story doesn't go anywhere.

816
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,409
Rym: the concert wasn't very heavily populated So, but it formed a mosh pit.

817
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:18,340
Scott: that lasted about shows you how good their music was.

818
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,525
Scott: Is that you know?

819
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:22,658
Scott: and is that they could get a lot of energy out of the people?

820
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:22,919
Scott: when?

821
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:26,365
Scott: There wasn't a lot of energy Transfer between people going on.

822
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:32,694
Rym: that mosh pit lasted about the length of time it took for an Otakon staffer to run over and yell Oh my god, stop doing that.

823
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:33,238
Scott: and I went.

824
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:41,835
Scott: oh And everyone just kind of stood there sullen for a minute and then we got back to going Before we even knew about the.

825
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:50,712
Rym: we All right, that was kind of a random episode, yep, so Don't fear going to concerts now.

826
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:51,798
Scott: use our advice.

827
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:52,743
Rym: Yeah I know you're all.

828
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:55,493
Rym: keep various shades of geek and nerd and dork out there.

829
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:56,497
Rym: go to concerts.

830
00:58:56,557 --> 00:58:57,219
Rym: It's not hard.

831
00:58:57,802 --> 00:59:02,142
Rym: Just go to Ticketmaster or whatever and do it if you're not 21.

832
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:04,230
Rym: It's a lot harder and that sucks.

833
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:07,040
Rym: and my only advice is get older.

834
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:17,046
Scott: Yeah even if you're not sure even if there's no music you like coming to your area or you don't like a wide variety of music a crappy live band is Always better than a recorded good band.

835
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:17,648
Scott: Yeah, there's just.

836
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:20,900
Scott: that's how a lot of you know, these little indie guys stay in business.

837
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,138
Scott: you know you download some indie musics indie bands mp3s and you listen to them and you go.

838
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:32,339
Scott: and But I guarantee if you had never heard their songs before and you saw them at some random club you would go.

839
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:36,008
Scott: Cuz music sounds ten times better.

840
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:37,853
Scott: live no matter what the hell it is.

841
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:40,160
Scott: It's just something about live music.

842
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:48,938
Rym: Yep, except of course for some forms of electronica where one there is no live version and two if there were it'd be identical or objectively bad music.

843
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:57,480
Rym: Exactly So we actually got into an argument with some people over phantomas.

844
00:59:57,924 --> 01:00:07,958
Scott: Apparently so everyone knows Fantomas was a band that when we got to that tool concert We already mentioned phantomas was one of the opening acts already playing when we got there.

845
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:14,180
Scott: now Apparently phantomas consists of some highly talented musicians.

846
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:21,500
Rym: However the music that phantomas makes how dare you defile the word music with what that was?

847
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:25,932
Scott: I say my personal definitions that music is almost anything right now.

848
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:28,820
Scott: I'm making music but it was not song.

849
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:31,306
Scott: Those were not songs.

850
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:35,136
Scott: They were just noises that somehow and notes and

851
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:36,419
Rym: now when we walked in

852
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:36,880
Scott: things

853
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:42,460
Rym: They were between songs because we got to the concert a little bit late because we I was trying to finish my Rasta fries

854
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:43,109
Scott: yep,

855
01:00:43,778 --> 01:00:47,669
Rym: and The crowd is chanting get the fuck off the stage.

856
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51,880
Scott: get the fuck off the stage or something similar like phantomas sucks.

857
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:58,640
Scott: Yeah Like there was a couple scary fat guys with phantomas shirts that were kind of faded and worn.

858
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:00,897
Scott: But after phantomas was done those guys left.

859
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:08,835
Scott: Yeah, you know, I don't know why they didn't take their opportunity for a free tool concert But whatever the crowd was incredibly hostile to phantomas.

860
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:14,217
Scott: after they played a few sets We stood there and we're like, oh give him a break, you know, they can't be that bad.

861
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:17,259
Scott: after five minutes We said get the fuck off the stage.

862
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:21,829
Rym: So then we go to the shore.

863
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,274
Rym: it was either that summer.

864
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:29,880
Rym: the next I think was the next summer and We need a bunch of Scott Johnson's friends and they're really into this kind of music and out of the blue.

865
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,700
Rym: We're just talking about music and we make an off-the-cuff like it couldn't be as bad as phantomas.

866
01:01:36,223 --> 01:01:38,271
Rym: And we figured no one ever heard of this band or anything.

867
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:40,640
Rym: and they're like what phantomas is awesome.

868
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:42,508
Scott: We're like, oh ha ha ha ha.

869
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:47,507
Rym: and that spiraling are quite the argument Apparently, you know.

870
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:49,375
Scott: and he didn't like Andrew WK either.

871
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:51,023
Scott: and I was like, okay He was like.

872
01:01:51,103 --> 01:01:53,256
Rym: Andrew WK is senseless crap.

873
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:58,357
Scott: his lyrics Argument that I used to defeat phantomas.

874
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:01,072
Scott: that And it was like.

875
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:05,633
Scott: vice versa, you know He was saying phantomas is great musical talent and I was saying but their songs suck.

876
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:08,141
