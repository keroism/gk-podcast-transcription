00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,140
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,670
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,490
Rym: Tonight, we review, without spoilers, the Evangelion rebuild movies.

4
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,548
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,090
Rym: I guess vague spoilers about what Evangelion as a whole is about.

6
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,089
Scott: Maybe.

7
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:34,170
Rym: There's a little bit of a statute of limitations on that show overall.

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:40,567
Rym: Normally, this is the point where we do a little opening bit and talk about, like, "Oh, what happened on the bike ride and what we did this

9
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:40,950
Rym: weekend?".

10
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,022
Rym: But nothing happened in the last two days.

11
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:44,210
Rym: There's nothing to us.

12
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,809
Scott: No, it's been rather uninteresting over here.

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:54,029
Rym: Between the last show and this show, I played Blades in the Dark online all night, and I did two days of work.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,593
Scott: I worked.

15
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:56,543
Scott: I ate food.

16
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:57,149
Scott: I slept.

17
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,330
Scott: I rode my bike to nowhere up a virtual French mountain.

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:03,790
Rym: Oh, yeah.

19
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:09,930
Rym: One thing I can say is I noticed something about my body from this hike.

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,056
Rym: It's about weight.

21
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:16,150
Rym: Not body weight, but physical weight.

22
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,682
Rym: I'll run 15 miles and feel fine.

23
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:22,507
Rym: I'll bike 100 miles and just be a little sore, and then fine the next day.

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,749
Rym: When I normally hike, I can hike 10 to 15 miles without any soreness, and 15 to 25 miles, I'm achy at the end of it.

25
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:42,590
Rym: But hiking with a heavy pack actually makes my knees hurt at the end of the day, whereas more strenuous activity without that pack does not.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:53,289
Rym: And I think it comes down solely to the fact that when you think about it, when I run and do all these other things, my muscles also get stronger and bigger, and changes happen in my body.

27
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:58,590
Rym: But bones and knees are mostly just bones and knees, and ligaments are just ligaments.

28
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:04,090
Rym: You can't make a ligament just bigger or stronger like you can the muscles around it.

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:13,928
Rym: So that bottleneck, having that extra 30 pounds on my back, is a big goddamn deal to the parts of my body that are the least able to be trained or improved in any way.

30
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,269
Scott: Well, I don't know anything about that.

31
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:20,470
Scott: I'm not an orthopedist or whatever the correct doctor is.

32
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:22,929
Rym: Yeah, I was thinking which ones which over there.

33
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,620
Scott: It makes common sense.

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,229
Scott: It's like, yeah.

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,150
Rym: Yeah, it's just something I didn't really think about.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,740
Rym: It's like, all right, I can hike 20 miles.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,108
Rym: I'll put out a pack and I'll hike 20 miles.

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,590
Rym: I'll just be more tired.

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,770
Rym: And now, I actually wasn't more tired at all, but my knees hurt.

40
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:35,909
Rym: I also couldn't run.

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,390
Rym: You could feel my knees being like, nope, do not do that when you're this heavy.

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,030
Scott: You've got a big load on your back.

43
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:52,769
Scott: If you go on a long bike ride, even if you get off and feel totally fine, like you don't feel achy or anything, if you try to walk up some stairs immediately after, you wobble, wobble, wobble.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,267
Rym: Yep, yep, yep.

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,500
Rym: But the other thing that was interesting is when I was wearing those really fancy backpacks.

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,150
Rym: When I was a kid, I didn't have a fancy backpack like modern technology.

47
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,010
Scott: Also, some of those didn't exist, even if you had all the money.

48
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,710
Rym: Oh yeah, that's what I'm saying.

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,785
Rym: The hiking backpacks today are materially different, kind of like how skis are different in the 21st century.

50
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:23,167
Rym: So, the thing that was really interesting about wearing that heavy pack was that it didn't feel like any weight at all, other than the knee thing, like when you're wearing it.

51
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:28,130
Rym: Unless you lean to the side at all, and then suddenly you feel all that weight all at once.

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,989
Rym: Like you gotta stay kind of straight up, or suddenly you feel it all.

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,781
Scott: Uh oh, I don't stand up straight.

54
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,210
Scott: I don't look like dynamite.

55
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,856
Rym: So yeah, we'll get right into it.

56
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:49,290
Rym: Normally, anime news, manga news, comic news, but we had a whole bunch of big news on Monday, and the news train continued.

57
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:50,716
Rym: We cannot talk about this.

58
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,330
Rym: There was a massive leak at Twitch.

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,990
Rym: Like this is huge news that we're still just barely unpacking.

60
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,810
Rym: We've barely even unpacked all the stuff we talked about on Monday.

61
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:20,809
Rym: So, what we know is that Twitch, someone leaked, not just like password hashes, or like all the baby stuff that gets leaked all the time, it appears that they leaked the entire source code for Twitch, including like change logs and multiple versions of a lot of things.

62
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,358
Rym: Entire databases of just raw information.

63
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,770
Rym: I saw talk of two-factor secrets were even leaked.

64
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,950
Rym: Raw passwords were not leaked, I don't think, but hashes were.

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,022
Scott: Well, so supposedly, there was one dump.

66
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,049
Scott: The dump was confirmed, legit.

67
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,469
Scott: It was actually a dump.

68
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,630
Rym: Ferg confirmed it at 7.30am yesterday, and then Twitch also confirmed it was legit a few hours later.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:05:03,510
Scott: But it was supposedly part one, so the only things that were actually in part one that seemed to have leaked is the source code of Twitch, its entire Git repository, which includes the entire history of the Git repository.

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:14,070
Scott: So you could presumably check out, you know, Twitch 1.0 from 2000-whatever, and try to run it on who knows what hardware, if I don't think that's going to be possible.

71
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:43,130
Scott: And also, some data that included something related to the payouts people get, you know, the earnings of streamers, but that data looks, at least, I haven't seen the original data because I'm not downloading some shady leak from Fortune, but the people have so processed that data via some unknown means and published it without much annotation describing what the numbers are.

72
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,240
Scott: And it doesn't have a lot of meaning.

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,346
Scott: what people have tweeted, right?

74
00:05:48,891 --> 00:06:06,930
Rym: It's a situation where people are coming in hot with hot takes about data they've looked at, but the serious people, like the journalists who are going through this data and methodically analyzing it, it's going to be a little while before we get really verified explanations of the full extent of this data.

75
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:16,124
Scott: Regardless, any claims of any data other than that, other than the source code repository and some data-- Well, actually, so here's the official list.

76
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:16,789
Rym: This is confirmed.

77
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,889
Rym: This is what is in the leak tube right now.

78
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,830
Rym: Three years of creator payouts with the asterisk that we don't exactly know what those numbers represent specifically.

79
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:31,870
Rym: The entirety of Twitch TV with commit history going back to nearly the beginning.

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,290
Rym: The source code for the mobile, desktop, and video game console Twitch clients.

81
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:41,490
Rym: Code related to all the proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch.

82
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,010
Rym: An unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios.

83
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,410
Scott: Right.

84
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,110
Scott: Well, I mean, so they did, they do or did, or maybe still do have like a Twitch app.

85
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,249
Scott: And if you get free games from Twitch because you have Twitch Prime, that's the app you need to get those games.

86
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,630
Scott: So that's, I don't know why they're calling it like some unreleased secret Steam competitor.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,839
Scott: There is a Steam competitor from Twitch.

88
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,622
Scott: It's the Twitch app.

89
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,410
Scott: It has, you can download games in it.

90
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,080
Scott: It has a library.

91
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,270
Scott: It does what Steam does.

92
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,870
Rym: I did read a little more about this, but there's still, people are still investigating it.

93
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,230
Rym: But the claim is that what it is, if you look at it, is something that is not available and out there.

94
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,630
Scott: Like it has other-- It's probably like a rebranded, upgraded, who knows what.

95
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,950
Scott: But all of these things are under the umbrella of the source code repositories from Twitch.

96
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:34,970
Rym: Oh, also a whole bunch of raw data that hasn't been analyzed yet on IGDB and CurseForge.

97
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,375
Rym: Other Twitch properties.

98
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,089
Rym: There's other things Twitch owns that I don't interact with.

99
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:47,090
Rym: And all of Twitch's internal security tools, including their red team penetration test suites.

100
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,292
Scott: Right.

101
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:50,110
Scott: So all their source codes, all their software.

102
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,530
Rym: Yup.

103
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:58,630
Rym: So we don't know much more yet, but if you have a Twitch account, I highly recommend you change your password.

104
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:02,770
Rym: And if you have two-factor authentication, disable it and re-enable it.

105
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:16,029
Scott: And beyond that-- Of course, there hasn't been any confirmed truth to the fact that anything in the Twitch SQL database presumably has been compromised in any way.

106
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,519
Rym: Yup.

107
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:27,070
Scott: But they did say it was leak part one, and it was such a leak that you have to imagine if they got all this, they could have, who knows what they could have gotten.

108
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,180
Scott: But maybe Twitch was using, were they using GitHub?

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,082
Scott: They're Amazon.

110
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:34,669
Scott: They're probably using OZ code, whatever it is.

111
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,450
Scott: So the breach could have come on that side of things and then thus not had access to anything else.

112
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,604
Scott: The only outlier is that payment data, why would that be in Git?

113
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,550
Scott: if the Git was the compromised part only?

114
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:51,190
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,681
Scott: That would be in a database somewhere.

116
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,869
Scott: Why was it in its own database?

117
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:58,542
Scott: Maybe it was in some sort of payment processor that got compromised or something.

118
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,187
Scott: Who knows?

119
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,170
Scott: Something strange is there.

120
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,189
Rym: I guess what I would say is that I would be more surprised if this is the extent of the leak than I would be if a part two comes out.

121
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,070
Scott: Right.

122
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,977
Scott: But there's no reason not to just go change your password, reset your stream keys.

123
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,318
Scott: It's free to do.

124
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,379
Scott: Couldn't hurt.

125
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,346
Rym: If you're not-- Worst case, it's a waste of time.

126
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:26,560
Rym: But best case, it might protect you possibly from other things that may be coming along.

127
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,460
Scott: Make sure you have 2FA enabled on there, which you should do for all your accounts everywhere anyway.

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:59,840
Scott: But one thing we did discuss today, which I just is really true, is that a Twitch account, unless you are A, streaming, obviously you need an account, B, subscribing, which you're going to need an account, you really want to chat on Twitch, or you really want to use the feature where you follow people and get notified when they go live, which can be useful for people who rarely go live.

129
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:10,900
Scott: So unless you want to use one of those four things or combination thereof, even if you watch a lot of Twitch, there's no reason to actually have a Twitch account.

130
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:22,080
Rym: I mean, I will admit, like I tweeted this too, like full disclosure, rather than like deal with this, I just, I reset my, I went, I logged into my Twitch account and I just deleted it because I don't actually use it that often.

131
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:27,975
Scott: If you don't use any of those four features, even if you use Twitch a lot, you don't need an account.

132
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,660
Scott: An account doesn't get you much, right?

133
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:45,360
Scott: And most of that, that's just, which is why they should be ego, you know, back to the argument from last week, they should go even harder on making it hard to get an account because people don't even really need an account unless you're doing those things.

134
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,612
Scott: And most of the people who want to make accounts are bots.

135
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:50,420
Scott: So therefore the barrier should be higher.

136
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,468
Rym: When I saw the breach, I went like, Oh, maybe I should change my password.

137
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:57,480
Rym: And I wasn't even logged into Twitch on any of my browsers at the time.

138
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:01,259
Scott: Well, yeah, Twitch will log you out, I think after a certain number of days, no matter what you do.

139
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,519
Rym: But that means I had not like done anything.

140
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,860
Scott: Their expired time seems to be shorter than some others.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,421
Rym: Yeah.

142
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,920
Rym: Cause YouTube, like Google, like almost never logs me out.

143
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:11,047
Scott: Yeah.

144
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,720
Scott: Very rarely.

145
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,380
Rym: So on some other news, you got this thing from Katsuka.

146
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,561
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,935
Scott: Thank you to the listener for posting this on our discord right before the show.

148
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,080
Scott: Cause I couldn't find the news.

149
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Scott: So the Onkama studio, the French animation studio, who made an animation such as Dofus and Wakfu, which I've heard of.

150
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:42,080
Scott: Wakfu was a big deal when it came out in some areas, but I haven't heard of it, you know, I've heard of it, but I haven't heard from it in a long time.

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,225
Rym: I think we even talked about it on a gig nights.

153
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,900
Rym: I watched a bunch of it and I kind of got bored with it and I didn't continue with it.

154
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,720
Scott: I wasn't into it, but it was definitely unique at the time and it had an impact like on, you know, animation as a, as a whole.

155
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:57,360
Rym: It definitely got a critical mass of true fans globally.

156
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,302
Scott: Yeah.

157
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:07,760
Scott: But anyway, the people who made that are making a full length animated motion film, which is like we always say on GeekNights.

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:18,880
Scott: There are not that despite the proliferation of, you know, everyone around the world making all kinds of content, more music in a day than you could possibly listen to more movies than ever.

159
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,583
Scott: You could watch more books than you could ever read.

160
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:31,360
Scott: If you limit yourself to full length, animated movies, 90, you know, we're talking 60, 90 minutes plus two D, you know, animated films.

161
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,768
Scott: Even if they're made with computers, there are not many.

162
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,791
Scott: Yeah.

163
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:39,420
Scott: The number that come out in a year are like a few hands worth.

164
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,420
Rym: And if you remove everything that is a sequel to an existing property that brings that number down even further.

165
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,201
Scott: Right.

166
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:57,697
Scott: Because even if you're a totally just an indie place, like to, to animate a thing of that length is a, just a tremendous endeavor, you know, even with the most modern technologies.

167
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:59,680
Scott: or, you know, let's say you have a pile of money.

168
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,161
Scott: Right.

169
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,044
Scott: So there just aren't that many of them.

170
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:12,900
Scott: You could conceivably, I think if someone dedicated themselves to being, you know, to doing this, you could watch every animated movie that is of a certain length.

171
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,241
Scott: Right.

172
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:19,620
Scott: 60, 90 minutes plus that has ever been made by humans within within a lifetime of a single human who is healthy.

173
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,980
Rym: You could definitely watch every year, every single feature length animated film that comes out in the world.

174
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,681
Scott: Yeah, probably.

175
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,147
Scott: Uh, even if you went for like the really unpopular ones, whatever.

176
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:42,620
Scott: Uh, so yeah, so they're making one and our policy because of the, what we just said is even it, why not watch an original, right?

177
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,104
Scott: It's an original story.

178
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:49,297
Rym: Also with these character designs and the, and the topic princess dragon, like, yeah, I'm down, I'm game.

179
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:50,079
Rym: You got me.

180
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,260
Rym: Right.

181
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,603
Scott: It's like we already have dragon Prince.

182
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,645
Scott: Let's go princess dragon.

183
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:04,280
Scott: But the thing, all I can say about it, cause there's so little information about it right now, other than like a picture and a little trailer that's tiny or whatever.

184
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:16,160
Scott: But the style of the characters reminds me of a princess Kaguya, maybe a little less sketchy parts, but you know what I mean?

185
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,741
Scott: Yup.

186
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,524
Scott: If you've seen princess Kaguya, you know what I mean?

187
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:26,117
Rym: And the dragon's got a little bit of a Western dragon coupled with a guy who look at the background and the foreground of the, of the movie poster.

188
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,680
Scott: We're doing a little judge by the poster here.

189
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:33,906
Scott: Uh, the art style is like, you know, exactly the opposite of that.

190
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:34,486
Scott: Right.

191
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:40,491
Scott: So it creates this contrast between the characters and the world that really, you know, I think would work well in a movie.

192
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:50,220
Scott: And that makes me think that, Oh, this movie might be good if they've already, you know, you can see how much thought they've put into this and positive aspects coming out from a still image.

193
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:57,011
Scott: I have a positive expectation of what this is going to be, whatever it's going to be.

194
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:02,480
Scott: So it's coming out December 15th in French theaters.

195
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,358
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

196
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,200
Rym: So check this out.

197
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,290
Rym: This video talks about a bunch of dangerous toys that were sold in America.

198
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:21,856
Rym: Uh, lawn darts are like, that is, that is baby's first dangerous toy that was sold in stores.

199
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,719
Rym: Like we're, we're going to way beyond that.

200
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:33,630
Rym: But the primary dangerous toy in this video from the sixties, it is a real toy is a gasoline powered pogo stick.

201
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,293
Scott: That sounds lovely.

202
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,377
Rym: It is terrifying.

203
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:45,610
Scott: And I mean, the gasoline powered is probably what's terrifying most people, but pogo stick by itself is terrifying and dangerous.

204
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,158
Scott: A pogo stick by itself is already a terrifying dangerous toy, especially when it's constructed poorly.

205
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:51,919
Rym: So yup.

206
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:58,710
Rym: So imagine a pogo stick that is literally powered by gasoline to make you jump higher.

207
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,451
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:02,072
Scott: Let's not do that.

209
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:02,612
Rym: Yeah.

210
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:03,854
Rym: Uh, no one, like.

211
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:14,910
Rym: there's no gore or anything in this video, but I will say that the person who is trying it out and working on it and demonstrating it hurts themselves basically every time they use it in the entire video.

212
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:22,461
Scott: You know, you could do, I guess you could make some sort of a pneumatic pogo stick.

213
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,404
Rym: It would be the same result.

214
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,330
Rym: It's kind of like powered powered roller skates or roller blades.

215
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,066
Scott: But at least you wouldn't have like this motor going on.

216
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:30,730
Scott: You'd basically...

217
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,472
Rym: No, no, it's not a motor.

218
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:32,575
Rym: It is gas.

219
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:38,150
Rym: Every time it comes down, it ignites the cylinder once and shoots you back up in the air.

220
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,090
Scott: Oh, so the pogo stick is the piston.

221
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,637
Rym: Yeah, the pogo stick is the piston.

222
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,810
Rym: You come down, spark plug fires and shoots you in the air.

223
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,730
Scott: But at least there wouldn't be fire involved if you just used a compressed gas.

224
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,357
Rym: Oh yeah, the fire, even with this, the fire doesn't hurt anyone.

225
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:56,730
Rym: The act of it pushing you back into the air itself is the danger here.

226
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,010
Scott: I mean, even a trampoline is hella dangerous.

227
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,865
Rym: I kind of want to go jump on a trampoline again.

228
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:03,470
Rym: It's been a while.

229
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,029
Scott: You should go to a professional trampoline place.

230
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,109
Rym: It's way more fun to just have trampoline fights with friends in someone's backyard.

231
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,844
Scott: Well, the trampoline places though, they just have a field of trampolines.

232
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,249
Scott: So that sort of, you know...

233
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:18,911
Rym: Yeah, true.

234
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:24,369
Rym: You don't have the situation of just falling off the trampoline, which is way scarier than a lot of people realize.

235
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,854
Scott: Well, scary is falling between the trampolines.

236
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:36,530
Scott: Anyway, so thing of the day, this isn't animation related in any way, but this is dude and he runs a campground.

237
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,894
Scott: People come and camp there.

238
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,780
Scott: They rent little campsites and then they leave.

239
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,150
Scott: It's sort of like a hotel, only way less amenities.

240
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,374
Scott: So this campground has been open for a long time.

241
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,976
Scott: It's still open until today.

242
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:59,490
Scott: And in the 80s, 1985, according to this video, he decided to, you know, use a computer to manage the reservation system at the campground.

243
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,610
Scott: But in 1985, you couldn't exactly buy a campground reservation software.

244
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,330
Rym: Yeah, there was not campground management as a service.

245
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:10,714
Scott: I don't even know if there is today.

246
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,419
Scott: You'd probably use something more generic, right, to do that.

247
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:20,291
Scott: But anyway, so what this person did is they got themselves a computer in 1985.

248
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,354
Scott: What computer could you get?

249
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,981
Scott: that wasn't very, that wasn't ridiculously expensive?

250
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:27,290
Scott: They got an Atari ST, a perfectly fine computer.

251
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:36,050
Scott: And by themselves, they wrote the software to manage the campground reservation system, which is not that complicated a thing.

252
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,681
Scott: Atari ST could handle it.

253
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,990
Scott: It would just wouldn't be that fancy.

254
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,493
Rym: It's pretty fancy.

255
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,843
Rym: Like it shows a map of the campground and like the campsites.

256
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,370
Rym: Like it's more fancy than you might expect when you watch this video.

257
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,091
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,517
Scott: But that software doesn't need any internet.

259
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,019
Scott: It didn't need any updates.

260
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,064
Scott: The computer, why would it break?

261
00:18:58,408 --> 00:18:59,530
Scott: It still works today.

262
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:10,090
Scott: The only upgrade that was made is because, you know, disk drives, uh, I've moving parts and such, they had to replace, you know, the disk drives with something that uses USB sticks, right?

263
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,092
Scott: Some sort of interface.

264
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:20,810
Scott: Like I have those same similar thing on my Apple computers where I fool the Apple computers into thinking that a micro SD card is actually an old hard drive or an old floppy drive.

265
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,311
Scott: Same trick.

266
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:24,015
Scott: Um, but other than that, it still works.

267
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:25,097
Scott: He's still using it today.

268
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:31,167
Scott: Why upgrade, you know, um, actually that's in a conversation.

269
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,830
Scott: that's, you know, going on in the tech space.

270
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:38,790
Scott: Uh, even though it's not a Monday show, we won't go into the discussion, but you know, with chip shortages and such, right?

271
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:51,170
Scott: It's like if an old slow as chip can do a thing, why use a crazy fancy one, but factories only make new fancy ones, you know, and reuse environment.

272
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,101
Scott: So many concerns going into this topic, but this is a actually a good, you know, is this a good environmental move?

273
00:19:58,422 --> 00:19:58,722
Scott: Yes.

274
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:03,610
Scott: Cause he didn't have to buy a new computer, use new Silicon, reduce, reuse, recycle.

275
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,114
Rym: This is reduced and reuse at the same time.

276
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:11,844
Scott: You have to consider how much power this old as computers using probably more than an iPhone is.

277
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:15,390
Scott: and an iPhone is many, many, many times more powerful.

278
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,376
Scott: So there's a lot going on here, but really interesting video.

279
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,138
Rym: Well, it's funny cause.

280
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:25,790
Rym: when I worked at IBM, I guess a statute of limitations or NDAs or whatever up, but when I was there, this was a long time ago.

281
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:34,360
Rym: Uh, one of the systems I had to manage was the core DNS for basically the entire fab, like the factory, like critical DNS.

282
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:42,070
Rym: And it was running on this ancient computer that hadn't been rebooted in years that was running OS2 warp connected to our token ring network.

283
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:50,524
Rym: And, uh, we just all agreed to not try to move it, to not try to shut it down, to not try to upgrade it because it was working fine.

284
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,970
Rym: I presume it's still there to this day.

285
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:59,850
Scott: But if it's not online and it works, you're good.

286
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,737
Rym: So the other day I bumped into, we were cleaning up the apartment that we'll get into the Evangelion review.

287
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:11,990
Rym: I, uh, I found a set of disks that was actually a parting gift when I did finally quit IBM and move on to other things.

288
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,290
Scott: I thought there was the plaque with the token ring cards.

289
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,051
Rym: Oh, yeah, I have that.

290
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:17,773
Rym: That's actually on my desk at work today.

291
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,635
Rym: But I love that plaque.

292
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:31,610
Rym: But because I, my first big IT project in my career, like the biggest thing I ever did first was helping IBM migrate off of token ring and onto Ethernet.

293
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:35,397
Rym: And if you think that makes me really old, actually it doesn't.

294
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:38,002
Rym: This was just a really old archaic network.

295
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,346
Rym: But also it makes me really old.

296
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:41,849
Rym: Two things are happening there.

297
00:21:43,290 --> 00:22:00,430
Rym: But, uh, so the parting gift when I left, because I really like the people I worked with, they gave me CDs that were the last official release of OS2 warp, the operating system, long after it stopped being released to the public.

298
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,948
Scott: You can just download it.

299
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,301
Rym: This was never released to the public.

300
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,830
Rym: I don't know if this is available anywhere.

301
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,469
Scott: Oh, let's get it up on oldversion.com.

302
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,952
Rym: Yeah, I found these disks.

303
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:11,094
Rym: So this weekend.

304
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,175
Scott: Archive.org, let's go.

305
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:14,859
Rym: This weekend, I'm going to rip these disks to ISOs.

306
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,063
Rym: I'm going to figure out if this is anywhere and see what I can do with these disks.

307
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:18,885
Rym: So stay tuned.

308
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:22,770
Scott: Archive.org and oldversion.com are probably your best bets.

309
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,432
Scott: Exactly.

310
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:26,683
Rym: So that's that's an exciting project I'm going to do this weekend.

311
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,750
Rym: I hope these CDRs are still readable.

312
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,417
Scott: That's oldversion.com.

313
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:32,020
Scott: Still love them.

314
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:32,624
Scott: Take a look.

315
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:33,228
Rym: I don't even know.

316
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:33,530
Scott: Anyway.

317
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:44,390
Rym: In the meta moment, the geek dies book, which we are steamrolling through now, the tale of Genji as he sleeps and fucks his way through life, causing minor problems along the way.

318
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:51,126
Rym: Otherwise, we're not going to any conventions anytime soon for all the reasons you can imagine.

319
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:51,929
Rym: Our most recent...

320
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,924
Scott: No, PAX Unplugged is happening, though.

321
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:54,570
Scott: We won't be there.

322
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,112
Scott: Yep.

323
00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:01,719
Rym: Atari Game Design, the last panel we did for a convention, which was for PAX East Online, is just on YouTube.

324
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,581
Rym: You can just watch it.

325
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,043
Rym: Follow us on the Internet.

326
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,264
Rym: We keep doing stuff.

327
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:06,546
Rym: We stream stuff.

328
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:07,447
Rym: We're making stuff.

329
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,328
Rym: We keep making stuff.

330
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,650
Rym: This podcast is on the Internet.

331
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:16,345
Rym: And I feel like we should jump right into the review because we already have too much to say for one episode.

332
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,450
Rym: And I haven't even seen the last of these movies.

333
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:19,452
Scott: That's right.

334
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,638
Scott: So, Rym did not watch all four of these movies.

335
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,163
Scott: I watched... This is my strategy.

336
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:27,187
Scott: I remember we were at Otakon.

337
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,469
Scott: The last Otakon we went to was '09.

338
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,450
Rym: Yeah.

339
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,694
Scott: So, we were at an Otakon.

340
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,299
Scott: I forget if it was '08 or '09.

341
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,081
Scott: Someone can look it up.

342
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:37,650
Scott: And it was definitely one of the last two that we were at, for sure.

343
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,390
Scott: And they were showing the first Evangelion rebuild movie.

344
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,610
Rym: Evangelion 1.0, you are not alone.

345
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:46,591
Scott: Right.

346
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,375
Scott: So, they were showing it there, like U.S.

347
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:48,916
Scott: Premiere.

348
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:52,022
Scott: And I was like, at that moment, I said, "You know what?

349
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:53,906
Scott: There's going to be four of these things.

350
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,329
Scott: I've already seen the

351
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:55,570
Scott: show.".

352
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:56,814
Scott: And I said, "At that moment...".

353
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:57,938
Scott: I said, "Nah.

354
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,429
Scott: I'll wait until all four out and watch them all in one

355
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:01,610
Scott: go.".

356
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:01,970
Scott: Yep.

357
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:03,173
Rym: I had two thoughts there.

358
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,275
Rym: My first thought was that.

359
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:07,162
Rym: And my second thought was, "I've already seen Evangelion.

360
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:10,689
Rym: It's just going to be super fancy, like reanimated movies of the same

361
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:10,930
Rym: thing.".

362
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,636
Scott: I was not sure what I was thinking, because I peeked in.

363
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:15,999
Scott: I think I even peeked in the door.

364
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,222
Scott: And I saw scenes that I had seen already.

365
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:22,269
Scott: And I was like, "Oh, this is just going to be like a compilation, sort of HD remake

366
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,610
Scott: deal.".

367
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,278
Rym: That's what I thought.

368
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:23,784
Rym: And you know what?

369
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:24,270
Rym: That's fair.

370
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,750
Scott: That's what I thought at the time.

371
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,589
Rym: Because other than the last 30 seconds of that fucking movie, that is just what it is.

372
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:39,568
Scott: Well, I learned not long after that that it wasn't just an HD remake, because once the second one came out, right?

373
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,892
Rym: Yep.

374
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:44,799
Rym: So, that was 2007 in Japan that that movie came out.

375
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,267
Rym: So, Scott says in 2007, "I will wait until this is

376
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:48,528
Rym: done.".

377
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:49,330
Rym: A wise move.

378
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,390
Scott: Well, I don't know if 2007 was when they showed it in the US, though.

379
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,310
Rym: Well, so I'm going to go by the Japanese release dates, because it wasn't really...

380
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,530
Scott: Yeah, we don't know what date they showed it.

381
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,830
Rym: It was not released officially in North America until 2009.

382
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,084
Rym: But...

383
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:04,602
Scott: It must have been '09.

384
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:05,470
Scott: then it was at Otakon.

385
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,569
Rym: But '08 was the last Otakon we went to.

386
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:09,086
Scott: No, we went to Otakon '09.

387
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:09,976
Scott: Did we?

388
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:10,648
Rym: I don't think we did.

389
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:12,470
Scott: I think '09 was the last one.

390
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,010
Rym: '09 is the one where they kicked us off the staff because we refused to come.

391
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,187
Scott: I think I have a badge for '09.

392
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,860
Rym: I think '08 was the last one.

393
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:18,264
Rym: Anyway...

394
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:19,530
Scott: It doesn't matter.

395
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,486
Scott: I'll go by the Japanese years.

396
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,435
Rym: So, 2007.

397
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,730
Rym: We wisely agreed to wait until all four movies come out, then watch them all.

398
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,217
Rym: 2009.

399
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,286
Rym: The second movie comes out.

400
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,990
Rym: Way off the rails from the first movie, but we just keep waiting.

401
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:48,368
Scott: The reason I knew when things had gone off the rails is because I had started seeing pictures of this Ava pilot who was not in the show, not in any... It's like, "Oh, clearly they've changed a lot if there's a whole new freaking character in

402
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:48,649
Scott: there.".

403
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,950
Scott: 2012.

404
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,458
Scott: The third movie comes out.

405
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,256
Rym: So, 2012.

406
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,930
Rym: Nearly a decade ago, the third movie came out.

407
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,132
Rym: And the fourth movie came out this year in 2021.

408
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:02,676
Scott: Now, hold up.

409
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,408
Scott: There's an extra layer to this.

410
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,490
Scott: Not only were there four movies, but each movie sort of had two releases.

411
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:19,267
Scott: So, what they did is they released the movie quickly to the theater, and then they updated them a bit to fix them up.

412
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,230
Scott: Sort of like how a lot of times there'll be a TV anime, and then for the DVD release, they'll fix a lot of stuff.

413
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,910
Rym: Yep, they fixed a bunch of stuff, and they added a total of seven minutes to the runtime.

414
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,138
Scott: Right, so...

415
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,389
Rym: Across all four movies.

416
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,570
Scott: Right, so each of the four movies individually had two versions, and a slight, tiny upgrade.

417
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:47,449
Scott: It gets confusing because the names of the movies have version numbers in them.

418
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:55,811
Scott: But if you consider them all to just be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, they released 1.1, 2.1, 3.0, and 4.1.

419
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,859
Scott: So, you don't need to watch those .0 ones.

420
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:00,810
Scott: You only need to watch the beefed up ones.

421
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:07,250
Scott: I don't even know what the differences are because I've never watched those unpolished ones.

422
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,409
Scott: I've only watched the four.

423
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:14,690
Scott: And if you go on Amazon Prime, which is where you can watch this in the United States for free if you have Prime, so not free.

424
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:18,500
Scott: You will just see those upgraded ones.

425
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,925
Scott: You will not see those original ones.

426
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:20,487
Scott: They don't exist.

427
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,865
Scott: They're like Star Wars, not Special Edition.

428
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:24,550
Scott: They're just gone.

429
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,870
Rym: Now, what I will say is we're going to review these like a normal anime review.

430
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,890
Rym: We're not going to spoil stuff other than I hinted at it at the beginning.

431
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,330
Rym: We're going to spoil broad themes of Evangelion, obviously, like what the show's about and stuff.

432
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,507
Scott: We might spoil the original TV show from how many years ago?

433
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:42,648
Scott: The 90s?

434
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:43,793
Scott: Yup.

435
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,148
Rym: But we're not going to spoil anything materially.

436
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:47,530
Rym: Don't worry.

437
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:56,890
Rym: Like we used to do in ancient times, we're going to do a separate, completely spoiler-filled Final Thoughts episode because I've only seen three.

438
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,506
Rym: I have not seen the end of this yet.

439
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:01,250
Rym: Scott has.

440
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,410
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why you're even qualified to have this show if you haven't seen the fourth one.

441
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,054
Scott: I saw them all.

442
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:07,269
Scott: I watched as soon as they came out.

443
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:12,230
Scott: That weekend, I watched the first two on Saturday and the second two on Sunday, and I might do it again.

444
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,820
Rym: Well, I'm going to watch them all again.

445
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:15,222
Rym: Good lord.

446
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,090
Rym: Actually, I went back and watched scenes.

447
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,450
Scott: I might not watch the first one again.

448
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,490
Rym: I don't need to watch the first one again, but I did go back and watch scenes from the original Evangelion to compare to the first movie.

449
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,685
Rym: And, uh, yeah, I have a lot to say.

450
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:31,081
Scott: I don't know how- Alright, well, let's start there.

451
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,190
Scott: Let's start with the first movie.

452
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,083
Scott: So the first movie is literally just the TV series.

453
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,808
Scott: Evangelion episodes one through- Yup.

454
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,059
Scott: I forget which one.

455
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,650
Scott: The sniper rifle one, I want to say?

456
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,216
Rym: Yeah, it goes up to about the sniper rifle.

457
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,546
Rym: Actually, no, it doesn't even quite get to the sniper rifle one.

458
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,390
Rym: It's like right there.

459
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,530
Scott: No, I think the sniper rifle is included in the first movie.

460
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,178
Rym: Yes, you're right.

461
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:51,443
Rym: You're right.

462
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:51,790
Rym: Never mind.

463
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,650
Scott: Yes.

464
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:00,930
Scott: So if you take just Evangelion, the TV show, from episode one up through whatever episode the sniper rifle is, you know, the famous one, right?

465
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,481
Scott: The whatever it's called, Plasma Cannon.

466
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,550
Scott: I forget what they called it, right?

467
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,288
Rym: Positron Cannon.

468
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,613
Scott: That's the one.

469
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,790
Scott: The Positron Cannon episode, the famous episode.

470
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:14,181
Scott: And you edit it down, you know, to only- because think about it, those episodes are what?

471
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:16,806
Scott: 20 to 30 minutes each times.

472
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:19,210
Scott: maybe five, six, seven?

473
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,590
Scott: So your- it gets edited down just to the important scenes.

474
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,553
Rym: Oh, I found a listing.

475
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:29,410
Rym: It covers up until about like episode six of the original show.

476
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:29,931
Scott: Episode six.

477
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:35,086
Scott: Okay, so about six times 25 would be 150.

478
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:36,470
Scott: How many minutes long is the movie?

479
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,450
Rym: A hundred and one minutes.

480
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,770
Scott: So you're cutting out 40 minutes basically.

481
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:58,349
Rym: And I will say this, my only complaint about this entire rebuild is, and it's not even really an important complaint, is that the first movie, up until the very end, loses the atmosphere of the original show in that- Not enough cicada scenes.

482
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:09,270
Rym: Yeah, because it's so condensed, it's almost just like a greatest hits of like, it is shot for shot, all the really iconic scenes from those first six episodes, beautifully animated.

483
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:18,650
Rym: But it like skips all the like side character building and all the atmosphere and it feels just rushed and fast.

484
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:27,290
Rym: But at the same time, I don't have a real complaint about that because what it really did for me is just remind me of, oh yeah, that's what happened to Neva.

485
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,715
Scott: I think that was the purpose of it.

486
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,839
Scott: It's not, you know, a replacement for the TV show.

487
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,490
Scott: It's a, all right, we're making these other three movies and we're expecting you not to go and watch the TV show again.

488
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:48,461
Scott: But you've seen the TV show before, so watch this first movie and we're just going to refresh you.

489
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:53,690
Scott: so you're where you need to be to watch the next three rebuild movies.

490
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,277
Scott: Also, while we're here, right, it's like some nostalgia.

491
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:02,043
Scott: You're seeing all these iconic famous scenes that we've kept in.

492
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:05,949
Scott: We've edited out cicada noise scenes and things of that nature, right?

493
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,164
Scott: And we, you know, it's really this plot wise, you're getting everything.

494
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,250
Scott: There's almost no changes whatsoever.

495
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,771
Scott: You're kind

496
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:33,890
Rym: of getting more earlier because the difference, the main differences, other than the big difference we'll talk about at the end, are that it focuses more, like it shows you more viscera and blood details of the angels, which is notable for the rest of the movies, the blood.

497
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:45,869
Rym: Two, it pretty explicitly tells you Sele's deal and a lot of what's going on way earlier than that even comes up in the actual original show.

498
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:59,490
Rym: Like, it's like, oh yeah, human instrumentality, Sele, like, it just kind of tells you a lot of this stuff really explicitly way earlier and it completely skips anything related to the computers.

499
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:05,219
Scott: But otherwise, it's pretty much mentioned the computers occasionally throughout the movies.

500
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,510
Scott: But if you haven't seen the TV, you might not know what they're talking about when they talk about the computers.

501
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,810
Scott: But yeah, the whole computer thing just edited out entirely.

502
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:26,970
Rym: And I guess the one thing I'll say as a review first is that I would not recommend watching these movies without watching the original show first, partly because the original show is brilliant and a very important piece of animation.

503
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:28,500
Rym: It is worth watching.

504
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,647
Rym: I'm going to link to...

505
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,069
Scott: Even if you don't like it.

506
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:38,050
Rym: Yeah, like, if you love Evangelion, if you hate Evangelion, there's a reason everyone keeps talking about Evangelion and we're doing this show right now.

507
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,750
Rym: The show is important, it is worth watching, and whatever you take away from it, you're going to take away from it.

508
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:53,830
Rym: And if you watch this first movie, it really removes a lot of the things that set you in the mood for the rest of Evangelion.

509
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,069
Rym: You'll miss out on a lot of why that show was good.

510
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:03,226
Scott: But if you are someone who's just not ever going to watch the TV show, it's like, I guess this can sort of get you up to speed.

511
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,630
Scott: It's going to get the job done.

512
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:16,250
Rym: Also, after the first movie, the rest of the movies, the rebuilds, they're faster in terms of plot that happens, but they also have all the atmosphere and everything back.

513
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,270
Rym: The pacing is more like Evangelion after that first movie.

514
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:21,627
Rym: A little bit.

515
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:25,430
Rym: We'll get to that, especially in the second movie and the third movie and the vibe.

516
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:31,350
Rym: But then, at the very end of this movie, I'm watching it, not knowing a lot about the rebuilds.

517
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,970
Scott: You're watching the first movie and literally everything that happens is like, you know what's going to happen because you've seen the TV show, it's just the TV show.

518
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,130
Rym: I was literally just there like, alright, now I'm going to see this scene, now I'm going to see this scene.

519
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,530
Rym: He's going to lay there in the bed with his hand over his eye, listening to that tape.

520
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:52,970
Scott: There's one scene that is a scene from the TV show, but it happens way later in the TV show.

521
00:33:53,832 --> 00:34:00,450
Scott: They put it in the middle of this movie, so it's a slight time change in terms of when that event happens.

522
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,810
Rym: And that event is very important to the show.

523
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:10,570
Scott: It's an important event, but other than that, everything else is pretty much lockstep.

524
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:17,550
Scott: You know, we're talking frame by frame, the only difference being the aspect ratio and the resolution and whatnot, right, because it's HD.

525
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:18,895
Rym: And all the blood stuff.

526
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:22,290
Rym: Until the very end of this movie.

527
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,909
Scott: We're talking like seconds, like the final seconds of the first movie.

528
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:34,050
Rym: Like suddenly, it is just like, oh, by the way, everything after this moment is complete batshit.

529
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,181
Rym: This isn't the Evangelion you know at all.

530
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:37,550
Rym: Here's a bunch of new characters.

531
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:46,330
Rym: Here's a character who you should not know about, literally on the moon, looking down at Earth.

532
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,909
Rym: And he says some stuff.

533
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,129
Scott: And is surrounded by some stuff.

534
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,190
Rym: Yup, some stuff that if you've seen Evangelion and you haven't seen these movies, it is hard.

535
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,089
Rym: All you can react to that is, oh my God.

536
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:05,930
Rym: And if we had watched this movie when it first came out, we wouldn't have been able to respond to that for years.

537
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,390
Scott: Right, it's like what the hell was going on there, right?

538
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,830
Scott: That final few seconds scene in no way fits, right?

539
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,970
Scott: It's like everything they've showed you is something you've seen before.

540
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:25,690
Scott: And then they show you something that doesn't fit at all with any of the end of Evangelion movies, TV shows, like anything, right?

541
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,390
Rym: Like we're talking, I don't think this will spoil anything material.

542
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:39,910
Rym: You see like a bunch of Spears of Longinus and a character on the moon and a bunch of other Avas and all this ridiculous nonsense that you cannot parse.

543
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,050
Scott: Right, it would be like if you're watching, you know, just to stick with Anno's faves, right?

544
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,450
Scott: Let's say you're watching like a Godzilla movie, right?

545
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,590
Scott: And it's like, okay, Godzilla's smashing the Tokyo, the humans are finding a way to stop him, right?

546
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:53,589
Scott: Okay, cool.

547
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,950
Scott: And then at the end, you know, it's like, you know, the movie's over, right?

548
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,689
Scott: And you're like, okay, that was a Godzilla movie.

549
00:36:00,111 --> 00:36:05,990
Scott: And then they show you like the bottom of the ocean where 10 Godzillas live in a house or something.

550
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,485
Scott: It's like, what?

551
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,829
Rym: And one of those Godzillas is like talking in English and doing something strange.

552
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,308
Scott: It's like, what?

553
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,869
Scott: It doesn't fit in any way with any Godzillas come before.

554
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,250
Rym: Or like that Godzilla, like opens a gate and a submarine comes out.

555
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,150
Rym: And in that submarine are a bunch of little Godzillas or some nonsense.

556
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:28,350
Scott: So after that, the second movie.

557
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:51,390
Rym: Yeah, after that, the best way I can describe this is imagine the same characters plus new characters who are mostly the same people, but the events that happen around them are radically different and happen in a different order or two different people or four different reasons.

558
00:36:52,232 --> 00:37:06,788
Rym: Like I'd almost imagine an alternate universe where like radically different things happen, but the characters react to those events the way you would expect those characters from the original show to react had those events happened in the original show.

559
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:14,850
Rym: And the moral is like, it's the same story, the same core, but with a very different journey.

560
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,230
Scott: Right.

561
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:24,770
Scott: So this, I've talked about this before, I think with some other media, the same idea that, you know, let's say you have a story, right?

562
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,890
Scott: And you're telling a story about capitalism bad, right?

563
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,850
Scott: So you have a story, right?

564
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,630
Scott: And so you can tell that same story with the same message of capitalism bad.

565
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:46,449
Scott: It doesn't matter at the, like at the ending, you could have capitalism kill the good character or at the end, you could have socialism save the good character, right?

566
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:54,230
Scott: And those are completely different endings, completely different things happen, but you're saying the same thing, right?

567
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:57,390
Scott: Even with drastically different events in the plot.

568
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,889
Rym: Which almost serve to reinforce each other.

569
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:00,932
Scott: Right.

570
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:08,927
Scott: So here it's like you're Evangelion, same exact message as original Evangelion, mostly like 90% plus, right?

571
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,750
Scott: Hedgehog's dilemma, all that biz, right?

572
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:24,749
Scott: It's saying the same things, even though the events that are unfolding with the same characters, you know, same voice actors in most cases, all cases, I don't even get right.

573
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,217
Rym: They sound right.

574
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,289
Rym: That's all that matters to me.

575
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,419
Scott: Same personality, same director, right?

576
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:34,150
Scott: Same all this stuff, same designs, mostly same designs.

577
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:43,570
Scott: Telling the same effective story meaning wise, but the events that unfold are tremendously different.

578
00:38:43,970 --> 00:39:01,490
Rym: So like a non-spoilery example, other than that, the one of the core, like I'll link to the episode where we talked about like what Evangelion was about in depth, but it has the like physical story of the events that happen, but the moral in the message is mostly around the hedgehog's dilemma.

579
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,010
Rym: The idea that humans are separate beings.

580
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:09,770
Rym: We can communicate with each other, but we can't communicate what's in our truest heart perfectly.

581
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,532
Rym: Like we can't.

582
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:14,110
Rym: I cannot convey the truest thoughts I have in my brain to Scott.

583
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,110
Rym: Well, I can convey a simulacra of that, but they're not the same.

584
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:25,369
Rym: The closer people get to each other, the more potential they have to hurt each other, but also the more potential they have to help each other.

585
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:35,370
Rym: And the show just explores this concept almost to the extreme, absurd conclusions that this conversation could have.

586
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:44,980
Rym: So imagine in the first show, you're watching the show and you're thinking, "Fucking Shinji, if you would just talk to someone even once about your feelings, everything would have been

587
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:45,284
Rym: different.".

588
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,815
Rym: So now watch these movies.

589
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:50,190
Rym: Oh, Shinji talked to someone about his feelings.

590
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:52,160
Rym: Everything is really different.

591
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:53,950
Rym: It's the exact same message.

592
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,800
Scott: Yeah, exactly right.

593
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:56,730
Scott: That's exactly right.

594
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,310
Rym: Misato, you could have gone into that room and said something instead of saying nothing.

595
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,010
Rym: Gendo, you could have praised your fucking son once, maybe.

596
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,324
Rym: And yes, that's true.

597
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:07,190
Rym: Everything's different.

598
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:14,090
Rym: It validates everything you thought about the original show, and it shows how, yeah, the events are very different, but the message is the same.

599
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,234
Scott: Yeah, you could just show.

600
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:26,910
Scott: it's like, if you do this, if the show is trying to tell you do X, you can send the message of do X either by showing someone not doing X and failing or doing X and succeeding.

601
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:38,230
Scott: So it's a rebuild in that way, and that last time they showed not doing X and failing, and this time they'll show doing X and succeeding, but the message is still, "You should have done X," right?

602
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,784
Scott: Oh, and it's sort of like, "Look, they did X and it worked.

603
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,348
Scott: See, I told

604
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:41,468
Scott: you.".

605
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:57,250
Scott: So I think this is really interesting in that, you know, usually when people redo movies or any kind of story in any medium, right, you're usually getting a sequel or a prequel, which this is not.

606
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,350
Scott: This is not a sequel or a prequel, right?

607
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:08,150
Scott: It is not a HD remake where you're just doing the same thing again, only fancier colors, right?

608
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,630
Scott: And it's like a Star Wars special.

609
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:16,750
Rym: It is hard to express how radically different everything is after the first movie.

610
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:17,732
Scott: Right.

611
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:18,510
Scott: It's a rebuild.

612
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:28,170
Scott: And so in the rebuild, the overall thing that makes it different is that is it good, right?

613
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,710
Scott: Is it better than the original?

614
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:35,690
Scott: It's not like a superhero comics where it's like, "Okay, alternate universe," right?

615
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:36,941
Scott: It's like, "No, this is

616
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:37,445
Scott: canon.".

617
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,525
Scott: And so the TV show is also canon.

618
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:41,350
Scott: It's all canon.

619
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,670
Rym: In fact, based on at least the first three movies, "canon" with a capital C, and I'll leave it at that.

620
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:52,870
Scott: Everything that happened in the TV show happened and everything in this happened, even though it's not a sequel.

621
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,570
Scott: And that'll only make sense if you've seen it all, which is why it's okay to just say that.

622
00:41:58,732 --> 00:41:59,830
Scott: It's not spoiling anything.

623
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:08,830
Scott: But whether the movies... I actually like the TV show way more than the movies still, even having seen all four of the movies.

624
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,490
Rym: But I liked the movies nearly equally.

625
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:21,570
Scott: But what I think is great about the rebuild and why I think maybe someone else will attempt a rebuild of something else at some point.

626
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,348
Scott: I don't know if any... I can't think of anyone who has.

627
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:35,150
Rym: The nearest thing I can think of, but it's such a poor analogy because these tended to be garbage, was there was a number of 90s anime that had an OAV that was very popular.

628
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:42,270
Rym: And then they would make an alternate universe where they tell the same story again as a longer TV show to explore an alternate set of events.

629
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:44,450
Scott: Yeah, but that's an alternate universe.

630
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:48,760
Rym: And also, they didn't really have the same messages.

631
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,990
Rym: They were mostly just bad and watered down.

632
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,920
Scott: You know what's comparable?

633
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:53,690
Scott: You know what's comparable?

634
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,070
Scott: Zelda's comparable.

635
00:42:56,612 --> 00:43:02,290
Scott: Zelda games is like, yeah, there was a book that had some sequence of timelines or whatever in it or something.

636
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,249
Scott: But all the Zelda games are mostly separate, taking place in different...

637
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,009
Rym: But they explore a very similar story, a very similar universe, a very similar...

638
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,950
Scott: Every Zelda game is sort of like Rebuild of Legend of Zelda, in a way.

639
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:17,737
Scott: And the existence...

640
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,231
Rym: Even though I like the TV show more than the movies... Zelda 2 is canonically an explicit sequel of Zelda 1.

641
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:26,526
Rym: But anyway...

642
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:37,210
Scott: The existence of these movies, the fact that they're there, actually, somehow, makes the TV show better.

643
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:37,762
Rym: Yes!

644
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,150
Scott: It's like, the TV show is better because the movie's here.

645
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:55,530
Scott: It's the opposite of what nerds complain about, which obviously isn't true, is that, oh, you ruined the thing I like by making a new thing, which can't possibly happen because you could just pretend the new thing isn't there.

646
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,534
Rym: It's almost put me into a loop.

647
00:43:56,715 --> 00:44:00,330
Rym: Watching these movies, I really want to go back and watch the entire show again.

648
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:06,030
Rym: But if I watch the entire show again, I feel like I'm going to think, oh, now I want to watch the movies again.

649
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:16,150
Scott: It's like, if these movies were, say, garbage, completely awful, the TV show would still be as good as it was on its own.

650
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,950
Rym: And we could just ignore the movies, like we do for those other Indiana Jones movies.

651
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,690
Scott: That original artwork cannot be harmed, but it's not easy to elevate it either.

652
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:46,930
Scott: The movies, even if you don't think they're good, even if you don't like them, or don't like them as much as the TV show, I like them just not as much as the TV show, they somehow have the power to, if you have seen them, the original TV show now means more.

653
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,850
Scott: It has become elevated in a way because there was a rebuild that happened later.

654
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,435
Rym: And I'd say it's from two angles.

655
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:59,530
Rym: On one hand, it reinforces the underlying themes of the original show.

656
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:06,450
Rym: So you watch the original show again, and you can compare all these different paths and really internalize the meta message.

657
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:17,670
Rym: But also, the movie explores many of the worldbuilding and science fiction aspects of the show that were footnotes in the show and vice versa.

658
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,357
Rym: I'll give an example that's not super spoiler-ly.

659
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:28,201
Rym: In the show, there's a moment where you find out there's a nerve base in the US, and there's an accident there, and it just disappears.

660
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:29,205
Rym: It blows up.

661
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,350
Rym: There's a big disaster.

662
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:32,717
Scott: It's like a footnote.

663
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:34,410
Scott: Isn't that in the lava episode, I want to say?

664
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,052
Rym: I think so.

665
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:36,920
Rym: I forget exactly, but I think you're right.

666
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,429
Rym: So that just happens, and characters react to it.

667
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,619
Rym: But you don't get an episode where they go and investigate it.

668
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:48,490
Rym: In the movies, that happens, and they go fucking deal with it.

669
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:56,741
Scott: Yeah, because the original TV show has these hints that early in the TV show, they deliver AV unit 3.

670
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:57,423
Scott: It's delivered.

671
00:46:02,814 --> 00:46:03,518
Rym: From Europe.

672
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:05,930
Rym: Well, O2 from Europe.

673
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,041
Rym: And then 3.

674
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,631
Scott: Anyway, it's unit 2.

675
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:11,050
Rym: It's unit 2, but it's the third one.

676
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,936
Scott: But yeah, it gets delivered.

677
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:17,570
Scott: But they never show you what the hell is... Kaji comes from somewhere else.

678
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:25,330
Scott: In the end of Evangelion, spoilers, all those white ones show up.

679
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,915
Scott: It's like, where did they come from?

680
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:34,230
Scott: The movies actually go and show you what's going on around other parts of the world.

681
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,978
Rym: You see Kaji doing his spy shit.

682
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:40,710
Rym: You see the place where the things come from.

683
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:45,068
Rym: I'm trying not to talk about that, but the place where the things come from.

684
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:54,910
Scott: There's a lot of blanks that got filled in, and it's not new information, because all that stuff was in the TV show.

685
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,510
Rym: And that stuff was not material to the message or even the plot.

686
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:08,510
Scott: Right, but because it matters for the plot of these movies, which is a different plot, they're now showing you all those things this time, before you didn't see them.

687
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:15,750
Rym: So you get to flesh out the physical events from the show and the movie, and you also get to flesh out the themes.

688
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:22,813
Rym: But the moments that gave me the chills watching the movies were... There are iconic scenes in the show.

689
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:33,550
Rym: The one I'm thinking of very specifically is when the skull-faced alien gets near terminal dogma and is staring Masato in the face.

690
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:39,049
Rym: That scene in the show is one of the most haunting scenes in the entire show to me.

691
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:52,690
Rym: And that exact same scene, with very different events leading up to it and very different events happening after it, but the two worlds almost converge into that scene being identical in the second movie.

692
00:47:53,810 --> 00:48:03,710
Rym: And the fact that the two stories I've seen intersected so perfectly and then diverge again at that moment, that stuck with me.

693
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:14,530
Rym: And that is how the whole of these two sets of tellings of the story, the episodes versus the movies, are greater than the sum of their parts.

694
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:29,250
Scott: So the second movie, unlike the first movie, while it's pretty much all stuff that did not happen in the TV show, it still is sort of like almost slightly altered events from the TV show.

695
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:36,650
Scott: There are things that happen in the TV show that kind of happen in the second movie differently, mixed up a little bit.

696
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,902
Rym: Some things from later in the show happen then.

697
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:41,370
Rym: Brand new things happen.

698
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:51,949
Rym: But the atmosphere is different, because the thing about these movies that's so striking is that each movie has a radically different vibe and feeling and mood.

699
00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:02,490
Rym: The second movie really focuses on the scale of what humanity has built, but also the fact that Earth is teeming with life.

700
00:49:03,312 --> 00:49:10,950
Rym: This positive optimism of humans were trying to save the world, and all the atmospheric scenes, it's not the cicadas.

701
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:15,589
Scott: That's what comes from the old robot shows that Evangelion is one of.

702
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:28,389
Rym: But instead of all the cicadas and the emptiness that is so pervasive in the original show, you see a world filled with people, teeming with life, going about their days, trying to survive and rebuild.

703
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:34,950
Rym: And I think that's really epitomized by the scene where Kaji takes them on the field trip with the ocean stuff.

704
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:45,370
Rym: And then it all kind of goes to shit, and the third movie is more like the empty times, coupled with things that are very hard to talk about without spoiling huge things.

705
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,730
Scott: So the third movie basically has no overlap with the original TV show whatsoever.

706
00:49:51,431 --> 00:50:00,929
Scott: It's like the first movie, you're on the TV side, the second movie is sort of like this border space, and the third movie is completely in a new thing.

707
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:06,698
Rym: The second movie is off the rails, but you're still in the same universe.

708
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:14,789
Rym: You're on a train and the scenery is very different, but you're still like, "Alright, I see how this track came from the track I was

709
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:15,009
Rym: on.".

710
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,770
Rym: And then after that, it's just like the train has fallen off a cliff and is in space somehow.

711
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:30,690
Scott: Right, and so there's four movies, and somehow, even though these are four anime movies, you know they're going to be four of them, they're in a series.

712
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:38,950
Scott: Usually, when you are going to make an anime series, even Evangelion, you save your terrible secret of space for the last few episodes.

713
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:46,730
Rym: No, the terrible secret of space goes beyond what you would have possibly ever expected before the end of the second movie.

714
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,151
Scott: Right.

715
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:55,390
Scott: Here, it's like each individual movie goes terrible secret of space at the end, even though the first one only does a little bit.

716
00:50:57,152 --> 00:51:02,590
Scott: And it's like, how was the end of the third movie not the end of the whole thing?

717
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:12,970
Rym: I mean, the end of the second movie, but for something that happens in the final seconds of it, could have been the end of Evangelion.

718
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,709
Scott: Yeah, it could have just been.

719
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,061
Rym: And I say that literally as in, remember the movie end of Evangelion?

720
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:22,730
Rym: Like, yup, sure, that is literally the end, game over.

721
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:30,710
Scott: Yeah, it's like the events that happen in each of the movies are so climactic, they could be, you know, it's just like four ends.

722
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:38,230
Scott: It's like the power, you know, usually animes save up their power for the end and then release the full blast.

723
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:44,103
Rym: This is more like Promare, the movie, where it just keeps escalating and escalating and escalating.

724
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:46,910
Rym: It's like a song that just keeps swelling and no point dies down.

725
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:53,069
Scott: This is the thing out of Revolver and there's four bullets in the Revolver and they're all maximum power and they go one, two, three, four.

726
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:56,595
Scott: But, Rym hasn't seen the fourth one.

727
00:51:57,437 --> 00:52:03,890
Scott: The fourth one, so a Revolver usually has six shots, so let's say the first movie is one bullet comes out.

728
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:06,455
Scott: Maybe it grazes you.

729
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:10,650
Scott: The second and third movies, there's just one bullet each and they hit you.

730
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,930
Rym: Like right in the forehead.

731
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:19,010
Scott: And then the fourth movie is all three remaining shots come out at once.

732
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:27,030
Scott: The fourth movie is like too much for a human being that can process Evangelion.

733
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:29,676
Rym: I'll put it this way.

734
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:39,065
Rym: After having only seen two, I was messaging Scott like a while ago and then again I was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have to do like a whole separate Final Thoughts because I have too much to say so

735
00:52:39,085 --> 00:52:39,145
Rym: far.".

736
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,847
Rym: And then Scott was like, "Yeah, you haven't even seen the fourth

737
00:52:42,968 --> 00:52:43,029
Rym: one.".

738
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,737
Scott: You still haven't seen the fourth one.

739
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,445
Scott: You really don't know anything.

740
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:47,390
Scott: the fuck is going on.

741
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,909
Rym: I already think I have like hours of things to say so far.

742
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:55,980
Scott: Well, the last one will give you a year of things to say.

743
00:52:56,964 --> 00:52:58,690
Scott: Or maybe you won't be able to say a damn thing.

744
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,997
Scott: You'll be like, "Well, I got nothing to say.

745
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:02,823
Scott: That shut me up.

746
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:03,787
Scott: It's so

747
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:04,248
Scott: powerful.".

748
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:19,910
Rym: But I really enjoy these movies and it is hard to think of any media I've encountered where this like two different angles intersecting, two different views of the same story complement each other so well.

749
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:30,390
Scott: But yeah, this is, you know, thankfully, I guess, you know, it's the end of the real end of Evangelion, right?

750
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,156
Scott: There will be no more Evas after this.

751
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:35,145
Scott: You know, the mangas, I think, are done, right?

752
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:36,550
Scott: TV shows done, movies are done.

753
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:41,690
Scott: You know, they're gonna never make any more Evangelion anything ever again.

754
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:44,706
Rym: This is no more Evas.

755
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:45,130
Scott: The end.

756
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:52,410
Rym: So I will say, I read a lot of the manga, but I never finished it because it wasn't done at the time I was reading it, which was a long goddamn time ago.

757
00:53:54,231 --> 00:54:06,949
Rym: What I remember about the manga was that it felt like the show, but with a lot more context and it went way deeper into everything, but still very close, stuck very closely to the show.

758
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:20,290
Rym: So I can't say yet, having not seen the fourth movie, if the manga is like a necessary part of this triptych or if the show and the movies together are like the thing.

759
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:24,138
Rym: And you haven't read the manga at all, I don't think so.

760
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:25,099
Scott: Nope.

761
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,422
Rym: The manga is real good.

762
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:34,220
Rym: Like, you get a lot of Futsuki, you get a lot of Kaji, you get a lot, like the watermelon scenes are way, way longer.

763
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,110
Rym: Characters conversations are just real and long.

764
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:39,380
Rym: But again, I didn't finish the manga, so.

765
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,350
Scott: Oh yeah, I guess just, you know, superficially, character wise, right?

766
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:47,980
Scott: The movies have more Futsuki Friday.

767
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,660
Rym: Yep, I like Futsuki a lot.

768
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:53,259
Scott: They have less Ritsuko going on.

769
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,740
Rym: Yep, like the show really explores Ritsuko and the Magi, and that is not really a thing in these movies.

770
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,399
Rym: Like it's a thing, but it's not like a major...

771
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,000
Scott: They mention the three Magi quite a few times, but they don't tell you what they are in the movies, they don't show the plot around them.

772
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:13,740
Rym: So think of it this way, in the movies, the three Magi are like what one of the nerve bases disappearing in the show is.

773
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,700
Rym: It's like, oh, that happens, people react to it, it's part of the fiction of the universe, but it's not explored deeper.

774
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:24,980
Scott: Yep, and I think that's why Ritsuko has less, you know, action.

775
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,000
Scott: Kaji in the movies is somewhat similar to the TV show where he comes in big, right, as a huge part.

776
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,437
Scott: He's like, it's Kaji, the Kaji stuff, and then not, right?

777
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:36,980
Scott: And then he's done.

778
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:39,360
Scott: It's like, alright, that was the Kaji part.

779
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:39,697
Rym: Yep.

780
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:43,980
Rym: It's hard to say.

781
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:46,397
Scott: And then there's new characters that weren't even in the...

782
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:54,880
Rym: I guess all this, one thing I can say is that before I watched these, I remember seeing the new character and thinking, really?

783
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,480
Rym: You just put another boob girl in and that's okay, Anna, whatever, but I like that character a lot, that character works well.

784
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:04,620
Scott: It's hard.

785
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,360
Scott: The character is there for a reason, I guess.

786
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:08,029
Scott: Yep.

787
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:18,900
Rym: It really makes a scene at the end of the second movie work and make sense and give you a lot of context for what happens.

788
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:26,920
Rym: Like, imagine a character who does the thing by accident versus a character who was trying to do the thing on purpose.

789
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:34,359
Rym: Which, in a way, contextualizes what Kaji was up to in the original show but kind of failed at.

790
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:41,180
Scott: Anyway, so we'll talk about this again once Rym has seen the fourth movie so he knows what he's talking about.

791
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,020
Rym: Also, I've really, like, it's hard to, like, we're dancing around stuff a lot because I want to talk specifics.

792
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,789
Scott: I don't know why you just don't go watch the fourth movie.

793
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:48,835
Scott: It just took me two days.

794
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:49,700
Scott: I don't know what you're waiting for.

795
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:50,938
Scott: It's sitting right there.

796
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,580
Scott: I'm busy.

797
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:52,875
Scott: It doesn't cost you anything.

798
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:53,260
Scott: You have Amazon.

799
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,060
Rym: I'm still mulling over the other ones, so... I'm mulling.

800
00:56:58,142 --> 00:56:59,760
Scott: You can watch them as many times as you need.

801
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,147
Rym: Oh, they're getting watched again.

802
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:03,119
Rym: The only one I'm not going to watch again is the first one.

803
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:04,999
Scott: Bring a notepad if you need to.

804
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:12,120
Rym: So, yeah, my advice to you, if you have never seen any Evangelion, go watch the original show.

805
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,880
Rym: Like, goddamn, there's a reason people keep talking about it.

806
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:22,276
Scott: And try not to, you know, it's like, yeah, you could watch it on Netflix if you have to, but really, you want to find... I have, you know, DVD...

807
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,752
Rym: There's a platinum, like, DVD release.

808
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,160
Rym: that is, like, the one to watch.

809
00:57:26,761 --> 00:57:31,920
Scott: That's the one because it has the director's cuts which have a few key scenes in some later episodes.

810
00:57:32,442 --> 00:57:36,980
Scott: And you have the original openers and enders with the Japanese audio, the English song...

811
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:53,620
Rym: And those key scenes, while they're not strictly necessary, they basically... There's a couple of scenes in that director's cut that, if you're watching the show for the first time, you'll go, "Oh, I get it," about some moderately critical plot points of, like, why Sele and certain things are doing what they're doing.

812
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:57,360
Rym: That is a little bit more obtuse without those scenes.

813
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,920
Rym: Like, still sus-outable, but...

814
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:03,780
Scott: They're quite helpful scenes that have been added.

815
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,320
Scott: So, yeah, that's the ideal Evangelion TV to watch.

816
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,260
Scott: And then, yeah, after that, now you can watch these movies.

817
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,480
Scott: You can watch these movies without watching the TV show, as if it's its own thing.

818
00:58:15,803 --> 00:58:16,178
Rym: I wouldn't.

819
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:21,578
Scott: But, yeah, it's like, I think, A, they're not as good as the TV show, right?

820
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:27,160
Scott: And B, a lot of stuff is just gonna, like, just be a miss.

821
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,748
Scott: You're gonna be like,

822
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,992
Scott: "What?".

823
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,468
Rym: Yup.

824
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:30,677
Scott: What the heck is that?

825
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:38,708
Scott: I understand, like, you know, the meaning of a lot of the things that happen in these movies, even though it's not like.

826
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,800
Scott: there's some, you know, prerequisite knowledge.

827
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,560
Scott: You can't follow what's happening.

828
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,320
Scott: You know, they do stand alone.

829
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:46,792
Rym: Yup.

830
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,768
Rym: But there's a difference between "What the fuck was

831
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:50,209
Rym: that?"

832
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,299
Rym: versus "Why the fuck did the Spear of Longinus

833
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:53,560
Rym: appear?".

834
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:55,362
Scott: Well, it's more like.

835
00:58:55,382 --> 00:59:05,100
Scott: the importance and meaning of what you're seeing only makes sense in contrast against the original TV show.

836
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,280
Rym: I think that's a very important point.

837
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,220
Rym: The contrast between the two is a huge part of why they complement each other so well.

838
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,797
Scott: Right.

839
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,680
Scott: So, it's like, if you watch the movies, you know, it's sort of like watching, like, a, alone, and you've never seen the TV show ever.

840
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,160
Scott: It's like watching a silhouette play.

841
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:26,980
Scott: It's like, yeah, you can follow who the characters are and what's happening and hear all the dialogue and you know what happened.

842
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,300
Scott: But you're just seeing, like, the black outline.

843
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:38,000
Scott: If you've seen the real TV show, now, even if you're looking at the silhouette, it's all filled in because you know what the hell everything is.

844
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:38,475
Rym: Yup.

845
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,060
Rym: So, yeah, we've gone on pretty long just reviewing these without spoiling anything.

846
00:59:44,203 --> 00:59:45,180
Rym: So, stay tuned.

847
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:51,020
Rym: We'll record our, like, super long spoiler episode probably without news or anything because we'll need some time.

848
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:52,479
Rym: And, yeah, watch these.

849
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,438
Scott: We might need to do two.

850
00:59:53,701 --> 00:59:53,989
Scott: One for...

851
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,556
Rym: Yeah.

852
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:55,577
Rym: Four.

853
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:56,740
Rym: Well, three.

854
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,680
Scott: See how much material you get from that fourth movie.

855
00:59:59,086 --> 00:59:59,152
Rym: Yup.

856
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:04,299
Rym: Uh, yeah, I don't know what else we can say except you should watch these.

857
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,480
Scott: Yeah, of course.

858
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:08,060
Scott: It's an animated movie.

859
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,598
Scott: Full length.

860
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:09,299
Scott: Four of them.

861
01:00:10,381 --> 01:00:12,113
Rym: And it's not a sequel, so...

862
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,579
Scott: No, it's not.

863
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:13,865
Rym: No.

864
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,150
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

865
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:27,328
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

866
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:32,690
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

867
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,610
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

868
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:40,370
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

872
01:00:51,450 --> 01:01:26,750
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are And uh, right now, I leave you with something that you really should have seen coming.

873
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,640
Scott: Congratulations!

874
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,083
Scott: Thank you all.
