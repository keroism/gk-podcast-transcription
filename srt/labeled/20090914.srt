00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,160
Rym: Hey, it's Monday September 14th, and this is GeekNights tonight virtual private networking.

2
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,926
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:31,995
Scott: This is a problem at my work.

4
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:37,510
Scott: Is that there's three tech guys, and we're all non picky, so we'll eat anywhere.

5
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:39,966
Rym: That's kind of the greater problem of the FRC.

6
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:40,530
Rym: Where do you want to eat?

7
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:48,077
Rym: And then because we're also open we always end up deferring to the choices of like the one picky guy Yeah, and so it's all about.

8
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:48,439
Scott: you know.

9
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:51,250
Scott: so we go and we just start walking around and we're like where do we eat?

10
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,754
Rym: Walking around looking around.

11
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,343
Scott: so I got some sushi up another sushi places like you eat outside.

12
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,967
Scott: They're all inside eating places.

13
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:03,634
Rym: It's like uh Yeah, you got to eat outside cuz this is like the good weather is gonna end yep so we got it.

14
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:14,556
Scott: so it's either like get a takeout and sit in a park or sit in a place and Eventually we you know we got to a place like three possible eateries all next to each other and we didn't care which one.

15
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,889
Scott: so someone just feotted and we picked this Thai place.

16
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:28,957
Scott: and The Thai place wasn't outside, but it was one of those places at the front of the store basically opens up entirely effectively outside And basically they had a lunch.

17
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:37,485
Scott: the only thing you could order was the $8 lunch special Which is pretty awesome cuz the $8 lunch special got you first you could shoot.

18
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,889
Scott: you got a salad in a little thingy.

19
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,274
Rym: All right little Thai salad.

20
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,787
Scott: little Thai salad is basically one piece of cucumber and some lettuce in.

21
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:47,546
Rym: you know to me You know I like little salads like that because you know I like the ginger salad.

22
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,290
Scott: you having to get her back.

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,983
Rym: I like myself a big salad.

24
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:56,965
Rym: You know Elaine style I mean a salad big salad for dinner, but if I'm not eating a big salad after the show man I got to start making sounds like gorgonzola stu landed sound.

25
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:57,550
Rym: oh, man.

26
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:03,896
Rym: But I got to start eating more of that like the tiny salad with every meal is like the best thing cuz I always want A tiny bit of salad.

27
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:17,775
Scott: yep, but I don't want to the salad in the way It's good for the gizzards it is so if you have a gizzard right and then They give you a choice of an appetizing bits you can get like two dumpling or two Rubbed off on you.

28
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,250
Rym: appetizing bit like a main bit and an opening bit.

29
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:21,436
Scott: You know it's like it's.

30
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:21,959
Scott: basically.

31
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:22,683
Scott: you know you can get like.

32
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:23,769
Scott: you can get like two.

33
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,581
Scott: What do they have I got?

34
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:27,070
Scott: I got a steamed vegetable dumpling?

35
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:31,590
Scott: I think the other guys got I forget, but you get to the you know little appetizing things.

36
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:33,769
Scott: And then you get your meal.

37
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:42,956
Scott: I got a drunken noodle man, and then you even get like a soda if you want soda even though I had water, but the other guy had to pay for Thai iced tea Which is separate from his sodas.

38
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,663
Scott: so it's worth paying for.

39
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,130
Scott: that was eight bucks?

40
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,175
Rym: That's why I love New York.

41
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,244
Scott: That's a fucking lunch for eight bucks.

42
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:53,037
Rym: I live I work in Midtown So I don't think that's the funniest part.

43
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:53,399
Scott: the guy.

44
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:53,781
Scott: He's like.

45
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,127
Scott: Oh drunken noodle very hot.

46
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:55,690
Scott: is that okay?

00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:58,613
Scott: And you know what.

49
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,444
Scott: I have had drunken noodle like five times as hot as that.

50
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:02,347
Scott: it was like what.

51
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:03,130
Scott: it was a joke.

52
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,873
Rym: Well, he's got a warn.

53
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:07,550
Rym: you you know white guy, but I think the thing is it wasn't Thai hot.

54
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:08,274
Scott: It was.

55
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,216
Scott: it wasn't even like Chinese restaurant General so hot.

56
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,524
Rym: it is funny the different scales.

57
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:18,124
Scott: I mean I remember when I mean Where I needed some waters, but it wasn't hot like.

58
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,269
Scott: yeah, I'm in trouble.

59
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:24,354
Rym: well I remember things the second to last time we ate at the fuck you sukatai and Pete And I were.

60
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,403
Rym: you know we are I think we both.

61
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:28,656
Rym: I forget what we ordered But they're like yeah You want a regular hot or Thai hot.

62
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:33,635
Rym: we look at each other and neither one of us wants to back down or be the wuss Who says nah?

63
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,483
Rym: I'd like regular hot please.

64
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:39,990
Scott: so we're both like yeah, Thai hot Wow the king, and I had the Thai hot.

65
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:48,723
Rym: You know they're good Thai restaurants around here, and maybe it's just my rosy memory and the fact that was the first Thai restaurant I'd ever eaten at.

66
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:49,190
Scott: I don't know.

67
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,050
Scott: I've never found something quite like the garlic pepper beef and chicken man the garlic pepper beef and chicken.

68
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,580
Rym: But I gotta tell you when it comes to Thai hot food.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,330
Rym: There's a phrase that is on FARC all the time.

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,390
Rym: This is one of those fart catchphrases that doesn't make it very far off a FARC pure cat.

71
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:07,670
Rym: Never has it been more applicable than when I ate the Thai hot Thai food.

72
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:12,370
Rym: Yeah, quote dot dot dot when the oil hits the anus dot dot dot.

73
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,676
Scott: All right, so let's.

74
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:21,949
Scott: there's probably been a bajillion bajillion tech news since you last did a Monday show.

75
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:29,964
Scott: We've forgotten all the ones that are more than a few days old with our short memories I was reminded a little bit by delicious, but all that did was remind me.

76
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:31,690
Rym: Oh, yeah, there was a bunch of tech news.

77
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:32,976
Scott: I've mostly been delicious.

78
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:39,989
Scott: thing like tech things is not things of the day But like like like Python libraries that I plan to use and stuff like that.

79
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,050
Rym: Well in the in the spirit of talking first, I want to real quick mention this because it is you know, it's important.

80
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,993
Rym: I think everyone should know.

81
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,818
Rym: Norman Borlaug is dead.

82
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:52,006
Rym: He's he has finally died after 95 96 years of being a badass.

83
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:57,090
Scott: I was pleased to see that he got you know proper news attention.

84
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:58,042
Scott: I thought it would be.

85
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:04,329
Scott: you know Usually when like a person like that dies they get like a slightly larger obituary in the New York Times and that's it.

86
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,850
Scott: So I was pleased to see that he was actually at like the top of Google News.

87
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,775
Rym: Well, here's the thing I sadly think football.

88
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:16,671
Rym: the only reason that he is so well known now is because of Penn and Teller and their bullshit episode about It.

89
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,909
Scott: I can't deny that it helped him, but I don't think that's it.

90
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,342
Rym: I think actually what what saddened me was his Nobel Prize winning.

91
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:23,486
Scott: this helped him a great deal.

92
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:29,912
Rym: a lot of the internet Newsy stuff about him had a lot of haters Really Haters.

93
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,924
Rym: most people were saying, you know people saying things like yeah great.

94
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,350
Rym: Thanks make the world more overpopulated.

95
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:38,010
Rym: Or yeah, you asshole now those people are gonna take over the world blah blah blah.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,117
Rym: Yeah, okay Norman Borlaug though.

97
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:45,490
Rym: I'll miss him primarily because he would never shy from Buzz Aldrin in someone.

98
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:46,576
Scott: That's for real.

99
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,206
Scott: I mean he wrote there's a great thing.

100
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:48,810
Scott: Let's link to it.

101
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,287
Scott: I have the link where he basically shoots down all the organic farming people.

102
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:55,307
Scott: He's like look Yeah, you can do your organic forming if you want.

103
00:05:55,388 --> 00:06:03,382
Scott: Sure Okay, if you want to feed the world like that, you know, you're gonna need to basically Destroy all of your wilderness is turning into farms point.

104
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,790
Rym: His beautiful point was that organic farming is great.

105
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:14,588
Rym: Go for it You know, it's a thing you can strive for but one it is elitist to think that that can somehow feed the world Especially if you have never experienced hunger.

106
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,815
Rym: Yeah, he also.

107
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,761
Rym: he basically points out that you know.

108
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:31,990
Rym: all other arguments aside about food The only goal he had was to reduce human suffering and because people were hungry He did everything he could to make people not be hungry and there's a lot less people that are hungry.

109
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:33,093
Scott: It's a lot.

110
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:35,181
Scott: the water is a much bigger problem.

111
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,890
Rym: He was a veritable Tezuka of making food.

112
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:40,341
Scott: Yeah, pretty much, you know, just spending his last breath.

113
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:41,125
Rym: Let me work.

114
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,129
Rym: Let me work.

115
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:45,460
Rym: Yeah, I'll admit I didn't know who he was until Penn teller.

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,188
Rym: Penn and teller told me I had known that there was.

117
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,350
Scott: I knew Of his works, but I did not know his name.

118
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,650
Scott: Well, you know I got the one of the works and I knew that a guy who made a Nobel Prize made those works.

119
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,388
Rym: I knew about the works in the context of that one sentence in every middle school textbook blah blah blah.

120
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,094
Rym: Green Revolution Blah blah blah.

121
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:07,248
Scott: I knew like a whole classes worth of stuff about that.

122
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:16,570
Rym: So But that aside We're generally gonna pick the news as we remember as opposed to what might have been important because it's something might be important.

123
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,564
Rym: But if I have nothing to say about it, it'll be like that X happened.

124
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:23,563
Scott: Yep real quick I just want to say I got the snow leopards.

125
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,070
Scott: I'm installing it on the Mac Mini right now.

126
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,859
Scott: It according to everyone I've seen and what I've heard.

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,090
Scott: I'm about to you know, find out for reals and after the show, but It definitely is just sort of a service pack.

128
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:42,340
Scott: However, it adds a few key features that happen to have significance for me because they make me use a Mac at work And I really need that exchange support.

129
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,386
Scott: So there you have it.

130
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,077
Rym: So what's the installer like?

131
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:51,949
Scott: I mean it's you put the disk in you push next next agree And then I guess I have to wait 40 minutes and I'll know the rest after the show.

132
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:53,870
Rym: Well, I guess it has to ask you something.

133
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,573
Rym: I mean otherwise.

134
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:58,349
Scott: you wish to drive to install on even though there was only one drive to install to see.

135
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,040
Rym: You know why it's doing that.

136
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:01,350
Rym: it's shake and bake syndrome.

137
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,863
Rym: So when you install it, you know, you're a Mac person you install your upgrade.

138
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:06,850
Rym: you can think to yourself and I helped.

139
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:07,853
Scott: Yeah, right.

140
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:11,868
Scott: No, it's in case you have a Mac Pro which has more than one drive in it.

141
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:26,573
Scott: That's why Anyway Steve Jobs obviously not dead and he brought out some new iPods That iPod nano despite the fact that I don't need it cuz I have an iPhone looking pretty good Like.

142
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:29,530
Scott: I don't understand why no one can compete with the stupid iPod.

143
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,081
Scott: I mean Zune can't fucking do it like.

144
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,828
Scott: I mean the Zune HD is looking pretty good, too.

145
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,298
Scott: But it's obvious what to do.

146
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,082
Scott: No way better.

147
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,070
Rym: It's obvious what to do.

148
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,297
Rym: It would be cheaper to do with an.

149
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,626
Rym: Apple sells it for it's just.

150
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,149
Rym: no one does it.

151
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,414
Scott: It's I gave you.

152
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,344
Scott: put me in charge of a bunch of electronics dudes, right?

153
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:49,884
Scott: I couldn't do the industrial design I couldn't do the electronics, but I could say here's the list of features.

154
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,250
Scott: get them fucking in there.

155
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,177
Scott: All of them do it this way.

156
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,847
Scott: And if they did it, it would be an iPod killer, right?

157
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:56,429
Scott: Here's the list.

158
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:56,690
Scott: ready?

159
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,198
Scott: Play any codec any codec, right.

160
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,815
Scott: if you can't handle like the full power of the codec then you know Cuz the CPU can't be that good.

161
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:16,086
Scott: make a power powerful device make a more powerful device or just like, you know Reduce the quality on the codec or have your client like, you know down Transcode or something or just like, you know, skip.

162
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,858
Scott: Yes Play the video all skippily.

163
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:19,320
Scott: who cares?

164
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,129
Rym: down transcode because that won't take CPU.

165
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,169
Scott: Well now I mean I mean on the clock on the computer, but then I can't just drag and drop.

166
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:27,481
Scott: Anyway, number two ready.

167
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,626
Scott: That's audio and video codecs by the way.

168
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:32,420
Scott: number two a nice easy unit is user interface.

169
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:37,321
Scott: all we need is the left and right button or an up and down button and Then a you know action button.

170
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:37,763
Scott: That's it.

171
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:42,301
Scott: You don't need any of the buttons besides that Number three volume right up volume.

172
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:43,908
Scott: I guess we can use the up and down button for that.

173
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,409
Rym: now What if I want to change tracks?

174
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,735
Scott: You push the button in the middle.

175
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,865
Rym: So I push the button in the middle and then what?

176
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:50,850
Scott: there's a menu.

177
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,427
Rym: So then I get a look at this menu.

178
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,450
Scott: You use the menu for changing the time.

179
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,105
Rym: No Because here is the the the iPod in that has just enough that I need.

180
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,260
Rym: but the reason I like it is that With the pre you don't have to look at it.

181
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,310
Rym: Yeah, I got a fucking look at that thing.

182
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,105
Rym: So if I'm on the train half asleep, and I just want to change the song or change the volume I gotta look at this thing and that with the iPod.

183
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,170
Scott: and yeah, you don't have to look.

184
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,316
Rym: I'll admit the pre is great.

185
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:17,137
Rym: Like I have media on it and it's a good like, you know I need something to listen to.

186
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:22,719
Rym: I need some audio but media playing device It is not just because it doesn't have the basic features.

187
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,907
Rym: The stupid iPhone has yeah our media.

188
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,217
Scott: even with the iPod It's like come on.

189
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:28,342
Scott: This is like a bajillion dollars.

190
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:28,945
Scott: It can't even do it.

191
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:36,744
Scott: an iPod does anyway Synchronize over the air Wi-Fi, oh my gosh, not that hard.

192
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,653
Scott: people just do it You know.

193
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:42,429
Scott: just drag and drop files on to it.

194
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:49,844
Scott: You know if you decide to plug it in instead of going over the air Just freely share files with any other device.

195
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,070
Scott: That's also the same device.

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,846
Scott: Let me just drag and drop mp3s and videos my friends no restrictions whatsoever.

197
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,914
Scott: Just free copying No one get.

198
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:01,410
Scott: you know, it's not any legal device, you know, it doesn't make it illegal.

199
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,443
Scott: And I'm just you know, it's no difference doesn't not doing anything that a computer doesn't do?

200
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:07,269
Scott: just copy files to my friends.

201
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,146
Rym: wireless You know, I am.

202
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:13,602
Rym: I'm really surprised that people no one's jumped on the idea.

203
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,364
Scott: Yeah, it's all these.

204
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:14,846
Scott: All right.

205
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,250
Scott: What else do they need there?

206
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,182
Scott: Oh support for headphones with a button on them.

207
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:19,370
Scott: I guess the iPod does do that.

208
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:25,649
Rym: well we've got all these hardware companies and they generally will always bow to the demands of the software companies and the legislators and everything when.

209
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,610
Scott: What a movable battery.

210
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:36,330
Rym: I think the problem is no one company has all the components together To make the awesome device and there's always one person in the chain who doesn't want to do the awesome thing.

211
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:37,635
Scott: Am/fm radio.

212
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,150
Scott: they added FM radio to the iPod was shocking, but they didn't add am radio.

213
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:42,576
Rym: I don't need it.

214
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,510
Scott: that had the X. I listen to am radio more than the FM radio.

215
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:52,360
Scott: Yeah, cuz FM radio only has music but the am radio has like the news weather traffic sports Which is the only time ever gonna turn on.

216
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,050
Rym: is my busted up car, right?

217
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:01,585
Rym: You know, I finally because my iPod integration on my car was actually pretty good But the power cable got caught in the door a while ago and broke and I didn't notice.

218
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:05,155
Rym: cuz I don't use my car mm-hmm and There's like.

219
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,602
Rym: I put the antenna back in just like.

220
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,150
Rym: oh I need something to listen to in the car.

221
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,834
Rym: It's free.

222
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,850
Rym: It's not anywhere close to paying me enough to listen to that garbage.

223
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:18,601
Scott: Good god, I only turn on the radio if it's an emergency like oh crap.

224
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,434
Scott: This is sports or something or oh crap What's the?

225
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,441
Scott: you know the weather is or something?

226
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:24,862
Scott: I don't know.

227
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,075
Scott: I hardly ever turn it on and oh crap What's the weather?

228
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:28,818
Rym: I'm outside.

229
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,582
Rym: I have a pre.

230
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,370
Rym: I can go to NOAA and look at the weather.

231
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:32,674
Scott: I'm driving.

232
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:34,583
Scott: I can't exactly look at it while I'm driving.

233
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:35,306
Rym: I never care.

234
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,150
Scott: Well, I'm driving.

235
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,742
Scott: I might care if I see a big storm ahead.

236
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:38,750
Scott: I want to know why though.

237
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,435
Rym: What are you gonna do?

238
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:40,201
Rym: You're all right, you're on.

239
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,390
Scott: take a different course.

240
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,090
Rym: You're on i-75 going south take a different course and you see a storm coming.

241
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:46,913
Scott: Take a different course.

242
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,244
Rym: if you listen to the radio, you're just gonna say storms coming.

243
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,880
Scott: Yeah, I can go a different way Oh shit.

244
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,589
Rym: It's storm anyway.

245
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:57,588
Scott: So yeah, that's that's pretty much.

246
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:08,330
Scott: it Makes me you know think like hey part of the reason I you know It's like in six months my iPhone contracts over right and I'm gonna definitely get something else probably Android just cuz I'm all googly.

247
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:10,681
Scott: But maybe the pre or maybe something else.

248
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,610
Rym: I've decided but I need you know.

249
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:22,950
Scott: I mean, I need an immediate playing device and I need a phone right and the iPhone is both which is huge It's like one and it's two and one which is like regardless of any other factor.

250
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,244
Rym: Well, you can argue that it's a phone but it's on the AT&T network.

251
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,207
Rym: so it's like 80% of.

252
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:28,548
Scott: I know.

253
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:29,270
Scott: that's the other problem.

254
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,853
Scott: It's like okay.

255
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,970
Scott: I can have two devices, but it's kind of crappy.

256
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:39,285
Scott: No Here's the or if you want to get a Verizon Slash Sprint phone and then the separate iPod to make up for the fact.

257
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,350
Rym: that's what I was about to say.

258
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:50,050
Rym: If you only if you if you will not compromise on having one device Then they're all pretty much equal the iPhone the pre and and like they all have an equal features that it just you pick what?

259
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,909
Rym: Features you want if you're willing to go to the two device setup.

260
00:13:55,471 --> 00:14:03,560
Scott: iPhone is not a loser because the only advantage the iPhone has is that it's a one device because anything plus an iPod is better than the iPhone.

261
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:14,500
Scott: if you're willing to have two devices Yep, so if I'd like to have one device, but I don't think that's gonna be possible just because AT&T is such poop It is and even then Verizon, I don't know.

262
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,065
Rym: Sprint more and more is busting out.

263
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,229
Scott: Sprint is busting.

264
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:27,744
Scott: Actually, there was like this guy the CEO of Sprint had a really wide open interview on the the PBS and basically He was like, yeah, we have these unlimited plans, but really we're charging you more.

265
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,121
Scott: He's like, yeah the limited plan Everyone thinks it's less.

266
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:30,485
Scott: It's more.

267
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:32,934
Scott: He's like everyone loves it.

268
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:35,102
Scott: He was just so open about everything.

269
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:37,270
Scott: It was pretty, you know, he's like, yeah the iPods a killer.

270
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:38,435
Scott: What are you gonna do?

271
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,319
Scott: I mean iPhones a killer.

272
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:39,842
Scott: What are you gonna do?

273
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:41,570
Rym: Well, I love the fact that they have.

274
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,930
Scott: It's like trying to compete with Michael Jordan.

275
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,010
Rym: They have their unlimited and they're super unlimited.

276
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:50,891
Rym: But if you look at the plans the only difference between those two basically is the super unlimited cost more money in the past I think.

277
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:53,920
Rym: drop the price recently and it gives you unlimited everything.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,433
Rym: the other one gives you unlimited everything but talking but they Talking.

279
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:01,850
Scott: then you'll ever need they give me like I have the lowest amount of talking possible.

280
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,001
Scott: I have like a bajillion rollover minute me too.

281
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,910
Rym: I have like four hundred and fifty talking minutes.

282
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:07,647
Rym: You know how many I used in the last month?

283
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:08,994
Rym: Eleven.

284
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:15,050
Scott: see now if they were true rollover minutes They would give me what they're worth in dollars back when I leave in six months.

285
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:23,360
Rym: You know, I got a lot of friends who have rollover whatever and they had there everyone's like, yeah I got the maximum rollover I could talk constantly for the next month.

286
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,724
Scott: Yeah, it's bullshit.

287
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,570
Scott: Anyway, I wish they would give me a plan.

288
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,355
Scott: That was five bucks.

289
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,240
Rym: Well now what we're seeing?

290
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:38,303
Rym: there's a dive hours and that's it Not even five hours and there's a divergence where people need a phone number because in modern Industrial society you need a phone number.

291
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:52,548
Rym: if you don't have a phone Or the ability to make a phone call of some capacity to a lot of like archaic organizations like pizza places And you don't live somewhere cool like Rochester where you can just go to a website in order pizza Then you need this phone number.

292
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:58,650
Rym: But you're not gonna use it if you're one of these divergent tech people for anything but interfacing with archaic people.

293
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,326
Rym: Yeah, you know calling your mom.

294
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,769
Scott: That's a Google Voice Google Voice.

295
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,960
Scott: Yeah All my colleagues say I found out if I can get Google.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:17,429
Scott: if anyone out there has a way to get us some Google Voice Invite whatever I want it not because I want to use it for myself But because I found out that it would actually be a really good way to get some voicemail type action in the podcast.

297
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:20,290
Scott: that doesn't Suck which is part of the reason why we've never done that kind of stuff.

298
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,369
Rym: Yeah, I mean Odeo basically stopped working at one point and no one ever fixed it.

299
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,545
Scott: Yeah, basically would give us a phone number the phone note you would call.

300
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,410
Scott: you would leave your message.

301
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,099
Scott: We would get a transcription of the message Whoever automatic and crappy it was.

302
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:42,440
Scott: it would still help us know if your voicemail was good or not And then we could push play like in gmail to play the audio the message and then the output from the computer with the gmail Open would go into the mixer and that would be how it would do it.

303
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,610
Scott: So we just need Google Voice for that.

304
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:49,270
Rym: So there's this article on slashdot and again in the true slashdot sense.

305
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:52,645
Rym: I don't care about the article, but I care about the topic the article raises.

306
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,890
Rym: you can read the article if you want.

307
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,795
Rym: I didn't even look at it.

308
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:03,570
Rym: how to make science popular again Mm-hmm, and this is something we've talked about a lot, but I started really thinking about it after seeing this article.

309
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,659
Rym: I mean, you know, we always talk about back in the day.

310
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,190
Rym: yet the world's fair optimism the scientist.

311
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,132
Scott: That's my kind of place I want to be.

312
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,364
Rym: the scientist was the good guy saving you from the Godzilla.

313
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:14,930
Rym: that was also caused by science.

314
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:27,933
Rym: But science was either a force of good or a double-edged sword and more and more in the media It's the you know evil scientist who uncovers the evil truth or does the evil thing and and even the doctors who are supposed to Heal you.

315
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:28,998
Scott: it's like they're evil.

316
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:32,519
Scott: and and this bullshit Randy healing is good You know.

317
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:39,710
Scott: sadly, you know There are a lot of men and all the news about medical studies are always scared to scare you not to be about healing.

318
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,442
Rym: Well, there's all their arguments and things you could do to make science more palatable.

319
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:50,797
Rym: and we have to make science more palatable more Popular more people to be interested in and care about science But far and above in a way.

320
00:17:50,837 --> 00:18:00,985
Rym: the number one thing I think is very simply that in the past It wasn't necessarily pro science It was just pro futurism and it was this kind of you know 50s style.

321
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:02,390
Rym: Look the future.

322
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:17,648
Rym: everything is great in the future, but More knowledge means that we know that everything is not great in the future and that while things get better Science, usually it uncovers uncomfortable truths more quickly than it solves them.

323
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:19,538
Scott: Yep Well, I mean here's the other thing.

324
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:27,270
Scott: is that right Nate, you know The laws of nature and the the arrangement of the universe doesn't care it can't care.

325
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:28,820
Scott: It's just the way things are.

326
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:37,610
Scott: and the way things are, you know Don't necessarily mesh with the way we happen to have built our society because he built our society based on a limited knowledge.

327
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,390
Scott: We didn't build our society on this more advanced knowledge.

328
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:50,290
Scott: So uncovering any more knowledge is in in the long run is guaranteed To disrupt our society and force it to change and break in many ways.

329
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,259
Scott: For example, we've discovered how to copy things infinitely.

330
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,730
Scott: not so good for the way we've set up our information economy.

331
00:18:57,194 --> 00:19:03,104
Scott: We've discovered how like, you know We're starting to discover more and more how brains work and other such things.

332
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,521
Scott: not so good for the way We've treated privacy in the past.

333
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:07,789
Scott: It's just gonna fall apart.

334
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:17,917
Scott: So, you know, it's it's in the past in the 50s, you know the the information we were discovering then, you know It's not just it was making.

335
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:30,639
Scott: at least it was making the lives of people in the United States Seemingly better because they were seeing things in their everyday lives like refrigerators and stoves and all sorts of news Little and that I think cars the wings on.

336
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,105
Rym: I think it was much more subtle than that.

337
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:48,523
Rym: if you look at you know the futurism of the 50s and it was basically taking existing comfortable structures and Extruding them out into the future and basically just enhancing them in the context of their existing Uses and their existing functions in the existing society.

338
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:49,830
Rym: Yep and less and less.

339
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,678
Rym: Does that work at all and more and more.

340
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,688
Rym: is that obviously not the way things will?

341
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,680
Scott: yes now It's like in the future everything, you know and love will be gone.

342
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,970
Scott: It'll be something different force chain.

343
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,530
Rym: I mean if we were doing futurism now like right now what we'd be looking at the iPhone of the future?

344
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:05,361
Rym: It plays 3d video.

345
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:16,110
Scott: Yeah, as opposed to phones are integrated with the brain and like there's all craziness The more you know the less fantasy can come in and people like fantasy a lot better than reality.

346
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:27,890
Rym: But there's also a subtle shift in that the marketing in the past was geared toward getting people to buy into Futurism and buy into science and then buy products and it was this kind of positive reinforcement.

347
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,959
Rym: Look everything makes everything better.

348
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,281
Rym: Yes.

349
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:30,582
Scott: Yes.

350
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,190
Rym: Yes power thirst power thirst.

351
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:32,571
Scott: Yeah.

352
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:41,390
Rym: now at least when it comes to technology and medicine especially medicine It seems like the marketing is everything makes your life worse.

353
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:47,630
Rym: We will scare you into buying products to protect yourself from the terrible secret of space as Amanda is saw it.

354
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,028
Scott: Now you see it.

355
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,416
Rym: That's all we could do.

356
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:53,599
Rym: a whole show mighty.

357
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,804
Rym: I wanted to just I wanted to touch on this.

358
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,910
Scott: Okay, this is real quick.

359
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:08,288
Scott: I want to say that Twitter announced among other things that Apparently despite the fact that you give Twitter the company Rights to do certain things with your tweets like republish them and display them etc, etc.

360
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:10,455
Scott: You own your tweets.

361
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:11,238
Scott: They belong to you.

362
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:12,422
Scott: You have the copyright on them.

363
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,550
Scott: You know, I know it's grant Twitter this license to them.

364
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,569
Rym: So well, we have two opposite takes on the awesome way to handle this.

365
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:26,328
Scott: I suggest that you should Creative Commons license your tweets So that you know people can retweet them without fear.

366
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:27,733
Rym: now That's the problem.

367
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:32,110
Rym: the way Twitter is that I feel we should do the opposite because my philosophy when it comes

368
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,039
Scott: Also a plan I approve of by the way, I approve

369
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:40,626
Rym: of both plans as do I because when I saw Scott do it I was like, oh, that's the obvious good thing to do.

370
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:41,210
Rym: That's cool.

371
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:41,913
Rym: I should do that.

372
00:21:41,953 --> 00:22:00,866
Rym: then I thought wait a minute because my whole life whenever I see a problem The first instinct I have is to push on that Problem to the maximum level of escalation in order to force the issue and the decision to come to a head Mm-hmm like say my foot really hurts and I'm not sure if it's broken or not.

373
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:01,950
Scott: jump up and down on it.

374
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:17,050
Rym: The first thing I'll do it unless there's like a bone sticking out is try to walk normally Because either I can or I can and having that knowledge and pushing it to the breaking point Possibly literally will allow me to more quickly come to a resolution and go to the doctor.

375
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:27,450
Rym: Yeah, if I'm like, I don't know and I kind of like gingerly like Then I'm going to delay possibly important and timely foot saving technology.

376
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:34,200
Rym: It's the same thing if I go to a website and it's at all slow I usually hit refresh a few times to see if I can bring it down.

377
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:37,310
Rym: Yeah, I always everything like that politics.

378
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,669
Scott: I hate refresh a few times not to see if I can bring it down to see if I could get it.

379
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:43,440
Scott: So explain your tweet.

380
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:55,279
Rym: So my tweet option is this if Twin if I own my tweets then if I don't give them an open license Doesn't that necessitate that people shouldn't be able to just retweet.

381
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,395
Rym: I mean all they're doing is attributing me, but they're also completely Retransmitting my transmission.

382
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:08,579
Scott: and yeah, I mean if you had a Creative Commons attribution license, that'd be totally cool But without that that's technically illegal.

383
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,998
Rym: It's not fair use to just take my work and completely 100% give it away for free.

384
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,660
Rym: That's right.

385
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,333
Rym: else regardless of whether or not I gave it away for free That's exactly right.

386
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:22,723
Rym: And it basically proof shows that copyright law really breaks down.

387
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:23,405
Rym: It's retarded.

388
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,334
Rym: Well, it breaks down in the minutiae 144 characters.

389
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:33,010
Rym: I could write every possible hundred and forty four character combination with a bash 26 to the hundred and forty fourth power.

390
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,379
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's a lot.

391
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,990
Rym: Yeah, it's a lot but it's not that many.

392
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,966
Scott: We should make a Twitter account that does it one by one one a day.

393
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:39,630
Scott: just have a tweet.

394
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,314
Scott: You know what you.

395
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:43,249
Scott: the the API limit is what a hundred and something an hour.

396
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:44,835
Scott: Right something like that.

397
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,243
Scott: So every hour it'll go through 155.

398
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:48,066
Scott: How long will it take?

399
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:55,689
Scott: Probably a billion years And Dinosaurs will be coming around and Twitter will be gone, but it'll still be got what dinosaurs?

400
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:57,790
Rym: Yeah, I guess Dave Riley was right.

401
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,178
Scott: That's how long it'll be in the future.

402
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:01,189
Scott: the dinosaurs will come back and go away again.

403
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:14,288
Rym: but one of the funniest things ever in Futurama was when they show that like time-lapse about the window while fries in the thing and It's like civilization grows comes to a peak aliens destroy it all castles civilization comes back.

404
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:17,134
Rym: Yep But I don't know.

405
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,260
Rym: I feel like everyone should do the opposite.

406
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:30,284
Rym: we should all have a super restrictive, you know every maximum right that copyright lets you assert and You know threaten everybody who retreats or just point out to everyone who retweet and think about this.

407
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,352
Rym: you were breaking the law by repeating Me.

408
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:38,885
Scott: and if you want to me if you make the argument right that you know 144 characters isn't copyright a bull right.

409
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:43,040
Rym: if you want to make that argument Well Emily had the sheet before any of us could say it.

410
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:50,770
Rym: the other night at dinner Emily pointed out the obvious answer Haiku, yep, so haiku is an art does not not know copyright on haiku.

411
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,860
Scott: And also at the same time right.

412
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:59,285
Scott: if you want to say it isn't besides haiku Then why do I need to give Twitter this license to use it?

413
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:00,310
Scott: And how can I own them?

414
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,848
Scott: It's basically any tweet is automatically public domain by that measure.

415
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,679
Scott: So yeah, is that the case?

416
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,070
Rym: so I am NOT creative commenting my tweets.

417
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,654
Rym: And in fact, if you're retweeting me You're gonna sue them.

418
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:15,850
Rym: You're probably gonna get away with it because I don't have the legal resource.

419
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,879
Scott: You should send them a cease and desist, huh?

420
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,582
Rym: Maybe I should.

421
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:20,310
Rym: I'll start tweeting cease and desist.

422
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,009
Rym: Now just here's another aspect of law if I direct message tweet you does that constitute me?

423
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,904
Rym: Notifying you of something.

424
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:29,629
Scott: I don't know I don't think so, but you should do it.

425
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:42,846
Rym: Anyway, just just to make people aware but so tight take either Scott's tack of using the Creative Commons tools to you know Force our open ideals onto the broken structure or use the broken structure to prove how broken it is.

426
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:43,869
Rym: Either one is great.

427
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:46,234
Scott: Yep Let's see.

428
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:46,899
Scott: What else we got?

429
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:47,684
Rym: one more little thing.

430
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:48,289
Rym: I want to bring up.

431
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:49,073
Rym: There's this.

432
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:52,649
Rym: it's this is from August but and maybe we could do a whole show on this later.

433
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:56,420
Rym: Well, we'll see but there is an article fear of porn.

434
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,608
Rym: URL exposure discourages firefox 3 upgrade.

435
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:00,953
Scott: It's true.

436
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:05,450
Rym: It is very true because firefox 3, you know makes your bookmarks usable.

437
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:06,947
Rym: Bookmarks were all.

438
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:13,290
Rym: you know The way people manage bookmarks usually old and shitty with a million folders and we could talk forever about how to manage your bookmarks.

439
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:14,309
Rym: We may already have.

440
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:22,338
Rym: But people who look at porn or do things like that They're like, you know, they're like animals.

441
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,730
Rym: They don't really know how to hide what they're doing.

442
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:29,219
Rym: You know the cat kind of knows like they cover their poop.

443
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:42,841
Rym: Yeah Doing you know, you can train a cat to flush its poop down the toilet whether than just covering it in sand and You can train a person to use something like delicious.

444
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,630
Rym: whether than covering their poop in sand.

445
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:48,370
Rym: But the majority of humans don't know and they cover their porn.

446
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:53,284
Rym: They'll have like the folder of like I don't know something weird like like poker whatever.

447
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:57,015
Rym: and in that folder of the subfolder of like You know grandma's whatever.

448
00:26:57,356 --> 00:27:00,908
Rym: and deep down under all this saying grandma's what kind of porn is that?

449
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:03,923
Rym: Well It hiding in plain sight.

450
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:07,015
Rym: if you like grandma porn What's the best place to hide your grandma porn?

451
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,580
Rym: under the grandma bookmarks?

452
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,450
Rym: because no one's gonna look at grandma bookmarks, right?

453
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,085
Rym: But people hide their poop understand because they don't understand how to actually hide their poop.

454
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:20,682
Rym: or the big question Should you even be hiding your poop at all?

455
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:23,793
Rym: If you have to hide your poop You've got a problem.

456
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:24,476
Rym: or your cat.

457
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,361
Rym: if you're a cat train the cat.

458
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:27,866
Rym: how to use the toilet.

459
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:32,843
Rym: if you're a person either Don't be ashamed or if you're ashamed there are tools to hide your poop.

460
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:38,401
Rym: There are easy ways to hide your poop So the people you don't want to see your poop will not find your poop.

461
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:41,170
Scott: The new firefoxes have private browsing modes.

462
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:41,947
Scott: So there you go.

463
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,002
Scott: Yeah, but just turn on private browsing look at porn turn off private brows.

464
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:48,289
Rym: this race is another long-term uncomfortable issue.

465
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:48,510
Rym: where?

466
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,818
Rym: Technology makes information more accessible.

467
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:10,489
Rym: the better technology gets the more you were either as a person Are they're going to have to be comfortable with the fact that you poop or You're going to have to be up with technology such that you know how to hide your poop and more and more Smaller numbers of people will use increasingly complex methods of poop hiding and the rest of you grandma's gonna find your poop.

468
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:20,433
Rym: So things of the day, what do you got?

469
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,440
Rym: So I was talking in a weird voice.

470
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,428
Scott: I was gonna use some kind of like talking in this.

471
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,200
Scott: we watch the college humor video and I decided that was very funny.

472
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:27,964
Scott: So I'll use it.

473
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,109
Rym: It's it's pretty good.

474
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,682
Rym: now if you think this is tasteless You're wrong.

475
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:32,425
Rym: This is this is.

476
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:39,530
Scott: this is definitely this is no more tasteless than an old thing of the day Involving stuffed plushies of the Twin Towers.

477
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,393
Rym: Oh, man.

478
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:41,978
Scott: This is a that one.

479
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:42,580
Scott: Yeah one.

480
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:45,068
Scott: This is a Star Wars analogy.

481
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:48,919
Scott: They're comparing the Death Star to the Twin Towers and it is very funny.

482
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,400
Rym: now It could have been done stupidly or tastelessly or whatever, but not only is this funny.

483
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:55,461
Scott: It has a funny punchline at the end It is.

484
00:28:55,482 --> 00:29:07,544
Rym: it is so cleverly done and they make like five or six like good out there Jokes, and it looks like they had like high quality 501st armors - yeah, they were the real deal But they it just.

485
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:11,538
Rym: it does such a good job of bringing up all the I'm when they bring up the loose change.

486
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:11,920
Rym: BS.

487
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:15,905
Scott: Yes, Palpatine knew He did on purpose.

488
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:17,873
Scott: There's no way two x-wings could have blown up to this.

489
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,460
Scott: All right, we're not gonna give away all the jokes.

490
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:23,980
Rym: I just you think Darth Vader was just happened to be in a tie fighter when the whole thing went down.

491
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,627
Scott: Yeah, go watch this video.

492
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:26,310
Scott: It's good.

493
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,732
Scott: It's funny.

494
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:30,659
Rym: So my thing of the day This is kind of old but a lot of people probably didn't see it.

495
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:35,060
Rym: So there's this famous painting of a guy and two kids in like a farm next to a ladder.

496
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:38,697
Scott: It's this old like 16 so you'll recognize the painting when you see it.

497
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,289
Scott: as soon as I saw it I was like, oh, yeah that painting.

498
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,734
Scott: who painted it?

499
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,423
Scott: by the way, ah Crap, all right.

500
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:43,771
Rym: Let me pull up the actual art of crap.

501
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,032
Scott: I love crap.

502
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:56,660
Rym: 17th century the 17th century darch work barn interior is one of 16 paintings that Calvin alumnus Cornelius van Nui gay Oh van Nui.

503
00:29:56,821 --> 00:30:00,138
Rym: Okay, no van Nui gave it to a school two years ago.

504
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:00,480
Rym: he did not.

505
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:03,248
Rym: Van Nui was not the painter.

506
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,479
Scott: I was gonna say if I knew he's a name I know.

507
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:12,367
Scott: anyway Egbert von der Poel's ah Under Paul was a name.

508
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:16,670
Rym: I've never heard before very good shows two women Shows a woman and two children inside a barn.

509
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,272
Rym: blah blah blah blah.

510
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:22,020
Rym: He lived from 1621 to 1664 Not that long as long ago.

511
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,157
Rym: Oh Anyway, it's a famous painting and you know it.

512
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,990
Rym: Like all old paintings that had problems and they were gonna restore it.

513
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:39,335
Rym: while they were restoring it the restorer noticed one That like all paintings it had darkened substantially over the years.

514
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:48,082
Rym: and you know A lot of people don't realize that we look at paintings and we kind of have this aesthetic of what we expect These famous old paintings to look like in Reality.

515
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:53,180
Rym: they were a lot brighter and more colorful than we see them today because paint they had shitty fucking paint.

516
00:30:53,462 --> 00:31:03,853
Scott: Not like we do today where you have like you go to you know The craft store and you get fucking the brightest paint in the universe the fact that these Paintings at all exist in any form today that aren't just black smears.

517
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:04,856
Scott: Think about a tattoo.

518
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,320
Scott: me think about an old tattoo.

519
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:07,147
Scott: That's what it was like.

520
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:08,520
Scott: eventually it turns into a blob.

521
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:12,160
Rym: Well, at least paintings don't have the problem that people get fat.

522
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:13,123
Scott: Yeah, I know.

523
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:20,507
Scott: but even though think about tattoo ink right turned into a blob and that was only like less than a century ago Multiple centuries ago.

524
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:23,660
Scott: right paint technology is gonna be a blob.

525
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,940
Rym: You want to get into some geeky shit the science and art and alchemy and mysticism of designing paint back in the day.

526
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,390
Rym: That is a whole amazing topic.

527
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:34,560
Scott: But also why artists are crazy led.

528
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:35,903
Rym: So one.

529
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:41,799
Rym: this work is a lot lighter and warmer and redder than you know, people would have expected.

530
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:43,445
Rym: Yep And there's a lot more detail.

531
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:54,940
Rym: It was kind of hidden but - he noticed that this ladder in the foreground That was kind of out of place Was really thickly painted like there was a lot of paint there for some reason like it had been painted over.

532
00:31:55,642 --> 00:32:02,900
Rym: So in the course of restoring he discovers that under all that clearly added on later paint is a slaughtered pig.

533
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:20,340
Rym: Uh-huh, a very detailed slaughtered pig and the painting was originally very very very different Because the original painting shows this, you know This person's sitting there in these kids and all the accoutrement of a farm life and a slaughtered pig Cut open ribs exposed hanging to dry and cure from the ladder.

534
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:30,704
Rym: Clearly what likely happened is some rich person, you know wanted this provincial life, you know Oh life on the farm painting and they saw this pig and they're like, yeah Thanks for the painting.

535
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:33,459
Rym: and then they hired someone else to paint over and put the ladder back.

536
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:44,579
Rym: But look at how much the character and the meaning and everything of this painting is changed by this one detail that was Redected and we wouldn't have known without science and technology.

537
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:52,745
Rym: today we're lucky in the modern world and that we can see, you know, we can see Han Solo shooting first and Han Solo being a pussy.

538
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:54,311
Scott: We have both options.

539
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:55,796
Scott: We need to reconstruct those.

540
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:56,760
Scott: See this is what I'm talking about.

541
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,488
Scott: People are all talking, you know copyright.

542
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:00,115
Scott: Oh, we got to stop remixers.

543
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:01,160
Scott: We got to stop sharers.

544
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,682
Scott: No, you know what?

545
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:02,525
Scott: We really have to stop.

546
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,114
Scott: We really have to stop like vandalisms, right?

547
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,640
Scott: That's something we should stop, right?

548
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,700
Scott: We should stop George Lucas from destroying his masters, you know And we should recreate them and give them the finger if possible and we should stop.

549
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,489
Scott: You know some rich dude from like modifying some sculpture.

550
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:19,980
Scott: This is this is what you need to do to protect art not copyright.

551
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,351
Rym: So yeah, check out the pig and it's a shockingly cut open pig.

552
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:27,540
Scott: All right, so I got a new segment.

553
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,320
Scott: All right, is that the noise you're gonna have really?

554
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,065
Scott: You can stop that now.

555
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,855
Scott: You're just ruining it and you're making it annoying and painful.

556
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:37,778
Scott: Everyone just turned off.

557
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:39,039
Scott: right now It's a good job.

558
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:42,660
Scott: Hey, it's not as bad as you know, the early game you would have done it for like a second.

559
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:45,151
Scott: Nobody, you know wouldn't have been so annoying.

560
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:49,190
Rym: and I want to point out in early GeekNights You know, we came up with the thing.

561
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,799
Scott: That's why we didn't post those shows.

562
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:58,300
Rym: We came up with a thing of the day bit and we came up with music for the thing of the day that would pay Like looping like in the background as intro.

563
00:33:59,083 --> 00:33:59,685
Scott: We didn't do that.

564
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:03,900
Rym: It was it sounded really cool if things of the day lasted 30 seconds.

565
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:09,340
Rym: Yeah, so 10 minutes of this like intense music playing quietly in the background drove people crazy.

566
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:12,500
Scott: so We got a new segment.

567
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:12,962
Scott: I'm gonna.

568
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:17,658
Scott: it's gonna be a really short segment and basically the thing is this I hate putting meta in the show.

569
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,215
Scott: for those you Don't know meta is when you talk about the show on the show.

570
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:22,260
Scott: Yeah, that's bad.

571
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,431
Scott: I don't want to limit that as much as possible.

572
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:28,300
Rym: I mean sometimes it's good like hey We're doing a thousand panels at this con.

573
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,771
Rym: But sometimes because you know a new listener and an old listener will care.

574
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:36,072
Rym: sometimes it's bad like oh, yeah foreign bullshit Blah blah blah, right?

575
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:37,637
Scott: We're not gonna do any of that That's for sure.

576
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:45,612
Rym: But in general, you know, if you're a new listener or you're if you're not in the community of GeekNights aside from GeekNights You don't care about our meta bullshit.

577
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,620
Rym: You just want us to get through it.

578
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,699
Rym: But we have to talk about some things on the show.

579
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:56,838
Scott: Yes, and the thing is there, you know We've avoid something meta so much that we forget to talk about the tiny bit of meta that we should.

580
00:34:56,858 --> 00:35:03,780
Scott: for example We never like remember to not like repeatedly announce contests and other things that we have that we should put in the show.

581
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:04,760
Scott: That's appropriate meta.

582
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:12,489
Scott: So if we have a meta minute segment where we force ourselves to do some meta during the show Then we'll remember to do that stuff.

583
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,156
Scott: So here we go the ad contest.

584
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:15,240
Scott: GeekNights ad contest.

585
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:20,680
Scott: You make an advertisement that we can use to advertise GeekNights on other websites.

586
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,879
Scott: You can win Akira the manga the whole thing.

587
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:27,711
Scott: Go to the website go to the forum.

588
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:29,439
Scott: There's a thread all about it.

589
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:33,859
Scott: I think I'm gonna extend the deadline a little bit just so I can get a few more entries in there.

590
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:40,460
Scott: Well, I guess we'll extend it by you know a week or so and we're going to announce it in the meta minute segment.

591
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:41,299
Scott: So we won't forget.

592
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:52,710
Scott: So if you have Photoshop skills make an advertisement, you know According to the rules on the on the website in the thread for GeekNights Basically something that will be posted on other websites.

593
00:35:52,790 --> 00:36:05,393
Scott: that will get people to click on it and come listen to GeekNights And you can win a pile of mangas good manga - very expensive and like $180 worth of manga Manga that you will enjoy even if you don't think you like manga.

594
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,240
Scott: you never listen to our Wednesday show Yep, so enter this contest and that's the minute.

595
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:16,226
Rym: So this whole week and much of last week I've been working from home Working from home.

596
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:16,789
Rym: It's great.

597
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,694
Scott: It's good times.

598
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:22,793
Rym: The only reason I get to work from home I never actually got sick Scott and I somehow avoided but everyone else.

599
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:37,316
Rym: I'm immune with my awesome immune system The word I've been using and I've been saying this a lot to my co-workers I stand by my freakish immunity to the swine flu Yes, but you don't have a freakish immunity to like pollen for some or various other things.

600
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:37,657
Rym: Yes.

601
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:38,600
Rym: I have allergies.

602
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:46,374
Rym: Anyway, so pretty much everyone got the swine flu and even like, you know The people who can't went to packs with us Emily and Alex and they came back and they were sick.

603
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,146
Rym: and my co-workers You know, my company has a policy.

604
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:52,140
Rym: So I basically have been working from home since packs.

605
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:56,274
Rym: I have not been to Manhattan since we flew back from packs.

606
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:56,956
Scott: Nice.

607
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:58,080
Rym: It's been great.

608
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,052
Rym: I gotta tell you working from home is like the best fucking thing ever.

609
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:01,694
Rym: It's alright.

610
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:07,358
Rym: I'm probably gonna go into work Independently, I'm working the midnight shift and covering Europe like one more time this week.

611
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:23,198
Rym: and While the European shift was like the worst thing in the world when I was doing it, you know from the office You know taking the ass late Croton Harmon train into the city sitting in this quiet ass office all alone and empty midtown at night With weird noises in the building and nothing to eat and it sucked.

612
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:25,184
Rym: I was tired Working from home.

613
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:25,607
Rym: It's great.

614
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:26,431
Rym: I wake up at like 1145.

615
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:29,830
Rym: I'm a work at 1150 I'm done with work at 9 and then I go do stuff.

616
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:30,535
Scott: Mmm.

617
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:32,704
Rym: Oh my god I want to work from home like forever.

618
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:38,983
Rym: Anyway, the only reason this is possible is because of VPN.

619
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:42,017
Scott: yes, I promised someone I forget who it was do a show about VPN.

620
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:42,600
Scott: So here it is.

621
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,851
Scott: VPN is a virtual private network And the reason that is called that is because it lets you.

622
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,563
Scott: it's as if you're on a private network But you're not.

623
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,446
Scott: you're on the internet.

624
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:57,140
Scott: You're on the public network, but it's as if you're on a private network.

625
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,331
Scott: That's virtually a private network.

626
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:08,215
Rym: We're not gonna dwell on the simplistic stuff But we're also not gonna get into the super technical detail, but we're gonna talk about a lot, but VPN I mean really all it is as Scott said.

627
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:08,960
Rym: just think of it this way.

628
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,480
Rym: I've got my computer at work, you know or at my school or any place.

629
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,266
Rym: We'll tell you use work.

630
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:15,779
Rym: is the exam any private network?

631
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,780
Rym: Oh, so my work has an intranet and maybe it's connected to the internet.

632
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:24,737
Rym: Maybe it has an internet within it, which is not an uppercase.

633
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:25,340
Rym: I internet.

634
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,952
Rym: I hope everyone understands those terms still.

635
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,640
Rym: we've gone over that in the past.

636
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:35,660
Rym: So if I'm not physically there and I have a VPN it is as though I'm physically there.

637
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,220
Rym: My computer has no way to know that it is not physically and directly at my office.

638
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:41,562
Rym: It is.

639
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:44,259
Rym: it can do all the things that it could do at the office.

640
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:53,693
Scott: Yep, like, you know, let's say you've got ten computers and you wire them up together, right and you know, it's like, okay They can all connect to each other and talk in various ways.

641
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:55,280
Scott: Maybe one of them has a web server, right?

642
00:38:55,742 --> 00:38:56,123
Scott: And you can.

643
00:38:56,223 --> 00:39:00,480
Scott: you only want people in your house on these ten computers to go to the web server.

644
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,229
Scott: You don't want to let anyone in the world go to it.

645
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,160
Scott: You got secret stuff on there, right?

646
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:11,640
Scott: See what you do is you configure the web server and you say hey web server Don't give web pages to anyone who isn't in this room on these ten computers.

647
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:14,308
Scott: But what if someone's not physically in the room?

648
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,071
Scott: They're far away.

649
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:27,300
Scott: They get a VPN it goes over the internet but it's all encrypted and secure and locked down and Effectively their computer on the other side of the world is in the room Even though it's not and they can visit the web server now depending what you're doing.

650
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,970
Rym: There are other and sometimes better ways to do this sort of thing.

651
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,656
Scott: I mean, there's tons of different VPNs.

652
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:43,140
Rym: this hardware VP Yeah, I mean if you just have web services that you need to get out One viable tunnels is to have them over the internet with the tunnel or to have them over the internet with just SSL.

653
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,233
Rym: You know, you've got a login and it's encrypted.

654
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:50,796
Rym: Yep, and The real benefit of VPN aside from everything is that it's a comprehensive solution.

655
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:53,448
Rym: it basically by default Will do everything.

656
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:55,780
Rym: you don't have to worry about setting up all this extra stuff.

657
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:58,591
Rym: It basically just makes your computer as though it's there.

658
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:00,740
Rym: all the different protocols and ports and everything work.

659
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:05,880
Rym: So you don't have to change your entire security architecture to support.

660
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:09,700
Rym: You know multiple methods of ingress and egress for all your services.

661
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:16,568
Rym: You basically design them as though they'll never leave your company and then you give people VPN access if they need to access all of those services.

662
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:17,070
Scott: Yep.

663
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:20,480
Rym: It's also really really good for legacy services.

664
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Rym: You know old LAN only bullshit that needs like it can't go over routed protocols.

665
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:27,389
Scott: That's a very good example.

666
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,180
Scott: It was one of the best uses of VPN.

667
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:33,079
Scott: I've noticed lately for normal people at least is let's say you want to play some video games.

668
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,169
Scott: But you know the video games.

669
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:36,958
Scott: you got to play them over the internet.

670
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:37,380
Scott: It sucks.

671
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,710
Scott: They want you to use like an auth server or something.

672
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,574
Scott: It's not working out too.

673
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:41,940
Scott: Well, you'd rather use the LAN mode.

674
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,783
Scott: It's much easier.

675
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:44,449
Scott: You can just get your friends together.

676
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,052
Rym: land mode.

677
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:46,637
Rym: We've talked about how it's stupid pointless.

678
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:47,320
Rym: Don't need it anymore.

679
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:50,120
Rym: It's the way of the dodo and people are dropping it left and right anyway, right?

680
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:58,040
Scott: But for example, I wanted to play System Shock 2 with someone right and we have NAT routers So that makes it very difficult to play over the internet without a server.

681
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,544
Rym: Yep I mean look option one.

682
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:06,810
Rym: may one of you repost the server you make all the firewall and NAT table Bullshit tap and and while that's easy for people like us.

683
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:08,175
Rym: It's still not trivial.

684
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:09,600
Scott: Like I it's a pain in the ass.

685
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:15,007
Rym: I mean I have a little diagram of our home network and anytime we want to do something like that I gotta sit down look at that thing.

686
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:17,236
Rym: All right, is that port being used by anything else?

687
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:18,140
Rym: No, okay.

688
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,199
Rym: Is the static IP the same blah blah blah?

689
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:24,413
Rym: Nope Okay, and I gotta like do all this crap and even for professionals is not easy.

690
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,700
Rym: if you're not a professional you're fucked, right?

691
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Scott: I mean people have such problems opening the ports.

692
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:29,405
Scott: I mean people.

693
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:34,963
Scott: some people have sort of figured it out But even then it partly ever works all the time and routers are not Home.

694
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:37,220
Scott: routers are not that reliable in terms of those features.

695
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:40,435
Rym: I thought UPnP was gonna solve this forever for everyone.

696
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:41,520
Scott: It only made things worse.

697
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,538
Scott: Yeah, so what we did is use hamachi or you know, there are other alternatives to hamachi as well which is sort of a easy VPN for normal people.

698
00:41:49,558 --> 00:42:06,860
Scott: and suddenly me and this other person on the other side of the world or you know relatively far away have Created a new private network and we're both on it and it's as if our computers are just wired up to each other Directly in the same house and we can open up a game and turn on LAN mode and it just works.

699
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:10,199
Scott: And there you have it and VPNs are totally awesome like that.

700
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:20,500
Rym: Now the main the other you know a side benefit mostly from a corporate or anything secure military perspective is the VPNs Generally offer more comprehensive security.

701
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:23,129
Rym: I mean let's say you just have SSL or a tunnel or something.

702
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:42,080
Rym: if the host computer gets compromised or If the host computer is multi-homed or there are all sorts of attack vectors that you have to be very Proficient your network engineers have to really know what they're doing or you'll introduce all these extra attack vectors Through whatever, you know tunnels or whatever you've set up, but good VPN software.

703
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:46,932
Rym: I'll oftentimes you'll have this sort of Lockdown like if you use a Cisco RSA or any of that stuff.

704
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:51,310
Rym: if I turn on my VPN I put my RSA key in which one has multi-factor.

705
00:42:51,751 --> 00:43:00,760
Rym: It's something I have something I know Mm-hmm and in an independent of that there's all this other, you know similar like multiplied factor on the other side.

706
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,799
Rym: I still have to log into the domain and all that stuff.

707
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:16,000
Rym: But all that aside what it does is it locks down my computer Turns off all other multi homing all other stuff to where the only thing my computer can connect to now is my corporate network.

708
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:18,500
Scott: Yeah, and you know, you might think well, what's the point of that?

709
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,400
Scott: Right, the point of that is let's say they let you in the VPN, right?

710
00:43:21,761 --> 00:43:24,720
Scott: But they still let you use your normal internet connection in your house.

711
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:31,280
Rym: Alright, so I got my unencrypted, you know wireless connection through some shady access point that I found outside.

712
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:43,360
Scott: Yeah, Sam what you could do is you could just open up, you know You can make a tunnel and let you could Intentionally let the whole world into that VPN and now you basically just open up a gaping hole into the corporate network.

713
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,743
Scott: Congratulations.

714
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:44,984
Rym: Yep.

715
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:48,760
Rym: VPNs are also really good for corporate access from untrusted sites.

716
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,180
Rym: You kind of create this encrypted tunnel that is easy to create.

717
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:59,229
Rym: I mean some CEO guy is not gonna be able to just set up an SSH tunnel bouncing off of his Linux box or anything Yep, at least even if he's smart.

718
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:00,294
Rym: even people like us.

719
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:01,620
Rym: I can't do that quickly.

720
00:44:02,062 --> 00:44:03,709
Rym: I can't just like BAM and set that up.

721
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:03,890
Rym: Yep.

722
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,477
Scott: Another thing about VPN.

723
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:06,100
Scott: right is okay.

724
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,440
Scott: Let's say I'm a company and I got two offices right one in Connecticut and one in California far away.

725
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,951
Scott: I need these offices to sort of connect to each other right?

726
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:18,180
Scott: I want you know, everyone needs to work together.

727
00:44:18,362 --> 00:44:19,940
Scott: It should just be one network, right?

728
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,840
Scott: I can't really having two separate networks and then you know having to use internet protocols to go between.

729
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:26,608
Scott: That's risky for my business.

730
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:29,240
Scott: First of all, and second of all, it's a pain in the ass.

731
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,943
Scott: It'd be a lot easier.

732
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:33,359
Rym: think about all the BS of like dealing with your exchange server and all.

733
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,035
Rym: yeah I think all right.

734
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,760
Scott: It would be a lot easier if all the computers around the world that belong to my company We're just always on the same network, you know, the ones in offices.

735
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:54,640
Scott: So I could right I could pay for really expensive like, you know t1s and t3s That go across, you know great distances and make it so that the computers are actually on the same network.

736
00:44:54,974 --> 00:45:00,186
Rym: Yep You can also do kind of the second tier like a virtual circuit MPLS kind of thing Yeah, which is still.

737
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:01,974
Rym: basically it's the same as a t3.

738
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:10,458
Scott: It's just it's virtual Yep, but a much cheaper solution especially for a tiny company is to get a VPN and it just.

739
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:20,814
Scott: it wouldn't be sort of Like this, you know VPN that you use when you're working from home where you turn it on and turn it off Be an always-on sort of hardware VPN.

740
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:22,620
Rym: now one one way to do this.

741
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,509
Rym: No, Scott mentioned having the one big network.

742
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,800
Rym: You can also use this with multiple networks.

743
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:35,932
Rym: I mean like say I have my New York office my San Francisco office my Chicago office my my Dubai office and Every one of them has its own network with its own IP scheme.

744
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:37,600
Rym: Yeah, but I want to connect them.

745
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:39,060
Rym: I don't want to make it a flat land.

746
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,338
Rym: I want the VPN to just make them appear to be the same for different subnets.

747
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:47,840
Rym: make it easy But I still want them to connect to each other Privately and I don't want to pay for at least line.

748
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,136
Rym: I mean all the VPN does is make an encrypted tunnel through the internet.

749
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:55,851
Rym: So I only need Internet connections at every point I want to connect.

750
00:45:56,212 --> 00:46:00,187
Rym: and they all just connect to each other over the internet The same as any other internet thing.

751
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:01,311
Rym: It's no different than web track.

752
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:03,640
Scott: You're basically making a big pipe over the internet.

753
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,209
Scott: That's yours and yours alone.

754
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,020
Scott: that connects two places, you know.

755
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,800
Scott: You're basically using the internet for your own private networking needs.

756
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,379
Scott: So it's like you could run an Ethernet cable in your house.

757
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:17,558
Scott: Think of it as throwing an Ethernet cable all the way across the internet to your friend who catches it.

758
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:19,003
Scott: and now is your Ethernet cable.

759
00:46:19,264 --> 00:46:20,168
Scott: no one else can get in.

760
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:21,594
Scott: It's a. it's like a physical thing.

761
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:22,838
Rym: now there are pros and cons.

762
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:28,480
Rym: pros It has all the same backup and functionality of the internet.

763
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:29,184
Rym: It'll just route.

764
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:30,533
Scott: if the internet goes down.

765
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:31,620
Scott: your VPN goes down.

766
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:32,770
Rym: That's I was saying the pro.

767
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,000
Rym: first it routes over the internet.

768
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:36,502
Rym: So whatever BS is going on on the internet You don't care.

769
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:41,720
Rym: you only need to know the IPs of your two endpoints or an endpoints and everything just works.

770
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,180
Scott: You gotta have static IPs or else it's a little difficult.

771
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,346
Rym: Yeah, there are ways around it.

772
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:53,680
Rym: Like kamachi doesn't need it, but other ones do and you know, whatever The cons you're beholden to the internet if you don't have a fat internet pipe your VPN is gonna be slow as shit.

773
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:57,532
Scott: Yeah VPNs are slower like if your internet connection is like X fast.

774
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:00,663
Scott: the VPN is gonna be slower than that because it's doing all this Extra stuff.

775
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:06,440
Scott: It's not only is it encrypting and adding latency by doing the encryption It's also sending over more datas.

776
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:11,740
Scott: You know sort of overhead packets and things for the VPN instructions and routing and all this stuff.

777
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:13,706
Scott: So it's it's gonna slow you down.

778
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,334
Scott: So I mean you it's still good enough to do something.

779
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:22,503
Scott: That's not super super Performance intensive, but don't expect to like, you know Have your pings.

780
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:25,799
Scott: stay the same when you're playing the counter strikes because it's not it's gonna be bigger.

781
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,307
Rym: So you're a punk kid.

782
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:29,434
Rym: you want to learn how to do this stuff.

783
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:30,199
Rym: try hamachi.

784
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,002
Rym: It just works.

785
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:32,186
Scott: hamachi just works.

786
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,920
Rym: and if you get beyond hamachi real simple get some net appliance or some image.

787
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,025
Rym: There are all sorts of ways to do this.

788
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:39,773
Rym: Just find some VPN solution.

789
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:41,259
Rym: That's free and easy and open-source II.

790
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:46,931
Rym: just run it on your home network and Figure out what your out external dynamic IP is.

791
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:48,778
Rym: maybe pay for one of those DDNS services.

792
00:47:48,998 --> 00:48:00,820
Scott: one one Very good idea to try out VPN is to if you get one of those routers that you can flash the firmware on if you Put on the DD wrt or the tomato or one of those other router for alternative open source router firmwares.

793
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:05,300
Scott: Most of them have open VPN support and you can read online how to make that work.

794
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,800
Scott: And the reason you want to do this right is is the another great use of VPN, right?

795
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,440
Scott: You're on vacation somewhere you're at a convention, right?

796
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,479
Scott: You've got in your home network.

797
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:18,100
Scott: So you've got your iTunes with your music sharing, right?

798
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:23,400
Scott: But it's in your home and it's it's on your hard drive in your desktop And you don't want to pick that up and carry it with you to do a convention.

799
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,320
Scott: So but you want to listen to some music that you didn't bring with you on your iPod.

800
00:48:27,962 --> 00:48:32,958
Scott: So what you do is you turn on your laptop you open up your iTunes, you know, but a VPN to your house.

801
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,809
Scott: now It's as if your laptop is in your house.

802
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,776
Scott: So your iTunes sharing suddenly works.

803
00:48:37,797 --> 00:48:38,178
Scott: Look at that.

804
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:40,746
Scott: just do Look I can see my computer from here.

805
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:45,620
Scott: All right, you don't need to use any like your remote desktop VNC type of stuff.

806
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:51,447
Scott: You know, you can just share your files locally on your home network Securely so that you know the.

807
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:55,720
Scott: no one outside your house is gonna get your files off your computer only people in your house.

808
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,219
Scott: They're gonna get your files that you're sharing.

809
00:48:57,722 --> 00:49:02,320
Scott: You know, like you're sharing the mostly so that you can access them from downstairs or upstairs or basement.

810
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:07,688
Scott: But now if you VPN back to your house You can get your stuff and it's totally cool.

811
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,089
Scott: now.

812
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:11,520
Rym: plus as we always say you can't learn something just by wanting to learn it.

813
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,286
Rym: You have to have some application some use.

814
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:16,537
Rym: So if you want to learn VPN, just set it up.

815
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:17,280
Rym: Anyone can do it.

816
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:22,280
Rym: There's nothing stopping you and you'll learn a whole bunch of stuff about networking and VPN along the way.

817
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:29,880
Rym: But when you learn a lot of networking stuff, you'll get a useful usable thing that you will probably use on a fairly regular basis.

818
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:39,759
Scott: Yeah I mean think about how many will work from home and have VPNs and they know how to turn them on because basically all they have to do is open up the Cisco software push connect and Type in their password, but sometimes that shit don't work.

819
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:44,185
Scott: And if you learn about VPNs You'll have a much easier time telecommuting.

820
00:49:44,526 --> 00:50:00,760
Scott: and if you're much better at telecommuting and have much more reliable at doing work while telecommuting Because you know how the VPN works and you're good at getting it to work You'll work from home a lot more Probably and you'll also have more access to your own stuff in your way from the house and you'll play more games and it'll be Awesome.

821
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,121
Scott: VPN is great.

822
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:11,468
