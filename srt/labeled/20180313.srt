1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,010
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 13th, 2018.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,190
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,324
Scott: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,720
Rym: - And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,319
Rym: Tonight, Slay the Spire.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:17,980
Rym: - Hell.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,110
Scott: - Let's do this.

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:20,578
Rym: - Let's do this.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,267
Rym: Well, it's the first GeekNights since the semi-annual daylight saving time.

10
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:31,800
Rym: Not savings time, but saving time.

11
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:37,000
Rym: It's one of those things that bothers me a little bit every time I hear someone put that little extra S in there.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:49,019
Rym: But it's every year, I feel like there's more people who are, like I can understand someone not liking daylight saving time and there's a lot of arguments every way, but people seem a lot madder about it every year.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,519
Scott: Well, it's good that it's getting attention because it's definitely a problem that needs to be fixed.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,411
Scott: But I think people are confused.

15
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:59,853
Scott: People seem to be saying that they want to keep the clock the way it was because they hate losing the hour.

16
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:00,560
Scott: And it's like, no.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,294
Rym: No, that's you expanding mine meme.

18
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,319
Rym: That's the first brain.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:04,861
Scott: Right.

20
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:08,595
Scott: A lot of people are saying that like, "Oh, we should just get rid of daylight savings

21
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:08,917
Scott: time.".

22
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:09,886
Scott: Savings?

23
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,280
Scott: - Yeah, savings time.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,743
Rym: Saving.

25
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:13,140
Scott: - Yeah, that's right.

26
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,220
Scott: And it's like, no, we want permanent daylight savings time.

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,340
Rym: We want to go forward, never come back.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:19,924
Scott: That's right.

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:23,220
Scott: Even though you lose your stupid hour, like most people are upset about losing the hour.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,107
Scott: I don't give a fuck about that.

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,566
Scott: I want the sun to be up like it is right now.

32
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,340
Scott: I came here after work to do the podcast.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,807
Scott: The sun is out right now.

34
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:35,460
Scott: Yesterday, last week, when I came over here, it was pitch fucking black.

35
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,126
Scott: Right?

36
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,500
Scott: And that's only a one hour difference.

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,753
Scott: That makes a big goddamn deal.

38
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:45,359
Rym: - My whole life, I don't care if it's light when I'm on my way to work because I can't enjoy the light while I'm at work.

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,445
Rym: In fact, getting up in darkness in middle school, I had to get up at like 6.30 to go to middle school when I was a kid.

40
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,589
Rym: I got up earlier for middle school than I do now.

41
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:57,805
Scott: - Yeah, it's not like, and you know, people are like, "Oh, well, just adjust when you go to

42
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:58,006
Scott: work.".

43
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:03,639
Scott: It's like, my work is not going to let me work from 8 to 4, from 7 to 3 to get the sun to be out.

44
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:04,444
Scott: Right?

45
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,818
Scott: You know, I need the clock to be as it is.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:15,590
Rym: - But what's interesting is there's, not to derail the show, but what I see a lot of nerds try to say is that time zones themselves are bullshit.

47
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:24,540
Rym: Like, the window of discussion around daylight savings time very rapidly gets into really poorly thought out ideas from neck beardos.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,759
Rym: So, we should not abolish time zones.

49
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:35,839
Rym: I'm okay with daylight saving time because it does serve, for my own life, a pretty good purpose.

50
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,049
Scott: - But we should keep it forever.

51
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,180
Rym: - Yeah, it's a compromise.

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,877
Rym: The fact that we go forward at this time of year is good, I'm just saying, let's not ever go back.

53
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:44,320
Scott: - That's right.

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:54,707
Rym: - Maybe, in fact, if we went forward, and then the next year, we went forward again, and then did daylight saving time back and forth between these two further forward states, that'd be awesome.

55
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:55,920
Rym: I'd be totally down with that.

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,664
Scott: - Yeah, that'd be good.

57
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:58,740
Rym: - So, you got any news?

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,300
Rym: There is actually pretty big gaming news.

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,068
Scott: - What was my gaming news?

60
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,625
Scott: Oh, there's all kinds of Switch action going on, right?

61
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,759
Scott: So, there's a big update to the Switch OS.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,732
Scott: They added a bunch of stuff.

63
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,749
Scott: You can find your friends on Twitter now more easily.

64
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,808
Rym: - Because it hasn't been Switch season.

65
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,699
Rym: I played through all the games I own, and I haven't gotten new games yet.

66
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,399
Scott: - There's a Kirby game, you get a free demo.

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,146
Scott: It lets you control Kirby plus three other AI-controlled extra dudes.

68
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,693
Scott: I think you might really get four friends to play co-op Kirby with.

69
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:27,260
Scott: I'm not sure.

70
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,551
Scott: I only played the demo.

71
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:31,744
Rym: - Yeah, I don't even care about demos.

72
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,692
Rym: First-party games, high-quality franchise games, I just buy them automatically.

73
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,440
Scott: It doesn't even matter.

74
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,640
Scott: - I guess you're buying the Kirby game, though.

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,988
Rym: - Yeah, definitely.

76
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:41,080
Scott: - Anyway, so yeah, that's coming.

77
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:57,983
Scott: But, they announced it, of course, if you haven't been living under 10 rocks, you know that there's gonna be a Smash bro coming to the Switch, and the only thing we know about it is that these Splatoon characters are gonna be in it, which anyone could have predicted that the next Smash would have that.

78
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,573
Scott: The question is, is this a remake of the last Smash that was on Wii U and 3DS?

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,092
Rym: - Because frankly, that Smash never seemed to really fully come into its own.

80
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,040
Scott: - With added characters and maps, or is this an all-new Smash?

81
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:14,787
Rym: We don't know.

82
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:19,300
Rym: - Like, I never even played that Smash enough to fully grok it like I had previous Smashes.

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,762
Scott: - Nope.

84
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,517
Rym: - Partly because none of you motherfuckers ever play it with me.

85
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:33,880
Rym: No one ever brought it to a con, no one ever wanted to play it, even our friends who were good at Smash just, like, had no interest in this Smash, but they did have interest in old-ass GameCube Smash.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,540
Scott: - Well, we played the GameCube 1 a bunch, we played the Wii 1 a bunch, and then the Wii U 3DS 1 was not played as much as a bunch.

87
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:54,088
Rym: - A big problem, partly, was that the 3DS 1, the local multiplayer just did not work at all at any convention, meaning even if I found a group of people to play with, it just would break immediately, it never worked.

88
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:54,820
Scott: - Also, it never will.

89
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,822
Rym: - Yeah.

90
00:04:56,485 --> 00:05:00,527
Rym: But with this one, I... No one knows.

91
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,720
Rym: We don't know what it's gonna be like.

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,467
Rym: We literally know nothing about it.

93
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,335
Rym: The news was just, "It's

94
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:05,837
Rym: coming.".

95
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:08,419
Rym: They didn't even give us a date, did they?

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,913
Scott: - No, I think it's next year.

97
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,156
Scott: - Yeah.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,808
Scott: - But this year, I don't know.

99
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,360
Scott: I think it just gives you a year.

100
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,422
Rym: - I guess I'm feeling it, because I really like Smash, and also, the era of...

101
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:26,159
Scott: - Everyone likes Smash, but the problem is, if you don't live in the kind of social scenario where you can play this sort of thing, which is like a college dorm or something...

102
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,776
Rym: - Or at cons, if the local multiplayer works.

103
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:29,300
Scott: - Right.

104
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,179
Scott: Then it's like, how are you gonna... You know, it's like, I couldn't... I got a lot of value out of the old Smashes, 'cause I was in college, or in a place where I'm living with a bunch of nerds.

105
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,488
Scott: We'd get together often and play it.

106
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,180
Scott: But now, not really so much.

107
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:52,260
Rym: - Of course, another part of this was that, on the DS, the 3DS, the screens... That form factor doesn't really work for me as a gamer so much anymore.

108
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:58,920
Rym: A lot of the games that I play or that come out, they really are better served by a bigger screen.

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,560
Rym: And the Switch screen is this perfect sweet spot.

110
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,479
Rym: So I feel like Smash would get played a lot more.

111
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,435
Rym: And while my previous argument would have been, "I wanna carry a 3DS around with me everywhere,".

112
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:14,699
Rym: these days, I don't actually have much downtime to play games on the go.

113
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:22,459
Rym: And whenever I think, "Oh, I'll have some time to play games on the go," like when I'm traveling, I got a long subway ride, I just bring the Switch.

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,129
Rym: It ain't that big.

115
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,220
Rym: It doesn't need to be in my pocket.

116
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,349
Scott: - I should bring up some old GeekNights here, like, "PSP, that thing's so enormous.

117
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,778
Scott: Ah, DS, nice and small and

118
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:31,040
Scott: cozy.".

119
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,740
Rym: - Yeah, and I'm not gonna lie, the kinds of games I play changed.

120
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:44,100
Rym: Also, game design changed in that there aren't as many games that are fit for purpose for short playtime small screen.

121
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:48,720
Rym: A lot of the games that come out now, like, there isn't a new Advance Wars.

122
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,780
Scott: - I find that I use the Switch as just a console on the TV and don't play it mobily that much, except occasionally in bed, but not a lot.

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,540
Rym: - When I play it mobily, it's because I bring it with me on a trip.

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,020
Scott: - Usually, I just use my iPad and my iPhone to play iOS games, and my 3DS suffers as a result.

125
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,899
Rym: - Yeah, but like, on a trip, I'll bring it in a hotel room, I'll set it up.

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,619
Scott: - I guess you got Android phone and no tablets, you're not really playing any games.

127
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,980
Rym: - Yeah, but even then, there aren't that many tablet-y games I would play on my phone, other than, like, board game ports.

128
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,200
Scott: - I have Civ 6 on my iPad.

129
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,103
Rym: - Yeah, well, yeah, you have an iPad with Civ 6.

130
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,920
Rym: I just play it on my laptop, 'cause it works fine.

131
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,839
Scott: - I got Hearthstone.

132
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,020
Rym: - Also, Civ 6, again, that is not a game.

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,652
Rym: What am I gonna do on my subway commute?

134
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:27,639
Rym: Take one turn?

135
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,400
Rym: That's not gonna happen, I'm not feeling that.

136
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,980
Rym: A giant multiplayer robot won't work on it, 'cause it's not a real computer.

137
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,820
Rym: But I feel like this Smash is gonna get a lot more play from our crew than the previous two Smashes.

138
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,400
Scott: - I mean, it's like, I have to get it, but I actually feel like what's gonna happen is I'm gonna buy it and not play it that much.

139
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,200
Rym: - Well, we should just play it, 'cause neither one of us was ever that good at Smash.

140
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,779
Scott: - Yeah, just like all these other things we should just play that we have.

141
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Rym: - Yeah, but I feel like we might play this, compared to, like, I feel like the Rocket League ship sailed.

142
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,839
Rym: You won't play Overwatch for some reason.

143
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,525
Scott: - Rocket League.

144
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:02,700
Scott: I did play a whole bunch.

145
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,720
Rym: - Yeah, but you don't anymore.

146
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,500
Scott: - I tried recently, and it was way worse, and now I've got too many other games.

147
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:12,379
Scott: But Rocket League was not a situation where I felt like I bought this and didn't get my money's worth.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,278
Scott: - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,300
Scott: - Plus, I did not re-buy Rocket League on the Switch.

150
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:24,720
Scott: I bought it on PC, I played it a whole bunch on Steam, I had enough my fill of it, and it was good times, and I can always go back to it, it's still alive.

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:37,958
Rym: - Yeah, but I guess it's definitely, you know, when we get to the, like, we're talking about Slay the Spire, a pretty new, like, not even fully out yet PC game, it is definitely video game season now.

152
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:48,179
Rym: Between the consoles and the PC games, there's so much video game action going on, it's actually really hurting my RPG and tabletop gaming right now.

153
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,079
Scott: - When's the last time you played a RPG?

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,467
Rym: - That's the problem.

155
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,399
Rym: That's a big problem in my life right now.

156
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:59,100
Rym: Partly because the kinds of events I would play RPGs, actually I played an RPG at the last PAX.

157
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,179
Scott: - Sure, me too.

158
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,119
Rym: - Yeah, and I feel like I should play one of those coming PAX, because it's four days.

159
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,200
Rym: But we'll see about the Smash.

160
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:11,860
Rym: I do really wonder how different it'll be from the previous Smash.

161
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,199
Rym: That same question actually is much more pressing when it comes to the upcoming Mario Tennis, which I don't trust at all.

162
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:29,060
Rym: But at the same time, the only way to know will be for us to buy it, because as far as I can tell, to this day, there's no one on Earth who is capable of reviewing the new Mario Tennis.

163
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:32,540
Rym: to let me know if it is a failure or not in the ways that I care.

164
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,800
Scott: - Mario Tennis.

165
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,639
Rym: - Mario Tennis.

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:45,279
Rym: So in some super minor news, we were talking the other day, talking about PAX and games we should bring, and the topic of Fireball Island came up.

167
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Scott: - So if you don't know, Fireball Island is a game that was advertised heavily on TV during our childhood, and is basically a big, fancy, expensive board game.

168
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,680
Scott: that was basically not a very good game.

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,498
Scott: It was a roll your dice, move your mice kind of situation.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Rym: - So actually, there's more to this.

171
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,760
Rym: It is way better of a game than you remember.

172
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,920
Rym: I'm not saying it's good, but there's more going on than you think.

173
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:11,320
Rym: It's got the barest hints of the kinds of things we like in modern Euros.

174
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
Scott: - It's a lot like Mouse Trap.

175
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,220
Scott: The game focuses on its plastic toy aspect, and not so much in the game aspect.

176
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,680
Scott: There's a volcano is the main feature of the game.

177
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,520
Scott: that erupts, and the fireball comes down at the volcano.

178
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,119
Scott: It rolls around and kills your dudes.

179
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,400
Rym: - Direct player conflict, get the McGuffin and get out.

180
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,528
Rym: There's stuff going on.

181
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,460
Rym: It is not the worst game.

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,139
Rym: It's not just Candyland or Uncle Wiggly.

183
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,940
Scott: - The point is, this game has been out of print for a super long time, for somewhat obvious reasons.

184
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
Rym: - There's a very similar game.

185
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,160
Rym: I don't know if it was the exact same kind of board almost.

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,979
Scott: - There was the shark one.

187
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,659
Rym: - There's the Micro Machines one.

188
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,800
Scott: - The shark one.

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,840
Scott: There was a whole category of board games for kids that involved elaborate Mouse Trap, obviously already mentioned.

190
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,560
Rym: - Oh no, the Micro Machines one is not the one I'm thinking of.

191
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,060
Rym: I'm thinking of a different game entirely.

192
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:12,340
Scott: Anyway, so what happened here is somebody has acquired the license and is making a remake of this Fireball Island board game.

193
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,915
Scott: It will be at PAX East on a table somewhere.

194
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,739
Scott: And I was like, "Hey, you should get the original and put it on the adjacent table for comparison

195
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:20,920
Scott: purposes.".

196
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,236
Rym: - So we all go to eBay and see, "Alright, what, 20 bucks to get a copy of this busted old

197
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:26,520
Rym: game?".

198
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,560
Scott: - No, like hundreds of dollars.

199
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,380
Rym: - It's pretty rare, apparently.

200
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,519
Scott: - Well, it's not rare, it's just, you know, it's out of print and people are willing to pay more for it.

201
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Rym: - I mean, I'm looking at it like there's an auction going on right now that people are bidding on, like 130 bucks for this board game.

202
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,991
Scott: - Yeah, not paying 130 bucks for that.

203
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,060
Rym: - No, no, no, but I do have a copy of Fireball Island, actually, that's in really good condition.

204
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,772
Scott: - Go get it.

205
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,600
Scott: - Put it on eBay.

206
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:57,279
Rym: I'm gonna call my mom and see if she'll mail it to me.

207
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:07,580
Rym: And I realized, because of this, like I always assumed, 'cause I have a huge board game collection from my childhood, and some of these games are actually really vintage.

208
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,872
Rym: Like, one of them's from the '20s.

209
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,000
Rym: We got a bunch of board games.

210
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,660
Rym: Like, I have a lot of '50s and '60s era American tabletop games.

211
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:26,140
Rym: And perusing eBay, a lot of these games are actually worth more money than I expected, which is real interesting.

212
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,600
Rym: So, I'm gonna dig into that.

213
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,380
Rym: Maybe I'll do an unboxing if I get my mom.

214
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,420
Rym: I'm gonna get my mom to mail me, like, all these old board games just to do something with them.

215
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,220
Scott: - Yeah, where are you gonna put them?

216
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,378
Rym: - Uh, eBay.

217
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:43,060
Rym: My mom's moving anyway, so I feel like-- - Is she still staying in Arizona?

218
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,369
Rym: - Ain't no, hell no.

219
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:45,880
Rym: No one wants to be in Arizona.

220
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,518
Rym: Actually, my brother's getting out of Arizona, too.

221
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,560
Rym: Pretty much my entire family that lives in Arizona is-- - They all went there, and now they're leaving.

222
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,300
Rym: - They're GTFO of Arizona.

223
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,157
Scott: - Good job.

224
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:07,500
Rym: - But, uh, I'm gonna see if I can get Fireball Island, the original, we'll bring it to PAX, we'll play it once, probably be disappointed, but get some good pictures of ourselves playing it.

225
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
Scott: - I wasn't disappointed because my expectation is exactly right.

226
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,500
Scott: You can't be disappointed unless you have a high expectation.

227
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,860
Rym: - I feel like this game will exceed your expectations.

228
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,420
Rym: I'm not saying it will reach a level of good.

229
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:23,479
Rym: Like in Civ VI, it's not gonna hit the golden age, but it might age out of the dark age.

230
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,060
Rym: - Have you played Civ VI with the expansion?

231
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,416
Rym: - No.

232
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,679
Rym: - I have, it's, uh, there's a lot going on in there.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,700
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

234
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,019
Rym: So, I've been following this channel, and it's not just this channel, there's a whole genre of YouTube videos along these lines now.

235
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Rym: Kind of like how, so the speedrunning scene, like the modern speedrunning scene is so far advanced beyond what it was a decade ago that it's unrecognizable.

236
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:17,779
Rym: Like, the state of modern speedrunning is so technical and so amazing that it kind of blows my mind because I remember an era where Scott and I watched a video that was being passed around the pre-YouTube internet, and this video was, "Holy shit, look at this speedrun of Mario

237
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:18,320
Rym: 3.".

238
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,020
Scott: - Yeah, I remember that video.

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,740
Rym: - Yeah, that video was like, that changed everything.

240
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:33,358
Scott: Like, we didn't even, like, now we know-- - It's like, 'cause we thought we were good at video games, and then it wasn't until like the year 2001 or 2002 that we saw this video, we're like, "Oh, that's what it looks like when you're good at video

241
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:33,520
Scott: games.".

242
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:42,880
Rym: - Yup, and then we learned it was a TazBot before Taz was like the term that we decided to use for that kind of thing, like, the heady days.

243
00:14:43,420 --> 00:15:01,658
Rym: So, another thing is happening that's sort of definitely adjacent to the speedrunning community, and this is people have the technical expertise and the know-how and the time and the energy to take video games, both old and new, deconstruct them, reverse-engineer them, figure stuff out.

244
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:05,960
Rym: Like, in the old days, there'd be the rumor of, "Maybe you could bring Aeris back.

245
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,920
Rym: "Maybe, even though you can't bring Aeris back, "what if there was code in there to bring her back?

246
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:12,051
Rym: "that was just cut out of the

247
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:12,374
Rym: game?".

248
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:21,420
Rym: And a lot of YouTube channels and a lot of smart people are deconstructing old games to figure those kinds of questions out in detail.

249
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:25,940
Rym: These videos, in particular, are off-camera secrets.

250
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:42,600
Rym: They're taking games like Pokemon Snap, or in the video I'm going to link to, Chrono Trigger, and spending 20-plus minutes going out of bounds with modified ROMs to show you things that were off-camera, things that are in rooms you could never get to, things that were hidden.

251
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,340
Rym: Why are there 100 Luigis under this one room in this game?

252
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,379
Rym: Like, that kind of stuff.

253
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,980
Rym: And it is way more technical and way more fascinating than you might think.

254
00:15:52,241 --> 00:16:05,200
Scott: It's like, there'll be memory space on the cartridge where you could draw maps for levels, and someone drew some level in there, but they never actually added that room to anywhere in the game, so they'll be like, "There's pipes in the room, "but they're not connected to any other pipes.

255
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,197
Scott: "You can never reach it unless you hack the

256
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:07,379
Scott: ROM.".

257
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:07,721
Scott: Yep.

258
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:10,260
Rym: But what if you could get behind the shopkeeper?

259
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,854
Rym: Is that chest-openable?

260
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,560
Rym: The answer is yes, and it's really funny.

261
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,420
Scott: Is it Mimic?

262
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,838
Rym: There's a bunch of gold in it, it looks like.

263
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,085
Rym: Oh.

264
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:28,680
Rym: So there's all this ridiculous stuff that is really just artifacts of the way games are developed, but it's fascinating to see them explored in detail.

265
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:35,280
Rym: This is the kind of video that if you showed it to Rym when he was 11 years old, I would have flipped out.

266
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,279
Rym: This would have been magic.

267
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:36,740
Scott: Yep.

268
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,240
Scott: All right, so another Chrono Trigger news.

269
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:44,960
Scott: If you didn't know, Chrono Trigger was recently released for Steam, which is new.

270
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,103
Scott: Yep.

271
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:50,613
Scott: The last Chrono Trigger release was for iOS and whatnot, and that release is awful.

272
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:51,140
Scott: It's garbage.

273
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,540
Scott: It's one of the worst things ever.

274
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Rym: I'm not gonna lie, the actual last release of Chrono Trigger was my SNES emulator.

275
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,379
Scott: The actual last good release of Chrono Trigger was in the DS.

276
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:03,439
Rym: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one.

277
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,680
Scott: If you want to play Chrono Trigger, the DS version is the best version.

278
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,117
Scott: If you can acquire a copy, it actually should not be difficult to do so.

279
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,720
Scott: I don't think they are expensive or rare like SNES Chrono Trigger cartridges are.

280
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,700
Scott: But anyway, so the one that was released...

281
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:17,983
Rym: 20 bucks.

282
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:18,880
Scott: Yeah, you can just buy it.

283
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:28,580
Scott: The one that was released on Steam, however, was basically the mobile one ported just directly to PC and it's a piece of garbage.

284
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:34,880
Rym: So they made a garbage port and then they ported the garbage port to make more garbage.

285
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:36,279
Scott: Correct.

286
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,590
Scott: Somebody put a very clever tweet out regarding this issue.

287
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:44,600
Scott: What happened to it?

288
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,629
Scott: Let's see if I can find it again.

289
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:46,235
Scott: Here it is.

290
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,380
Scott: This is a port from mobile.

291
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,309
Scott: It only disappoints, but Steam will refund my 15 silver points.

292
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:55,329
Rym: That is pro.

293
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,520
Scott: If you have played Chrono Trigger, you will find that humorous.

294
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:02,740
Scott: If you don't find that humorous, you need to correct your life and play Chrono Trigger.

295
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,200
Scott: But anyway, but not the PC version or the mobile version.

296
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:08,220
Scott: The DS version or the SNES version only.

297
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:14,620
Scott: Anyway, so the actual thing of the day is this guy named Tim Rogers.

298
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,066
Scott: If you don't know who that is, he's the video ball guy.

299
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:21,880
Scott: A guy that we are high on and have been high on since we knew about his existence.

300
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,037
Rym: He is a person for whom I have deep respect and meeting him in person only solidified that.

301
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,140
Scott: He is a true video game expert.

302
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,947
Scott: He knows so much about video games.

303
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:47,880
Rym: To this day, and it was sort of an inside baseball thing, but he told us how he figured out the timing for one video game based on an older video game and the thing he said there.

304
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:58,960
Scott: I think he said the time it takes to charge up your shot in video balls, the exact same number of milliseconds it takes to charge up your shot in Gunstar Heroes.

305
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,639
Rym: I forget what game it was.

306
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,904
Rym: But anyway, it's that level of care and attention to detail.

307
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:13,719
Scott: Anyway, so this guy now, if you wonder what he's doing after the failure of video ball, the sad failure, is he is working for Kotaku making funny videos.

308
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:15,639
Scott: And he is narrating them.

309
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:28,539
Scott: In a way, it is much like I guess like Yahtzee or whatever, where you have this humorous yet informative narrator talking over a bunch of video game footage with no actual people footage.

310
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:41,467
Scott: But on the other hand, his style is very unique because he goes obviously way deeper and way more informative and whatnot than other people do because his video game knowledge is so deep.

311
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,186
Scott: And here is a video to decide if you like what he does.

312
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:54,417
Scott: He rips that new Chrono Trigger Steam port a new asshole by saying basically here we all know it's awful, right?

313
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:59,290
Scott: But look, if you just do these things and then he actually does those things, he's like you can make it good.

314
00:19:59,371 --> 00:19:59,939
Scott: Do these things.

315
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:12,460
Rym: It's interesting how Chrono Trigger, probably the most notable aspect of that game is that no one has ever been able to do anything like it again successfully.

316
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,804
Rym: No one has ever done a sequel to it.

317
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:16,118
Rym: No one has ever been like.

318
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:30,626
Rym: it fills this very specific core area of gaming history and nostalgia that people are endlessly trying to recreate and reproduce and it's unique in that regard.

319
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:41,217
Rym: And yet this part of it is just bad and it's bad in these very specific ways but it's hard to argue what a truly good port would do.

320
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,967
Scott: Watch this video.

321
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:48,585
Scott: It will tell you exactly what a truly good port will do and that is take the original game, make it widescreen, the end.

322
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,424
Rym: But what about the idea?

323
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,819
Rym: A lot of people want the HD remake.

324
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:59,580
Rym: maybe do like take the choreomic character designs and make them like really in the game and stuff with pixel art.

325
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,081
Rym: No.

326
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:00,709
Rym: Why not?

327
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,480
Scott: Don't do that.

328
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:01,965
Rym: Why not?

329
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:02,591
Rym: It's bad.

330
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:03,319
Rym: Why is it bad?

331
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,852
Scott: No one wants that.

332
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:05,660
Rym: A lot of people seem to.

333
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,580
Rym: a lot of people say they want that.

334
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,124
Scott: No they don't.

335
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,558
Rym: But they say they want it.

336
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,337
Scott: Ask them to draw that and show you what it will look like.

337
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:25,679
Rym: It's just fascinating that Chrono Trigger a remake of Chrono Trigger that is faithful to the feelings of the original is to this day probably better than even like the barest.

338
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:29,923
Rym: any attempt to make a sequel to it would do worse than just re-releasing it.

339
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:38,511
Rym: In the meta moment the GeekNights Book Club book is Homa's The Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson.

340
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,336
Rym: I'm well into the Odysseus parts.

341
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:43,257
Rym: I'm past the Telemachus parts.

342
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,400
Rym: At least the initial Telemachus parts.

343
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,477
Scott: I'm doing other stuff.

344
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,986
Scott: You're not reading.

345
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,046
Rym: As soon as you read even a little bit of it.

346
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,096
Rym: you're just going to burn through it.

347
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:51,804
Rym: It's real good.

348
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:52,228
Scott: Maybe.

349
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:52,915
Scott: I'm feeling it.

350
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:54,531
Scott: I keep forgetting like when I get home.

351
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,146
Scott: that is not a thing that comes to my mind.

352
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,076
Scott: I got so much shit going on.

353
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:01,096
Rym: All you got to do is read like the first chapter and you'll be like oh alright I got this.

354
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,005
Scott: I have to remember too.

355
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,803
Scott: I think I might try to start reading it on my phone.

356
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:04,794
Scott: that way I'll get through it.

357
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:07,460
Rym: That's how I've been reading it because I can burn through a chapter while I'm pooping.

358
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:13,139
Rym: But it's real good and I'm not going to belabor the point but it is the current GeekNights Book Club book.

359
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,178
Rym: We're going to do a show on it at some point in the near future.

360
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:16,452
Scott: If you're literate you should read it.

361
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:17,180
Rym: You should.

362
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,994
Rym: You should also note that the GeekNights Book Club has actually done a lot of books over the years.

363
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:23,520
Scott: Really?

364
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,194
Rym: Yeah there's a ton of them in there.

365
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,347
Scott: It takes so long to do them though.

366
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,070
Rym: Yeah but we've been doing GeekNights for like 13 years.

367
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,291
Scott: We've read a lot of books.

368
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:30,575
Scott: So 13 books.

369
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:37,599
Rym: We kind of cheated because we did some books we'd already read in the early days and that kind of thing.

370
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:39,052
Rym: I think we did.

371
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,865
Rym: The Sun Also Rises at one point or no we did Fair World of Arms.

372
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:43,580
Scott: Yeah I hadn't read it at that point.

373
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,478
Rym: Yeah which was weird because I've read that book like five times.

374
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:50,701
Rym: But anyway otherwise we're going to be live at PAX East 2018.

375
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:56,461
Rym: Unless Scott is still sick by that in which case I will be live at PAX East 2018.

376
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:58,700
Rym: The Top 40 Tabletop Games You Must Play.

377
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,276
Rym: We did the Trial Run at MAGFest.

378
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:00,983
Rym: It went really well.

379
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:03,166
Rym: This is the for real version.

380
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:17,626
Rym: If you're wondering why this is not the capture the flag show we promised on the last episode of GeekNights we're deferring that because Slay the Spire is a current new hotness and I think it's more important to talk about it now.

381
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,525
Rym: Capture the Flag can wait.

382
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:20,838
Rym: We've waited 13 years.

383
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:21,828
Rym: We can wait another month.

384
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:29,140
Rym: So it's not that often that we review a PC game because it's hard to get Ryn to play one.

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,558
Rym: It's hard to get Scott to play one.

386
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:35,139
Rym: Yeah Overwatch probably the biggest PC game right now.

387
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,888
Scott: It's not the same category.

388
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:36,680
Rym: Right up there with Hearthstone.

389
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,554
Scott: It's not the same category of game.

390
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:42,677
Rym: But anyway Slay the Spire isn't even really out yet.

391
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,051
Rym: It's early access.

392
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:44,880
Scott: We've got to be very clear.

393
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,132
Scott: So not only is it early access but on top of the early access I've chosen to play beta version.

394
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,990
Scott: So I'm getting the early.

395
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,628
Scott: All you have to do is in Steam when you install it you can go to the properties of the game.

396
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:56,556
Rym: It's worth it to do so.

397
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,544
Scott: And you can choose the beta version instead of the stable version.

398
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,200
Scott: You'll be even more early access.

399
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,312
Scott: It doesn't cost or you don't need a password or code or anything.

400
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:19,388
Rym: But it says a lot about Slay the Spire that we think it's worth reviewing now before it's actually out and we're both playing it in lieu of other games like Civ 6's new expansion.

401
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:19,913
Scott: Right.

402
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:31,045
Scott: So there's a if you don't know in the Netrunner world there's a community called stimhack and that's sort of like the center for Netrunner internet community activities is this website stimhack.

403
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:31,913
Scott: They got articles.

404
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:32,740
Scott: They run a Slack.

405
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,690
Scott: They run a forum.

406
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,398
Scott: They run everything.

407
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:34,540
Scott: Right.

408
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:50,906
Scott: So and some of the people at the top of stimhack the Netrunner organizer types they went and made this game company and developed this game using lots of Netrunner resources not official Netrunner resources from the company Fantasy Flight but community resources.

409
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:55,937
Rym: Like a bunch of nerds who know a lot about collectible or non-collectible card games.

410
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,834
Scott: Get your Netrunner players to play test.

411
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:58,540
Scott: Get their advice.

412
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,451
Scott: Netrunner players are like the smartest card gamers there are.

413
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,966
Scott: Let's use their knowledge in this community to build this game.

414
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:09,876
Scott: and in fact there's a Slay the Spire channel on the Netrunner.

415
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:18,685
Scott: stimhack Slack and the devs of Slay the Spire are in there and you can like report bugs there and they'll talk to you there right because that's the inside baseball on this game.

416
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,220
Scott: So what the hell is Slay the Spire?

417
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:31,899
Scott: So Slay the Spire is a roguelike where basically you have a map with nodes and you can proceed up the map to the top and you got to get up to the top of the map three times beat three bosses and then you beat the game.

418
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:33,673
Scott: And you can follow different paths.

419
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:39,185
Scott: Each spot on the map is either going to be a shop or a question mark mystery thing.

420
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,822
Scott: Sort of like FTL right?

421
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,459
Rym: I was about to say it's a lot like FTL.

422
00:25:43,164 --> 00:25:48,180
Scott: Or most of the time it's a fight and the fights are pretty much Final Fantasy RPG fights.

423
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,329
Rym: But here's the rub.

424
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,400
Scott: You stand on the left bad guys on the right and you fight.

425
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,610
Rym: And it's roguelike.

426
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,160
Rym: so you're like collecting things and improving yourself along the way.

427
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,875
Scott: If you die you die.

428
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:58,339
Scott: Game over.

429
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,000
Rym: Maybe you're hurting yourself along the way.

430
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,920
Rym: But the other the other part of this the reason this game is so interesting is that it's roguelike X deck builder.

431
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,381
Scott: So it's like Dominion right?

432
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:13,252
Scott: If you ever played Dominion the board game the card game whatever.

433
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:13,796
Scott: Right?

434
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:16,200
Scott: You start your game with a basic, very basic deck.

435
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:17,249
Scott: You fill your hand.

436
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,948
Scott: You play as many cards as you can to do as much as you want.

437
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:24,360
Scott: And then discard your whole hand including unused cards.

438
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:25,229
Scott: draw a whole new hand.

439
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:31,046
Scott: If you run out of cards in your deck you shuffle your discards back in and keep going.

440
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:35,899
Rym: Now I cannot express to you why I think that us talking about this game is pretty high praise.

441
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:43,659
Rym: Because we generally and I think we have a very low opinion of most deck builders because Dominion set the bar pretty high.

442
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,420
Rym: Almost everyone who tried to make a deck builder since Dominion has made an objectively worse experience in every possible way.

443
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:50,903
Rym: Right.

444
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:54,905
Rym: There are very vanishingly few good deck builders in my opinion.

445
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:56,400
Scott: This is a single player experience right?

446
00:26:56,621 --> 00:27:01,919
Scott: But basically the thing that makes this game magical is that you sit in there and you see these two bad guys.

447
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:07,287
Scott: And not only are they sitting there it tells you exactly what the bad guys are going to do.

448
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:09,449
Scott: This guy is going to attack you for 15 damage.

449
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,979
Rym: This guy is going to give you a minor negative effect.

450
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,060
Scott: This guy is going to curse you or some shit.

451
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,619
Scott: And you look at what you've got and you have all the fucking time in the world to figure out how to play your hand.

452
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:20,380
Scott: You're like well he's going to do 15 damage.

453
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:29,639
Scott: maybe I'll just play these three block cards to block for 15 and thus I'll take no damage this turn and I can worry about doing damage the next turn because it keeps going until someone dies.

454
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,594
Rym: And it's very low pressure as a result.

455
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:32,805
Rym: There's no timer or anything.

456
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:33,512
Rym: You just sit and think.

457
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:39,920
Scott: Well there is a timer in the top right and you can get achievements for beating the game faster but you don't actually care unless you're speed running.

458
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,557
Scott: But yeah.

459
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:51,612
Scott: So the game ends up being tons of fun because when you beat some bad guys or go to the shop you start getting more cards upgrading cards, remove cards from your deck.

460
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,440
Rym: Now again full disclosure.

461
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,600
Scott: Not only are there cards there's also potions you can get.

462
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,840
Scott: you can hold three potions and use them whenever you want.

463
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,275
Rym: We'll talk about the details of it but these details may change substantially.

464
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:01,610
Rym: The game is in early access.

465
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:07,700
Scott: You get these relics along the way that you can't really get rid of at least as far as I know and the relics all give you special powers that are constant.

466
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:15,693
Scott: Also there are some of the cards you get aren't just attacks and defenses.

467
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,411
Scott: They're like power cards.

468
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:22,500
Scott: You play them once and then now you have a power for the rest of that particular combat.

469
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:24,903
Scott: So sort of like a power card is almost like a relic.

470
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:30,340
Scott: only you have to spend some actions and mana during your turn in order to get it out there into the game.

471
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,651
Rym: But all this combined.

472
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:32,804
Rym: because it's a single player.

473
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:34,620
Scott: It takes a space in your deck you have to draw it too.

474
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:42,559
Rym: Because it's a single player experience and because it is a video game it does the kinds of things that say Dominion wouldn't be able to do.

475
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:47,449
Rym: It doesn't need to worry about cards being balanced in light of each other.

476
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,811
Rym: They're just balanced in light of it's a roguelike.

477
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:51,086
Rym: Maybe you found a great card.

478
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:51,510
Rym: Cool.

479
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,319
Rym: Let's see what happens.

480
00:28:53,845 --> 00:29:04,440
Rym: And in terms of like the powers and the relics and the things it just it ends up being a very casual experience where a lot of the powers can be the kinds of things you cannot do with a physical card game.

481
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:07,369
Rym: Like every time you draw this card Hearthstone style.

482
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:09,328
Rym: Oh draw another copy of that card.

483
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:10,095
Rym: It's yours now.

484
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:10,620
Rym: Awesome.

485
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:15,939
Rym: Or here's a card that if it comes into your hand you can play it but then it goes away forever.

486
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:16,943
Scott: Burn it.

487
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,367
Scott: Exhaust it.

488
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:21,570
Scott: Any card that says exhaust when you play it will disappear at least until the next fight.

489
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,352
Rym: Or like you've played Dominion you get curses right?

490
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:23,959
Rym: Curses suck.

491
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:27,651
Rym: In this game there's a bunch of different kinds of curse type things.

492
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:28,499
Scott: And they'll damage you.

493
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,974
Rym: Some of them are like at the end of your turn if it's still in your hand take it damage.

494
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:34,196
Rym: Some of them are ethereal.

495
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:39,773
Rym: so you'll get curses that clog up your hand and you gotta try to like burn them or get rid of them or something.

496
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,240
Rym: But once you draw them then they go away.

497
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,540
Scott: There's lots of interesting strategies going on.

498
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,126
Scott: for example there'll be a card like Power Shield right?

499
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:47,510
Scott: It costs 2 mana.

500
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,954
Scott: it gives you a ton of blocks.

501
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:50,660
Scott: so that's pretty good.

502
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,328
Scott: if there's a bad guy doing a ton of damage you play that you're alright.

503
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,944
Scott: It does damage back to the bad guy every time they hit it.

504
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:58,905
Scott: So it's like alright that's not bad.

505
00:29:58,925 --> 00:29:59,672
Scott: I'll take that bonus.

506
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:10,400
Scott: But some bad guys do damage in single hits that are high damage and some bad guys do damage like I hit you for 1 damage 10 times instead of 10 damage 1 time.

507
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:14,359
Scott: they get hit by the flame barrier 10 fucking times and just die.

508
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:23,870
Scott: So you gotta like be prepared for all the different bad guys that you know of in the game and sort of build your deck to handle any situation and a lot of times I'll start.

509
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,150
Scott: you know you look at the cards you start getting as you play cause you don't have much choice.

510
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,000
Scott: it's a lot of randomness.

511
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:31,130
Rym: Every time you beat a fight you pick from one of like 3 cards.

512
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:34,764
Scott: And what relics you get is kind of random too.

513
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,805
Scott: it's like you can just get the deck you want every time.

514
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,613
Scott: you know you gotta make the best of what you're given.

515
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,551
Rym: But that is the power of a deck builder.

516
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:47,166
Rym: the point of a deck builder is that you literally construct your deck from the options available in the course of the game.

517
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:50,059
Rym: you can't just design the perfect deck you gotta roll with the punches.

518
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,339
Scott: Yeah otherwise they make like the perfect deck every time right now.

519
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:57,088
Scott: So you might start the game like I wanna make poison and never see any poison cards like well too bad.

520
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:57,168
Scott: Yup.

521
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:02,924
Scott: But you know sometimes like I did get the poison deck once just I kept getting off for these awesome poison cards.

522
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:03,693
Scott: I got every card in one.

523
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:06,340
Rym: I gotta tell ya when you got a bunch of poison it feels real good.

524
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,923
Scott: But then you get up and it's a bad guy and it's like poison doesn't do much to that bad guy.

525
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:11,206
Scott: Yup.

526
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,637
Scott: It's just like well fuck me I gotta have 100% poison deck builder.

527
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:19,731
Rym: Like FTL I'm all about a certain strategy and then I run up against a guy who just has way too many shields.

528
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:20,863
Rym: there's nothing I can do about it.

529
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,080
Scott: Yup exactly.

530
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:28,740
Rym: So I wanna get into the details of why this game is so fun but again I just cannot stress enough.

531
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:34,140
Scott: So the game has these daily challenges first which they are working on right now and they keep making them more and more interesting.

532
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:38,799
Scott: Basically it modifies the game in interesting ways and then changes every day.

533
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,394
Scott: There's also this ascension mode.

534
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:50,620
Scott: so after you beat the game enough you get this ascension mode where like ascension 1, ascension 2, ascension 3 where the game gets harder and harder and harder and harder so you can challenge your skills.

535
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,626
Rym: But everything we're about to say from this point on might change drastically and I just wanna be very clear about that.

536
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,537
Scott: This is early access and we're playing early access beta mode.

537
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,274
Scott: yet the game doesn't really crash.

538
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,112
Scott: it totally works and it's totally super fun.

539
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:03,607
Rym: The game is already fun enough to be worth buying.

540
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:11,019
Rym: if they never improve this game further it is worth the price of admission and you can play it for a month or two before you got bored with it.

541
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,639
Rym: We have nothing changed.

542
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,849
Scott: It has two classes but there's a spot to put a third class.

543
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:18,416
Rym: I much prefer playing with the girl, the middle one.

544
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,746
Rym: Because I like playing the poison strategy.

545
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,400
Scott: but the economy of the game.

546
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,880
Scott: The two classes are pretty much tough.

547
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,359
Scott: person who does a lot of damage in a few hits.

548
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,507
Rym: It's pretty simple.

549
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:32,598
Scott: It has a lot of defense not really, they're pretty equal.

550
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,547
Scott: It can also do lots of defense.

551
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:39,950
Scott: and the other one is play a lot of cards, do a lot of combos kind of thing.

552
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:40,698
Rym: So it's interesting.

553
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:48,618
Rym: the economy of the game as it is now really comes down to, like you know in Dominion you start the game with a certain number of coppers and then some duchies.

554
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,224
Rym: Well and estates not duchies.

555
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:52,800
Rym: So it's similar.

556
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,184
Rym: you start with some attacks and some blocks like a really straight forward deck.

557
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:58,480
Scott: And then you get like two good cards.

558
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:07,059
Rym: And the main economy of the game is that as you go through each level as you go along the way it's very difficult to heal.

559
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,200
Rym: Taking damage is not something you want to do under almost any circumstance.

560
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,311
Scott: Whenever you get to a campfire where you can heal, you can heal.

561
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,087
Scott: I think what 30% of your max HP.

562
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,380
Rym: Yeah not a lot.

563
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:24,555
Scott: Or if you don't need the healing, campfires have all sorts of other powers.

564
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:28,880
Scott: So by default at a campfire if you don't heal, you can upgrade a card in your deck which is great.

565
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,788
Rym: This is really cool.

566
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,315
Rym: So like an attack does 6 damage if you upgrade it.

567
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,385
Rym: The attack costs the same but does like 8 or 9 damage.

568
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,486
Scott: Every card has like an upgraded plus version.

569
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:38,253
Scott: that's way better.

570
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:42,113
Scott: and like your deck when you keep going and good at the game is going to be all upgraded cards.

571
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:52,459
Rym: You don't want no crappy but everything is always a choice like that and it's always a difficult choice because upgrading a card is great but you have very few opportunities to ever heal damage.

572
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:56,052
Scott: Well every time you beat a top boss, you start over.

573
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:56,638
Rym: On health.

574
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,547
Scott: You get full heals.

575
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:57,850
Scott: Yeah.

576
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,679
Scott: You gotta get unless some daily challenges disable that.

577
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,012
Rym: Oh interesting.

578
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:02,440
Scott: But anyway.

579
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:16,292
Rym: But as a result, so you're basically, you're playing this economy of try to at almost any cost prevent damage to yourself because it doesn't matter how many turns it takes to beat the enemy unless the enemy has a turn related power.

580
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:19,425
Scott: Like some bad guys it's like okay keep blocking all my attacks.

581
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:20,679
Rym: I'll just do more damage every turn.

582
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,377
Scott: I just keep increasing my damage to where now you can't block it all.

583
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,810
Scott: or there's a turn where you got unlucky and didn't draw any blocking cards.

584
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:28,620
Scott: Congratulations.

585
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,010
Scott: The only way you could have beat me was by attacking all out and killing me before I became even more dangerous.

586
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:34,393
Scott: Yep.

587
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:35,262
Scott: If you did not do this.

588
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:35,808
Scott: Ha ha ha.

589
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:42,840
Rym: So the just variety of effects that you can apply or that cards can do is already really interesting.

590
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,225
Rym: Even with, there's not that many cards now.

591
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,217
Rym: Like I've seen them all.

592
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,393
Rym: There's nothing particularly like I don't know.

593
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:57,359
Rym: I feel like even if they could expand this game forever, Dominion style and I'd probably just keep playing it at about the same rate that I play FTL today.

594
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:05,346
Scott: Even with this very minimal card pool, it's like every time I play, you know, go up the spire, even if I fail, I discover something new, right?

595
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:08,899
Scott: So like the other day I discovered there's a card spinning, there's a relic spinning top.

596
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:13,828
Scott: Spinning top set is a relic and it says if your hand is empty draw a card, right?

597
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:18,311
Scott: So there's another card called anger and anger is a zero mana attack.

598
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:25,260
Scott: You can just play it and when you play it, what it does is it basically does some damage weekly because it's an attack, right?

599
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,970
Scott: But it's a weak attack.

600
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,619
Scott: It only costs zero.

601
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,340
Scott: And then it copies itself and puts both copies in the discard pile.

602
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:36,533
Scott: So if you play anger, your deck slowly fills with angers, right?

603
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:37,059
Scott: Tons of them.

604
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:49,745
Scott: You get the spinning top and a deck that only consists of angers effectively and cards that let you draw cards and you can basically infinitely play these zero cost angers.

605
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:55,987
Scott: and then when you run out of them because you've drawn your whole deck, it shuffles the angers in the discard pile back and you keep playing angers.

606
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,724
Scott: You just do infinite damage with those two things.

607
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:03,480
Rym: Yep, I had one run where I kept getting the cards that give you those zero cost shivs that just do some damage.

608
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,084
Scott: Shivs are great.

609
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:04,894
Scott: You can upgrade.

610
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:07,000
Scott: You can get the accuracy to increase shiv damage.

611
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:14,618
Rym: So you get a thing where you get an innate power where every turn you draw your hand and then you get a bunch of shivs just on top of it.

612
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,512
Rym: Every single turn.

613
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,319
Scott: Every time you play a card each turn, gain a block.

614
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:25,803
Scott: Every time you play a card each turn, do a damage to all enemies and you've got all these shivs that cause zero and you just keep playing tons of them.

615
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:34,733
Scott: In addition to the damage the shiv does, in addition to the additional upgraded shiv damage, each shiv does a damage to every bad guy and gives you a block.

616
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,999
Scott: Every turn you play a shit ton of shivs are all for zero.

617
00:36:37,382 --> 00:37:02,737
Rym: Here's where the game really shines because in the base Dominion set for example and also in a lot of poorly designed deck builders, there's the gold rush problem where there's a very simple strategy that is very likely to win, very powerful, very degenerate and the nuance and complexity of the enemies in this game, their behaviors and patterns are way more complex than you

618
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:02,939
Scott: think.

619
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:04,550
Rym: And as a result...

620
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,453
Scott: I actually wasn't like paying too much attention to the enemies.

621
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:11,564
Rym: Oh yeah, I was playing, there's this knob, this guy who's like holding a spine and he's like this demon looking guy.

622
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,380
Rym: and what I didn't notice.

623
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,040
Rym: I was just playing and then he crushed me.

624
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,150
Rym: He killed me, I was like what?

625
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:22,859
Rym: Then I realized his power was like anytime you play a non-attack card, he gets stronger.

626
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,596
Scott: So it's like you try to block his attacks, you just make him stronger.

627
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:33,303
Scott: The only way to fight him is just keep attacking and kill him before he kills you and absorb and basically be a meat shield and tank it up.

628
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,948
Rym: Kind of like how in Final Fantasy 4 in particular, it was really about...

629
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,120
Scott: You can block him a little bit.

630
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:50,251
Scott: You don't have to completely refrain from blocking, but you can't block like you normally would just carelessly because you'll just give him so much strength, your block won't matter and he'll do like 100 damage in one hit from all that strength he got.

631
00:37:50,473 --> 00:37:57,480
Rym: But the combination of the types of things enemies can do and the kinds of patterns they'll have they're... Every fight is interesting.

632
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:12,439
Rym: Even the most basic like "here's a bug" ends up being a pretty interesting fight and I find when I play the game that, you know, some roguelikes will punish a little too hard or make it a little too easy and you get frustrated or you get bored.

633
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:22,779
Rym: It already strikes a pretty good balance where when I lose, it's mostly my fault with a little bit of luck and when I win, it's mostly my fault with a little bit of luck.

634
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:31,564
Rym: I have a lot of skill and planning input into the game despite it having a lot of random elements in terms of how your deck evolves.

635
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:32,089
Scott: What's telling?

636
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:38,169
Scott: a lot is like sometimes like you'll go through the game and there'll be a certain bad guy and you'd be like "Oh my god, I have the perfect way to kill this bad guy".

637
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:39,968
Scott: and you kill it in like one shot and it's so easy.

638
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:40,756
Scott: It's just like

639
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:41,059
Scott: "Aha!".

640
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,886
Scott: and then the next time you go through and you get to the same bad guy somewhere, it's like "Oh, I'm not built to fight this guy that I killed in one shot last time".

641
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:50,190
Scott: and they totally fuck you up even if you make it through.

642
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:52,437
Scott: and it's like "Alright, well, that

643
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:52,640
Scott: happened.".

644
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,929
Rym: Or like it's my fault.

645
00:38:54,151 --> 00:39:02,939
Rym: The enemy's telling me what he's gonna do after like four hands, I know the pattern and yet I still just am dumb and I mess it up.

646
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:12,038
Rym: Like I get a really good attack hand and I get greedy and I run through the attack instead of doing the thing to protect myself from the attack that's gonna come next turn.

647
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,689
Scott: Or like there's like a slime guy and it's like "Alright, when his health goes-".

648
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:16,700
Rym: Oh, that slime guy!

649
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,339
Scott: When he gets below half health, he stops his attack and splits in half.

650
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,860
Scott: So it'll be turns and we're like "He's gonna do this big

651
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:23,304
Scott: attack.".

652
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:29,506
Scott: So I start defending and I'm like "Wait a minute, I could've just attacked and made him split instead of doing that

653
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:29,950
Scott: attack.".

654
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:35,589
Rym: But you gotta be careful because when he splits, the two halves have however many hit points he had.

655
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:39,879
Scott: So you wanna bring him as far below half as you can on the turn in which you bring him below half.

656
00:39:41,783 --> 00:39:48,555
Scott: There's a lot of situations where it's like "Oh, I blocked and took one damage, not a big deal, but I could've just killed that guy that

657
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:48,797
Scott: turn.".

658
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:54,862
Scott: But your instinct is to just automatically start playing defense cards because you see the attack symbol above the dude's head.

659
00:39:55,084 --> 00:40:01,223
Rym: But I guess simple strategies generally don't work and that is the sign of a well-executed deck builder.

660
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:04,435
Scott: There's also a lot of interactions you might forget about.

661
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:08,877
Scott: So like some of the relics are things like "Oh, every tenth attack does double

662
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:09,280
Scott: damage.".

663
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,556
Scott: It's like "You're not keeping track of that

664
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:10,778
Scott: shit.".

665
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,559
Scott: But he keeps track for you and actually does a good job.

666
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:20,540
Scott: But if you don't spend your time looking around every turn, suddenly you'll play an attack and you're like "Oh, I was only trying to do one damage to that guy.

667
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,195
Scott: I wasted my double attack thing on the wrong guy because I forgot about

668
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:24,255
Scott: it.".

669
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:25,669
Rym: But the UX they keep improving it.

670
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:28,940
Rym: It does things like that particular pen nib or whatever it was.

671
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:31,792
Rym: It flashes and does a big like "Hey, this is the

672
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:31,934
Rym: turn.".

673
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:33,640
Scott: You gotta be looking there, right?

674
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Scott: You gotta be very attentive.

675
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:46,210
Rym: All the numbers on the cards, kind of like in the Race for the Galaxy app, all the numbers reflect the actual current state based on all the modifiers.

676
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:51,404
Rym: This game would be hell if it were not a video game.

677
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:52,151
Rym: Yes.

678
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:53,020
Rym: Utter hell.

679
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,600
Scott: Indeed.

680
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,565
Rym: The other thing I think is really strong is that it has money.

681
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:05,548
Rym: You can interact with like, you can buy stuff from people, but there aren't really items like in a lot of roguelikes.

682
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,992
Rym: It's not like you're collecting 40 heal potions.

683
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:16,819
Scott: Yeah, when you're in a shop you can remove one card from your deck and every time you use that at a shop, you can only use it once per shop and the price goes up at the next shop.

684
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,366
Rym: Another sign of a good deck builder, the fact that burning cards from your deck is a difficult and expensive thing that you want to do.

685
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:26,233
Scott: There is a relic that makes it always cost 50.

686
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,000
Rym: I think I saw that relic.

687
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,688
Scott: Anyway, you can buy a relic at a shop, you can buy a potion at a shop, and you can buy cards at a shop.

688
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:32,720
Scott: That's pretty much it.

689
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,535
Rym: But here's the thing, the only consumables in this game, the potions, you can only hold three at a time.

690
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:43,485
Scott: So if you get another one, you already got three, you can discard one of the ones you got or not take the new one.

691
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:48,720
Rym: So it avoids a common roguelike problem of if not now, then when.

692
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:58,031
Rym: See also, every Final Fantasy game where you're fighting Xaromas at the very end of Final Fantasy 4, and you're still like, "Should I really use that

693
00:41:58,072 --> 00:41:58,557
Rym: elixir?".

694
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:00,313
Rym: I only have 99 of them.

695
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,980
Rym: I might need it in the future.

696
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,240
Scott: There might be another boss after this one.

697
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,787
Rym: Yup, like this game avoids that problem.

698
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:10,270
Rym: You have three potion slots by default.

699
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,520
Rym: Those are the only consumables in the game.

700
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:18,620
Scott: When I first got into the game, there were a lot of situations where I died and it's like, "Oh no, I could have won if I used the potion.

701
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,012
Scott: Now I don't have that problem

702
00:42:20,073 --> 00:42:20,417
Scott: anymore.".

703
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:23,387
Rym: And the potions are good too, they're all subtle.

704
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:27,672
Rym: They're like, "Get some extra dexterity just for this fight, or do 20 damage to one guy

705
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:27,936
Rym: once.".

706
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,700
Scott: Well, 20 damage to one guy once would be a big deal.

707
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,911
Scott: The guy's down to 20.

708
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:34,639
Scott: Just kill him off rather than spend more turns losing more HP.

709
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,620
Rym: Or you accidentally split the slime.

710
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,340
Rym: Well, before he actually splits, bring him down further so he's less of a problem.

711
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,200
Scott: Yeah, you'll be doubling the worth of that potion.

712
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,200
Rym: I like the boss who's the big slime who splits into two slimes that will each split into two slimes.

713
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:54,700
Scott: Yeah, do you make four slimes to make your AOE attacks better, or do you take off one slime first and then the other one because you don't have a lot of AOE?

714
00:42:55,321 --> 00:43:01,939
Scott: But, you know, there's a lot, it's like really, you know, it seems like it's so basic, but actually there's a lot of subtle stuff going on there.

715
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:13,287
Rym: This game is just shockingly well designed for the early stage that it's in, to the point that if it is, if they sold it today as is and never made changes to it, it's still worth buying.

716
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:17,873
Rym: I highly recommend everyone listening to GeekNights play this game.

717
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:22,720
Scott: Unlike other game communities, Netrunner players actually know about games, and this is proof.

718
00:43:23,462 --> 00:43:27,000
Rym: Yup, but also it is because it is a single player experience.

719
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:36,640
Rym: there's no pressure, which makes it a lot more fun as a casual experience, like if this were on my phone, I would just play it like every time I was pooping.

720
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,084
Rym: Like, it would replace most of my pooping games.

721
00:43:39,205 --> 00:43:41,205
Scott: I am waiting for this to be on some mobile device.

722
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:55,578
Rym: I will play the hell out of this on a mobile device, but it's good enough to where I play it on a PC, like the precious time I have in front of my gaming PC, where I could be playing Overwatch or Civ 6, I have chosen to play this game over them multiple times.

723
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,460
Rym: I cannot give higher praise to this game.

724
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,628
Scott: You know what the...

725
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:10,000
Rym: I'm sorry, the praise, the other praise, Scott is sick and coughing and has difficulty doing this show and yet, we are still praising this game.

726
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:14,333
Scott: At the pace that I played this game, it takes you an hour to beat it, or at least to get final boss, so.

727
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:23,391
Rym: I look forward to how this game will evolve, and I feel like when there are for money expansions in the future, I'll probably buy them all.

728
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:26,259
Scott: I don't know if there will be any.

729
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,429
Rym: We have no idea.

730
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:37,872
Rym: It's so early, but if you enjoy games like FTL and you want another game like that, that you can just sort of play and be always making relatively interesting decisions.

731
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:39,589
Scott: If you like deck building games like Dominion.

732
00:44:39,892 --> 00:44:40,255
Scott: Yup.

733
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:44,220
Rym: If you want a good deck building game that you can play by yourself because you're too good at Dominion.

734
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:46,279
Rym: This is your game.

735
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,059
Rym: Now we're going to stop before Scott dies.

736
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,840
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights.

737
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,701
Rym: [outro music].
