1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,277
Scott: It's Wednesday November 15th.

2
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:15,128
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:18,488
Scott: tonight We discussed the comic ex machina.

4
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,907
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:30,809
Rym: So today down at Fordham Plaza I was done with some work and I had to go to an ATM to get enough money to pay for the parking to Get out of the parking garage.

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:39,339
Rym: I was in so on my way back from getting a bunch of money out of this really dodgy looking ATM on the street near Grand Concourse in the Bronx.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,150
Scott: I would never use an ATM on the street ever.

8
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,210
Rym: Well, I found one legitimate looking ATM, right?

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,950
Rym: And it was out of order and I needed money cuz I had to pay to get my car out of this garage.

10
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,438
Rym: I was parked there for an hour.

11
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:52,544
Rym: So it was like 20 bucks.

12
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:55,317
Rym: I Mean my company's gonna pay me back.

13
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,402
Rym: It's not like it's a big deal.

14
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:57,788
Scott: But yeah, I know it's just annoying.

15
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:19,063
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so as I'm on my way out I decided to get a smoothie and there's another gentleman who is standing there waiting for his smoothie while I order mine and he looks like a punk kid a. he looks about my age maybe a little younger and he's talking into a cell phone kind of hunched over and I hear him say the words Man, man, there's there's an emergency.

16
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,290
Rym: Yeah, this is deep shit.

17
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:25,265
Rym: One of my boys was over on like I forget what Street he said and he saw James.

18
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,709
Rym: Yeah that fucker.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,839
Rym: Well, tell you what rounded boys up and we're gonna go get him.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,149
Rym: meet me at blah and he talks for a while.

21
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:42,729
Rym: Then he hangs up takes a smoothie and walks away and I think My guess is that this is some sort of gang-related violence that was being planned in line for my smoothie.

22
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,809
Scott: Yeah, if you're not lying It would be hard to disagree.

23
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:59,690
Rym: I mean the guy had a blue kind of bandana around his head and all that and the conversation was very very not up to The standards of moral behavior.

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,229
Scott: Sounding was he a crip or a blood or perhaps a hoodlum?

25
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,250
Rym: Well considering that he was wearing a lot of blue if he's anything he was probably a crip.

26
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,919
Rym: Not that I know much about.

27
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,269
Scott: I don't know shit about that.

28
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,604
Scott: I know as much as I knew from that South Park.

29
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:27,670
Scott: Yeah, Timmy Yeah That wasn't even in that episode was because remember they would go in there and he'd be like just take my money.

30
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,760
Rym: But he didn't say okay.

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,006
Rym: I guess he did kind of yeah.

32
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:35,610
Rym: Yeah Actually, we've been watching a lot of South Park lately.

33
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,543
Rym: We have indeed and we've been trying not to let the South Park slip in.

34
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,490
Rym: but it's real easy to quote South Park.

35
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,299
Scott: Yeah, it's basically taken over for the Simpsons.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,810
Rym: Yeah, the only thing bigger than that for us is still you can't watch Tim Simpson.

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,355
Scott: Yeah, you can't.

38
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,704
Scott: you can't prevent ten South Park things.

39
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:52,687
Rym: It's not Snorlax.

40
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,447
Rym: That's Borlax Borlax.

41
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:58,161
Rym: Anyway, we actually are gonna take a trend from.

42
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,726
Rym: you know, anime world order and all that.

43
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:05,320
Rym: We've got two Anime related newses for anime manga comics day.

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,085
Scott: You can't have two anime related newses.

45
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:13,306
Rym: I Don't know why but I didn't expect you to say that I really didn't know where.

46
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,678
Rym: Yeah, so bust out with your news.

47
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,573
Scott: so at the New York Comic Con Great.

48
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:24,115
Rym: Great.

49
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:30,639
Scott: Yeah, if you don't know the New York Comic Con is a new comma convention That's in New York City at the Jacob Javits Center.

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,670
Scott: The first one ever was last year in February.

51
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:38,185
Scott: I tried to go to it and failed because they had it in the small.

52
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:50,240
Scott: if you ever been to the Javits Center There's a big ass open room that can be divided into three pieces But usually it's one big ass room and when someone has a convention there They use the whole big ass upstairs room.

53
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:54,978
Scott: Like the car show uses the whole upstairs There's also a downstairs for smaller shows.

54
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:03,749
Scott: the New York Comic Convention used one half of the downstairs and Sold way more tickets than they could fit people in there, which was dumb.

55
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:08,890
Scott: So after not being able to get into the convention, I was like fuck these people don't know how to run a convention.

56
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,138
Rym: Yeah, Scott wasn't the only one boned.

57
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,750
Rym: I'd say the majority of people who tried to go to this convention got boned.

58
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,640
Scott: Yeah, there are people with pre-orders who couldn't get in.

59
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,583
Rym: there were guests.

60
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:28,690
Scott: there were guests who were in like Doug Rushkoff who was there, you know signing his book that he writes at the DC table was in there signing his book.

61
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:29,754
Scott: Then he went out.

62
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:31,039
Scott: then he couldn't get back in.

63
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:33,387
Scott: Yeah, it was the president of DC Comics.

64
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,090
Scott: Can you anyway?

65
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:54,390
Scott: This convention which is going to be held again this year and will supposedly Be using the upstairs and have all the space it needs and not be crowded and impossible to get into but still have all the high high-profile guests Apparently is going to also have the American Anime Awards at it this year.

66
00:04:54,971 --> 00:05:05,522
Scott: Now the American Anime Awards are apparently just gonna be some of you know official awards ceremony for American anime and manga or not.

67
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:13,090
Scott: so much American anime and manga but Manga and anime that has been released in America this year, you know.

68
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,359
Scott: So why?

69
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,424
Scott: I guess Ava is never gonna win But I gave someone puts out a new release of it this year.

70
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,950
Scott: ATV puts out a release this year.

71
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,141
Scott: Maybe that release might be eligible for a prize or something.

72
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:31,121
Rym: Yeah, they got a whole bunch of categories here Like the best actor best actress best actor in a comedy.

73
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,364
Rym: they break off comedy from.

74
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:39,030
Scott: it's weird because they have special Awards for comedy, but they don't have special awards for any other genre.

75
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,982
Scott: Comedy is the only genre breakdown and I can kind of see why.

76
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:52,510
Scott: being that in comedy not being serious I mean dramas serious most action or kind of serious at least an anime, you know, but comedies are never serious.

77
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,830
Scott: So it's hard to win a best something award when your show isn't serious.

78
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,000
Scott: So comedy would be the first genre you would break out.

79
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:05,257
Scott: But yeah best DVD package design Yeah best anime theme.

80
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,502
Scott: so here's the ones I don't get.

81
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:08,950
Scott: if these are the American anime Awards, right?

82
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,670
Scott: Why you can't really give the awards based on the quality of the anime itself because the anime is made by people in Japan.

83
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:21,010
Scott: You know, it's not you got to give awards for the work done by the American.

84
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,053
Scott: necessarily what?

85
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:29,950
Rym: because I mean what you could do at least what I would do for the words like this is it's the American awards Being given to whoever so they're given.

86
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:41,910
Scott: But I'd still say the focus should at least in my opinion be on the work that is done Bringing it over to America and not on the work creating the original work because that's not the American animals.

87
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,297
Scott: No, just beat the anime Awards.

88
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,161
Rym: I don't know I would.

89
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:45,870
Rym: I mean I see what they're doing here.

90
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,127
Rym: You know, I see what you did here.

91
00:06:47,522 --> 00:07:01,570
Rym: Yeah they're trying to bring anime into the mainstream because this is the kind of thing that would generate a lot of press releases and The news would at least pay lip service like and blah blah blah won the anime Awards last weekend at the New York City comic-con.

92
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,095
Scott: Yeah, I think what it really is.

93
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:10,872
Scott: if you look at any other sort of products DVDs in general books They always put labels on them of awards they've won.

94
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:14,966
Scott: like you go to the store and you look at a DVD and it's always got those like this.

95
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:20,090
Scott: would all these awards at These film festivals and they've got those little like wheat kind of little icons.

96
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,762
Scott: You know you go buy books in the store and books always have like.

97
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:31,369
Scott: I was in the New York Times bestseller list and I won The author won Hugo and Nebula Awards for sci-fi science fiction and blah blah blah.

98
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,490
Scott: But anime can't say really anything about awards except for the occasional oscar-nominated Miyazaki movie.

99
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,262
Rym: Well, there are words in Japan that Americans don't know anything about.

100
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:42,110
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know if there are words in Japan.

101
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,630
Scott: Well, I think about them at all.

102
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:49,128
Rym: I have seen or heard of anime that have won various awards, but I don't think they're that big.

103
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:52,970
Rym: even in Japan They might be like, I mean GeekNights can give out awards.

104
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,701
Rym: Yeah, I hereby give the award for best podcast to GeekNights.

105
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:57,223
Scott: Awesome.

106
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:03,461
Scott: Oh, but even comic books in America They've got Eisner Awards and Harvey Awards and stuff, but anime doesn't.

107
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:08,546
Scott: so the reason they're having this is probably you know one to generate a lot of.

108
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:31,465
Scott: you know, anime action in an industry that's not doing as well as it was before media play without a business and To now when they put anime, you know, you go into the store You see all this anime and if you don't keep up with it on the internet You don't know what's good and what's bad, but if they can start putting stuff like one best anime of 2001 You know, it'll sort of bring stuff out to people who just walk around looking at the shelf.

109
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,150
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

110
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:44,250
Rym: I imagine what's going to happen is they're going to be announced and all the super fans who watch everything You know the day after it comes out in Japan fan sub from bit torrent are gonna bitch about how?

111
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,976
Rym: Oh, but they didn't.

112
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:50,010
Rym: they don't know anything about Nana and ergo proxy and whatever I'm watching right now.

113
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,509
Rym: Therefore they're crap and they're wrong.

114
00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:04,579
Rym: I Imagine a lot of other people are going to complain about how the show that should have won Didn't win and the people who think that the show that won deserved it Probably won't say anything because they won't even know.

115
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,390
Scott: so the same shit that everyone does for every other stupid meaningless award.

116
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,778
Rym: Yeah, I I mean as a person I could.

117
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,067
Rym: I couldn't care less about all these words.

118
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:13,950
Rym: the Academy Awards.

119
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:17,029
Rym: I haven't even known who won for the last several years.

120
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:24,824
Scott: I just find it funny that they're giving out the American Anime Awards at the New York Comic Con instead of that Oh to count a car anime Expo.

121
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:25,950
Scott: What the hell?

122
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,510
Scott: It's like they're just totally disrespecting the anime conventions to go to the comic convention.

123
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,436
Scott: Anime is putting comics.

124
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,142
Scott: Yeah, they're there.

125
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,105
Scott: I don't get it.

126
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,590
Scott: I don't know what the logic is with that one.

127
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,838
Rym: Yeah, well, did they say anything in the article?

128
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:43,049
Rym: I didn't read the whole article as to why they chose the New York Comic Con.

129
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,208
Scott: No, I have no idea.

130
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:51,770
Scott: Anime and manga are an important part of what the New York Comic Con is here to celebrate.

131
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:54,218
Scott: We're proud to be hosting this special event.

132
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,450
Rym: All right, something must have changed hand somewhere.

133
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:03,290
Scott: I mean, maybe I could see anime was a relatively had a pretty good presence at the Comic Con.

134
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,117
Scott: It is primarily a comic convention.

135
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,425
Scott: Well, the thing the anime people were doing stuff there.

136
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:08,610
Rym: Here's what I've noticed.

137
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:10,338
Scott: What's her name?

138
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,650
Scott: the macross min-may.

139
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:24,470
Rym: yeah, they did there last year but going like going to the one comic-con I went to and Hearing reports from other people who go to comic cons It seems like a lot of anime fans are really starved for more cons and more anime stuff.

140
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:35,070
Rym: so a lot of anime fans end up going to comic cons and I guess spoiling the fun of the super fans who are angry that there's people dressed up as Naruto at their comic convention.

141
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:39,510
Scott: Yeah, there were a bunch of narutards in line when I was waiting outside.

142
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:58,110
Rym: Well at the Philly wizard world that comic-con the only people who would interview with me other than those two guys who were looking for Silver Age comics and only Silver Age comics were all these people who actually weren't having a good time But they were all anime fans cosplaying as anime things who didn't know that comic conventions aren't like anime cons.

143
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,658
Scott: Yeah, and there were some anime type people in the artist alley.

144
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:01,480
Rym: Yeah, there were.

145
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:09,706
Scott: but yeah, I'm just saying you know, this is I Don't know and the American Anime Awards at the New York comic convention.

146
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:10,790
Scott: What are you gonna do?

147
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,330
Rym: Well, the thing is I don't want to ever bother with the New York comic convention after what happened last year.

148
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,601
Scott: Yeah, I really don't want to.

149
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:22,308
Rym: but now it's kind of like We're gonna have to send someone to cover this thing.

150
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:25,130
Scott: now I might just go like for the what's that?

151
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,418
Scott: I think I'm gonna go with my original plan of.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,765
Scott: I'm gonna let people who are gonna go on Friday Well, tell me what happened there and then on Saturday, I'll go down.

153
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,242
Rym: if the word is good Well what I might do because now our situation is reversed.

154
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:39,668
Rym: I work in the city.

155
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,539
Rym: Mm-hmm So I might just go there Friday.

156
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,201
Scott: Oh good.

157
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:44,627
Scott: Then you could tell me if it was worth going.

158
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:56,769
Scott: Yeah There is the thing about the New York Comic Con that other comic cons don't have is they really do have Lots and lots and lots of high-profile people in you know comics and a whole bunch of other related industries

159
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:17,590
Rym: Except I've found and even the anime cons even even if I really like a guest and I really want to hear what they have to say usually Even big names that conventions tend to either Answer a lot of stupid questions from people in the audience that are just completely Retarded because people ask the craft that you can find in Wikipedia.

160
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:22,127
Rym: They're like, so what was your favorite thing that you ever directed?

161
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:22,970
Scott: I hate that shit.

162
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,056
Rym: Yeah, no one

163
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,650
Scott: ever don't ask a question that Google can answer Yeah,

164
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:38,579
Rym: or a question that's just lame or the kind of question that everyone in the world would ask ask something weird Or something cool or something interesting Mm-hmm, and I wish I wish

165
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:42,249
Scott: I kind of questions the GeekNights would ask if they were interviewing the person for a show

166
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,574
Rym: or Even anime world order.

167
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:50,202
Rym: Yeah what I have always wanted and I pushed this at Cinecon But the con really wasn't set up for it and I'm gonna.

168
00:12:50,302 --> 00:13:03,110
Rym: I'm trying to push this as some other cons But instead of having a panel where the guest comes up does their spiel and then the audience asks questions I'd rather see a moderated discussion or an interview panel where?

169
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:11,959
Rym: Someone is up front and the guest is up front and the someone interviews the guests like it was a talk show Like like Stephen Colbert interviewing someone.

170
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:18,885
Scott: or even better if people wanted to ask questions at the panel they would have to write them and they had a single line to write them on.

171
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:21,698
Scott: none of this pair because The one thing I hate.

172
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:31,290
Scott: this bothered me a lot because I was watching a Video of Richard Dawkins asking a question and people when they're at panels or lectures They just ask some of them not everyone.

173
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:37,830
Scott: They ask questions so poorly like they they just keep saying a whole bunch of extra words.

174
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,510
Scott: It's like just say your fucking question.

175
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,130
Scott: This guy was like well considering blah blah blah blah blah in relation to blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah blah blah.

176
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:48,393
Scott: The question.

177
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:53,210
Scott: you should have just said the question because some people not not to you know.

178
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,818
Rym: Call a kettle.

179
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:06,809
Rym: that may be a certain color a certain color But some people like to hear the sound of their own voice And - really and this bothers me a lot because I see this is so many cons people Want to sound smart and look cool?

180
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:12,370
Rym: So they get up front and they try to ask a smart question and they use all those big words and semi-colons.

181
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,590
Scott: The way it is to look cool when asking a question is to have a really short question.

182
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,730
Scott: That's really direct and it is also really witty.

183
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,389
Rym: You mean like when I asked Magic Johnson how it was to work with?

184
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,322
Rym: Captain Lou Albano on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

185
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:32,784
Rym: That is a perfect exam and wait That was one of my favorite moments in life.

186
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:40,690
Scott: Mm-hmm When his head hits his answer just or the other way to do it is to ask a perfectly normal question Like when are you going to do blah?

187
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,854
Scott: And then you know to have like a witty answer like if he says yes Then I'll say this.

188
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,986
Scott: if he says no, then I'll say this and it'll be funny.

189
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,350
Scott: either way It's like when are you going to do blah?

190
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,743
Scott: Never you suck, you know, but not you suck something clever.

191
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:55,045
Scott: Yeah.

192
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:55,286
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:55,486
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:04,761
Rym: All right Yeah, but I just I'd love to see you know A David Letterman style kind of just interview the guest in front of an audience Mm-hmm because things like having one guy talk at you.

195
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:15,489
Rym: you guys who heard the only Rym Episode or the only Scott episode of the show know that one guy talking is a lot less Interesting and a lot harder to do than two guys talking.

196
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:21,210
Scott: Yep, also, you know that way the time won't be wasted asking all these questions that are just like no comment.

197
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,350
Scott: What's your favorite color?

198
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,974
Rym: How old are you?

199
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,880
Scott: what they should do really is they should have.

200
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:36,849
Scott: the people who want to ask a question should submit the question Beforehand like I don't know maybe on a website or something and then someone will take this list of questions Submitted by people at the panel somehow.

201
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:43,874
Scott: Maybe use technology to do it in some way and then cross off all the ones that are stupid and just ask all the good questions.

202
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,930
Rym: or or and I Did this to a degree at the Anime Club Summit at Otakana?

203
00:15:50,090 --> 00:16:06,910
Rym: I think two years ago one of them where instead of sitting on the panel I decided to be the main DMC and I walked around with the microphone and while they were answering a question up there I'd wander around the audience with my mic off Talk sit down next to the people who had questions and talk to him a bit like so what do you want to ask blah?

204
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,730
Rym: Alright, uh, you want to ask this or that and I'd get it out of them and I'd kind of assess him and if they Were cool, I'd hand him the mic and let him ask the question.

205
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:19,607
Rym: Otherwise I would ask the question for them or I would just wouldn't ask their question.

206
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,150
Rym: that way No one dumb could get a hold of that microphone.

207
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:36,909
Scott: Yeah If you had like two or three staff Two could probably do it for a small panel easily because one person is there with the current question and the other person Is looking for the next question just goes and screens the questions, you know, then it works out.

208
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:39,643
Rym: Great Alright, so to get on to some other news.

209
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:41,030
Scott: Wow, that was long news.

210
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,554
Rym: Yeah, it was but there's a lot to say.

211
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,646
Rym: Dragon Ball Z. Oh god is being.

212
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,110
Scott: you can't watch ten Dragon Ball Z.

213
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:49,629
Rym: How about you can't watch?

214
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:55,133
Rym: 290 or more Dragon Ball Z There?

215
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,039
Scott: I guess you could because there are that many.

216
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:04,790
Scott: there are over 290 episodes of Dragon Ball Z Actual half-hour episodes or the 15-minute one actual episode.

217
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:21,340
Rym: Now the awesome thing is that Dragon Ball Z due to popular demand is being Remastered frame for frame by Funimation for a super uber ultimate awesome DVD box set release of all of it.

218
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:23,229
Scott: Well, I guess that's sort of a good thing.

219
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:26,683
Scott: in 1080p That's sort of silly.

220
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:31,453
Rym: with digital Remastering and everything they're removing It's a little bit excessive.

221
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:41,702
Rym: They're doing a brand new print from the well a brand new transfer from the original prints and They're remastering it entirely frame by frame in 1080p.

222
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:47,176
Rym: They're going to sell it season by season for 4998 which is season.

223
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,870
Rym: Yeah, which is like 900 minutes of anime for 50 bucks.

224
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:55,669
Rym: It might in other words in other words for 50 bucks you get one and a half fights.

225
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,958
Scott: But I'm sure so it might.

226
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:07,364
Scott: actually being not a fan of Dragon Ball Z at all Actually being a hater of Dragon Ball Z. It might be worth it to just buy season one.

227
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:12,883
Rym: See I remember in high school I'd always come home and I set my VCR to take Pokemon.

228
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,449
Scott: Wait, are these gonna be HD DVDs?

229
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,713
Scott: Or blu-rays?

230
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,620
Scott: cuz how else is it gonna be 1080p?

231
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,944
Rym: They're just gonna be DVDs.

232
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:21,148
Scott: How is it gonna be 1080p?

233
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:27,310
Rym: I think they're they're remastering it in 1080p, but then they're gonna transfer to DVD when they're done.

234
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:27,893
Rym: I don't know.

235
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:33,513
Scott: I don't know that's kind of weird, but it's very specifically says DVD okay.

236
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:34,114
Rym: Okay.

237
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:41,355
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if anyone's gonna release much on blu-ray or HD DVD anytime soon Considering the market for it.

238
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:41,676
Rym: Yeah,

239
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:57,470
Scott: I do think it's a good idea though because you know the anime industry not Like I said before not doing as well as it was doing in a few years ago Since the media play thing and everything and you know They brought out over a lot of new shows, but none of the new shows are really the smash hits, you know.

240
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,849
Rym: Oh, oh, hey dinner up, but I just I read the article more thoroughly.

241
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,118
Rym: 1080p is what they did.

242
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,907
Rym: the transfer in and the remastering in.

243
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,755
Rym: okay So they'll have it ready.

244
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:11,536
Rym: if they want to release it in the future on whatever HD format there is It'll be ready to go.

245
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:12,382
Rym: But anyway continue.

246
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:17,770
Scott: Yeah, but You know, they they pretty much already re-released all the hit series.

247
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,936
Scott: I mean, they've re-released Ava six times.

248
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:22,925
Scott: They already re-released cowboy bebop super remixed.

249
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,630
Scott: They Akira movie super remixed.

250
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,886
Scott: Yeah, everything is either in a nice slim case box or whatever.

251
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:39,684
Scott: Dragon Ball Z the DVD releases of Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT and all those Dragon Ball shows are still there's pretty sure.

252
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:50,639
Scott: there's only been one legal American release of all those things and they've all been pretty terrible and difficult to collect all of them and Not easily affordable and all that jazz.

253
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,066
Scott: So I really think this is kind of a good idea.

254
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:56,230
Scott: to make a big cash Brian, you know get some monies plus.

255
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:04,550
Rym: I mean Dragon Ball Z has a lot of fans and Well, I've seen maybe 15 episodes of it random ones maybe three and it's got some funny stuff in it.

256
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,830
Rym: It's not a great show and the fact that people take it at face value scares me.

257
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,643
Rym: But then again when I was a kid, I took project a co at face value.

258
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,145
Rym: It's like wow.

259
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:14,867
Rym: She's a superhero.

260
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:15,570
Rym: This is awesome.

261
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,376
Rym: Oh my god, the school's gonna get destroyed.

262
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,019
Scott: Well, they do.

263
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,865
Rym: Yeah, I didn't know.

264
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,150
Rym: I didn't know it was a joke.

265
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,570
Rym: You know, they're all cross-dressers on the spaceship.

266
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:33,281
Rym: But Dragon Ball Z is kind of funny because it's kind of a parody of fighting shows except that you know People took it seriously.

267
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,090
Scott: Yeah, I do.

268
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:41,070
Scott: While I don't like Dragon Ball Z I think there's a good way for funimation to get a bunch of money so that they can buy some real and better anime series.

269
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:45,906
Scott: Bring those over, you know funimation does a pretty good job with most of their releases.

270
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:51,475
Scott: kind of well that and you know What they do average job, I would never begrudge a fan of a show Anything.

271
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:56,353
Rym: if someone really likes, I don't know MD guys It's cool.

272
00:20:56,754 --> 00:21:00,505
Rym: If they put out like an MD guys awesome box that comes with a football.

273
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,608
Scott: Yeah, I won't buy it.

274
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,750
Scott: but If that's your thing good for you.

275
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:14,748
Scott: And I think this is gonna make a lot of Dragon Ball fans happy because there's still shit tons of Dragon Ball fans out there And this will probably make them more money than any other anime release of the next few years.

276
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,490
Rym: at RIT I worked in a sub shop one summer and at that sub shop and there were no geeks.

277
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,720
Rym: There was all like normal people.

278
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,830
Rym: Most of them weren't even in college.

279
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:28,330
Rym: they're all like high school punk kids or punk kids who didn't go to college and One of them none of them knew anything about anime or anything.

280
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,730
Rym: But one of them watched Dragon Ball Z all the time and I didn't realize this the one day he was mopping.

281
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:40,410
Rym: He's like come here And then he'd run across the room with the mop and then he'd turn around and do it again.

282
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,997
Scott: Oh god, how old is this kid?

283
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,850
Rym: He was probably like two years younger than me.

284
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:46,062
Scott: All right, okay.

285
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:55,279
Scott: So you want to hear people talk about Japanese cartoons, you know anime But you think the other anime podcasters just aren't nerdy enough.

286
00:21:55,721 --> 00:22:10,207
Rym: sounds like you need to join forces with the anime world order Where each week three self-proclaimed experts offer you reviews of titles both new and classic news and commentary Rants convention reports interviews with fandom and some hentai and yaoi.

287
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:15,849
Rym: for good measure So search for anime in the iTunes music store or visit our website at anime world order.

288
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:19,322
Rym: calm Anime world order revealing the truth about anime.

00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:20,848
Rym: one podcast at a time.

290
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:37,870
Rym: things of the day Now in a land in a world in a place in a time in a land before time.

291
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:39,414
Scott: No, not a land before time.

292
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:39,816
Scott: it sucks.

293
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:41,761
Rym: it's from land before time.

294
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,937
Rym: one was a pretty damn good movie for a seven-year-old All right for a seven-year-old.

295
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:46,681
Scott: It was okay.

296
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:47,405
Rym: land before time.

297
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:48,349
Rym: eight not so good.

298
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:51,769
Scott: Someone to tell us how many there are now.

299
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:52,717
Rym: I know there it.

300
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:56,920
Scott: I know there's a lot because I saw Something with a lot of roman numerals on it at the store.

301
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:59,270
Rym: There's at least like four or five, but it doesn't matter.

302
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:05,550
Rym: Yeah, but but I think the day here there someone did this video some radio station or TV station or something.

303
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,272
Rym: I don't even know.

304
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:15,970
Rym: I barely paid attention to it, but the important part is it is a video about the guy Who does pretty much every movie trailer in America?

305
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,813
Rym: Don LaFontaine.

306
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:20,060
Rym: he is that guy who does that voice.

307
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,066
Scott: yeah, you know every movie trailer.

308
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:26,029
Scott: You know is like something something something something.

309
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:27,614
Scott: That's the.

310
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:30,430
Scott: Don LaFontaine is the guy who does those trailers, and he does that voice.

311
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:34,829
Rym: He's been doing this for a long time as how long has he been doing it?

312
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:39,433
Rym: He was doing work in the 60s and 70s Holy crap.

313
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:40,377
Rym: and to this day.

314
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,545
Rym: He does like 50 or 60 a week.

315
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:43,850
Rym: He does everything.

316
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,778
Scott: He must really crank these things out.

317
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,260
Rym: He does.

318
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,530
Rym: he does up to 35 in a day according to Wikipedia.

319
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,303
Scott: I guess is this you're not doing anything else.

320
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:56,229
Rym: That's not too hard I mean, what a thing this guy's talent is that he has an awesome voice kind of like the Lionel guy.

321
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,818
Scott: Yeah, that guy no well whatever.

322
00:23:58,878 --> 00:23:59,560
Scott: Lionel is a.

323
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,188
Rym: Lionel is a train company that I visited when I was a kid.

324
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,208
Scott: yes I often mix the two out trains and Thundercats.

325
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:17,328
Rym: who knew You could make some kind of animated gif about that Lionel Lionel Thunder Thunder Thunder train.

326
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:27,124
Rym: Anyway This is just kind of a funny video with this guy really Taking himself not seriously and being funny.

327
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:32,750
Scott: Yeah, it's good to see that He's actually a cool guy who's not all weird and reclusive or anything like that.

328
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,930
Rym: Well, you know what he makes six or seven figures.

329
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,289
Scott: Well, he has to because all these movies are making a fortune and without his voice your trailers got nothing.

330
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,430
Scott: Yeah, so you got to get the guy.

331
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,110
Scott: It's it's like in V for Vendetta when they the voice of fate changes and it's such a big deal.

332
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:54,630
Scott: Imagine when this guy's no more and they had to find different people to do movie voiceovers.

333
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,230
Scott: That's gonna be in our lifetime probably when this guy retires.

334
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:01,503
Scott: No by then all movie trailers are gonna be totally weird not having this guy by then.

335
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,409
Rym: We'll have computers to perfectly do it.

336
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:08,249
Scott: Maybe we'll be able to have a computer to recreate Don LaFontaine's voice for all time.

337
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:18,450
Rym: Well, luckily this guy looks real healthy and real strong and the cool thing is from what you see guy to be to have that Voice, well, they call him the voice of God or Thunder throats.

338
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:19,789
Scott: That sounds right to me.

339
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,868
Rym: But the cool thing is you know most people who do voices for stuff.

340
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,338
Rym: They'd have a different voice in the real world.

341
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,350
Rym: This guy always sounds like that.

342
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,371
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's just that's the voice He has.

343
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:35,590
Rym: like he can turn it up and do it more like double but his normal talking voice is just like that.

344
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,434
Rym: It's really cool.

345
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,346
Scott: Yeah, just watch the video and we don't need to explain it anymore.

346
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:43,874
Scott: Yeah Okay, my thing of the day is a high Larry.

347
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,330
Rym: his video rofl copter times a million.

348
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:51,670
Scott: The title of the video is stupidest robber ever stupidest criminal ever, right?

349
00:25:52,573 --> 00:26:00,078
Scott: it starts out where this guy is going to rob a convenience store and Obviously, you know from the title of the video.

350
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,481
Scott: He's gonna do something dumb.

351
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:14,470
Scott: Perhaps he's going to I don't know Get shot by the convenience store clerk or he's gonna steal Something and try to run out the door but hit his head on the door and fall over.

352
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,336
Rym: It's stuck in a chimney somewhere.

353
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,420
Scott: Yeah, who does so?

354
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,467
Scott: it starts out where he's behind the store.

355
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:23,402
Scott: now everything he does they they use all the security cameras in the store.

356
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:29,949
Scott: the store must have like six or seven cameras and They show you what he's doing from all sorts of angles at all sorts of different times.

357
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:35,290
Scott: First he tries to climb up on the roof outside the store with predictable results.

358
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:40,290
Scott: And there's a. there's a camera outside the store watching him outside trying to climb on the roof.

359
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,354
Scott: You can guess what happens.

360
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:45,650
Scott: then he tries to get into the store by making a hole in the roof.

361
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,458
Scott: You can guess what happens there.

362
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:48,583
Rym: It's so great.

363
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:55,648
Rym: You see like debris Falls Debris Falls debris Falls debris Falls dude falls and lands on his head.

364
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:02,190
Scott: Yep Surprisingly, he never like injures himself enough to be knocked out that first fall.

365
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:03,695
Rym: It looks like he dies.

366
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:05,822
Rym: if I fell like that I would be dead.

367
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,552
Rym: and yet he gets right off and he's like, oh great So he.

368
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,810
Scott: so the Sun is coming up and he's proceeding to rob the store.

369
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,094
Rym: You know, actually I'll bet he was passed out for a while there He could have been.

370
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:16,701
Scott: I mean it was day when he got up.

371
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,488
Scott: He probably was passed out for a long time.

372
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,357
Scott: Anyway Gets up starts robbing the store.

373
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,683
Scott: He gets a 40.

374
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,309
Scott: He's smoking in the store, you know.

375
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:29,005
Scott: Then he tries to get out of the store and he can't get out the front door.

376
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,090
Rym: Yeah, the door is locked.

377
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,516
Rym: So first he's like bang.

378
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,444
Rym: He's trying to bust it open and he can't.

379
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:37,898
Rym: he's trying to pry it open In really poorly thought-out ways.

380
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,439
Scott: this guy.

381
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,643
Scott: he got into his store.

382
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,889
Scott: He robbed it a little bit and now he can't get out.

383
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:44,175
Scott: So he tries to exit.

384
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:47,006
Scott: he takes he finds a ladder and he tries to get out the hole in the roof.

385
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,229
Scott: that ends hilariously as well.

386
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,730
Scott: Basically the video goes on and he does more and more dumb shit until finally the police are at the front door of the store.

387
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:57,909
Scott: He can't get out.

388
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:01,844
Scott: He he lays down with his face on the ground that his hands behind his head.

389
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:03,230
Scott: then the cops come in and arrest him.

390
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:11,930
Rym: I think one of my favorite parts other than you know The two big Falls are is when he sees the camera there finally and he tries to throw something.

391
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,278
Scott: I don't know if he threw something at the camera.

392
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,510
Scott: I think he threw something for the sake of throwing something.

393
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,460
Rym: Yeah, but it looked like he was aiming at the camera.

394
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,365
Scott: It could have been.

395
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,330
Scott: it doesn't really matter.

396
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,570
Scott: The point is he's just like pissed off and he can't do anything cuz he's dumb ass.

397
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:35,288
Rym: So he takes like a big giant bottle and throws it now when you think the video is over Watch it until the end because they do a quick reprise of all the major events in the video.

398
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:44,188
Scott: Yeah It's just so entertaining cuz you watch it and you think okay There's you know, you see him fall once and you're like, okay, that's the end of that.

399
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,619
Scott: No, it gets dumber and dumber.

400
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:49,030
Scott: I couldn't really imagine it being any worse.

401
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:52,990
Rym: I'd almost want to talk to this guy just to see what he'd have to say for himself.

402
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,564
Scott: I don't want I don't think he's smart enough to eloquently express what he was thinking.

403
00:28:57,584 --> 00:29:00,815
Rym: No, here's my idea my Multi-million-dollar idea.

404
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:02,601
Rym: All right, so we get this guy.

405
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:03,704
Rym: He's Brian jail who get out.

406
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:12,090
Rym: eventually we get him We take this video we pay him to do commentary on the video and then we sell that DVD.

407
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:15,420
Rym: I would imagine the commentaries like.

408
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,145
Rym: I don't know what I was trying to do there.

409
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,149
Rym: I was high.

410
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,116
Rym: I Was high lol, man.

411
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,103
Rym: I was passed out for like a day.

412
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:25,250
Rym: I don't know when I got up but the Sun was coming up.

413
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:32,250
Scott: Yeah, they obviously cut out lots of boring parts of the video where he just walks around and does nothing.

414
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:33,416
Rym: Yeah, they get right back to him.

415
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,546
Rym: He's trying to climb out the roof in desperation.

416
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:41,529
Rym: Yeah All right, so it's been a while since we've talked about anything other than anime on anime day.

417
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,337
Scott: So we're gonna talk about some comics.

418
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:46,062
Scott: Well, not the manga kind.

419
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:49,170
Rym: Yeah, but not so much the underwear pervert kind either.

420
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:52,353
Scott: Well, it's 25% Underwear pervert.

421
00:29:52,393 --> 00:30:06,344
Scott: I would say we're going to talk about a comic called ex machina written by the man Brian K Vaughn with art by Tony Harris and it is published by Wildstorm which is really just DC with a different name on it.

422
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:07,789
Scott: So it's an imprint Brian K.

423
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,495
Rym: What else has he done?

424
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,398
Rym: of note, huh?

425
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:13,670
Scott: Brian K Vaughn is only like the best comic writer right now.

426
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,660
Scott: He's written wide.

427
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,269
Scott: last man, which is gonna end soon.

428
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:22,626
Scott: He's written runaways, which he's gonna stop writing and Joss Whedon's gonna write that.

429
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:23,869
Scott: I think that was in news a while ago.

430
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,505
Scott: He's doing a miniseries of Doctor Strange comics, which you can find on the shelves right now.

431
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:33,628
Scott: He's Doing ex machina right now.

432
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:35,915
Scott: It was something else.

433
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:39,110
Scott: oh he did a miniseries of the escapist for Dark Horse.

434
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,164
Scott: He's basically writing comics left and right and up and down and they're all.

435
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:44,750
Scott: most of them are awesome.

436
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,368
Scott: He's basically as far as I'm concerned could do no wrong when it comes to writing comics.

437
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,759
Scott: everything He is written that I have read has been great.

438
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,166
Scott: Oh pride of Baghdad.

439
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,130
Scott: He wrote pride of Baghdad.

440
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:57,042
Rym: I haven't read that yet, but Emily did and I think you did too.

441
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:58,107
Rym: Yep, and I want to.

442
00:30:58,127 --> 00:30:58,830
Rym: I just haven't got a chance.

443
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,171
Rym: You know what?

444
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:02,345
Scott: I'll read it before you read anything by Brian K Vaughn.

445
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:03,390
Scott: read pride of Baghdad.

446
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:04,940
Scott: It's a one-shot comic.

447
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,114
Scott: It's only hardcover right now But it's pretty cheap.

448
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:10,570
Scott: if you want just wait for the softcover to come out and buy it.

449
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,115
Scott: It's a single graphic novel.

450
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:12,878
Scott: Just one book.

451
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:13,339
Scott: you read it.

452
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,603
Scott: You're done warning.

453
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:15,667
Rym: It's sad.

454
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:16,610
Scott: It's real sad.

455
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:19,621
Rym: It's not a happy thing if it's your birthday.

456
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:20,785
Rym: You probably don't want to read this.

457
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:30,730
Rym: No, sorry on your birthday Don't read it on a sad day either when other sad things happen Yeah Like if your pet just died or it's your birthday and you have a pet lion.

458
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:34,230
Scott: Read it on a perfectly normal day like before you go to bed or something.

459
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,161
Rym: So you have horrible nightmares about being a lion and Baghdad.

460
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:41,350
Scott: So Ex Machina, it's awesome.

461
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:51,470
Rym: it's really good and remember this is coming from me the man who Absolutely hates 99% of underwear perfect comics and I mean, I can't read this shit.

462
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:59,442
Scott: I tried to read something to review it with Scott and I couldn't finish it Alright, so let me sum up the plot of Ex Machina pretty quickly.

463
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:09,976
Scott: There's a guy named Mitchell hundred as in his last name is hundred as in one zero zero and He's a dude in New York.

464
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,403
Scott: I forget what his original job was.

465
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:19,750
Scott: It wasn't something it wasn't very high-profile and One day he randomly gets some superpowers.

466
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:24,663
Scott: The superpower is that he can communicate with and control technology.

467
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:28,768
Scott: if the technology is too simple like a hammer He can't really do anything.

468
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:34,185
Scott: But if you've got like a gun he can just say jam and the gun will jam.

469
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,570
Scott: if you've got a computer He doesn't even touch the keyboard.

470
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,709
Scott: He just talks to it with his brain or with his mouth and he commands it and he tells the computer what to do.

471
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:47,370
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you how he got the powers or the origin or anything like that because it's kind of silly.

472
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:49,236
Scott: Well, it's not entirely silly.

473
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,082
Scott: well, it's but it's sort of spoilery.

474
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:53,350
Rym: compared to most superhero comic type stuff.

475
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:56,810
Rym: It's actually really more sci-fi than anything.

476
00:32:57,271 --> 00:33:09,350
Scott: It is very sci-fi sort of like the Rocketeer is really how far it goes with the sci-fi superhero kind of stuff Because I mean the dude gets a jetpack that some crazy Russian guy made for him and all that kind of stuff.

477
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:15,868
Scott: So as far as the super Russian guy is my favorite character Yeah, as far as the superhero wing part of it goes think the Rocketeer.

478
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,424
Scott: But that's not why this comic is awesome.

479
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:24,510
Scott: anyone could write You know a Rocketeer clone with a different power and it would be okay.

480
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:31,490
Scott: Why this is awesome is because the story starts not when he has superpowers and is fighting villains or?

481
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,125
Scott: Saving one of the towers of the World Trade Center from falling down.

482
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:37,214
Rym: Yeah, that's a really cool thing I want to talk about in a minute.

483
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,666
Scott: Okay, that's not where the story begins.

484
00:33:39,727 --> 00:34:03,530
Scott: the story begins Where he is the mayor of New York because he's decided he could do better to help the city by being the mayor then by being a superhero that flies around with a jetpack and most of the plot lines are mostly the political in nature like Someone makes a controversial piece of artwork and wants to put it in a museum.

485
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,667
Scott: So he has to deal with it and he has to deal with you know, what the people think.

486
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:18,810
Scott: and yeah He's the mayor of New York and he's dealing with things that are kind of realistic in a West Wing TV show sort of way for what the mayor of New York would have to do.

487
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:27,717
Rym: Yeah, and the characters really well fleshed out and the politics are interesting in that they're not all Consistently to the left to the right to center.

488
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:29,242
Rym: They're all over the place.

489
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:35,110
Scott: Yeah, he's not like some bleeding-heart liberal guy He's not some wicked war hawk conservative guy.

490
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:42,458
Scott: He sort of does things that make sense and sometimes you agree and sometimes you disagree and sometimes you're like, yeah That's what you should do.

491
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:43,790
Scott: And sometimes you're like, why are you doing that?

492
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,719
Rym: That's kind of weird Yeah, and he disagrees with things that he does like.

493
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:53,708
Rym: at one point he ends up banning smoking in New York City But at the same time he's pissed off about it and he goes to smoke cigarettes all the time.

494
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,775
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's.

495
00:34:56,036 --> 00:35:00,110
Scott: it's pretty cool because he does things a lot of times for you know political reasons.

496
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,804
Scott: I think it's a very well not in 100% realistic.

497
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:11,047
Scott: It's a more realistic political scenario than other things would have you then and say sanctuary or Eagle.

498
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:15,037
Scott: Yeah Our Captain America Captain America.

499
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:20,946
Rym: What's the moral of sanctuary is if you're a badass you can rape your way to the top.

500
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,998
Scott: Yeah, ex-mocking is a little more realistic than that.

501
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:33,090
Scott: and what's cool is, you know, there's superhero wing but It provides sort of this background sort of like fancy Lala.

502
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,850
Scott: It's a magical girl show but it has this dinosaur plot hiding in the background, you know.

503
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:43,910
Scott: So whenever the magical girl stuff gets a little boring They always have this little dinosaur plot going on to keep it together.

504
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:50,930
Scott: You know, I work, you know has this political mayor of New York story this little superhero thing going on in the background.

505
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:56,030
Rym: I worry one day that we're gonna actually see the end of fancy Lala and find out what that dinosaur things about.

506
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,650
Scott: It's gonna be disappointing as all hell.

507
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,309
Rym: It's gonna be totally lame and will feel cheated out of the previous seven years.

508
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:05,085
Scott: That's why I'm probably never going to watch the end of fancy Lala.

509
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,190
Rym: It's just like Black Samurai.

510
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,404
Scott: We can't watch it, but I am going to read all of ex-mocking it.

511
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:21,790
Rym: now one thing that's cool it's got mention know the World Trade Center and there are other little things like this, but History pretty much diverges from actual American history at the point at which this guy gets his superpowers.

512
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:25,202
Rym: So they won't show any of this stuff like.

513
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,570
Rym: they don't show him doing all these things.

514
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:40,333
Rym: In fact, they skip over a lot of his past and reveal it in tiny flashbacks throughout the reading and they allude to things like They kind of allude to the fact that the towers were saved by this guy And then

515
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:41,056
Scott: they allude

516
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:42,923
Rym: to it more and more and it's kind

517
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:43,164
Scott: of this

518
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:50,270
Rym: slightly altered history Like wow, things are a little bit different in this world as a result of this with far-reaching consequences.

519
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:54,160
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely really cool that you know, there were.

520
00:36:54,441 --> 00:37:01,270
Scott: there were a bunch of superheroing standard Underwear pervert adventures at some point in the timeline of this story.

521
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:09,021
Scott: But though those events do not take place on the pages of ex-mocking it They have taken place in the way past.

522
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,310
Scott: so they could write a whole prequel comic to this.

523
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:15,383
Scott: That would be just as big and crazy as every other superhero comic, but they don't.

524
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:24,298
Scott: they're only telling this story Which is way cooler because it has lots of political action and not so much flying around Talking to guns action.

525
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:32,990
Rym: and also the thing that I think is really cool Is that almost every superhero thing suffers from supervillain syndrome where all right, you have a superhero.

526
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:39,609
Rym: Well, the only thing that a superhero could ever have trouble with is an equally powerful supervillain.

527
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:43,922
Rym: Thus there's a flimsy excuse for some supervillain for them to fight in this.

528
00:37:43,982 --> 00:37:45,988
Rym: there aren't really supervillains per se.

529
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:54,417
Rym: there are Things that happen for the same reasons that this guy has his power But they're really not at all like the classic.

530
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,430
Rym: I am the evil magneto and I am going to oppose everything professor Xavier does.

531
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:14,674
Scott: Yeah, occasionally I mean I think there's a couple plot lines where there is someone making mischief or people targeting him in some way You know, but it's never like a supervillain It's more of a. it's like if he finds out what's going on He can usually fix it.

532
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:23,887
Scott: most of the time he fixes it with his mayoral powers and very rarely He fixes it with his superhero powers Which he's not supposed to use because I think the government told him not to.

533
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:27,582
Scott: yeah Cuz it's all secret and everything and he has like this room.

534
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:32,952
Scott: He can go into where his powers won't work but yeah, it's.

535
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,702
Scott: There aren't any villains in the classic sense of you know, haha.

536
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:40,845
Scott: I'm the monster of the week.

537
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,170
Scott: You must defeat me in a fight.

538
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,499
Scott: It's like oh, here's the political situation of the week.

539
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:48,490
Scott: or there'll be two situations going on at the same time.

540
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:55,624
Scott: One of them will be strictly a political thing and one of them will be strict You know, he's got both hands full all the time.

541
00:38:55,664 --> 00:39:02,290
Scott: There's never just one thing He's paying attention to which is like I said pretty realistic as mayor's got to deal with all kinds of shit.

542
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,810
Scott: You know some council guy is going crazy.

543
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:12,270
Scott: There's something going down to some labor strike and there's also a crazy killer going around making people feel unsafe.

544
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:17,470
Rym: Yep, and he wants to go stop the killer, but all the government is like no you're the mayor The police will take care of that.

545
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:27,210
Scott: Yeah That's one of the best things to love about this book is that most of the characters are The people around the mayor all his advisors and he's got a bunch of different crazy advisors.

546
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,595
Scott: He got the guy with the dreads.

547
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:41,650
Scott: He's got the really tough police commissioner woman the Hispanic one and there's all these cast of characters directly around him and He sends them off on assignments like, you know to go do things and you see them do it.

548
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,527
Scott: Well, because they're all awesome But he'll get into fights with like the.

549
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,254
Scott: you know The police commissioner like he says.

550
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,204
Scott: I read there's a law that says there can't be any psychics.

551
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:53,810
Scott: go out and bust the psychics And the police lady's like no, we don't want to do it.

552
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,091
Scott: He's like.

553
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:55,698
Scott: you're gonna do it as a law.

554
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:56,401
Scott: go enforce it.

555
00:39:56,461 --> 00:40:00,609
Scott: go do it now because he doesn't like psychics Which is good because I don't like psychics either.

556
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:12,037
Scott: But yet all there's all this cool stuff going on with those people as they disagree with him agree with him do his bidding Don't do his bidding tell him what to do, you know and you'll see.

557
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:13,227
Scott: sometimes he will.

558
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:21,030
Scott: he'll Disagree with the advisor and what he says is what goes and sometimes the advisors will convince him of something when he doesn't know better.

559
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:22,494
Scott: It's pretty cool.

560
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,222
Rym: Yeah, I've said this about other things before.

561
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:25,990
Rym: I think gassaraki was a big example.

562
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,230
Rym: But as far as this sort of thing goes, it's very realistic.

563
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:35,284
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's hard to say that about a superhero comic or a giant robot.

564
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:37,831
Scott: superhero parts of this comic are not realistic but

565
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:53,055
Rym: in terms of it's it's realistic and that suspension of disbelief is easy to Maintain and that peep I mean something non-believable may happen But the way the people in the story react to it and the way it plays out is Very realistic as it.

566
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,600
Rym: if that happened in the real world.

567
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:57,370
Rym: This is probably how people would tend to react to it.

568
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:01,044
Scott: What else can be said about this awesome comic besides that?

569
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,189
Scott: You should all go and read it.

570
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:03,614
Scott: I don't know times.

571
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,781
Rym: You should all go and read it at least once.

572
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,470
Rym: Yeah, I don't read comics more than once really.

573
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:11,420
Rym: Yeah, except maybe I want to read sanctuary again.

574
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:14,229
Rym: Yeah kind of I want to read it knowing what happens in the end.

575
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:17,446
Scott: Maybe I will read this again when the next volume comes out.

576
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:25,830
Scott: right now There are three volumes of ex machina available trade paperbacks But it is a monthly comic that you can buy in comic book form.

577
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,870
Scott: You know one issue at a time and it comes out once a month.

578
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:35,489
Scott: I don't know if you'll be able to get all the previous issues But you can definitely get the new issue when it comes out each month.

579
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:37,822
Scott: There's also an ex machina special.

580
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,230
Scott: that is just two issues.

581
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:45,856
Scott: That is a special side story from the past or whatever and I have them But I don't know if they're gonna.

582
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:49,271
Scott: they might publish those in a future trade paperback or not It's.

583
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,119
Scott: it's unclear if that's gonna happen.

584
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:53,509
Scott: But yeah, it's totally cool.

585
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:58,270
Rym: So before we close up the show for tonight, I got a couple of little metal meta things.

586
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:04,652
Rym: well one thing that I really want to tell all of you out there because I know you don't all go to the forums but Way back.

587
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:11,970
Rym: We did a show on Big O to a Final Thoughts episode where we spoiled the whole show and we talked about all of it.

588
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,978
Rym: you know we analyzed the show from our perspective as viewers and we We really kind of did our final like.

589
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:33,150
Rym: here's what I think of the way this show ended and the way you know when this Character died and when this thing exploded and blah blah blah in a way that we really can't talk about a show when we're reviewing It because you know spoiling things for people is not cool and I hate to do a show Where all the people who haven't seen the show?

590
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:37,487
Rym: Though the other show that we're talking about on our show have to not listen.

591
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:38,371
Scott: Yeah It's.

592
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:48,710
Scott: it's nice to say that moat ninety nine point nine percent of the episodes of GeekNights Anyone can listen to without prerequisite other than understanding and comprehending the English language, you know.

593
00:42:48,710 --> 00:43:02,429
Scott: It's like if all of a sudden in order to listen to GeekNights You had to have already seen a show or already played a video game in order to get Entertainment value out of it, you know, you know as opposed to negative entertainment out of it.

594
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:10,142
Scott: That's not a good thing because it basically alienates a bunch of listeners But at the same time that episode is really fun to do.

595
00:43:10,162 --> 00:43:17,350
Rym: it was very very popular And more importantly many of you have been asking us to do that for other shows.

596
00:43:17,892 --> 00:43:19,560
Rym: So now is your chance week.

597
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,786
Rym: We could do them every week.

598
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,510
Rym: There's a lot of anime.

599
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,523
Rym: We've seen that we could talk about an excruciating pain.

600
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:26,593
Scott: I need to refresh my mind But yeah,

601
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:40,250
Rym: well, yeah and hence in order to make this the best for everyone I made a thread in the forums where I want you to nominate What shows you want us to do this for and then once not after another week or so when all the nominations?

602
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,555
Rym: I think that are worth that are in.

603
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:48,610
Rym: I'm gonna make a poll and whatever show wins the poll We are going to as soon as is feasible do a final thoughts.

604
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,303
Rym: Here's exactly what we think about this show and how it ended.

605
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:51,625
Rym: show.

606
00:43:51,645 --> 00:44:00,190
Scott: Mm-hmm yeah, basically we're looking for shows that most people have seen in their entirety and would be interested in hearing an in-depth analysis of.

607
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:03,962
Rym: Right now the frontrunners seem to be utenna and try gun.

608
00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:06,049
Scott: Yeah, those are pretty good ones.

609
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:18,620
Rym: now Of course, we can't do a show that we haven't seen and whatever show it is We're probably gonna watch it through real quick again to refer at least watch the important episodes or you know Watch each episode for a few minutes to remind us.

610
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:19,985
Scott: Oh, yeah, then this episode.

611
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,250
Scott: then that one.

612
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,213
Scott: Yeah, okay.

613
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:25,281
Rym: Like if you want us to talk about Gundam seed, I need a little bit of time.

614
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,304
Scott: Yep 50 episode monster.

615
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:31,401
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I think is that shows easy to talk about.

616
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,610
Scott: Yeah Gundam see that actually be a pretty good one.

617
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,049
Scott: I wouldn't mind if people voted for that, especially since I'm watching it and I've seen it.

618
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:45,270
Scott: I've seen it like one point seven five times Because I watched it three quarters of the way through on fan sub and then I watched the whole thing through on DVD.

619
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:48,380
Scott: So it wouldn't be too bad to do that show.

620
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:51,230
Rym: Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun watching the end of the show again.

621
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,645
Scott: I gotta say it's a fun show even though it's not the best show ever.

622
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:57,783
Rym: Yeah, other than when Certain characters cry.

623
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:06,118
Scott: Yeah God Not the fact that they're Okay, okay.
