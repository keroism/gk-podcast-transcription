1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,631
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday, February 16th.

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,313
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:16,900
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the 90s OAV my hope sky tie.

4
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,007
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:27,284
Rym: So get this.

6
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:31,540
Rym: I was poking around on the internet and there was an article on FARC about blockbuster of all things.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,945
Scott: I thought blockbuster was out of business.

8
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:37,400
Rym: There are still apparently blockbuster stores in a few places that aren't gone yet.

9
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,760
Scott: What is the towns like only old people?

10
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,188
Scott: Apparently are they towns where they don't.

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,816
Scott: not only they they only have dial-up internet.

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,906
Scott: So no one get Netflix and Everyone's old.

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,294
Scott: so they don't know how to use.

14
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:49,979
Scott: you know.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,880
Scott: Well, here's the thing and they don't have one of those red boxes at the grocery store.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,294
Rym: Blockbuster was completely irrelevant.

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,003
Rym: that the brick-and-mortar Blockbuster.

18
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:01,800
Rym: well, I'm not provide anything that I couldn't just get online from Netflix.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,599
Scott: I thought the red but the red box at the grocery store put it out.

20
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,879
Rym: Actually, the red boxes are doing really shittily now, too.

21
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,267
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean they they were.

22
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:11,707
Scott: it's sort of like it was the combination of the red box and then Yeah, I agree.

23
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:18,862
Rym: until it put it out this FARC article I was convinced like you that there is no purpose left in the world for a brick-and-mortar Blockbuster.

24
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:28,098
Scott: wait, let me guess which all of the extra stock from every other blockbuster that went out of business all went to this One blockbuster which is now a paradise of cheap DVDs and video games for a penny.

25
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:28,700
Rym: Not quite.

26
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:39,169
Rym: This was sad to me a little bit because as a kid I mean blockbuster is the only place that in Suncoast I could either go to Suncoast and buy my anime for like a $40 VHS with two episodes at a time.

27
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,800
Rym: Yeah, or I could go to Blockbuster and watch like dune megalopolis.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,668
Scott: Yeah, we had FYE Sam Goody in blockbuster.

29
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,700
Rym: Yeah, but no apparently, you know, you can just download movies over the internet.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,849
Rym: But you know, you can't download right cash.

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,582
Rym: someone fucking robbed one of the last blockbusters Okay.

32
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:59,620
Rym: Yeah, so I guess there's still a purpose for the brick-and-mortar blockbuster.

33
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:00,905
Scott: You know what?

34
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,100
Scott: You can't rob Netflix or Amazon.

35
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:04,943
Scott: That's actually.

36
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:05,907
Scott: that's actually like.

37
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,979
Scott: I'll bet you could rob an Amazon warehouse.

38
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,556
Scott: It would be very difficult.

39
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,584
Scott: the thing I don't think it would.

40
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:19,240
Scott: that actually, you know, you think about it, right and you're like, okay How does Amazon make so much more, you know, how can they charge so much less than Best Buy, right?

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,880
Scott: It's like well, they don't have the cost of the store and the sales people and all that.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,599
Scott: But they do have other costs like servers and these sorts of things, right?

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:35,216
Scott: but a significant cost to Best Buy's and other retail stores is basically Insurance and also like basically, you know stop-loss, which is shoplifting.

44
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,280
Scott: it cost them a lot of money.

45
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,418
Scott: Amazon has zero shoplifting compared to pretty much any percentage.

46
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,500
Scott: actually They save a ton of money on that.

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,901
Rym: How do you know?

48
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:46,131
Rym: because most loss is actually employees and not customers.

49
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,840
Rym: and there are people who work in the Amazon warehouses.

50
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:50,849
Rym: You don't you can't tell me I don't.

51
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,160
Rym: there aren't people just taking boxes of shit out of there.

52
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,620
Scott: I don't think people are walking out of the Amazon warehouse with a bike with tons of shit.

53
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,568
Rym: I would I'd be interested actually.

54
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:00,291
Rym: I'm a shareholder.

55
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,240
Rym: I should email and be like, what are your loss statistics?

56
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,247
Rym: I really want to know.

57
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,335
Scott: you can get the annual report.

58
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:04,900
Scott: if it's public.

59
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,208
Scott: Yeah, it's probably in.

60
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,153
Scott: it might not be in.

61
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,240
Scott: there might be find out.

62
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,005
Rym: I've only.

63
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,058
Scott: I'll be very interested to see about.

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,578
Scott: you know The theft if there is any from Amazon and any other internet there's gotta be.

65
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,580
Scott: I mean, there's some retailers that are also brick-and-mortar stores, right?

66
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:27,125
Scott: Like Midtown Comics will sell you comics online, but you can also go to the store and I'm sure people steal from Midtown Comics You know, at least sometimes.

67
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,893
Scott: no, I don't know I don't like shoplifting.

68
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:31,959
Scott: that's real stealing it's not okay.

69
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,154
Scott: So this would normally be like a Tuesday news because it's gaming related.

70
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,530
Rym: You got nothing to say about anime Do you know?

71
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:39,400
Scott: but it's Pokemon?

72
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,503
Scott: So it is.

73
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:44,337
Scott: I think the anime crowd the Wednesday listeners care more than the Tuesday listener.

74
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:44,919
Scott: They may.

75
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,191
Scott: So basically, you know the Pokemon card game.

76
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,476
Rym: I know of it.

77
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:54,800
Scott: I've played it on occasion All right, so they're gonna make a thing at the Pokemon website website pickups.

78
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,180
Scott: That's an official game, right?

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:09,148
Scott: It's gonna be a flash game where you can play the Pokemon card game in flash, right and there's three Pre-made decks that you can use.

80
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,520
Scott: Yeah, three pre-constructed decks and twelve virtual trainers.

81
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:16,178
Scott: You can play against across three leagues.

82
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:22,478
Scott: so basically you can go learn how to play the game without spending any money and play it a whole bunch.

83
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,480
Scott: and What I find, you know, I mean that's not the greatest thing in the world.

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,340
Scott: It's not like you can use any card in the world and make any deck and play against any of your friends.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Rym: But I can't say I did enjoy playing a little bit the magic on the Xbox.

86
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,989
Scott: I was gonna say the magic on the Xbox.

87
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,880
Scott: right they try to charge you money for that shit, right?

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Scott: But this is free flash in the browser and is basically to the same extent as the magic at the gathering on the X.

89
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:50,080
Rym: Why is Nintendo so smart about some things and so dumb about very similar thing?

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,164
Scott: Well, I think they're all.

91
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:57,412
Scott: you know, this is like they're smarter than Wizards of the Coast in this particular department But they're not maximum smart.

92
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:01,009
Scott: if they were maximum smart They would say one dollar a month.

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,700
Scott: you get a program or five bucks a month.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,244
Scott: Even you get a program.

95
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:10,380
Scott: you can play the Pokemon card game online against anyone with any card.

96
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,929
Rym: No a much better Forever would be five dollars a month to maintain it.

97
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,080
Rym: and then you know, you get access to all the basic cards.

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,300
Scott: Oh, yeah, you get everyone gets one set, but you have to pay 20 bucks to add a new set of cards.

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,499
Scott: But once you add the new set you can have any card in that set as you could probably get away With forcing them to buy boosters.

100
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,631
Scott: You people do have done that online.

101
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,320
Scott: the way you do it our games that do it.

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,567
Rym: I know the way you do a Pokemon is you sell Physical boosters.

103
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:46,800
Rym: that are the only way you so if you buy a physical booster It has a serial number that gives you a one-shot that gives you an in-game booster and or you can buy an online only booster.

104
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,222
Rym: That's like three dollars cheaper Maybe.

105
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,127
Rym: but that's what I would do.

106
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:56,295
Scott: I mean that's if you want to those kids for everything They're were that would let you milk some kids who were way into it.

107
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,260
Scott: really hard, right?

108
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,780
Rym: But usually milking kids put you in a federal prison.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,107
Scott: But I'm just saying right is if you look at say the way the comic book people do it Right is they'll be like, okay.

110
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:09,360
Scott: We got a new event, you know, it's the crazy war.

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,920
Scott: So they'll have crazy war issues 1 through 12 and have crazy war side story and spider-man crazy war and Batman crazy war issues.

112
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,025
Scott: Right, and they just went.

113
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,411
Scott: so many issues a crazy war.

114
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,560
Scott: the super collecting nerds have to buy them all right.

115
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:25,536
Scott: But I think if you know, no one is willing everyone dips in the toe, right?

116
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:26,800
Scott: No one jumps in the pool.

117
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:32,719
Scott: I think if you made it, you know full-on like Netflix you get infinity cards for.

118
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:40,960
Scott: you know These set prices instead of making people do the collecting thing that enough Extra people would be willing to buy in when the collecting I don't know.

119
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,135
Scott: So it's not there that you would actually make more money.

120
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:43,860
Rym: I don't think so.

121
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,168
Rym: I think they should go one step further.

122
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,819
Scott: you get my money if you did it that way.

123
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:51,771
Rym: No, if they just want to make money why aren't you even thinking about a good game?

124
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,823
Rym: just make a Pokemon skin Farmville Pokeville, that's it.

125
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,592
Rym: That'll make more money than any effort.

126
00:06:58,673 --> 00:06:59,535
Rym: any bullshit.

127
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,000
Scott: Just throw it out there.

128
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:01,866
Scott: But this is pretty.

129
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,940
Rym: it's Farmville, but it's a little Pokemon icon.

130
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:09,594
Rym: You make a little Poke Center and then you you know You put the Pokemon art in the fields and you don't even have to skin it.

131
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,100
Rym: Don't even make the rules different.

132
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,599
Scott: Why don't they do that?

133
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:13,337
Rym: I don't know.

134
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:20,167
Scott: But they could do that and they could also do this and those two things would not conflict with each other and they would Make even more money.

135
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,959
Rym: or they could just make the Pokemon MMO.

136
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:28,997
Scott: They could do all three of those things the card game the Farmville and the MMO and none of them would conflict with each other And they would all make maximum money.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,629
Rym: So further all the outside things are ways to get items that are Of course, they were all.

138
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,340
Scott: all three of those things would cross over.

139
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:44,737
Scott: So in the Pokemon MMO you would find cards you could use to play the card game And if you win the card game against someone you get points you can use to upgrade your Farmville.

140
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,615
Scott: and in your Farmville You would grow items and those items would be used in the MMO.

141
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:54,283
Scott: I Just pictured a kid growing and since you can only play each game on a little bit each day So you can.

142
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,350
Scott: now you've got enough games.

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,879
Scott: You can occupy your entire living time with spare time with Pokemon games.

144
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,079
Scott: so anyway, and then you can cross it over with the actual GBA game.

145
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:12,137
Rym: and Okay, it's interesting to me and kind of sad that you know We see pretty much every anime movie that comes out in theaters in New York.

146
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:21,760
Rym: because every good one Yeah, everyone that isn't one piece number 100 But even then it's there aren't that many anime movies let alone anime movies that actually are in the u.s.

147
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,842
Scott: Well, there are a whole bunch but they're all like I said one piece number 35,000.

148
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:31,292
Rym: yeah, there aren't even that many of those 10. yeah, that's not that man.

149
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,034
Scott: That's a line.

150
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,100
Scott: They come out with one every year.

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,753
Scott: They come with a Pokemon movie every year they come at right.

152
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,200
Scott: So this is quite a few of them.

153
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,431
Rym: I considered watching Pokemon forever the other day.

154
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,076
Scott: So I guess that was number four.

155
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,184
Scott: I Guess we saw.

156
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:46,820
Scott: anyone we saw was number three the best way to see anime.

157
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,525
Rym: It said that it's during this.

158
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:53,480
Rym: but the New York International Children's Film Festival, which is an awesome event in and of itself.

159
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,099
Rym: It's just this great kind of film festival in New York, and there's no reason not to go.

160
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:08,040
Rym: but they always show pretty much every current big anime movie and The crowd at the anime movies at these things is half kids and half people like me and Scott.

161
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,631
Rym: Yeah, like the same posse.

162
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:11,000
Scott: It's actually a pretty good crowd though.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,549
Rym: I remember we saw summer wars that way.

164
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,520
Scott: summer wars is on DVD blu-ray.

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,977
Rym: I think today we got that great Q&A at the end when all the questions were why is King Cosmo so awesome?

166
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,808
Rym: is King Cosmo Your favorite character when I grow up?

167
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,531
Rym: who's your favorite?

168
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,620
Scott: I was like, who's your favorite character grandma?

169
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:29,425
Scott: Was I supposed to say So?

170
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:33,919
Rym: this year the International Children's Film Festival has two anime movies in addition to everything else.

171
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,950
Rym: We got tell welcome to the space show.

172
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,700
Rym: Mm-hmm and time of Eve.

173
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:38,524
Scott: All right.

174
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:41,680
Scott: So if anyone lives welcome to the space show was shown at the Otakon.

175
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,692
Rym: Yeah, I go to if anyone's in the New York area.

176
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,520
Rym: I highly recommend this month.

177
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:50,677
Rym: well I guess next month in March check out the International Children's Film Festival.

178
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:59,951
Rym: and If you like the anime movies, I'd recommend seeing at least one non anime movie summer wars is on DVD and blu-ray starting yesterday.

179
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,259
Rym: But anyway things of the day, what do you got?

180
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,646
Scott: Oh, so the new hotness that everybody is all hotness about is obviously MLP FIM.

181
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,807
Rym: I Enjoy my little pony.

182
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, we'll probably do a whole show on it.

183
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,320
Scott: So I'll refrain from saying anything, you know too deep about it to ruin that future show.

184
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,524
Scott: But here is a totally awesome super great my little pony AMV.

185
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,460
Rym: it is way well done.

186
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,293
Rym: I mean it's to the level of the good old anime music videos that we would show at conventions or at RIT anime The ones you used to see in like the tournament round.

187
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:44,780
Scott: I would like to go to our T anime.

188
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,743
Scott: Just show the same thing.

189
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:46,727
Rym: Oh my god over.

190
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:52,006
Rym: Well, I don't doubt for a second that they have already shown it at RIT And there's no way they didn't.

191
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,769
Scott: I hope so.

192
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,616
Rym: It's not really an AMV.

193
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,505
Rym: It's not anime Animated music video.

194
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,556
Scott: Yeah animation music video is spider-man manga.

195
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:08,800
Scott: Japanese person would say No, it is way good or is it, you know the spider-man manga the one that.

196
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:15,207
Rym: So in the spirit of AMV things of the day because Scott's still my thing of the day That was my head.

197
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:16,114
Rym: I have another AMV.

198
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,271
Rym: I want to go back to the classics because this one's way good, but it's new.

199
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:28,960
Rym: and I realized again that a Good half if not more of the good anime music videos I've ever seen or done by Kevin Caldwell.

200
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,629
Rym: So I linked to one of my favorite AMVs.

201
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,800
Rym: it is to koto cha and it is pretty great.

202
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:39,140
Scott: You know people like koto cha like people don't bring it up at all anymore.

203
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,615
Rym: But this used to be a super popular is a super huge big day deal.

204
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,518
Scott: It's got OAVs.

205
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:46,240
Scott: It's got movies.

206
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,043
Scott: It's got TV.

207
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,865
Scott: It's got manga.

208
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:54,020
Scott: right if you ask a Japanese person with ultra relaxes, there's some good odds They'll know how to do the frickin dance.

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,980
Rym: If you ask any anime fan in America who went to conventions in the 90s, they'll know koto cha, right?

210
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,820
Scott: So this is like a huge deal that like completely disappeared from the mind share of it.

211
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,691
Scott: Nobody talks about fans in the US, right?

212
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:10,100
Scott: So maybe we'll have to watch it and do a show on it.

213
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,501
Scott: We got it.

214
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,503
Scott: We got to bring it back.

215
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:16,646
Rym: Yeah, I mean this kind of like I don't know golden boy Battle athlete.

216
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,840
Scott: those are not quite the same as koto cha.

217
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,271
Scott: They don't have OAVs and TVs now they don't.

218
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,919
Scott: and dances that everybody knows.

219
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,113
Rym: Mangas and you know, I guess part of it's you know, the main bit.

220
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,380
Rym: we're talking about mahoutse kaitai.

221
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,940
Rym: But I I suddenly remembered all the anime that I loved from a long time ago that I haven't seen in a long time.

222
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,917
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's a lot of it.

223
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,860
Rym: But I guess we should do the meta moment because a lot of conventions are coming up in a hurry.

224
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,785
Rym: I remember back in the day convention season.

225
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:47,100
Rym: It's weird, but convention season for me used to be May through like early September.

226
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,040
Scott: Well, most of the conventions are always in the summer because that's summer is to traditional convention season because that's when people are not in school.

227
00:12:54,081 --> 00:13:00,700
Scott: So you can get and you know You can get the most people to show up on a summer weekend and you won't have weather ruining you and such and such.

228
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:00,961
Scott: Yeah,

229
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:01,563
Rym: but I'm San

230
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:06,482
Scott: Diego comic-con Otakon, you know, these things are all in July August You know,

231
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:14,040
Rym: I think anime central was in May but it was like May June July August September was all my cons and then there was Katsucon like hanging off by itself in February

232
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:14,481
Scott: Yep,

233
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:19,556
Rym: but now it's like February starts our convention season and that just goes constantly through the

234
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:20,780
Scott: forever.

235
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:25,023
Scott: Well, I think what happened right is that you had more conventions Can you know?

236
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,960
Scott: and the thing is we go to a wider geographic area of conventions?

237
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,213
Rym: We also stopped going to a lot of conventions though.

238
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:35,934
Rym: We got like we hit a peak I think earlier and I don't think we go to more cons now than we used to.

239
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,380
Rym: I think we just go to more quality Cons, right?

240
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:49,600
Scott: But anyway, the thing is is that conventions as more of them appeared moved and shuffled to get out of the way and basically the bigger ones got the times they Wanted and all the other ones that have moved to the side, right?

241
00:13:50,381 --> 00:14:02,560
Scott: so you've got like anime Boston in April and you got PAX East in March and you've got New York comic-con in October and you Got PAX West in September and you got Otakon in August July and you got ConnectiCon also in all.

242
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,929
Rym: now The reason I bring that up.

243
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,420
Rym: It's kind of you know, this is the meta moment.

244
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,100
Rym: Usually we just do announcements, but this is kind of a very gignite scheduling thing.

245
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,477
Rym: A lot of people inquire asking us to come to conventions many of them like generic on.

246
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:19,167
Rym: a lot of cons recently have been asking us to come and Don't feel bad that we don't come.

247
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:23,060
Rym: we basically are already at critical mass of very large conventions.

248
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,886
Rym: Yeah Let alone small ones.

249
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,480
Scott: and part of the reason we don't come is now that we're in New York City.

250
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,078
Scott: We used to go to more mostly because we had cars and we had more free time.

251
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,099
Rym: now That's not in any way the reason I don't go to little cons.

252
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:35,984
Scott: That's the reason.

253
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,636
Scott: one of the reasons I'm going is because you know, we're in the city.

254
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:39,460
Scott: We don't have cars.

255
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Scott: So, you know getting there it is is an extra cost and I can just go down and get that zipcar if I want it.

256
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,882
Rym: That's not.

257
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,268
Rym: that's not the reason I don't go.

258
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,193
Scott: Yeah, but they still.

259
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,620
Scott: it's one of the reasons I'm not going.

260
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:50,365
Scott: It's it's.

261
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,740
Scott: it's an increased cost of transportation.

262
00:14:53,361 --> 00:15:00,159
Scott: And is it really worth a vacation day and a whole weekend, you know for a car, you know It's got you got to make it worth my while.

263
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:08,783
Scott: You know Scott Some conventions make it worth my while because their conventions are so awesome that it's worthwhile Like packs.

264
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:18,440
Scott: and some conventions make it worthwhile because they're so awesome like anime Boston, but anime Boston also Gives us money, which I would still go if they did not give us money.

265
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,386
Scott: But they do because they just do.

266
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:27,472
Rym: but I guess the whole moral of this is just that we've been rebuffing a lot of requests Lately, so if anyone's listening you're wondering why.

267
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:31,050
Rym: you know, maybe you told your convention Hey get GeekNights and GeekNights side.

268
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,779
Scott: This meta moment is turning into the meta month.

269
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:35,052
Scott: So let's let's just get to it.

270
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:39,251
Rym: the convention is the original Intent of the meta moment to get out all the kind of meta.

271
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,460
Scott: Yeah, but it's also supposed to only be a moment.

272
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:42,980
Scott: We don't want to fill the show with too much meta.

273
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,375
Scott: So the conventions we are going to in very near times are PAX East.

274
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:56,611
Scott: we're doing three panels Week after PAX East Zenkai con we're doing a bunch of pan one anime panel Then the rest is all gaming kind of old recycled packs panels.

275
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,920
Scott: and then in April anime, Boston.

276
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:05,940
Rym: We are confirmed as always preferred panelists will be an anime Boston bringing the a-game and those are the near-term conventions.

277
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,811
Scott: You should go to all our way.

278
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,636
Rym: You want to hurry this up.

279
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:09,999
Rym: You're all.

280
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,129
Scott: What do you mean?

281
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:12,814
Scott: You're delaying it.

282
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:21,018
Scott: right now We have all signs of websites and Twitter accounts and all sorts of internet presence for front row crew.

283
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,440
Scott: calm You should go and check out all our stuffs and our Twitter's and everything to participate with us.

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,837
Rym: You see I feel like this would be more focused if every show you just did one like don't forget the forum.

285
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,586
Rym: and then some Other show be like don't forget.

286
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:34,960
Rym: We got a Twitter that tweets out the things of the day.

287
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,244
Scott: We could do that.

288
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,130
Rym: I don't think we need the whole.

289
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,720
Rym: we've got an internet thing.

290
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,012
Rym: All right, if you're worried about speeding it up.

291
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,420
Rym: I mean, that's the best way to speed it.

292
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,708
Scott: Yeah, and so you're slowing it down right now again.

293
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:48,000
Scott: The book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

294
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,114
Scott: How far in that I'd still didn't read anything beyond chapter one.

295
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,344
Scott: I Got time.

296
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:54,170
Rym: you got time.

297
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:54,814
Rym: We should.

298
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,689
Rym: we could do the show though It's an important book.

299
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,639
Scott: We'll do it real soon.

300
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:06,883
Rym: So way back when we were at RIT We would you know pick up just a random anime or if we couldn't pick anything we'd ask the wise and old veterans of the Anime club.

301
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,229
Rym: Hey, what should we watch?

302
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,760
Scott: They pretty much just watched everything eventually.

303
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:20,819
Rym: Yeah I mean there were literally like four or five hundred VHS tapes of just fan subs and pro releases and everything and we got up To a thousand while we were running the club later with Scott Johnson.

304
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,436
Rym: Even when we were freshmen there was more anime than we could ever possibly watch.

305
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,900
Scott: our consumption rate However was extremely high.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,741
Scott: We watched a ton of and well the entire for enemies that if they came out today We would not even give a second Look.

307
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:38,860
Rym: the entire front row crew as it was back then would go to the anime club and we were all members.

308
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,811
Rym: So after we'd all go to the library and each one of us would check out three tapes And then we would.

309
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:44,680
Scott: we had a lot of people.

310
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,252
Scott: So if you had five people you had 15 VHS tapes of anime.

311
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,400
Scott: many of those tapes had like four episodes on.

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,645
Rym: That's all of Ava.

313
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,152
Scott: That's a lot of tapes.

314
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:57,480
Rym: In fact, I remember that one time on my birthday I happened to win the raffle and it was my birthday.

315
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,439
Rym: So they gave me a gift and the gift was check out as many tapes as you want.

316
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,160
Rym: Yep, I checked out all of Ava in fact that day.

317
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,780
Rym: But of all the many shows we watched at RIT one that I kind of Forgot about until relatively recently was Maho Skytie Magic Users Club the OAV.

318
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,460
Rym: Yeah, we're not talking about the TV show or the manga or any of the other stuff related to it.

319
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,480
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of crazy that this show that people really don't know about or you don't even know exists.

320
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,442
Rym: Mostly I've never seen a cosplay of this Ever.

321
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:27,407
Scott: I don't know if I have.

322
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,131
Scott: I don't remember it.

323
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:42,052
Rym: I might have maybe It's possible but anyway It's just a random show that we watched one of many many shows and when I remembered that it existed a few months ago I remembered that I enjoyed it, but I didn't remember the plot at all.

324
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:43,136
Scott: I remembered.

325
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,267
Scott: I remember aliens Yeah, and there was a magic.

326
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:55,480
Scott: there were kids at a high school and they had a club where they were doing magic Yeah, and that next door to them was the manga club that was fighting with them by pushing the wall back.

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,040
Rym: I remembered that very clearly.

328
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:07,075
Scott: I knew that the aliens had a big bell and I remembered what the main character looked like with like her hair looks like a Mop, and I remember that the main dude is told nerd.

329
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:08,380
Scott: and that's all I remembered.

330
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:19,175
Rym: The only other two things I remember that are very important Is that one at some point in the end sigh the main girl has to draw a magic circle and she kind of fucks it Up, I don't remember that.

331
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,440
Scott: remember I watched it and I saw that but I don't remember that stood out in my mind.

332
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,380
Rym: I couldn't tell you why and that the opener is one of my favorite openers to an anime.

333
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,945
Scott: I was a real good opener with the That little bit.

334
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:31,468
Rym: you'll all know.

335
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:32,111
Rym: watch the opener.

336
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,056
Rym: I'll link to just pa.

337
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:35,082
Rym: pa and it's.

338
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:38,454
Rym: I don't know that just the openers is so like 90s anime fun.

339
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:43,690
Scott: and Well, the whole show is 90s anime fun, right?

340
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,819
Scott: I mean especially with like casting magic spells like it.

341
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:48,943
Scott: It's.

342
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:52,619
Scott: it's a lot of the slayers kind of humor that goes on.

343
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:59,448
Scott: I guess I did not including like, you know tall big-breasted women who go It's in the whole thing.

344
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,780
Rym: Well, I didn't remember much else about the show.

345
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,300
Rym: I didn't know how the plot was resolved written really what the plot was.

346
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:15,700
Rym: No I really Didn't know if the show would hold up because I have nostalgia for a lot of anime and you know I rewatched Ava not that long ago and Oh Ava's brilliant and everyone says otherwise is stupid.

347
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,558
Rym: I rewatched Trigun not that long ago great show but not as great as I remembered.

348
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:28,919
Rym: Yeah, you know it's a mixed bag watch an old anime that used to like and My own sky tie actually way exceeded my expectations of holding up.

349
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:35,431
Scott: Well and the one hand right it sort of you know Exceeded it and also did not exceed the expectations.

350
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:41,755
Scott: right because I was expecting like all right It'll be a cute magic girl show whatever, you know, it'll be.

351
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,160
Scott: it'll be average, right?

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,620
Scott: But it was slightly above average, but it was way more perverted than I ever remember.

353
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,263
Rym: See, I don't.

354
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:51,533
Rym: I would argue that it's not really that perverted.

355
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,000
Scott: It's pretty perverted.

356
00:20:53,861 --> 00:21:09,530
Scott: Even in the extreme climax of the final episode where they're resolving the core plot They're fantasizing with the panty shots and the boobs and such at the even at the very height of every, you know I mean at least some shows that have fan service.

357
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:15,008
Scott: when you get down to resolving the core plot They can put the fan service behind them.

358
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:17,580
Scott: the thing is and the fans focus on the climax.

359
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:21,537
Rym: Here's a big difference between an old anime like this and modern fanservice.

360
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,892
Scott: That is true Is that the fan service is a lot less gratuitous.

361
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,080
Scott: No, not even what I'm gonna say kiss exists.

362
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:39,880
Rym: All I'm saying is that the fanservice in this show was basically serving the joke that Takeo You know the president of the Magic Club would get distracted and kind of whenever there's a dangerous situation.

363
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,452
Rym: He just kind of have this weird fantasy.

364
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,020
Rym: It always played that one weird song.

365
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,247
Scott: Yeah, I guess if you're unable to think in the meta Then you could do you.

366
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,260
Scott: you could say that that is an excuse for all the pervertedness.

367
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,400
Scott: But then is not the you know, Moe excuse also valid?

368
00:21:55,842 --> 00:22:02,319
Rym: Because I also note that the way they did those scenes is that every time every time there was fan service They wouldn't really animate it.

369
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,815
Rym: They'd come to like a series of kind of blurry shots of life and it was always the same stupid fantasy.

370
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:13,772
Rym: He's always like oh They're all gonna suddenly rip their clothes off and adore me.

371
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:17,102
Scott: Well, that was the clever trick They use.

372
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:19,610
Scott: right is basically okay in.

373
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:32,530
Scott: the characters won't actually get all sexual and naked But what we'll do is we'll have this one guy The pervert will imagine them doing that so we can draw them in their underwear without the characters quote Really being in their underwear.

374
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,120
Scott: Ah, but thus they won't be like.

375
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,948
Rym: version of Takeo is very.

376
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,074
Rym: I don't know it fits his character.

377
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:39,375
Rym: all that.

378
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:45,115
Scott: I guess the characters are all really yes We made a perverted character so we could make the anime perverted but he's not that perverted.

379
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,380
Rym: He's actually just a loophole.

380
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:48,127
Rym: He's just a nice normal guy.

381
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:48,749
Scott: He's a nice.

382
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,620
Scott: He's a relatively nice not as creepy pervert.

383
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:59,840
Rym: Still I'm curious why you're fixating on this so much because there actually wasn't that much fan service.

384
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,824
Scott: Is it really it just?

385
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:08,960
Scott: it really stood out to me when I while I did not remember the show being you know Like that and when I watch it again, it just really stood out like every single episode.

386
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,615
Scott: There were like at least four or five, you know, everybody's in their underwear Joe.

387
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,062
Rym: actually no there was about one Explosion.

388
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:16,768
Scott: now there was quite a few for it.

389
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:20,360
Scott: I don't know what you watch count because there were definitely multiple.

390
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:26,020
Rym: I'm really surprised that that stood out to you so much because what stood out to me was just how funny it was.

391
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:29,000
Scott: It was pretty funny, but it wasn't extremely fun.

392
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:33,279
Scott: I mean, you know other than the pervertedness the rest of the show it was like.

393
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,600
Scott: alright It was like ko beast maybe better than ko beast quality.

394
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:46,378
Scott: It was like hey, you know this plot with the aliens is actually pretty interesting and you know The even though each episode is sort of like an episodic kind of.

395
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:46,720
Scott: you know.

396
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:55,029
Scott: Situation is they're actually stringing it together and the characters are actually good characters and you know the there are plenty of funniness of.

397
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:01,560
Rym: I'm just still hung up on your weird kind of Fixation on the relatively minimal fan service II jokes in the show.

398
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:01,996
Rym: I don't know.

399
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,585
Scott: I don't know if you've been watching like a whole bunch of crazy moe shows that you know I just that perversion was minimal.

400
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:12,340
Rym: level of fan service is barely what I would even use the word perversion for okay.

401
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,180
Scott: So maybe on some animes otaku scale On a normal person scale is pretty high.

402
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:23,596
Rym: Have you watched any popular show like Dexter lately?

403
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:24,740
Rym: There's similar level.

404
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,827
Scott: I even know what that is.

405
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,175
Rym: Yeah, cuz you don't watch anything.

406
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,040
Rym: You have no perspective.

407
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:32,280
Scott: Maybe show maybe TVs just getting real perverted and I've been watching too many old animes.

408
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,180
Rym: But Scott if it's getting really perverted old stuff isn't any more perverted than news.

409
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,188
Scott: I mean, I've been watching like 70s stuff though.

410
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,080
Rym: So a lot of 70s stuff is also kind of perverted.

411
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,200
Scott: Yeah, the galaxy Express is not preferred.

412
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:46,473
Rym: I wouldn't use the word perverted if I had to say anything off the show.

413
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:50,143
Rym: I'd call it a heartwarming Comedy.

414
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:52,310
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's it's you know, the perversion is not.

415
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,180
Scott: I'm not saying that the perversion is the majority of the show.

416
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,380
Scott: I'm saying is that saying that it's barely know worthy and you're really fixed is definitely noteworthy.

417
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,082
Scott: It is a. it is not a majority but it is at least like 10%.

418
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,400
Rym: First episode of blue seed was way more perverted than mahout sky tie.

419
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:09,245
Scott: I'm not saying.

420
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,860
Scott: I'm saying is that on an anime scale right?

421
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,150
Scott: It's probably less perverted than a lot of animes But it is still quite perverted.

422
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:23,051
Scott: a significant portion of this show is TNA and underwear And ladies and you know it is.

423
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:25,742
Scott: if you cut that out you would have 10% less.

424
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,692
Rym: you have to go to the listeners on this.

425
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:32,740
Rym: you guys watch the show cuz one, you know If you want to skip the whole review the show I think is definitely worth watching.

426
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,485
Scott: It's a short OAV.

427
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:38,300
Scott: You can watch it in like a night and it's really entertaining and really funny.

428
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:48,793
Rym: I'm just I'm asking you this listeners when you watch it think to yourself how Perverted you think this show is and compare my feelings to Scott's.

429
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:49,074
Rym: Okay.

430
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,079
Scott: We'll compare it to apocalypse zero.

431
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,404
Scott: Sure It's completely clean.

432
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,307
Scott: It's safe for children.

433
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:53,949
Scott: No Scott.

434
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,320
Rym: I'm just saying that I don't think they're gonna find it terribly perverted.

435
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,246
Scott: I am saying a significant portion.

436
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,032
Scott: I think you have a 10%.

437
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,536
Rym: I think you're you're obsessed.

438
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:03,640
Scott: Okay, I'm obsessed.

439
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,240
Rym: So anyway, the plot of mahout sky tie is actually pretty straightforward.

440
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,080
Rym: There's aliens that come down and they're better than everything we've got.

441
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,858
Rym: They just wipe out all the armies of the world and they have this giant bell and they broadcast that We're here to take over the earth and invade it.

442
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:24,929
Rym: Yeah And then they just kind of stick around and everyone just kind of gets used to them and they're just there Watching everybody like going and they're weird.

443
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:25,290
Scott: They're not eat.

444
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,595
Scott: They're like weird robot aliens.

445
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:30,238
Scott: They're not like green aliens they're all robots and mechanical type shit.

446
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:41,800
Rym: and Independent of this a guy happens to know magic and he started a magic users club in his school like any other club and it's actually one of the Least popular clubs and no one really cares about it.

447
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,538
Rym: But they actually just do real magic and I kind of like how the way the show does the magic is they?

448
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,322
Rym: they have these Kind of fetishes that they use, you know The little duck.

449
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:53,880
Scott: if the aesthetic styling of the magic is pretty cool because I get they draw symbols.

450
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,772
Scott: They had the quacking duck on a stick.

451
00:26:55,812 --> 00:27:00,993
Scott: They ride on a broom Which is but they're not which is very self consistent.

452
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,100
Rym: and just like the duck is never explained.

453
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,227
Rym: None of that stuff is explained.

454
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,092
Scott: It is explained.

455
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:07,985
Scott: It's Explained in episode four.

456
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,530
Rym: I think yes, it's explained that.

457
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:09,810
Rym: yes.

458
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,315
Rym: I got the duck from this box.

459
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,719
Scott: Yeah, he was a basically he.

460
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,191
Rym: Where'd the box come from?

461
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:17,259
Rym: Why is it a duck?

462
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,767
Scott: There's no it's an ancient artifact.

463
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,460
Scott: and he found his box in a cliffside cave near the beach.

464
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:25,679
Scott: Yeah, and that box contained all the magics.

465
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:31,307
Scott: Yeah, but it was an ancient relic of magic from an agent Anything beyond that.

466
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,300
Rym: like they didn't go into any depth at all.

467
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,869
Rym: It's just this is the way it works.

468
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:36,920
Rym: a picture of this thing will make magic happen.

469
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,195
Scott: There was a magic book that was in the box that told him what to do.

470
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,969
Rym: Yeah Yeah, they didn't go into anything beyond that.

471
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,495
Scott: Well, I mean the explanations in the book.

472
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:44,158
Scott: You just haven't read it.

473
00:27:47,183 --> 00:28:00,800
Rym: And they decide he decides Takeo that he's going to fight the bell But actually he only decided this because he wants to impress the girls who I don't even know I don't even really understand the whole like the motivation to fight the bell.

474
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,223
Scott: I mean cuz it's like in the beginning of the first episode they're going out to investigate it right on their brooms And whatever.

475
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:07,550
Rym: cuz the bell keeps messing with them.

476
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,173
Rym: That's why they wanted.

477
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:08,997
Scott: does the bell key?

478
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:09,520
Scott: messing with them?

479
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,761
Rym: It just sort of rolls around town checking shit out until it sees magic and then it freaks the fuck out and tries to kill People.

480
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:19,097
Scott: right but that was only after they went and started using the magic near it wasn't messing with they.

481
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,940
Scott: I think they messed with The bell first before the bell messed with them.

482
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:28,060
Rym: Oh, but I point out not to really spoil But once you know what the bell was actually after they were pretty justified in fighting the bell.

483
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:29,325
Scott: But I mean the bell was sort of.

484
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,952
Scott: I mean, here's the thing right?

485
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:31,796
Scott: That's the trick.

486
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,342
Scott: That's what the bell is So smart.

487
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,873
Scott: wait, you know, they attacked the bell right away.

488
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,720
Scott: Did you do but remember Independence Day, right?

489
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,270
Scott: It's like are these aliens peaceful or are they bad?

490
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,607
Scott: and then so it's like well, we don't know yet So we can't attack yet.

491
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,353
Scott: Oh shit.

492
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,320
Scott: They're bad, right?

493
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,265
Scott: It was like you don't know.

494
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:49,719
Rym: until they do so, of course, I point out they did not attack it They simply flew up to it.

495
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:58,684
Scott: Well, no the the opener the very beginning part of every episode which is actually really cool because they keep it completely silent because you Can't hear anything in space You know.

496
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:11,756
Scott: and then as soon as you can hear it once the the opener gets down into the house I got that really not holding up CG from Gonzo Yeah, but they clearly the humans clearly went to war against the bell and laughs.

497
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:19,197
Rym: but they point out before That in the overture it says the bell arrived and announced to the world that it was invading.

498
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,243
Scott: okay, okay I guess that counts.

499
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:23,852
Scott: but in you know, it wasn't invading like.

500
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:28,145
Rym: and at the end the bell was like yeah, we were here to invade Yeah, but it didn't.

501
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:31,606
Scott: it wasn't invading in a militaristic way I think it was.

502
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:37,270
Scott: I think it just was didn't have all the info yet It was yeah, it had years and years and years of reconnaissance.

503
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:38,414
Rym: Yes, and it wasn't done.

504
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:41,605
Scott: It wasn't done with his reconnaissance What was really cool.

505
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:45,119
Scott: this is one of the and if they're doing reconnaissance in plain sight like here I am.

506
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:59,440
Rym: No, any live planes big black balls rolling on the show is basically that this magic users Club antagonizes the bell and It's a cast of five just actually I'd say really strong really well done characters that complement each other.

507
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,845
Rym: Well, and what is a very heartwarming?

508
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:05,340
Scott: Yeah, I mean even the weakest character the the sort of the girl who's I guess semi famous.

509
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,211
Rym: Any of their names?

510
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,240
Rym: can you name anyone from the show?

511
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,222
Scott: I forget them all.

512
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,074
Rym: so not Sion Anika the two main characters.

513
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:14,636
Scott: That's their names.

514
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:15,339
Rym: Takeo.

515
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:16,306
Rym: Yeah, that's right.

516
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:17,153
Rym: Abras above.

517
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:17,959
Scott: Are you looking at a list?

518
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,267
Rym: Well, I remember them because of the.

519
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:28,151
Rym: every time they did the eye catches or not the eye catches but the Caffeine, um, you know, they're like what's coming up in the next episode.

520
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:30,200
Rym: They just scream each other's names over and over again.

521
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,347
Rym: I Never watched the coming up in the next episode.

522
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,752
Scott: Oh, you should have watched those.

523
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:36,944
Rym: They were actually.

524
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:41,540
Rym: that was a big part of my anime culture back in the day is watching that for every episode of every show.

525
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,022
Scott: Yeah, I never.

526
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:50,960
Rym: I never watched the next episode bits except for initial D Don't miss it, but likes the main character Sion Anika that have this good thing going on with each other.

527
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,628
Rym: They're kind of I don't know sighs one of those cute ditzy girls, but it's not.

528
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:08,036
Scott: Yeah, I mean there you can see sort of like some moe precursors present But they're so small and it's definitely not full-on moe.

529
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,040
Scott: So it's like hey, whatever.

530
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,100
Rym: Well while she has the moe precursors at the same time, she kicks some ass and takes some name.

531
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,006
Scott: Well clearly, you know, it's not it.

532
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,050
Scott: So I'm saying is there?

533
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,940
Scott: the precursors are pretty much just like she falls down a lot.

534
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,773
Rym: I love her as a character sighs.

535
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:21,518
Rym: You're so cute.

536
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:28,177
Rym: I enjoyed the way she interacted that one scene because she kept bumping into everyone and just being kind of klutzy.

537
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:36,212
Rym: and the one time Akane is walking up and she turns around and she's like And they don't collide and she's like I did it.

538
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:49,740
Scott: I Think the best character though is the is Oberetsubo, no, well, he's alright, but the Jeff the sidekick girl who Danica Yeah, the spunky girl who's like you should quit this fucking club.

539
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:54,080
Scott: Yeah, cuz she's like the most, you know level-headed not weird one, you know.

540
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,815
Rym: I would say that Akane the fashion girl is equally level-headed.

541
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:57,620
Rym: She just doesn't care.

542
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:01,640
Scott: Yeah, kinda but it's like she just has really strong magic for some reason.

543
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,909
Rym: Yeah, it just has kind of a spin to it.

544
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:06,077
Scott: And every time she gets mad you just spins.

545
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:09,400
Scott: I don't know why This happens now.

546
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,868
Rym: I don't it's hard to say if my perception was colored though because I actually Because we just did a show on dubs and sub.

547
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,460
Rym: I watched the center Niklaus dub.

548
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,178
Rym: You know what?

549
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,343
Scott: Most dubs are bad.

550
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:25,315
Rym: This dub is not great, but it is not terrible.

551
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,624
Rym: I actually do not Disrecommend the dub.

552
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:29,367
Scott: I watch this up.

553
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,680
Rym: Nanaka is of course Lisa Ortez, you know, it's all like good.

554
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:39,280
Rym: Well relatively good American voice actors and surprisingly the Japanese cast is pretty high-powered.

555
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,752
Rym: They got a while junco to do Akane.

556
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:50,064
Rym: Mm-hmm famous singer and Takehito Koyasu Shit plays Oberetsubo, of course Of course good.

557
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:56,357
Rym: I do like the one scene where you know, cuz part of the plot is that Oberetsubo is totally gay for the main character.

558
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,089
Scott: Yep Like I'm the one it's.

559
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,920
Scott: it's weird because it's all stereotypical tropes.

560
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:09,840
Scott: Well, no because he's sort of acting in such a strong Come on way that you almost think he's just sarcastically fooling around kind of a put-on.

561
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:14,460
Scott: Yeah, but he's not actually gay for the main character, but no he actually is gay for the main character.

562
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,882
Scott: I love

563
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:19,546
Rym: that scene where they're staying over in the beach house and he's just laying there obviously Dreaming about something cuz it's

564
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:28,940
Scott: like if I was like if I go to Rym and I'm like, hey, baby, you know People be like, okay, he's just joking around right, you know, they might you know say mad, but you know, it's joking around.

565
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,155
Scott: But the thing is he's like hey, baby, but he's not joking.

566
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:33,059
Scott: He really wants him.

567
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,887
Rym: There's that one scene where they're sleeping in the same room together He's just kind of freaking out weird and fantasizing and then and the main characters like I mustn't fall asleep I mustn't fall asleep.

568
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:45,844
Scott: I wasn't Classic sort of.

569
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:46,607
Rym: I guess it's the.

570
00:33:47,168 --> 00:34:00,600
Rym: this show if we have to review it has a lot of like if you watch it Stereotypical 90s anime like straight up all the tropes and yet it executes them Elegantly and humorously and it has really good animation.

571
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,312
Rym: Oh, the animation is nothing not.

572
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,718
Scott: and good, you know, except for the CGs.

573
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,160
Rym: Yeah, but the animation is great.

574
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:14,199
Rym: And I realized watching a lot of old anime recently not 70s anime which doesn't have this so much except for the mech stuff.

575
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:21,080
Rym: but 90s OAVs in particular tend to one be way better than their equivalent TV shows.

576
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,527
Rym: you know El Hazzard, Tenchi and two.

577
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:24,188
Scott: they have

578
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:37,928
Rym: that kind of old-world cell animation where there's tons of weird little comedic details all over the place like little facial expressions background characters make reacting to things and Everything's kind of moving and there's always stuff going on everywhere like

579
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:41,357
Scott: a new type magazine in the trash can in the apartment.

580
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:49,147
Rym: or you know Things on the posters are on the school like someone like in the foreground, you know, they're hitting on each other Whatever in the background.

581
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,395
Rym: the two girls are like sharing this look Mm-hmm and like kind of whispering to each other.

582
00:34:53,415 --> 00:35:00,160
Rym: all these little Tiny details little shivers that the main character does every time he's hit on that are all you wouldn't even notice them.

583
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:04,779
Rym: Yeah, and I don't know a lot of new crappy anime doesn't have anything like that.

584
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:05,461
Scott: No They don't.

585
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,919
Rym: they don't bother with like background details this weird specific kind of detail that you really see in these 90s OAVs.

586
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,020
Scott: That's the kind of stuff you also see like manga backgrounds to that, you know.

587
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,288
Scott: They just they don't.

588
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:18,160
Scott: you know, not so many people are doing that anymore.

589
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,993
Rym: Yeah, the show also kind of elegantly like, you know with the duck like.

590
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:24,340
Rym: they explained it like you said to a degree But they didn't really explain it explain it enough.

591
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:35,584
Rym: but there's tons of other things like that that are just the world is presented to you and Yet beyond like it's presented to you as though this is just the way it is and they don't bother with the fanboy level of Explanation.

592
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,839
Rym: they just give you enough to make the show work.

593
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:43,380
Rym: A lot of modern shows either have the fanboy explanation like gunslinger girl type shows.

594
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,404
Rym: You know where they go.

595
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:48,454
Rym: like this is the specific bullshit of this specific bullshit moe.

596
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:49,999
Scott: Well, they explain every single freaking.

597
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:55,080
Scott: Yeah Yeah, well, I think the one thing that the show really that makes the show really strong right is the alien part.

598
00:35:55,221 --> 00:36:02,780
Scott: Right is because if you look at all the old animes Especially the ones that we like or that were really really well liked it from the olden days, right?

599
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:09,760
Scott: the one thing a great majority have that have in common is the Central sort of sci-fi mystery, right?

600
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Scott: Even if it wasn't some shows were sci-fi shows right such as say vote Tom's or Ava.

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,246
Rym: Hey, let's go a step further.

602
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,095
Rym: even look at fantasy shows like slayers.

603
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,484
Rym: slayers is goofy comedy But it has the.

604
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:35,400
Scott: here is the serious backdrop plot that if you just wrote down what that plot was I'm saying is that you know Somebody's old shows if they were sci-fi shows had a mystery at their core some sort of thing That is like to be discovered at the ending.

605
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:51,239
Scott: It's like who what the hell is this mysterious thing that carries us through the show that's always in the background Right, even cowboy bebop has that right and pretty almost every you know, cool show You know macross everything has a sci-fi mystery even shows that are not sci-fi shows.

606
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:56,697
Scott: Fancy la la right or you know stuff like that has a sci-fi mystery.

607
00:36:56,738 --> 00:37:01,557
Scott: not always Sci-fi no, but a lot of the times it is a sci-fi mystery at the core.

608
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:02,380
Rym: I would pull back.

609
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,137
Rym: There's two things, you know, what got me into anime other than the fact that it was crazy Ultraviolet cartoons I'd never seen before.

610
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:13,925
Rym: cuz you know I was eight and I watched vampire hunter D but it was that there were.

611
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:23,900
Rym: it was different and a lot of the old 90s anime was just really sci-fi or really fantasy really kind Of out there and had these plots and some of that is lacking from a lot of new stuff.

612
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,871
Scott: Yeah, I think a lot of new shows right.

613
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:27,520
Scott: they made mahoutsukai tie today.

614
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:35,212
Scott: It would have been the magic club strike which is without the aliens Yeah, and then it's like well that totally ruins the whole thing.

615
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,660
Rym: or they would have done like darker than black.

616
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:38,279
Rym: We're all right.

617
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:39,645
Rym: Here's a plot but one.

618
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:43,539
Rym: the whole show focuses on this plot and to the plot is so.

619
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:48,820
Rym: Either they hide it all from you and it's not kind of elegantly done or you just don't give a shit about it.

620
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,845
Scott: Yeah, it's all about.

621
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,740
Scott: you have these characters so you can have this character drama.

622
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,400
Scott: But you also have a you know and a sort of epic plot somewhere that you know for them to go do something.

623
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,626
Scott: I think you get both at once.

624
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:03,061
Scott: if you do just one without the other it doesn't work So well.

625
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:12,785
Rym: in contrast things there's the scenes where like sighs being really cute practicing riding on a broom And then she makes a little butt saddle for it cuz her butt really hurt And that's hilarious.

626
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:19,920
Rym: and yet simultaneously you have like the scene where Akane is reading the bells mind That was some deep sci-fi awesome action right there.

627
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:28,020
Rym: Like if you took just that scene You could you would not be able to differentiate the show from a dead serious sci-fi drama masterpiece.

628
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,574
Rym: Yeah, just from that scene extrapolated out.

629
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:40,272
Rym: and if you did the comedy It's the exact same thing for comedy and the show elegantly blended the two together in a way that many Shows not just anime are not able to do well.

630
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:42,280
Scott: Well, he's not able to do well recently, right?

631
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,935
Rym: There's also a sort of idiosyncratic elegance like Jeffy or Jeff Coon.

632
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:47,100
Scott: Jeff is the best.

633
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:48,144
Rym: I love how.

634
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:53,265
Rym: you know, there's kind of a Gandalf the gray element going on there Yeah, and there's also just the.

635
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,911
Rym: that's just her cute little thing.

636
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,600
Rym: Like it's just hanging like a cell phone charm on her broom.

637
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:59,797
Scott: yeah, no, but there's the.

638
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,459
Scott: What's it called?

639
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:15,790
Scott: Right, if you look at more modern shows Right a lot of the shows today would are just the character parts and the only show, you know If I try to really think really hard about a recent show that actually has you know Character parts and the sci-fi mystery right?

640
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,039
Scott: Yeah, look at like something like Haruhi has a sci-fi mystery.

641
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,334
Rym: Hurry, actually, I think is the best example of a more recent show.

642
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:26,449
Rym: that gives me the same Feelings that a show like mahout sky tie does.

643
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,176
Scott: yeah, but you know other shows.

644
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:32,239
Scott: I'd even put them in You know, yeah, they were definitely in the same genre.

645
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,667
Scott: So, you know what is cool as a sci-fi mystery.

646
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,720
Rym: straight out if you liked Haruhi you will love mahout sky tie and vice versa.

647
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:39,548
Scott: Yeah straight

648
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:42,244
Rym: up without any Reservation I say that,

649
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:53,977
Scott: you know, but try to try to think like some other recent animes that have come out right and Some of them are just you know, I mean not too many of them at all really or sci-fi Or have any kind of

650
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,180
Rym: action

651
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,215
Scott: Right.

652
00:39:56,235 --> 00:40:03,655
Scott: Okay, so Right, so that doesn't really have you know, the the mystery of anything that's that's pretty much just.

653
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:07,159
Rym: the first season had the mystery Of you know, what's up with the head?

654
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,332
Scott: Yeah, but that was the what's up with the head was actually one of the characters dramas.

655
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:16,860
Scott: it wasn't really this sort of background You know thing that nobody knew what was up.

656
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,616
Rym: Well, I guess the way we can sum this all up is that mahout sky tie.

657
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:21,159
Rym: at least for me.

658
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:24,977
Rym: It reminded me of how much I fucking loved anime in the 90s.

659
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,157
Rym: But it's it didn't tell me that 90s anime was better.

660
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:35,457
Rym: specifically It just taught me that the anime I liked from the 90s still holds up today by and large.

661
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:46,695
Rym: Well this one Yeah, well I try gun was probably the least holding up relative to what I expected of anything I've watched in recent memory that I had seen back in the day.

662
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:47,839
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

663
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:49,445
Scott: Yeah, you had to go.

664
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,549
Scott: do a lot more re-watching.

665
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:50,931
Scott: bring me.

666
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:52,758
Rym: Let's remember a lot of shows that I have seen.

667
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,765
Rym: I Expected not to hold up.

668
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:55,046
Scott: Yeah.

669
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:58,580
Scott: Also, I don't you know, I don't remember if I watched or did not watch them.

670
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,565
Scott: Oh, it's a Kai Tai TV.

671
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:02,539
Rym: I've never seen the TV or have only seen the OAV?

672
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,585
Scott: Like I don't even remember.

673
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:08,722
Scott: so now I kind of want to go and check out the TV to see like did I see the TV?

674
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:09,867
Scott: did I not see the TV?

675
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,113
Scott: how much of the TV did I see?

676
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,680
Scott: if I saw any is it good?

677
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,262
Scott: Is it bad?

678
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:13,905
Scott: I don't know.

679
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,614
Scott: how similar is the OAV?

680
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:16,800
Scott: who knows mystery?

681
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,100
Rym: Well, I mean it picks up pretty much right where the OAV leaves off really so the aliens have been vanquished.

682
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,625
Rym: Ah, there's just the fucking tree.

683
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:27,540
Rym: Oh really and now they got to deal with the tree, but it's just a tree.

684
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:28,323
Scott: What's the problem?

685
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:30,071
Rym: It's blocking out the Sun and the road.

686
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:32,824
Rym: the pedals are busting everything up in Tokyo Really?

687
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:38,993
Scott: Yeah, they could be alright, baby but yeah That gets an interesting.

688
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:39,537
Scott: Okay.

689
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:42,069
Rym: Yeah But anyway, I mean I don't want to really like.

690
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,227
Rym: I could talk a lot about all my favorite scenes and why I think they're Great, like.

691
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,200
Scott: no, we don't need to do that.

692
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,300
Rym: It's like what he's like when he one more when he's doing the the magic show for the manga club on the beach.

693
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,944
Scott: That's a good one.

694
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:52,910
Rym: And it's the magic shows.

695
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,580
Rym: great and then he whips out the truth teller.

696
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,996
Rym: But then look at the the mark of an elegant show.

697
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:02,409
Rym: they do the wow Thing with the truth teller and of course they bring it back.

698
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:13,049
Rym: but they bring it back in such a subtle and Heartwarming and kind of sad way and it's that the show very bled blends Very well the drama and the comedy and the sci-fi all together.

699
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,212
Rym: and just a great show.

700
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,298
Rym: Yeah a solid B anime.

701
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:18,525
Scott: Yeah You should watch this show.

702
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:20,472
Rym: Yeah, pretty much any anime fan should watch this.

703
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:21,577
Scott: It's only six episodes.

704
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:22,440
Scott: You can watch this show.

Rym: It's not gonna kill you and if you enjoy it at all one You know.

Rym: if you liked Haruhi watch this.

708
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:35,740
Rym: also check out other similar OAVs, like I don't know El Hazzard the original Tenchi OAV.

709
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,084
Scott: Yeah, it was hard.

710
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,691
Scott: that had the you know, the sci-fi mystery at the core.

711
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,944
Scott: So did the original Tenchi OAV the original original Yeah, not any of the others.

712
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:48,320
Rym: No, no the Tenchi every Tenchi other than the original Ryo Oki OAV.
