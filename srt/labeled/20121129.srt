1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,133
Scott: Are we good?

2
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:10,236
Scott: Is it working?

3
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:10,858
Rym: That's working fine.

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:11,661
Rym: Is everyone working?

5
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:12,684
Rym: Yes, everyone's working fine.

6
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:13,266
Scott: Okay, you ready?

7
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:14,390
Guest: One time I saw a goose.

8
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,218
Rym: So we're here, we're here with Conrad Kraling.

9
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,562
Rym: Many of you may know him from the internet.

10
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,330
Scott: Yeah, our fans, it seems it's weird.

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:31,650
Scott: It's like people are, I guess they listen to our show and they say they're our fans, even though I tell them not to listen to our show, but all they want to hear on our show is people who aren't us.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,694
Rym: Huh?

13
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,710
Scott: People who are on the show only once, like, you know, a separate weird situation.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,752
Rym: If I had a listener not that long ago at an event, say, wait a minute, you know, Conrad, the guy from Johnny Wander?

15
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:45,213
Scott: Yeah.

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,604
Scott: People will be like, oh man, the best episodes of GeekNights.

17
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:55,240
Scott: How about, you know, fast karate for the GeekNights, the one they always say is the food episodes.

18
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,022
Rym: Okay.

19
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,024
Rym: We should do a show on food.

20
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,425
Rym: Sure.

21
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,376
Scott: But anyway, so by popular demand, we have brought back.

22
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,230
Rym: So Conrad, the corn bed, we've heard that you've seen a ghost.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,116
Guest: Well, one time I did in fact see a ghost.

24
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:08,858
Guest: What was it like?

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,781
Guest: Well, okay.

26
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:15,796
Guest: You see, I was, I was trapped in a dungeon after an entire year of imprisonment.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,900
Guest: I spent it with a dragon.

28
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:25,159
Guest: Finally, I escaped on a rowboat and after about a year of drifting on the sea, I finally regained feeling in my legs.

29
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:26,623
Scott: Okay.

30
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:36,827
Rym: So I think Emily didn't realize until recently that every time you said that you were referencing this, this thing that we're all, she knew the thing that you were referencing, but she didn't realize that the seeing a ghost was a reference to that thing.

31
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:37,871
Guest: Oh no, it's, it's perfect.

32
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:44,932
Rym: It is because when you reminded me of the dragon was when you put it in the bio, you gave me for our PAX dev panel.

33
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:45,354
Scott: It was dead.

34
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:46,036
Scott: That was on.

35
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,804
Rym: And you emailed me too.

36
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:49,887
Rym: You were like, is it okay?

37
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:50,950
Rym: And I was like, yeah, sure.

38
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,273
Rym: And I went for it.

39
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,737
Rym: I put it up and it's in the book.

40
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:58,673
Scott: You could, anyone can get the PAX dev 2012 program and see it says right there, Conrad.

41
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,819
Rym: It's like wearing an Ogloff shirt.

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,489
Rym: People who know, know, and nobody else is the wiser.

43
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,347
Guest: I should note that I also use that exact same bio for the mobile gaming summit bio I had to submit.

44
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,296
Guest: And that is an industry professional like situation.

45
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,542
Guest: I had never been happier because they printed it.

46
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:15,024
Guest: Oh yeah.

47
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,087
Guest: They printed it.

48
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,030
Guest: I tweeted it.

49
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,196
Guest: I was like, this is the happiest day of my entire life.

50
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:25,675
Scott: I'm so happy that I got a reference to, do we know who the guy is who actually made the song?

51
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:26,157
Guest: Yeah.

52
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:26,578
Guest: Yeah.

53
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,500
Guest: Yeah.

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,545
Scott: Can we like, uh, get him on the show?

55
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:30,428
Guest: Probably.

56
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,173
Guest: I would love to shake his hand with gloves on.

57
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:37,513
Rym: We should say something much more important that our friend Kate usually yells at us for stupid shit on the internet.

58
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,539
Rym: She is the one who showed us the dragon.

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,222
Scott: Exactly.

60
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,626
Rym: So it is her fault.

61
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,893
Scott: But yet she'd probably complain if you brought it up.

62
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:47,581
Rym: No, she would probably say probably.

63
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,664
Rym: Okay.

64
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:55,102
Rym: So you might remember years ago we were doing a profiles and geek and then we kind of forgot to keep doing those,

65
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,707
Scott: but now we're going to keep doing them

66
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,861
Rym: because Conrad's here and we didn't want to talk about cell phones again, even

67
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,793
Scott: though everyone wants to hear about cell phones, it's just the same shit over and over again.

68
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,315
Rym: It's easy.

69
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,419
Rym: Buy an iPhone.

70
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,148
Rym: If you don't want an iPhone, buy the old nexus S.

71
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,094
Guest: well, you can buy the nexus as the nexus.

72
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:09,736
Guest: This is a pilot.

73
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,542
Scott: You can get the next song nexus.

74
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,646
Guest: Yes, the Samsung nexus.

75
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:16,217
Scott: It's disgusting for, but it's gigantic in other ways.

76
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:17,842
Scott: It's good, but it's sold out.

77
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:24,362
Scott: But I point out that the majority, look, I'm limiting the cell phone discussion to three minutes.

78
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:25,345
Rym: Look at my monitor here.

79
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,572
Rym: This is Dell ultra sharp with a proper color gamut.

80
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:34,973
Rym: The majority of people in the world don't know or care and they'll buy a monitor that costs a quarter as much and say it looks better.

81
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:40,469
Rym: Do you think any of those people need a better screen than this screen on my nexus?

82
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,961
Guest: I refuse to give money to any company that ships pentile matrix.

83
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:49,642
Scott: It's a question of whether it's, you know, but you know, if it's better for you, but do you know it's better for you?

84
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,830
Rym: So when I tweeted about that, I tweeted something.

85
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,644
Rym: I was like, nobody really understands color gamut and they showed blah, blah, blah.

86
00:03:56,005 --> 00:04:08,260
Rym: And there's a Twitter account dedicated to color gamuts and they retweeted me and they emailed me and they were like, you are one of the few people in the world who understands what we care about.

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:17,548
Guest: I will, I will go on record as saying that a non tech just did the write up of the nexus for, and the nexus for is this beautiful panel that has not been calibrated at all.

88
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,603
Guest: They did not calibrate it in the factory and they sold out like crazy though.

89
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:27,281
Guest: And a non tech was like, they didn't even, it's not even touched like the nexus for is just, it's gigantic.

90
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:27,602
Guest: Huge.

91
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,083
Guest: Yeah.

92
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:32,977
Rym: If it was this size or a smaller, I'd probably consider it my Palm pre a little while ago.

93
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:36,066
Scott: Cause I have a small, it's the best size.

94
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:36,889
Rym: It's thick though.

95
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,190
Rym: Yeah.

96
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,193
Scott: It doesn't matter.

97
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:43,531
Rym: It has a physical keyboard, which while I still kind of miss physical keyboards, I'm done with physical keyboards.

98
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:44,134
Scott: Yeah, probably.

99
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:44,976
Scott: It's nobody.

100
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:48,268
Rym: There's very few people still type faster on my pre than I can.

101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,733
Scott: You guys have one minute left on this.

102
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:50,576
Guest: I'm done.

103
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,359
Rym: Okay.

104
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,001
Rym: All right.

105
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:52,984
Rym: So what about Google glasses?

106
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,349
Scott: They're not coming out yet.

107
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:54,891
Rym: They will someday.

108
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,596
Rym: Did you see that new game ingress?

109
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:57,498
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,203
Scott: If you have an Android phone, get it.

111
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,790
Rym: But no, it's a closed beta.

112
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:02,271
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,577
Scott: Well, if you'd got to get in the beta.

114
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,340
Rym: Yeah, I tried.

115
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,470
Rym: I even tried to pull rank and be like, do you know who I am?

116
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,752
Rym: Google doesn't.

117
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:08,515
Scott: Yeah.

118
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:08,856
Scott: Google.

119
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,559
Scott: Do you know who I am?

120
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,212
Scott: Some guy who uses our fucking thing and doesn't even give a bunch of people at Google.

121
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:17,604
Rym: And that has worked before it's got, I got us into some, some of our early con.

122
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:22,157
Scott: I got the fucking CR 38 Chromebook thing and I don't even use it.

123
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,587
Rym: I got some of our earliest con gigs by pulling the, do you know who I am?

124
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,410
Scott: Sure.

125
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,216
Scott: Anyway, let us move on.

126
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,540
Rym: That was when I wasn't even anyone.

127
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,531
Scott: Are we going to do news and things a day or are we going to do those later?

128
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:32,892
Scott: That.

129
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:33,413
Scott: Okay.

130
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:34,556
Rym: So let us.

131
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:34,957
Rym: Thursday.

132
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:35,779
Rym: It's the lounge.

133
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,245
Scott: So let us profile the Conrad.

134
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,751
Scott: So the Conrad, we met you in the college.

135
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:41,974
Guest: Yeah, that's right.

136
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,902
Scott: We know very vague details of your pre-college.

137
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,566
Guest: Oh wow.

138
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:47,927
Guest: Okay.

139
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:52,357
Rym: Um, our listeners don't even know about our pre-college.

140
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:53,300
Guest: It's weird.

141
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,245
Guest: My family moved all around New York state.

142
00:05:55,325 --> 00:06:02,787
Guest: So I used to, I was born in Buffalo, but my family immediately moved as far North and as far East in New York state as you can go to base in Canada.

143
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:03,429
Guest: Yeah.

144
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,037
Guest: On the Canada, Vermont, New York border on the New York side.

145
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:06,418
Guest: Okay.

146
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,465
Guest: It was in this tiny town called Rouse's point.

147
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:21,197
Guest: And, um, some of my fondest memories, uh, as a child, we're going into with my father into Canada for beer, Vermont for gas, and then back home where he would make me pancakes every Saturday.

148
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,927
Guest: And this was like a really like formative memory I had.

149
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,930
Guest: It was, it was awesome.

150
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,735
Scott: And I could definitely identify with that.

151
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,116
Scott: That's good.

152
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:28,417
Guest: And so.

153
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:32,951
Guest: when I was nine though, we moved to Lancaster, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.

154
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:42,195
Guest: Um, which is, I think now why I could never imagine living in the suburbs ever again, like suburban wasteland sort of doesn't even begin to describe it.

155
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:47,113
Guest: Like we had to take the bus 45 minutes to get to the mall, which was the most exciting thing available to us.

156
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:54,698
Rym: You know, it's interesting because suburbs in the Midwest, especially like Southeast Michigan, North, like Northern Ohio are not like that.

157
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:55,320
Rym: There's sub.

158
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,263
Rym: they're suburbs, right?

159
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,671
Rym: The same kind of thing you were living in, but they're so dense.

160
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,496
Rym: There's a grocery store, like every mile.

161
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,703
Rym: I live near the grocery store.

162
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:06,174
Rym: It's like five minutes in any direction from my house, my house.

163
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,619
Scott: I grew up in which my parents still live in.

164
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:14,882
Scott: You could walk to the mall or the grocery store, but you know, now having lived in the city, I cannot tolerate being not in a city.

165
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:16,246
Rym: I can't tolerate very long.

166
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,816
Rym: I was talking to some of your friends, Conrad, at the party last night.

167
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:24,069
Rym: And we were talking about like, imagine going to a restaurant in a car.

168
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,878
Guest: Imagine if you needed milk, you have to get into the car.

169
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,580
Guest: Yeah.

170
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,225
Rym: What now to me, a car?

171
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,859
Rym: actually, now that I don't need a car anymore, getting into a car is like this mystery time.

172
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,464
Rym: Like, Oh my God, we're going somewhere.

173
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:37,745
Rym: Yeah.

174
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,130
Guest: I feel like a dog, right?

175
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,511
Guest: I'm sure.

176
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:41,413
Guest: I'm so excited.

177
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:44,378
Guest: It's embarrassing.

178
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:50,229
Scott: So being someone who lived in the stakes, how did you become all nerdy and technology?

179
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,131
Rym: How'd you get your nerd on?

180
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:51,653
Guest: Okay.

181
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:55,144
Guest: So I mentioned that I lived up in this very small town called Rouse's Point.

182
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,278
Guest: Despite it being a very small town, my father was very in line with the tech community there.

183
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,432
Guest: So one of his best friends, John Rigby, actually ran a bulletin board system.

184
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:04,414
Guest: Whoa.

185
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:08,527
Guest: I was on, I was on BBSs when I was like four and five and it was a big, I didn't realize.

186
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,470
Scott: What kind of computer did you have then?

187
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,295
Guest: I believe it was a 386 at that time.

188
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:12,716
Guest: All right.

189
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:13,117
Guest: Wow.

190
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,342
Rym: My first computer was a 486 SX.

191
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:15,824
Guest: Yeah.

192
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,209
Guest: Well, we, I missed the 486 line.

193
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:18,590
Guest: We had that 386.

194
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,183
Scott: The first computer that was in my house that wasn't a video game console was a 486, a hundred megahertz.

195
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:30,278
Guest: So yeah, it was a, and you know, I used to like dial in with all those mysterious pro modem protocols.

196
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:31,180
Guest: It had those funny names.

197
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,428
Guest: We only had the one phone line.

198
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:41,304
Guest: So despite the fact that I had, cause back in the day, BBSs, you would have metered a lot of time that you could be on to dial in.

199
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:46,073
Rym: I went to, I used to go to this pirate BBS where you could download, download basically pirated versions of games.

200
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,636
Guest: Oh, every BBS.

201
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:52,404
Rym: But I had to, you had to donate money to them, like by mailing them a check.

202
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:52,885
Rym: Oh yeah.

203
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,287
Rym: And then you would get oxygen.

204
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,651
Rym: And it was, it was, it was at this underwater.

205
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,535
Rym: Were they running space trade around there?

206
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,497
Rym: It was the underwater theme.

207
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,925
Rym: And if you ran out of oxygen, you couldn't download any more stuff.

208
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,829
Rym: And the analogy really didn't work.

209
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:05,170
Rym: that well.

210
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:05,530
Scott: No.

211
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,013
Guest: Yeah.

212
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:11,802
Guest: So I had unlimited time on it and it had red dragon, of course, like every BBS.

213
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:13,224
Guest: And I spent a lot of time on that.

214
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:14,747
Scott: So that's the year you spent with the dragon.

215
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,149
Guest: That was my year with the dragon.

216
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,390
Guest: Yeah.

217
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,352
Rym: Bringing it back around.

218
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,396
Guest: So, so that was, uh, those, uh, that was sort of my nerdy history.

219
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,659
Guest: Otherwise my father always had computers around the house.

220
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,466
Guest: I was doing basic when I was, you know, in kindergarten and, uh, I sort of just stuck with it.

221
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,850
Guest: because I mean, why not looking back on it?

222
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,142
Guest: Like it's really easy to look at that period of time and be, you know, like, wow, how did I, I was just using windows 95 all those years.

223
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,486
Guest: Like it's sort of a miracle thinking back on it.

224
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,330
Guest: Hey, that we moved forward as a race.

225
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,570
Guest: Yeah.

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,324
Scott: It's like, I use like windows seven today and it doesn't, you know, and it's like one part of my brain is like, this isn't any different than windows 95.

227
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,546
Scott: But then I look at windows 95 and I'm like, what?

228
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,510
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,610
Rym: Remember when plug and play, what didn't even always work?

230
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:09,170
Guest: Well, we, we referred to it as plug and pray at the time, sort of jokingly, but you know, yeah, like it's really easy to look back on those times in my opinion and, and sort of marvel at how anti-competitive everything was and how very, it was like, well, if you need a computer, you have one choice, you go to the store and you buy a compact.

231
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,150
Rym: I remember I tried to go to gateway and I really wanted windows NT and they wouldn't sell it to me.

232
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,470
Guest: Yeah.

233
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,503
Guest: And there was like that, that Ray of sunlight that windows 2000 was, it was like, Oh, this is what a real multi-user operating system is like.

234
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,810
Scott: But like, you know, obviously I didn't get that until I got to fucking RIT.

235
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:25,997
Rym: Yeah.

236
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,850
Rym: I had windows 2000 before I went to RIT.

237
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,850
Scott: I used 98 SE for a long time.

238
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,276
Rym: Because I cashed in all the bonds my grandparents gave me.

239
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:37,630
Rym: And I bought that AMD K7 800 with windows 2000.

240
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,649
Guest: I bought a via chip.

241
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,670
Scott: Oh, you and, you and Greg Hartman.

242
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,414
Guest: I bought, I bought it with money that I made from my paper route.

243
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,760
Guest: And, uh, I saved up for months to get this, this via chip.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,389
Guest: And I was so excited about having enough money to buy the via chip that I actually didn't have enough money to buy a motherboard, but it didn't matter.

245
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,090
Guest: I was just excited.

246
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:01,546
Scott: I saved up a thousand dollars working at the dry cleaners in high school and I bought a Pentium three 450 with a TNT two.

247
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,330
Scott: I bought the TNT two the day it came out.

248
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,229
Guest: Did you remember when a CPU slotted in?

249
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,289
Scott: Yeah, it was a slot.

250
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,395
Rym: Well, they were sockets.

251
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,649
Rym: Then they went to slots and then back to sockets.

252
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:11,393
Guest: Yeah.

253
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,390
Scott: I never understood what the point of the slot was.

254
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,230
Rym: The point of the slot was that because you had more space on that board, you could put a shit ton of like L3 cash on there.

255
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:21,850
Guest: And it was actually thinking about the layout of a board.

256
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,364
Scott: You could probably, and it would still be, it would still be standard, I guess.

257
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:25,670
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,352
Rym: Basically.

259
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:26,512
Rym: Yeah.

260
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,375
Rym: You'd have more space on the, on the board.

261
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:29,999
Rym: You'd have more space.

262
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:36,010
Rym: You could put a bunch of memory in there, like caches and stuff, more L2 L3, which before then only existed on motherboards.

263
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,783
Scott: I think it was a lot easier to put a computer together because you didn't have to deal with the fricking janky ass.

264
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,789
Scott: lock it where you're going to destroy everything.

265
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,210
Rym: I read.

266
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:54,250
Rym: The only reason that we went back to sockets was that the chip, by only having this edge connection, it just, there was a limited number of pins and a limited amount of bandwidth and the physical distance started to matter.

267
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:54,550
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,321
Scott: Well now the new thing they come up with is the pins are on the motherboard and the contacts on the chip.

269
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:03,090
Scott: And apparently that like reduces some heat or so it's like apparently way better.

270
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,440
Guest: I mean, if you think about it, it makes the chips like more physically reliable if nothing else.

271
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,641
Guest: Right.

272
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,965
Guest: We've all, we've all been to pin on a, an Athlon.

273
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,229
Guest: Let's be fair to anybody who has done that.

274
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,993
Guest: So, so I think the move back makes a lot of sense.

275
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:18,574
Guest: I think it's smart.

276
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:18,914
Guest: Of course.

277
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,038
Guest: Um, I'm very excited about building my, my next computer.

278
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:31,770
Guest: Um, I have it all specked out, but I, I'm like really sort of nervous because Ivy bridge is very good, but everything I read about has, well, it's like land of milk and honey.

279
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:33,978
Scott: Because it's tick tock, right?

280
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:37,130
Scott: So Ivy bridge was tick and the next one's going to be boom, big move.

281
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,225
Rym: Every time I've ever researched a computer, I'll immediately see like, Oh, or there's a, you know, X millimeter process coming next.

282
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,570
Rym: Oh, well, you know, there's always something next.

283
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,638
Guest: Well, like let's take Nvidia cards, for example, Nvidia cards right now.

284
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:55,566
Guest: The six 60 TI is this phenomenal piece of technology that I would have.

285
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:56,729
Guest: no, I would throw it down for that today.

286
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:57,370
Guest: I'll do it right now.

287
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,172
Scott: I got a six 80.

288
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:06,090
Guest: it's crazy high roller, but I mean price performance, like that's, it's such a compelling value and it's so, you know, that's what Emily got.

289
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,333
Rym: She's actually these computers.

290
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:13,146
Rym: Emily's computer, my computer are identical, except she has a new video card and I still have my GTX two 60, two six.

291
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,131
Rym: You know what?

292
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,335
Rym: Does it fucking matter?

293
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,201
Rym: Cause my computer is a fucking supercomputer.

294
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:21,070
Rym: I can play counter-strike full FPS, NS two full FPS.

295
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:27,643
Scott: Yeah, but I can play NS two full FPS, vertical sync at full resolution with fraps running.

296
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:28,986
Rym: Yeah, I got vertical sync off.

297
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,770
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to upgrade.

298
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,654
Rym: The reason I haven't upgraded is that settings.

299
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,741
Rym: I want the mercury playback engine to work in.

300
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:40,290
Rym: premiere premiere supports a list like 12.

301
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,202
Scott: I enabled, even though I'm not on the list and it works, uh, it's probably not actually working.

302
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,167
Rym: How did you enable it with the checkbox?

303
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,430
Rym: That's not doing anything.

304
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:55,382
Rym: If you're basically the premiere looks at a string to see if the string for your video card is in a list.

305
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:59,650
Rym: Otherwise it does not enable GPU offloading of a automatic, like live rendering.

306
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,692
Rym: All right.

307
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:01,434
Rym: I'll send you a link.

308
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:07,848
Rym: Basically you can add the string of your video card to the list and pretty much any video card after like a 300 series.

309
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,833
Scott: I'm pretty sure mine will do it.

310
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:15,610
Rym: Yeah, yeah, well, but they, for some reason they won't certify it or whatever, but that is why it's supposed to be a Conrad.

311
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,418
Guest: Well, I, Hey, I'm more than happy to talk about.

312
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,490
Guest: I love this shit out of video cards because I do 3d graphics programming.

313
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,676
Guest: Now I spend a lot of time limiting the video card conversation.

314
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,803
Guest: I will say that Nvidia and AMD need to get their shit together.

315
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:30,950
Guest: Whoever's writing their drivers needs to fucking step into high gear.

316
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,556
Rym: All of our video drivers for a long time.

317
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,460
Rym: They were awesome compared to any other.

318
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:41,790
Scott: lately they're getting flaky because the competition has also always been flaky.

319
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:50,120
Guest: An unnamed source of mine that used to work at Microsoft reported at one point that 50% of windows, blue screen, automatic file bug reports are caused by Nvidia drive.

320
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,770
Guest: that I've been getting blue screens lately, you know, some of our user, our user, we get so many support emails that are like your game, blue screen, my computer, and it's too blue screen.

321
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,411
Scott: And you know what?

322
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:06,141
Scott: It happened when an onus was stomping, but it was, it was clearly because the video guy.

323
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:11,670
Guest: Yeah, yeah, but I mean, to a degree, like it's, it's kind of, um, for us, it's really frustrating because we're a small company.

324
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,172
Guest: We want to treat our customers really well.

325
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,155
Guest: And we're just constantly getting reports.

326
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,957
Guest: It's like, well, I play every other game just fine.

327
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:17,538
Guest: What is your game?

328
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:18,179
Guest: Blue screen.

329
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,300
Scott: That is a good question.

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,641
Rym: You know what?

331
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:23,045
Rym: The answer is, well, you probably don't actually play every other game just fine.

332
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:26,610
Scott: You're probably made that one open GL call that no one else is making.

333
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,631
Guest: Well, and it's unity too.

334
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:33,880
Guest: The problem is since we do everything in unity, three D we're so limited in how much access we have to a lot of this stuff.

335
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,442
Guest: And so we're sort of at their mercy.

336
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,685
Guest: I think it's the way I want to have.

337
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:40,910
Scott: other unity games would crash as much, you know, well, then there would have to be one.

338
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,497
Rym: Yeah, but hey, the new Nintendo Wii U, you can ride unity games for it.

339
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,139
Guest: Oh, great.

340
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Guest: Sure.

341
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,643
Scott: Nintendo will let you sell those on the store.

342
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:56,090
Rym: The Wii U came out this weekend and I did not know that someone posted on the forum tomorrow.

343
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,993
Rym: Yeah, someone on the forum is recording.

344
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,555
Scott: So you've already got it out.

345
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:01,658
Rym: I won't have it.

346
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,041
Scott: I mean, anyone listening, it's already out.

347
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:04,942
Rym: It's like Nintendo.

348
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:10,670
Rym: Way to, way to be the one thing in my entire life that was constant and trusted without reservation.

349
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,212
Rym: And to blow that.

350
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:20,465
Rym: Yeah, they blew it hard to like generations of bad decisions for me to actually move from sight unseen to going to wait and see.

351
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,470
Guest: Yeah, this one, this one was particularly bad.

352
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:38,650
Guest: I mean, when you're, when you're up at E3 showing footage of call of duty that you recorded on a PC talking about your next generation graphics, man, you really kind of have to consider where you are at and then ship what is basically an Xbox three 60 repackaged into Nintendo hardware.

353
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,035
Guest: Man, they've got to be, they've got to be desperate is the only thing I could think.

354
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,517
Rym: And yet they've got the controller.

355
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,322
Rym: So they're doing what they, they're doing what they should have done seven years ago.

356
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:49,303
Guest: Now.

357
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:51,526
Scott: Oh, well.

358
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,290
Rym: So do you play any video games?

359
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,291
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,093
Scott: Well, what games are you playing right now?

361
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:57,794
Guest: Well, okay.

362
00:16:57,874 --> 00:17:01,179
Guest: So I'm playing Mass Effect three multiplayer with everybody.

363
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,100
Scott: How does that work?

364
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,023
Guest: It is board mode in call of duty.

365
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,846
Guest: So you survive waves of enemies.

366
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,490
Guest: You complete mission objectives on every third wave.

367
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:15,257
Guest: And I play it with, uh, Ananth and my, uh, my girlfriend, Rochelle, and we have a good time.

368
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:22,848
Guest: Um, and I also was playing fallout, new Vegas for quite some time, which it was the best of times.

369
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,050
Guest: And it was the worst of times.

370
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,032
Scott: I played it a little bit and then I stopped.

371
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,233
Guest: Yeah.

372
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:38,050
Guest: I was impressed obviously with the world as ever, but towards the end of it, I felt like I was tiptoeing around the crash bugs or tiptoeing around the bugs that would delete my inventory.

373
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,413
Scott: I am glad I didn't get that far.

374
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,635
Scott: I had problems early on.

375
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:45,802
Scott: where it's like, I think in the first town, there's like a robot, but I never talked to the robot.

376
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:50,370
Scott: And then when I went to the second town, the robot was there and he acted like he knew me already.

377
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,277
Scott: And I was like, I was like, I know you were in the first town because people talked about you, but I never found you.

378
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:59,724
Scott: And why are you here now acting like, you know, me, shouldn't we introduce first?

379
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,166
Scott: And it is stuff like that.

380
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,810
Scott: Whereas in the original fallout three didn't have issues like that.

381
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:11,110
Scott: You know, everything sort of more was, I think they spent more time on making sure each person and character behaved appropriately and was in the right place.

382
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,410
Rym: Yeah.

383
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,114
Rym: Well, like when I remember the guy who wants to blow up Megaton.

384
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,935
Rym: Oh yeah.

385
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,719
Rym: When I met him the first time I was like, you fucker.

386
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:19,502
Rym: And I just punched him to death right there.

387
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,865
Rym: And that plot just disappeared.

388
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:22,506
Rym: Never came up again.

389
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,009
Rym: And I took his clothes and the whole rest of the game.

390
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:26,311
Guest: Yeah.

391
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:32,796
Guest: I also, I feel like all out three proper spoken, a more coherent voice throughout the game.

392
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:37,339
Guest: I really do feel like new Vegas, although at times it was significantly stronger overall.

393
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,360
Guest: I don't think it was as cohesive.

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,201
Guest: It was still really good.

395
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,041
Guest: Like, don't even get me wrong.

396
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,182
Guest: I, I want that setting.

397
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:51,010
Rym: I love those games, but it was because the primary joy I got from it was exploring the world and kind of seeing cool things like the ruin houses and everything.

398
00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,396
Rym: But the fact that it was actually so sparse and so generic other than very tiny areas of content that I kind of lost interest almost immediately.

399
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:00,496
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,117
Scott: That's another thing.

401
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,799
Scott: Cause fallout three is like you come out of the vault and then what?

402
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,161
Rym: And I'm like, Oh my God, look at that freeway.

403
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:11,504
Scott: Not only is it technologically open world, it's the plot is open.

404
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:16,387
Scott: It's like Megaton is right there obviously, but it's like, you don't have to fucking go there first.

405
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:18,708
Scott: It's like, you don't, you know, just, you can see it there.

406
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,050
Scott: So it's sort of a design choice, but you can just go out there and you can see it there.

407
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,213
Scott: Whereas in fallout new Vegas, it's definitely more of a linear, like, go here next, dude.

408
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,354
Scott: They're telling you where to go.

409
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,176
Scott: You know, like, Hey, you should really go that way.

410
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:30,416
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,258
Rym: More sort of a deus exe of, yeah, the plot's over there whenever you're ready, dude.

412
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:34,819
Guest: Yeah.

413
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:39,262
Guest: I really do feel like that was a very intentional choice made on feedback from the first game.

414
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:44,305
Guest: Like in fallout three, I'd be willing to bet that they got a lot of feedback that was like, well, I just didn't know where to go.

415
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:51,050
Guest: And so they probably, they probably doubled down on being easy and in doing so probably punch that particular aspect of it.

416
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,931
Guest: To the game in the face.

417
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,192
Rym: Did you play the new deus exe human revolution?

418
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:55,253
Rym: I guess it's not new anymore.

419
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:55,533
Guest: I did.

420
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:56,734
Guest: I played human revolution.

421
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,274
Guest: Did you like it?

422
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:57,955
Guest: I did.

423
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,976
Guest: Uh, I thought it was, I thought it was very good.

424
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:06,120
Guest: Um, of course there, this is, this is another one of those cases where you're talking about design concessions from the first one.

425
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:12,644
Guest: Uh, I think that the first one was more interesting in some ways.

426
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:17,748
Guest: Uh, and also the newest deus exe brought to light for me exactly how bad every modern stealth game is.

427
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:19,709
Guest: I think every stealth game is bad.

428
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,330
Guest: Yeah.

429
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,495
Guest: Uh, cause I like, I tried playing it except for thief.

430
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:26,997
Scott: thief and nothing else.

431
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,879
Rym: Mark of the ninjas 2d thief gold.

432
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:29,600
Rym: That was a good job.

433
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,781
Scott: He've gold is also gay.

434
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:31,882
Guest: Yeah.

435
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:38,770
Rym: Three came for free with my creative graphics blaster extreme, I think, or some other video card I bought and using the old school glide drivers.

436
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,354
Guest: Yeah, dude.

437
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:43,944
Rym: I remember when my friend Ken came over when he's like, I have open GL.

438
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,150
Rym: We're going to play GL quake.

439
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,211
Guest: Do love glide.

440
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,894
Guest: That's like, it's like technological API or sex tool.

441
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,097
Guest: We can make a fun game out of this.

442
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:55,518
Guest: Actually.

443
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,080
Scott: We should make a new, a new standard to compete with them.

444
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,868
Scott: K y you feel like everyone does your video cards for k y it better.

445
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,629
Scott: It's really hard to install it in the case.

446
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:08,430
Scott: It just keeps slipping.

447
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,952
Guest: It was supposed to make inserting these cards easier.

448
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:22,739
Guest: No, just inserting the cables is easier, but uh, but yeah, so day deus X, but I really liked, again, I really liked the environment.

449
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:23,559
Guest: I liked the world.

450
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,720
Guest: I thought that they did a lot of things.

451
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:38,650
Rym: worried about it in deus X was much deeper feeling and more fleshed out and all the interesting side bits were interesting as opposed to follow three, which actually, well, I know it's a barren post-apocalyptic wasteland, but I was kind of taken aback.

452
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:47,976
Guest: At how barren it was, even like inside of town, new Vegas in particular, it's supposed to feel very sparse, obviously, I think due to its, uh, desert location.

453
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:48,597
Guest: Yeah, exactly.

454
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:49,457
Guest: It's, it's in a desert.

455
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:53,340
Guest: And so you're supposed to feel this, this, the gravity of this massive world.

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,222
Scott: And if there wasn't apocalypse pretty much anywhere is going to be sparse.

457
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:56,622
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:56,862
Guest: Yeah.

459
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:02,966
Guest: But, and, and even in DC and in fallout three, there were buildings and there were things, but it was extremely empty.

460
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,047
Guest: And of course that was part of the feel.

461
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:08,830
Guest: And so you remove the buildings from the emptiness and it's literal, just like sort of how, you know, a universe and gravity.

462
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,334
Scott: It takes over after all the other forces of neutral that entropy always wins.

463
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:21,619
Guest: But, but yeah, so, uh, otherwise I can't think of what I've really been.

464
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,200
Guest: Well, I've been playing a lot of my own game.

465
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,821
Guest: guns of Icarus as you can probably

466
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,462
Scott: talk about that for a

467
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:29,664
Rym: bit is to give you the most honest feedback.

468
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,325
Rym: I can give actually fun.

469
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:38,210
Rym: The fact that I play it at all in my, in my rotation, my 10 year rotation of counter-strike sleep and natural selection.

470
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,393
Rym: The fact that I'm playing guns of Icarus as a lot.

471
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:40,834
Guest: Yeah.

472
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,339
Guest: And, and I am a very harsh self critic.

473
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:50,107
Guest: I will, I will critique, critique myself very strongly, but I'm actually willing to say that I'm very proud of the work that we've done on guns of Icarus.

474
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,210
Guest: And I think it's fun and I like playing it.

475
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:05,730
Guest: So it's a, just for, for those of you who might be listening and somehow, uh, haven't heard me talk about this on another channel, it is a steampunk airship combat game, and it's all small team-based.

476
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,515
Guest: So you and three other dudes get onto this airship and shoot down other dudes full of four people.

477
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:24,150
Guest: And, uh, you obviously you're all on teams and, uh, you have to work together on the ship to perform various tasks like manning the guns, which are affixed to hard points or repairing, uh, the hard points and the weapons and your engines and hull.

478
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:35,310
Guest: And then there's of course the captain who is ostensibly in charge and hollering at you to do things that if my play experience is any indicator, you will ignore and just camp, camp the balloon while our hull gets blown up.

479
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,533
Guest: Uh, yeah, it's, it's actually fun.

480
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:39,254
Guest: I do.

481
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:43,260
Guest: I can recommend it in good conscience and say, this is a fun game that I worked on the most fun.

482
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,789
Rym: Like once I was playing during the beta with Adam and he's like in storm going to do and he's, he's Clanny and old school.

483
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,490
Rym: Like I kind of am.

484
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,136
Rym: So once the two of us were on a ship together, that shit was motherfucking invincible.

485
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:54,838
Guest: Oh yeah.

486
00:23:54,858 --> 00:24:02,510
Scott: You guys probably, cause he'd just be like rubber guns, broadside coming three, two, cause every other, cause everyone and every other ship was camping the balloon or whatever.

487
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,070
Guest: Yeah.

488
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,472
Guest: Then we're all just hammering away.

489
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:07,917
Scott: If you have two people working together, well forget it.

490
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,178
Guest: Yeah.

491
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:16,568
Guest: We see, we see ships now in game with, with like really experienced players and they, they are really into it.

492
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,890
Guest: They're talking about meta strategy.

493
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,573
Guest: They, we, we added this item.

494
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:26,143
Guest: It was like a harpoon gun and you can harpoon ships and like drag them into you and like nobody used it.

495
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,785
Guest: Everybody was like, what is this even for?

496
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:28,226
Guest: Well, okay.

497
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,196
Scott: What I will harpoon and then they can't get, you can see really easy to shoot them now.

498
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:36,478
Guest: This was, this was our thought.

499
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,343
Guest: Initially we were like, well you just harpoon them and you drag them in for the flame thrower.

500
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:44,210
Guest: We almost like you, you could very easily see how you would use it on the ships with two guns on the same side.

501
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,351
Guest: We're like, this will be great.

502
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:58,450
Guest: What we didn't expect was there's a ship with two guns on the very front and the new strategy is to put two harpoons up there and harpoon somebody at you and drag them into you at such speed that you careen right through them and destroy them with your ship.

503
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,035
Rym: That is really, you like, it's amazing.

504
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:06,322
Scott: So you had, you, you put in ramming damage, which is a factor of speed and the size of your ship.

505
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:11,970
Scott: And it just so happened that the speed of the harpoon pole added with the, it just, it just worked out that way.

506
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,412
Scott: You didn't put it in there on purpose.

507
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,299
Guest: The ship is the pyramidion, which is a very fast ship to begin with.

508
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:20,790
Guest: And so you, you increase the speed at which you're traveling by like pulling the other ship into you.

509
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:25,359
Guest: You effectively double your collision damage and in doing so you just barrel right through them.

510
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,750
Guest: So you start on broadsides to weaken like their components and then you just careen into them with these harpoons.

511
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,390
Scott: I mean, you don't, I don't think even want to check to make sure whether those physics are accurate, right?

512
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,584
Guest: I will say actually our, our guy, Jezary Bankston, who did all of the flight and collision models, they're incredibly well modeled.

513
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:46,410
Guest: The, the flight model is, is extremely physics based.

514
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,322
Guest: So the distance that your engines are away from the center of the ship, for example, determines your rotation speed.

515
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:55,488
Guest: It determines how fast you can turn because he's applying torque in that way.

516
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:56,290
Guest: It's, it's really cool.

517
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,002
Guest: He actually wrote a biplane flight model too.

518
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,310
Scott: That's super accurate.

519
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,347
Rym: So who's writing the boarding engine?

520
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:06,509
Guest: Oh, I'm glad you should ask about that because it's time for me to kill you.

521
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,729
Scott: We've made this joke before.

522
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:20,210
Rym: I think it's, it's that you, I think part of your success in my opinion is that you guys, because I seem to know a lot of people at this company somehow are doing the opposite of what the tribes two team did.

523
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:29,050
Rym: You have a forum, you look at what your people, like the people playing your game say, but then you make your own decisions based on that feedback instead of doing what they ask.

524
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,914
Guest: This is, this is the only way to make a game.

525
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:39,530
Guest: And, and I said this in another place and I was actually pretty happy with this analogy is that if you have a room full of smoke, your players will ask you to put in a fan to blow away the smoke.

526
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,552
Guest: What you actually want to do is put out the fire.

527
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:54,170
Guest: And so when, when people ask us for things, we like to put them through a filter of like, well, what problem are they attempting to solve with this and how can we affect that more positively or at a more fundamental level?

528
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,595
Guest: And I'm, I'm really happy with the work that we've done in that regard.

529
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:00,200
Guest: We, a lot of people are very right about a lot of things.

530
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,230
Guest: So for example, the ability to form a crew before you enter into matchmaking or before you enter into a match, that is important.

531
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,750
Scott: You can't, you can't, you get in the game, it starts, no one's joined the server yet because they're still loading the map and the game starts and no one wants to get in the comm chair.

532
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,769
Rym: Counter-Strike even has that problem in puppy games.

533
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,491
Rym: Yeah.

534
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,293
Guest: So we're, we're actively looking at that.

535
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:22,677
Guest: We, we just implemented and by the time this airs, it will be out.

536
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:28,585
Guest: But, um, Monday coming up, we have a big patch that will do automatic rematch.

537
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:32,790
Guest: So when you're done with a game, it'll put you into a new game on a new map with the same people.

538
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,992
Guest: And that's not done yet.

539
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:36,396
Guest: Uh, and so, you know, it'll be in on Monday.

540
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,317
Guest: I'm really excited about it.

541
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:45,470
Guest: And, uh, of course we're going to be making fixes to spectator mode and the like to better support, uh, tournament casting and we're going to get clan support in, in the near future as well.

542
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:46,632
Guest: All right.

543
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:46,933
Guest: Yeah.

544
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:52,847
Guest: We're, we're really excited about, you know, we're going to try to make this game more competitive, I think, and then cater to that community.

545
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,110
Guest: It should be really cool.

546
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,791
Rym: That's a good community.

547
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:56,093
Rym: That community is on the upswing.

548
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,097
Rym: lately has been rocking it.

549
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,561
Rym: I mean, you saw the legal legends thing at pass.

550
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,670
Rym: That was, that was like more professional than that fake tournament in the wizard.

551
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,110
Scott: Yeah.

552
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,316
Scott: I think it's definitely, it's, it's becoming a crowded space.

553
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:13,250
Scott: There's a lot of people going for it, but I think everyone's going for it because you know, the pie is getting bigger, right?

554
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:21,210
Scott: So, you know, you might feel like, well, how are we, anyone going to care about my game being competitive when everyone's playing, you know, all these mobas and FPSs and such?

555
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:28,586
Scott: Well, there's, you know, there's a whole lot of people looking for games to watch, you know, there's no hockey, no hockey.

556
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:29,649
Guest: watch guns instead.

557
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,210
Guest: That's right.

558
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,675
Guest: No, I mean, and it's twitch TV is huge.

559
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:33,638
Guest: No, absolutely.

560
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:38,570
Guest: And we're, you know, we, we have an official channel on twitch and we're, we're trying to court some casters on twitch.

561
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,635
Guest: I'm really excited about getting more into this space.

562
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:46,686
Guest: and on the topic of mobas, how do you guys feel about stupid?

563
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:48,310
Scott: I'll be honest.

564
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:48,710
Scott: Okay.

565
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,095
Scott: I think the fundamental game of a MOBA, right?

566
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:57,062
Scott: The, you know, five on five sort of, you know, thing, it has something going on there.

567
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:57,562
Scott: It's fun.

568
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:03,150
Scott: I kind of want to play kind of like a versus tower defense, but the reality of what every implementation is.

569
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,112
Scott: Some are better than others.

570
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:09,722
Scott: Like legal legends is better than Dota because it doesn't have the nonsense, denying bullshit is the bottom, right?

571
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:14,070
Scott: But they're all, you know, it's like they get the details wrong.

572
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:25,490
Scott: And I feel like if I made a MOBA, I could keep the same fundamental thing, you know, game idea of, you know, five on five control one guy on this map, but it would, but it would be good because there wouldn't be any bullshit.

573
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,893
Rym: Well, this gets into the same thing.

574
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:35,070
Rym: I mean, in my opinion, MOBAs steer wrong and that the original game had a lot of emergent properties that people who can, you know, had a really strong community around it.

575
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,415
Rym: So people would do these emergent things like the last hitting, because that was just the limitation of this mod.

576
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:51,790
Rym: But then when they like canonized those emergent behaviors into legit game mechanics, instead of addressing them in a different way, that is where these games fall flat.

577
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,490
Scott: So, you know, judging by the way you even asked that question, I get the feeling you are also anti MOBA.

578
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,569
Guest: Let me let me preface this by saying that it is my hope to someday compose a rap song so that I can use the line last hits like MOBAs.

579
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:05,423
Scott: There is the Dotas, you know, the...

580
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,220
Guest: MOBAs represent a really interesting case study for me because it's exactly what you said.

581
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,410
Guest: It's the emergent properties and how they've translated into codified formalized rule sets.

582
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,857
Guest: And I think you're dead on with the last hits.

583
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:25,470
Guest: I think the concept of last hit and you, man, you see this in other games, too.

584
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,150
Guest: So I mentioned I was playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

585
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:34,390
Guest: The points you get from killing enemies is weighted extremely heavily in your favor if you get the last hit.

586
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:37,601
Guest: Even if you didn't contribute most of the damage, you get that last hit.

587
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,990
Guest: You get an insane amount of like experience points.

588
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:44,850
Guest: I consider that a weak design, I think.

589
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,798
Rym: Well, I think it's a symptom of a greater problem.

590
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,370
Rym: Those mechanics are there, in my opinion.

591
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:55,630
Rym: I can use a better lexicon now because I've read that Characteristics of Games book that we learned about at PAX Dev.

592
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:04,490
Rym: But these games, they have these skill components that require you to master all of these sort of individual fiddly bits.

593
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:13,290
Rym: Because that's the only way to give these games enough strategic and tactical and execution depth to make them appeal to competitive players.

594
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,990
Rym: Because there's an extremely high return on investment for learning those skills.

595
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:25,330
Rym: But the problem for me is that those skills that these games make you learn are not analogous to what the game is about at all.

596
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,750
Rym: The game appears to be about one thing, but really it's about the worst parts of StarCraft.

597
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,614
Scott: Last hitting, right?

598
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,462
Scott: It's like, well, why is last hitting a thing?

599
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,350
Scott: Last hitting a thing has always been in video games.

600
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,514
Scott: If you kill the guy, you get the frag.

601
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:45,150
Scott: In Quake, if you're the one who kills the guy with your Rocky, even if the other guy did 99 of the damage, you are the one who gets the frag on your score.

602
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,250
Rym: Dude, Crystal Warriors on the game gear.

603
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,718
Scott: And the reason for this, right?

604
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:51,007
Scott: Why is the reason that every game does this?

605
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:51,690
Scott: This is the reason.

606
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,702
Scott: Because we need to add the code that says frag plus one has to be somewhere.

607
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:56,484
Scott: Where do we put it?

608
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,550
Scott: We put it in the onDeath function.

609
00:31:59,173 --> 00:31:59,454
Scott: Right?

610
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:03,410
Scott: So, when someone dies, that's when someone gets a frag.

611
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,016
Scott: So, in the onDeath function, right?

612
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:10,789
Scott: How do we, oh, we have to also have access to the person to give this frag to.

613
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:19,410
Scott: Well, we don't, you know, we're going to do at that moment when someone dies, have a running tally of all the damage that's been done to them and figure out, you know.

614
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:22,330
Scott: No one was going to do that, especially not way back in like a mud.

615
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,172
Scott: Well, certainly.

616
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:32,750
Scott: This is carried over till the present day and towards become sort of just gaming common sense in a way, even though it's not common sense, but to where no one would think to do it differently.

617
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:41,850
Guest: Mass Effect 3 does accumulate damage counters though for everybody and experience is divvied up, but the waiting function is my objection in this case, I think.

618
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:51,490
Guest: And I'll also preface this by saying that I'm more in line with Dave Serlin, for example, who's doing a lot of work for Capcom right now on balancing the old school fighting.

619
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,509
Guest: He used to be an active member in the fighting game community, but he and I suffer from the same problem in that we're both hands.

620
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,592
Guest: Yeah, exactly.

621
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:03,490
Guest: Actually, neither of us are particularly good at execution and we don't necessarily consider that to be the core component of the game.

622
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,411
Rym: So you can play Yomi.

623
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:17,010
Rym: Well, if you remove those components, then you get to the situation where all games break down pretty rapidly and return on investment of skill has to eventually have an end game that is within the reach of players.

624
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:25,090
Rym: MOBAs have these shitty fiddly mechanics because that's the only way to keep a perfect end game out of the grasp of a player who's dedicated to solving the game.

625
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,619
Guest: I think to a degree, I would actually rather make a good game every two years.

626
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,985
Guest: If that's the alternative, I would rather make a good game every two years.

627
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,402
Rym: Ah, that is why I put so much stock in German board games because we solve every game we play eventually.

628
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:38,966
Rym: I mean, Settlers isn't done.

629
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,290
Rym: I'm done with Settlers, but you know what?

630
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,829
Scott: Every time.

631
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,470
Rym: It was way fun while I was playing it and when I was done with it, I played a different game.

632
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:52,126
Scott: And you look at board games and constantly there are new ones coming out that are all awesome and in some way, you know, it's like Settlers is no good anymore.

633
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,050
Scott: Where did this eclipse thing come from?

634
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,950
Scott: Suddenly this huge hit game selling all selling out multiple editions.

635
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,450
Rym: Though I do still play Counter-Strike and I like it for all the meta reasons that these kids like MOBAs.

636
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:09,370
Rym: So I can't pretend that I'm immune to the desire to see a great return on investment.

637
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,889
Scott: But at least that the you know, that stuff in Counter-Strike, you know, makes sense, right?

638
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,230
Rym: The actions are analogous.

639
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:16,670
Scott: Right.

640
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,315
Scott: The actions are analogous to what you're trying to do.

641
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:22,025
Scott: I mean, in Street Fighter, they make mostly sense, but not as much sense as Counter-Strike.

642
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,409
Scott: And in Dota, they make even less sense.

643
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,748
Scott: Shoot your own guys to win.

644
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,248
Rym: I think Soul Calibur has a better analogy.

645
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,130
Scott: Soul Calibur has the best analogy of any real time fighting game that I have played ever.

646
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:34,290
Rym: Well, Bushido Blade.

647
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:34,996
Scott: No.

648
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:36,638
Guest: Wow.

649
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,268
Guest: Taking it back.

650
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,350
Guest: I haven't even heard the words Bushido Blade.

651
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:43,730
Rym: I was not good at Bushido Blade, but I was better than all my friends.

652
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,735
Guest: It was an SNK game.

653
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:46,005
Guest: I'm thinking of the right game.

654
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:46,670
Guest: That was an SNK game.

655
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,250
Scott: It was the realistic 3D PlayStation game where when you hit someone, they were dead.

656
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:50,853
Guest: Long game.

657
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:51,560
Guest: OK, cool.

658
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:52,510
Scott: Never mind.

659
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,230
Scott: No, you're thinking of the game where I showed up.

660
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,210
Rym: I was like, I've got a sword and you've got a hammer.

661
00:34:56,571 --> 00:35:00,750
Rym: If I hit you with the sword, maybe you're dead or you're almost dead.

662
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,986
Scott: Or you're wounded at best.

663
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:03,806
Rym: And you start looping around the ring.

664
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:04,755
Rym: Like, ready?

665
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:05,181
Rym: Go.

666
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:05,689
Rym: Someone's dead.

667
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,301
Rym: It was awesome.

668
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:07,910
Scott: Anyway.

669
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:09,700
Rym: It was awesome.

670
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,429
Rym: I love those games.

671
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:11,691
Guest: Yeah.

672
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:14,790
Guest: Now I'm just looking forward to my Strike Suit Zero Kickstarter coming through.

673
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:21,450
Guest: I really like just sometimes, man, like especially working in games now and having to actually make game design decisions.

674
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,130
Guest: Some days I just like to come home and shoot other spaceships in a spaceship.

675
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,689
Guest: That's just the thing I like to do.

676
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,030
Guest: And Strike Suit Zero looks like it's going to be a blast.

677
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:35,770
Guest: And even, you know, even if it's just like to a degree, what I what I've always wanted was sort of like a free space kind of game with like Newtonian physics where you could.

678
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,830
Scott: Nobody's made a free space game in so long.

679
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,576
Rym: No, I would I would I would if there was.

680
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:43,550
Rym: if somehow if Disney made a new TIE Fighter game happen, that was a free space shooter.

681
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,477
Scott: Oh, Disney.

682
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,550
Rym: I would tie fighter.

683
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,730
Rym: I would probably back the highest level of whatever.

684
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,763
Scott: I don't think Disney needs to kickstart anything.

685
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,690
Scott: They got money.

686
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,316
Guest: Well, I guess a principle.

687
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,489
Guest: I absolutely appreciate it.

688
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,550
Guest: But like, you know, I really remember that Sophie game that came out for the Xbox 360 that was made by Square Enix.

689
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,790
Scott: I didn't play it, but I know it was silly.

690
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Guest: It was silly as shit.

691
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,610
Guest: It was like anime spaceships.

692
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,257
Guest: And yeah, it was.

693
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,130
Guest: it was just really dumb and flashy.

694
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:11,481
Guest: And like, I loved it.

695
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,309
Guest: I love the shit out of it.

696
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,724
Guest: I must have played it for like 60 hours.

697
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,568
Scott: It was just like to this day, there's someone listening right now who's like, yeah, they're like, oh, my God, someone else played seriously.

698
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,530
Scott: And he's like, yeah, the voice acting was awful.

699
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,845
Scott: And now he's listening to this and saying, oh, my God, it's me.

700
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:27,529
Scott: They're talking about me.

701
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:39,990
Guest: Interestingly, when we used to do game jams at work where like every Friday at the last Friday of the month, we would all sit down and a programmer would pair off with an artist and you would come up with your idea for a game.

702
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:42,549
Guest: And then we would vet these ideas and see if anything good came out.

703
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:45,789
Guest: And I am not a creative person by any means.

704
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,649
Guest: I'm just I'm just not.

705
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:53,490
Guest: And so I got paired with John Lynn and John was like, you know, what games do you like?

706
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,467
Guest: And I was like, well, you remember Sophie from the PC and like nineteen eighty three.

707
00:36:58,487 --> 00:36:59,290
Guest: I like that.

708
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,752
Guest: I also kind of like to rez.

709
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:09,310
Guest: And so I made this like a rez, like Sophie game that used the music on your hard drive to to create like waveforms and enemy enemy patterns and stuff.

710
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:17,570
Scott: So that was that was the extent of pretty sure that I'm pretty sure the original Sophie wasn't that like for more systems and like any game ever.

711
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:22,210
Scott: Well, yeah, it was like there was a Web page I went to once I had like samples from like every sound card ever.

712
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:28,510
Scott: And like the only game that they could find that they could actually test and all these different sound cards through the generations was like the original.

713
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,519
Scott: So I'm pretty sure it was the original Sophie.

714
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,826
Scott: I have to check that out.

715
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:32,530
Guest: It would make sense.

716
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,409
Scott: It was like Commodore, you know, Atari.

717
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,569
Guest: I was like, what might have made it all the way up to the Sound Blaster era.

718
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:45,644
Rym: I remember when I got my dad, he wouldn't buy me more RAM, but he bought me a Sound Blaster AWE 32 advanced wave effects.

719
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,770
Rym: The only benefit was MIDI was a little bit better set in your blaster environment variables.

720
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,650
Rym: You realize that thing needed two IRQs.

721
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,642
Guest: Yeah, that was serious business back then, man.

722
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,110
Guest: Not to be trifled with.

723
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,350
Guest: Yeah, high level ones that you had to reboot DOS in a real mode.

724
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,353
Rym: Oh, shit.

725
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:08,410
Rym: I made boot disk because SimCity 2000 would not play on my computer.

726
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,949
Scott: I only needed boot disk for the mech warrior, too.

727
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,870
Scott: And I only freaking had to do that until I got 16 megs of RAM.

728
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,662
Rym: Until I upgraded my RAM, I could not play Doom.

729
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:20,390
Rym: if I booted the computer legit.

730
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,368
Scott: I had 8 megs of RAM, so I could always play Doom.

731
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:27,030
Rym: I'd hold an F5 to boot to like raw DOS and then I would type mouse to load my mouse driver.

732
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,181
Rym: Hi Mem Mem Maker, all that stuff.

733
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:30,630
Rym: And then I would start Doom.

734
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:36,930
Scott: Not only that, but I, because I had 8 megs of RAM and a quad speed CD-ROM, I could install Doom and Doom 2 in under a minute.

735
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:42,409
Scott: So I could just keep, whenever I needed more space, whenever I needed more space, I could delete it.

736
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,029
Rym: Doom came on a fucking disk.

737
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,170
Scott: I had a CD-ROM that had Doom 2 and Doom Ultimate.

738
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,026
Guest: Maybe at the time he had to put into a plastic caddy to load into his CD drive.

739
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:52,830
Scott: You don't know, it's possible.

740
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,870
Scott: No, the CD drive was quad speed, bitches.

741
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,450
Guest: So by that time, yeah, you're right.

742
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,590
Scott: That's why I said Doom installed, like boom, it's installed.

743
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,769
Rym: Scott, I bought the Doom 2 shareware like when Doom 2 came out.

744
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:06,029
Rym: And then I'd use like wadded and de-hacked to make my own Mavs.

745
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:07,307
Scott: Good job.

746
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:09,187
Rym: I'm very proud of myself.

747
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:10,228
Guest: Those were the days.

748
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,005
Scott: They were.

749
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,289
Scott: So what are you into besides technology and games that you were known for?

750
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,750
Scott: Uh, well, I live with a lot of- I know you were a nerd of many colors.

751
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,250
Guest: Yeah, I live with several illustrators and many of whom do comics.

752
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:28,990
Guest: And so I end up reading a lot of comics or as to say, comics end up piling up next to my desk.

753
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:29,669
Scott: That sounds like me.

754
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,958
Guest: I should read them.

755
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,229
Guest: I think that's the way I want to put it.

756
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,769
Scott: What's piled up next to your desk right now?

757
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:34,549
Guest: Oh, God.

758
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:40,960
Guest: The worst part is Ananth will periodically come into my room and just be like, "Hey, we got these in the mail.

759
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,026
Guest: You should read one of

760
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:42,288
Guest: these.".

761
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,950
Scott: And so I will say- You didn't know if Ananth is going to do this, it's going to be good.

762
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,669
Guest: Yeah, exactly.

763
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,830
Rym: Yeah, if you put it on the pile of everything else, that's good.

764
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,290
Rym: Particularly- I mean, I just got my Daisy Cutter Kickstarter.

765
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,570
Rym: I haven't even like read it at all.

766
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,509
Guest: That looks so good.

767
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:53,369
Guest: Yeah, it does look good.

768
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:56,690
Guest: I will say that I just finished up King City by Brandon Graham.

769
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,050
Guest: King City was originally a Tokyo pop property.

770
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,029
Guest: They published the first book.

771
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:03,010
Guest: It didn't take off.

772
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,947
Guest: And then so they canned it.

773
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,909
Scott: Oh, right, right.

774
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:07,169
Scott: A lot of those people have found other places to go.

775
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,630
Guest: Yeah, it sat in purgatory for like several years.

776
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,450
Guest: But recently the Omnibus got published.

777
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,970
Guest: So it's this amazing, large, hardcover compilation of all the King City comics.

778
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:21,330
Guest: And it is just the most incredible, off-the-wall, urban decay.

779
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,390
Guest: I highly recommend it.

780
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,710
Guest: I'm not going to do it justice summarizing it because this is sadly not my forte.

781
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:35,630
Guest: But I do recommend everybody grab at least the first King City volume, if not the whole hardcover, and just give it a read because it's a blast.

782
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,039
Guest: I love it.

783
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,830
Scott: How about in terms of, you know, movies, musics, and that sort of thing?

784
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,410
Rym: Did you see Wreck-It Ralph?

785
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:42,970
Guest: I did see Wreck-It Ralph.

786
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,530
Rym: Did you like it?

787
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,990
Rym: Because I liked it because Roger Rabbit did in that all the plot was like new characters and the old characters were just cameos.

788
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,190
Rym: They weren't actually- Absolutely.

789
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,690
Rym: Like Bowser was not the villain.

790
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:57,590
Guest: No, it nails what a video game movie sort of needs to be, right?

791
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,070
Guest: Especially because you're absolutely right in your analogy of Roger Rabbit.

792
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,310
Rym: So did you notice that Sandy Fox did one of the fucking voices and AKB48 did the theme to Sugar Rush?

793
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,243
Rym: Well, I did notice AKB48.

794
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,310
Guest: I didn't notice Sandy Fox or something?

795
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,929
Rym: Yeah, Sandy Fox.

796
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,990
Rym: I don't even know what voice he did.

797
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:09,570
Rym: She was credited.

798
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,281
Rym: I was like, "Sandy

799
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:10,688
Rym: Fox?".

800
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:11,950
Rym: I still haven't looked up what she did.

801
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,410
Guest: Yeah, wait a minute.

802
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:13,549
Guest: I didn't realize that.

803
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,190
Scott: It's Rym's favorite.

804
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:19,170
Scott: The only thing that can make Rym go crazier is if it was like a two-mix opener.

805
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:25,347
Rym: I was just watching old anime openers from the '90s.

806
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,410
Guest: Getting some Nagumi Hayashibara into your diet.

807
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,228
Rym: Oh my gosh.

808
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:30,569
Rym: Yeah, two-mix, man.

809
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,250
Guest: Did they do rhythm and motion?

810
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:33,149
Guest: Was that two-mix?

811
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,670
Rym: The White Revolution was that music video that everyone thought was an anime, but it was just a music video.

812
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,950
Scott: I didn't know what I was watching that first day of anime club.

813
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:40,629
Rym: I watched that.

814
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,189
Rym: No, two-mix?

815
00:41:41,551 --> 00:41:43,850
Rym: In high school, me and Ken found it.

816
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,290
Rym: We had this MPEG file, but that shit was hard to play back in the day.

817
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,249
Scott: So when you were at that first anime club meeting in 1/2000, you knew you had already seen that.

818
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,970
Rym: Scott, when I came to that anime club meeting, I already knew who two-mix was.

819
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:02,110
Rym: I knew White Reflection, and I had seen easily half the anime I've seen in my entire life already.

820
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,268
Guest: High school, man.

821
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,608
Guest: That's just how it was.

822
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,510
Rym: Scott, I had already seen most of Slayerz, like Eska Flonay.

823
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:11,770
Rym: Yeah, Eva's the only thing I hadn't actually watched.

824
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,250
Guest: So, okay, no lie.

825
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:21,290
Guest: I have this problem, whereas generally when we discuss the media that I've consumed, generally there are two different categories, and it's like a Venn diagram in which the circles don't touch.

826
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,729
Guest: It's like good media and shit that I've accidentally seen.

827
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,466
Guest: And this absolutely applied to me in anime in high school as well.

828
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:45,570
Guest: So I ended up with these fan subs of Tenshi ni Naruman, which is this weird, bubbly, sort of just awkward story about this angel that falls to earth and then falls in love with a dude who's all tsundere about it.

829
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,729
Scott: I've never heard of this.

830
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,930
Scott: It's got a anime news network.

831
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,690
Guest: Yeah, Tenshi ni Naruman is the name of it.

832
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,349
Guest: It's patently bad.

833
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,960
Rym: I asked because Luke liked it.

834
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,090
Rym: I ended up seeing some of Rhizal Mine.

835
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:58,287
Scott: What?

836
00:42:58,891 --> 00:42:59,720
Scott: I completely forgot.

837
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,730
Scott: there was a show called that.

838
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,810
Scott: I have no idea what it's about.

839
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,970
Rym: It has that Hajime Te Shimimasho whatever opening song.

840
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:08,748
Rym: If you hear that song, you'll be like, "Oh, great

841
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:08,930
Rym: show.".

842
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,407
Rym: I probably will.

843
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,390
Scott: How about Alien 9?

844
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,432
Rym: Oh.

845
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:14,770
Guest: Wow, taking it better.

846
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,230
Guest: That was the one with the creepy hats, right?

847
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:16,510
Guest: Yes.

848
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:16,889
Guest: The creepy hats.

849
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,790
Scott: And the whole plot was in the closer the last episode.

850
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,990
Rym: Yeah, we all went to eat dinner and Gabi was in the other room watching.

851
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:24,010
Rym: We watched the end of the show.

852
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,330
Rym: And Gabi was watching the closing credits.

853
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,326
Guest: She's like, "Oh, my

854
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:27,490
Guest: God.".

855
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,950
Scott: They just kill everyone in the closing credits of the last episode.

856
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:34,767
Rym: All right, she's credited in Wreck-It Ralph with "additional

857
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:35,289
Rym: voices."

858
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,249
Rym: We got burned.

859
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:37,190
Guest: Ouch.

860
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,130
Rym: No information.

861
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,250
Scott: Background characters.

862
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:41,210
Guest: No record.

863
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,730
Scott: Needs some money.

864
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,990
Guest: Wreck-It Ralph was definitely one of the best things to happen this year.

865
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,188
Guest: And we got Looper this year.

866
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,690
Guest: And Looper, man, I take a lot of shit for Looper as much as I did.

867
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,528
Scott: I haven't seen either one.

868
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:52,229
Guest: Okay.

869
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:58,130
Guest: My thing about Looper is even if it wasn't perfect, I think it represents something important.

870
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,549
Guest: It's like we can have these high-concept movies come into Hollywood and do very well.

871
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,310
Guest: Just as a template, that's a positive thing that I want to see more of, right?

872
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:08,610
Guest: Even if Prometheus wasn't perfect, I want to see more Prometheus.

873
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,568
Guest: I want to see more Looper.

874
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,130
Guest: These are things that I like.

875
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,533
Guest: I like that.

876
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:13,270
Guest: I can go to the movies and see good sci-fi again.

877
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:18,389
Rym: I heard, though, that the new Bond movie is really good and makes up for the second to most recent Bond movie.

878
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,610
Scott: I haven't seen either one.

879
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:20,864
Scott: I only saw Casino Royale.

880
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:28,750
Rym: I've seen a lot of people who actually like Bond, like they know Bond, and they call this their second or third favorite Bond ever.

881
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,530
Scott: Well, I've seen every Bond movie up to Casino Royale.

882
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,169
Scott: I just haven't seen the two newest ones.

883
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:34,329
Rym: It was okay.

884
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:39,329
Rym: The only problem with Casino Royale, in my opinion, is that Casino Royale is the derpiest Bond plot.

885
00:44:40,232 --> 00:44:42,710
Rym: Like it's too close to the original book and all of its derpiness.

886
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:43,310
Scott: Yeah.

887
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:44,185
Scott: It was all right.

888
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,670
Guest: Are you talking about the old Casino Royale?

889
00:44:46,932 --> 00:44:48,650
Rym: Oh, with Woody Allen or whatever?

890
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,878
Guest: Yeah.

891
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:50,249
Guest: Oh, okay.

892
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,010
Guest: There was a new one.

893
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:51,528
Guest: Oh, I see.

894
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,790
Guest: This is what I mean about this Venn diagram, man.

895
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:54,469
Guest: It's real.

896
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,649
Guest: My Venn diagram of media is real.

897
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,849
Rym: Wait, so what was the last James Bond movie you've seen?

898
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:03,929
Guest: It was that one where it's like the software mogul tries to shoot down North America with a space laser.

899
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,730
Guest: So what, Pierce Brosnan?

900
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,250
Guest: Yeah, Pierce Brosnan one.

901
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:07,250
Guest: It wasn't GoldenEye.

902
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:07,588
Guest: No?

903
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,788
Guest: No, it was a Pierce Brosnan one.

904
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,470
Rym: I hated Pierce Brosnan's Bond movies.

905
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,310
Rym: He was an okay Bond, but his movies were, I just didn't like him.

906
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,610
Scott: Wasn't Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye?

907
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:15,129
Rym: Yeah.

908
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,209
Rym: That was the only good Bond movie he was in.

909
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:18,429
Rym: He was in a bunch more.

910
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,290
Scott: Pretty sure GoldenEye.

911
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,150
Guest: Maybe it was GoldenEye.

912
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,050
Scott: Pretty sure GoldenEye is about a space laser on a satellite.

913
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,870
Guest: Maybe.

914
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,202
Guest: Yeah.

915
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,361
Guest: Maybe I'm thinking about Dr.

916
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,088
Guest: No, actually.

917
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:27,177
Scott: Dr.

918
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:27,650
Guest: No is about a rocket.

919
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,167
Guest: No, I like Dr.

920
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:28,249
Guest: No.

921
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:28,574
Guest: Dr.

922
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:29,869
Guest: No is about a rocket.

923
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,809
Guest: But this was definitely a Pierce Brosnan one.

924
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,036
Scott: Yeah, Dr.

925
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:33,298
Scott: No is.

926
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,170
Scott: Sean Connery is the first Bond movie ever.

927
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:35,990
Scott: It's about a rocket.

928
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:36,490
Guest: Yeah, I know.

929
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,169
Guest: That was awesome.

930
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:37,803
Guest: Dr.

931
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:37,927
Scott: No.

932
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,810
Rym: From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball.

933
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:41,890
Rym: Which I really like.

934
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,849
Scott: Thunderball is the best.

935
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,350
Rym: You only live twice on our majesty's Secret Service.

936
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:45,990
Rym: Diamonds are forever.

937
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:46,487
Rym: Live and let die.

938
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,389
Rym: The man with the golden gun.

939
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,809
Scott: You don't have to go over the whole list here.

940
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:49,783
Rym: Moonraker.

941
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,390
Scott: Moonraker is the corniest, but I like it anyway.

942
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,830
Rym: Well, because it gave us the Moonraker laser.

943
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:55,649
Scott: Of course.

944
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:56,950
Guest: It was The World Is Not Enough.

945
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:57,630
Guest: That was the one.

946
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,170
Guest: That was the last one that I'd seen was The World Is Not Enough.

947
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,170
Rym: Oh, that was like at the peak of everything I hated about Bond.

948
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:02,709
Guest: Exactly.

949
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:03,749
Guest: And that was the last one.

950
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,770
Guest: So like after that, I was like, well, we're done.

951
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:07,389
Guest: We're done with Bond for a while.

952
00:46:07,953 --> 00:46:08,044
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,565
Scott: All right.

954
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:09,850
Scott: What else?

955
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,068
Guest: So now now I have to see Skyfall, though, I hear it's very good.

956
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,330
Rym: Well, you should probably see Casino Royale first.

957
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:15,690
Guest: OK.

958
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,201
Guest: Yeah.

959
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:19,410
Rym: It has one of the better opening credits I've ever seen in a movie theater.

960
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:21,449
Rym: If that's worth anything.

961
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,549
Scott: How long have we gone?

962
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:23,650
Rym: We can keep going.

963
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:25,929
Rym: We've gone on for forty six minutes.

964
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:26,950
Scott: Not bad.

965
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:28,989
Guest: I mean, ask.

966
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:29,870
Guest: Ask me anything.

967
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:30,650
Guest: I am a Conrad.

968
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,470
Guest: Ask me anything.

969
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:32,330
Rym: All right.

970
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:35,909
Rym: If you had to give an over/under, how many times have you ejaculated in your entire life?

971
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:38,390
Scott: It's going to be a big number.

972
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,149
Guest: 365 days in a year.

973
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:43,930
Rym: Now you have to think back to the day when that started happening.

974
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,189
Guest: Well, you know, you're right.

975
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:47,070
Rym: But there's a graph.

976
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,990
Rym: It's got to be weighted.

977
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,390
Rym: There's probably way more in the days of discovery.

978
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,230
Guest: Well, it was weird because I started masturbating before I could ejaculate.

979
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,430
Guest: So like now this is a weird question.

980
00:46:57,496 --> 00:46:58,090
Guest: That does happen.

981
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,150
Rym: I saw I saw a video of a baby in the womb.

982
00:47:01,412 --> 00:47:02,310
Guest: Yeah, of course.

983
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:02,807
Guest: Oh, yikes.

984
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,030
Guest: I mean, it makes sense.

985
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,049
Guest: All the wiring is there.

986
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:06,845
Guest: Yeah, man.

987
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,750
Rym: OK, so let's say this is called the kids at home with science.

988
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,210
Rym: This is called a Fermi calculation.

989
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:17,729
Rym: You're attempting to make a broad, generalized guess based on extremely like estimated numbers.

990
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,350
Guest: Let's say 15.

991
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,750
Guest: I'm 27.

992
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,758
Guest: So 12 years, 365 days in a year.

993
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,269
Guest: Let's say that there's an average of one time a day.

994
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,889
Guest: Somebody can do the math with a calculator because I'm not very good at multiple large number multiplication.

995
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:37,115
Guest: But it basically comes down to 12 times 365.

996
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:37,669
Rym: It's not too bad.

997
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,627
Scott: No, not bad at all.

998
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,229
Guest: I try really hard.

999
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:42,589
Guest: You working that bone.

1000
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:44,803
Guest: OK, OK.

1001
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,070
Guest: Speaking of shitty anime, have you guys ever seen Green Green?

1002
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,789
Scott: I never even heard of Green Green.

1003
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:50,789
Guest: It's awful.

1004
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,682
Rym: It was the shit anime.

1005
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,030
Scott: Why did jerking off every day remind you of Green Green?

1006
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:06,810
Guest: Because in the opening scene of the first episode, there is a man who introduces himself in this really dramatic way by proclaiming that he's he's masturbated at over 100 strokes a minute and shows his blistered hands.

1007
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,069
Guest: That's the image of me you should have right now.

1008
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,310
Rym: This is like 2002.

1009
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,350
Guest: I watched this in college.

1010
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,249
Scott: We didn't know about it.

1011
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,669
Guest: My freshman year of college, I watched it.

1012
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,489
Rym: We were there.

1013
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,968
Rym: No, I know.

1014
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,030
Rym: A whole bunch of girls without shirts on.

1015
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:20,868
Rym: One's holding a cactus.

1016
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:21,888
Rym: They're all drinking milk.

1017
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,690
Guest: Yeah, no, this is Green Green.

1018
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:30,270
Guest: OK, so in college, my freshman year of college, we used to every every night we would get Gracie's takeout food.

1019
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,430
Guest: And we would watch the worst anime we could find.

1020
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,950
Rym: Remember, you remember, Scott, you could fill that you could fill that tray.

1021
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:37,487
Rym: All right.

1022
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,129
Scott: The white styrofoam tray.

1023
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,110
Rym: But you had to be able to close it or they wouldn't let you walk out with it.

1024
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,730
Guest: Which what I always end up like half of the time we did this, I would always end up taking an entire styrofoam tray full of waffle crisps.

1025
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,150
Scott: Why didn't you hide a bunch of styrofoam trays in the safety barrel?

1026
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,429
Scott: You probably could have gone.

1027
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:53,129
Guest: Oh, God.

1028
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:53,869
Guest: Safety barrel.

1029
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:00,350
Rym: Well, I remember when I moved out of RIT and I looked in my dorm and I realized I had like 40 Gracie's glasses and like a bucket full of styrofoam.

1030
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:01,190
Guest: All of that silverware.

1031
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:02,290
Guest: All of that silverware.

1032
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,290
Guest: We still probably have.

1033
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:05,649
Rym: I have several Gracie's forks and knives.

1034
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:10,170
Scott: OK, like I'm not one to be turned on by like, you know, hentai and such, right?

1035
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,150
Scott: Animated people.

1036
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:18,710
Scott: Wait, Scott, anytime someone ever says I'm not X, but but if that situation were to occur in real life, that would be pretty amazing.

1037
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:24,010
Rym: Scott, maybe not because she one of these naked girls has a cactus.

1038
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:26,688
Rym: She looks prepared to use it.

1039
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,488
Guest: But I really like they all have milk.

1040
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:30,110
Guest: They're all pretty cute.

1041
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:30,886
Guest: I really like milk.

1042
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:32,150
Scott: They're all smiling.

1043
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,350
Scott: They're all having a good time.

1044
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,549
Scott: They're not upset or anything.

1045
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:34,890
Rym: Yes.

1046
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:36,170
Rym: You know, where's Darryl?

1047
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,790
Rym: So I was like, how come they're always crying?

1048
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,026
Rym: Yeah.

1049
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,250
Scott: These ones are just like, hey, how's it going?

1050
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:43,110
Scott: It's almost like they're going to play volleyball in nudist colony or something, which is totally hot.

1051
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,010
Rym: But Scott, the cactus really worries me.

1052
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:47,329
Scott: Hey, you don't know what the cactus could be for.

1053
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:49,430
Scott: It could be for anything.

1054
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,869
Rym: I wonder if that show is worse than Photon.

1055
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:53,888
Guest: Oh, wow.

1056
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:54,835
Rym: Yeah.

1057
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,230
Rym: We did a show recently.

1058
00:49:56,332 --> 00:49:57,450
Rym: We started talking about Tenchi Muyo.

1059
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,170
Rym: And I remember that I really, really have fond memories.

1060
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,769
Scott: You know what my memory of Photon is?

1061
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,730
Rym: A small amount of Tenchi Muyo.

1062
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,150
Scott: Let me tell you my memory of Photon going into media play.

1063
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,570
Scott: And every time the Photon DVD was always there in the same spot and it never moved.

1064
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,930
Scott: And I kept seeing it every time I went in there to look through DVDs.

1065
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,429
Scott: And that's what I remember of Photon.

1066
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:14,710
Guest: I remember about Blockbuster, actually.

1067
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,230
Guest: You'd always go into Blockbuster and every time Ninja Scroll would be in the same place.

1068
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,950
Rym: Right next to Doom Megalopolis and Armageddon and Wind of Amnesia.

1069
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,585
Guest: Fucking Wind of Amnesia.

1070
00:50:25,036 --> 00:50:25,889
Rym: I remember watching that.

1071
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,870
Rym: I thought it was the deepest thing ever.

1072
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,990
Rym: I was like, "This is amazing.

1073
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:29,650
Rym: Oh, my God.

1074
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,730
Rym: This is society.

1075
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:31,017
Rym: This is

1076
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:31,264
Rym: deep.".

1077
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,528
Rym: And then at the end, it's like, "Oh, they're having sex

1078
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:33,730
Rym: now.".

1079
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,786
Rym: Then my mom walks in and I'm like, "I swear it wasn't like this until just

1080
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,108
Rym: now.".

1081
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:41,047
Rym: And then there's this moment burning my brain where just as my mom is like,

1082
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:41,409
Rym: "Really?"

1083
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,910
Rym: He is nibbling on her nipple.

1084
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:44,910
Guest: Oh, yeah.

1085
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,690
Guest: It gets really into it.

1086
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,669
Scott: Well, she didn't bring a cactus.

1087
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,210
Scott: Of course, he's going to nibble if you don't have any cactus protection.

1088
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:53,940
Guest: And she's wearing gloves too, man.

1089
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:54,499
Guest: She's ready.

1090
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:55,919
Rym: She's got gloves on both hands.

1091
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,413
Rym: Oh, I know.

1092
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:58,020
Guest: She's serious about that cactus, man.

1093
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,719
Rym: She is the cutest of these four girls too.

1094
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,256
Guest: Oh, I know.

1095
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,437
Rym: That hair.

1096
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,478
Guest: Yes, that's right.

1097
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,520
Guest: We watched this.

1098
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,999
Guest: We watched Midori no Hibi.

1099
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:06,120
Guest: Oh, really?

1100
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:06,615
Guest: Oh, yeah.

1101
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,498
Rym: I watched one episode of that and I was like, "That is

1102
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:08,640
Rym: enough.".

1103
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,740
Scott: Is that the one with the puppet hand?

1104
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:09,907
Scott: Yes.

1105
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:10,192
Guest: Yeah.

1106
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:11,780
Guest: It was the shit anime tour, man.

1107
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,400
Guest: We watched all the worst stuff.

1108
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,160
Guest: We watched Fullmetal Panic, which was good.

1109
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,160
Guest: And then we watched Fullmetal Panic Fumofu.

1110
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:18,478
Scott: And that was not.

1111
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,210
Rym: That was a travesty, man.

1112
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,600
Guest: That was the bait and switch of the moratorium.

1113
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,720
Scott: I watched one episode of Fumofu.

1114
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:25,939
Guest: We watched two, which was tough.

1115
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,718
Rym: It was like, "Hey, remember this thing that was pretty good that you kind of

1116
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:28,980
Rym: liked?".

1117
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:29,414
Rym: It was okay.

1118
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,240
Rym: We're going to shit all over.

1119
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,100
Scott: Regular Fullmetal Panic was pretty much a straightforward anime, you know, a little school humor and a little robot fighting.

1120
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:37,615
Rym: And then... Decent plot.

1121
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,858
Scott: Fumofu was just, "Where'd the robot fighting

1122
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:39,919
Scott: go?".

1123
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:41,540
Guest: Oh, okay.

1124
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:44,699
Guest: I don't know if I've asked you guys what you all think about Haruhi.

1125
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:46,399
Scott: I think it's awesome.

1126
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,620
Scott: I have only seen a few episodes.

1127
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,956
Rym: The original Haruhi?

1128
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:49,976
Rym: Like the first...

1129
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:50,478
Guest: Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,280
Guest: The very first incarnation.

1131
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,620
Scott: I'm not sure what order to watch them.

1132
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,400
Scott: Whatever episodes I saw were all right.

1133
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:54,934
Scott: I would watch more.

1134
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,519
Guest: I watched them in broadcast order.

1135
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,999
Rym: That's how I watched them.

1136
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,399
Rym: You know what?

1137
00:51:58,844 --> 00:51:59,940
Rym: I think it was a brilliant show.

1138
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,060
Rym: I thought it was really heartwarming.

1139
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,040
Rym: I really, really, really liked it.

1140
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,199
Guest: Dude, I actually did too.

1141
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,400
Guest: And I get mixed reactions when I ask people about it, which is why I was curious as to what you all thought about it.

1142
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:09,697
Guest: I'm trying to...

1143
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,260
Rym: I don't want to speak about it too much because Scott hasn't seen it.

1144
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,069
Guest: I don't really want...

1145
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:17,040
Rym: What it is actually about is what makes that show Haruhi.

1146
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,520
Scott: Pretty sure I know what it's already about.

1147
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,360
Rym: What do you think it's about?

1148
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,398
Rym: This is interesting because Scott recently enlightened the fact that he's never read or seen Macbeth.

1149
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,339
Rym: So I asked him to explain to me what he thinks Macbeth is about.

1150
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,040
Scott: So Scott, what's Haruhi about?

1151
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,940
Rym: What is Haruhi about?

1152
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:33,420
Guest: You just changed my entire perspective.

1153
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,239
Scott: There's some aliens.

1154
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,914
Scott: I know that.

1155
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,139
Scott: And they're real.

1156
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,440
Scott: And this girl really wants to find the aliens and everyone around her is actually the aliens.

1157
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:44,138
Scott: But she doesn't know that.

1158
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,290
Rym: There is a meta...

1159
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,920
Scott: And it's also time traveling.

1160
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:55,420
Rym: You're correct, except that there is a meta... You've got what the Prince of Nothing is about, but not what it's about.

1161
00:52:56,162 --> 00:52:57,615
Scott: So I don't see the consult.

1162
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:58,140
Scott: is what you're saying?

1163
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,140
Rym: No, there's a consult.

1164
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,778
Rym: I'll put it like that.

1165
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,160
Rym: Okay.

1166
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:00,899
Rym: There's a meta.

1167
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,980
Rym: The show is one step deeper than that.

1168
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:03,479
Scott: That's good.

1169
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,840
Scott: That means there's a reason to watch.

1170
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,580
Rym: That is why the show is good and worth watching.

1171
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,819
Rym: Unlike Scrap Princess, which was really fun, but...

1172
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,860
Scott: So sad truth.

1173
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,119
Scott: I know more about Haruhi, which I've only watched a couple episodes, than I know about Macbeth.

1174
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:19,580
Guest: This is like the affliction that we all have, like 80s anime watchers.

1175
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,500
Guest: This is what we take home at the end of the day.

1176
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,300
Rym: Well, look at what just happened in our group, just now, this discussion.

1177
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:33,740
Rym: The culture of connected people in the world, at least in the Western industrialized world, is that any conversation, no media is sacred.

1178
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:42,010
Rym: In any group of people, there's going to be the same reaction to... If anyone says any name of a movie, no matter how famous, someone in the room will not have seen it, and everyone else goes,

1179
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:42,696
Rym: "What?".

1180
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:43,819
Scott: Think about it.

1181
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,160
Scott: You've never seen the West Indies?

1182
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:48,280
Scott: Think about this, right?

1183
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:51,680
Scott: I say this a lot, I might have said it on the show 10 or 12 times already.

1184
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,459
Scott: A kid was just born, just now, somewhere in the world, right?

1185
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:04,576
Scott: Hasn't seen Star Wars, hasn't seen anything ever, hasn't played any video game, hasn't played any... And meanwhile, we're making things faster than that kid can possibly even play one game or whatever, right?

1186
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:12,239
Scott: So yeah, starting now, and starting actually a long time ago, no one's ever going to see or hear or play all the things.

1187
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:16,758
Scott: No matter who you find, it's going to be like, "You don't know the

1188
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:17,120
Scott: whatever?".

1189
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:17,939
Scott: Of course not.

1190
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:18,816
Scott: This isn't possible.

1191
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,120
Guest: We've been discussing this a lot, particularly as we've been watching Adventure Time at my house.

1192
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:24,540
Rym: I'm really digging Adventure Time.

1193
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,680
Scott: I'm going to start watching Adventure Time pretty soon.

1194
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:28,060
Rym: Scott, it's like Venture Brothers.

1195
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,179
Scott: I know what it's about.

1196
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,280
Rym: No, I'm saying first season is super fun, but then once you start to get it and kind of get these characters...

1197
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,980
Scott: It's all about the secret apocalypse of the past.

1198
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,380
Rym: It's also just like, it really grows on you in a way that you wouldn't expect.

1199
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:54,640
Guest: It does, but what really interests me is that the inspiration and the template work that these guys are building off of is very, very clear in a lot of cases, and yet they bring their own really unique and distinct voice to this.

1200
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,585
Guest: So you can say, "Well, there's a kid out there who has never seen Star Wars or who maybe will never see Sailor Moon,".

1201
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:09,257
Guest: and to a degree, they have received at least a part of that because they're part of this conversation, I think, that is ongoing.

1202
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:13,340
Guest: I'm not doing a good job of encapsulating in some kind of rambling.

1203
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,880
Guest: I apologize.

1204
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Guest: But it's very cool to see how all of that stuff that we consider really sacred will appear to the next generation of people.

1205
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,419
Guest: I think that's very, very cool.

1206
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:33,260
Guest: And I'm really happy that we have people like Frederator working on stuff like this because they're doing it in absolutely all the right ways, and I think Wreck-It Ralph is another good example of how to kind of respect the past while creating something for the future.

1207
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,880
Scott: Did you see that episode that the Adventure Time people put onto this other show on YouTube?

1208
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,550
Scott: It was like...

1209
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,120
Guest: Oh, with Cartoon Hangover.

1210
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,399
Guest: I believe it was called like Awesomenauts or something similar?

1211
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,777
Scott: No, it wasn't Awesomenauts, but it was basically like these, you know, what the hell was the name of it?

1212
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,219
Rym: Not Superjail.

1213
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:47,602
Scott: No.

1214
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,479
Guest: Oh, that was something else.

1215
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,580
Rym: Oh, give me... I don't even know what that is.

1216
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,419
Rym: I just keep... YouTube, until recently, has recommended to me nothing but that He-Man, yeah, yeah, yeah Because you've watched that a thousand times.

1217
00:55:58,681 --> 00:55:59,158
Rym: And My Little Pony.

1218
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:02,140
Rym: And lately, it's been recommending to me Superjail.

1219
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,480
Guest: I wasn't impressed with Superjail.

1220
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,220
Guest: I just don't think it was my kind of show.

1221
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,400
Guest: I don't think it was my kind of humor.

1222
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,700
Guest: And I'm not even attempting to make a value judgment.

1223
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,046
Guest: It wasn't for me.

1224
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,278
Rym: It wasn't for me.

1225
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,540
Rym: We have similar tastes lately.

1226
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,718
Rym: I mean, Gravity Falls is rockin' it.

1227
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,700
Guest: Gravity Falls is phenomenal.

1228
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,780
Rym: It's got some flaws, but we didn't show it.

1229
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:18,956
Guest: It does.

1230
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,418
Guest: It does.

1231
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:24,552
Guest: And in the context that nothing is perfect, I think that Gravity Falls is very good, you know?

1232
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,020
Guest: And I think it's just good to see all this really good creative work coming to light.

1233
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,139
Guest: that's also just very popular and making a lot of money.

1234
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,680
Guest: This is what I've always said.

1235
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:41,199
Guest: I've always said that making a good product is very difficult, but once, you know, you've put in the time and you've managed to create something good, pretty much success follows naturally.

1236
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,860
Guest: And so part of what I do at Muse is, you know, we all try to focus on that point.

1237
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:48,600
Guest: We try to make a good game above all else.

1238
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:49,216
Guest: That's it.

1239
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,740
Guest: This is our one objective.

1240
00:56:52,422 --> 00:57:02,840
Guest: And the last game I made, Crevers, wasn't perfect, but I can very easily now isolate the flaws with, you know, the way I ran the project, the flaws with the way I coded the project and the flaws with the way that we created the project.

1241
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,080
Guest: And I think that it was like a really necessary speed bump to a degree on the way to Guns of Icarus.

1242
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,426
Guest: And, you know, I'm just.

1243
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:11,280
Guest: it's making a good product is the most important part.

1244
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,119
Guest: And I really do think people lose sight of that fact.

1245
00:57:13,603 --> 00:57:15,240
Scott: The name of that new show is Bravest Warriors.

1246
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,595
Scott: That's the way this Warriors.

1247
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:16,940
Guest: Thank you.

1248
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,732
Scott: I watched the little thing.

1249
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:18,138
Scott: It was cute.

1250
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,539
Guest: Yeah, it was cute.

1251
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:21,419
Scott: And I mean, one guy looks like Mega Man.

1252
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,160
Guest: I think cartoon, Cartoon Hangover is doing this thing now where you can pitch them anything.

1253
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,052
Scott: Really?

1254
00:57:26,114 --> 00:57:26,339
Guest: Yeah.

1255
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,620
Scott: And I'll pitch you something.

1256
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,524
Guest: They will.

1257
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:30,600
Guest: They will like, man.

1258
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,202
Rym: So get this.

1259
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,620
Rym: I'm kidnapped and put in a dungeon and there's this dragon.

1260
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:36,719
Scott: There's also a ghost.

1261
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,720
Guest: No, the dragon isn't the ghost.

1262
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,580
Guest: You see the ghost incidental to the dragon.

1263
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,020
Guest: The dragon has the juiciest B hole in town.

1264
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:46,940
Guest: However, slimy, scaly stick around.

1265
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:47,642
Scott: He does.

1266
00:57:48,346 --> 00:57:50,900
Guest: You should actually let me close this out with a rap segment.

1267
00:57:51,783 --> 00:58:00,020
Scott: Mark, if you're going to close out with a rap segment, you should preempt by pimping yourself, promoting the things that you would like people to.

1268
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,500
Guest: I'm actually not going to do a rap segment.

1269
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:09,818
Guest: The only rap lyrics I know are both fake rap lyrics and insanely offensive and feature either any other kind.

1270
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:17,300
Rym: Nothing could be worse than when Tycho did that rap about the prostate at Pax prostate rather barely.

1271
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,520
Scott: I remember he did it.

1272
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,900
Rym: I don't remember the way I have it in my like mashup of Pax Prime one year.

1273
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,679
Rym: I'm going to isolate that and make a separate video of it and link to it.

1274
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:25,907
Rym: OK.

1275
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:28,319
Rym: It's an insidious cluster.

1276
00:58:28,523 --> 00:58:29,478
Rym: But anyway, dick ballista.

1277
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,898
Scott: Promote your shamelessly self promote your things, which you've already done.

1278
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:34,780
Scott: some of my name.

1279
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,980
Guest: My name is Conrad Kraling.

1280
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,680
Guest: Right now I'm working at Muse games.

00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,540
Guest: I was one of the senior engineers on guns of Icarus.

1282
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:43,540

00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:48,220
Guest: I am on Johnny wander, Johnny wander.com.

1285
00:58:49,302 --> 00:58:51,220
Guest: You'll probably see a lot more of me in the near future.

1286
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,539
Guest: I have some cool stuff coming up.

1287
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,780
Guest: I'm very excited to share that with you guys.

1288
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,099
Rym: You should all cosplay as Conrad at conventions.

1289
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:58,900
Guest: Yes, that's that's right.

1290
00:58:59,101 --> 00:58:59,900
Guest: It's really hard.

1291
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,056
Guest: You just have to not get a haircut and wear a T-shirt that you stole from somebody two years ago.

1292
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,020
Scott: If you need if you need a reference picture, just buy a bottle of what's that stuff?

1293
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,038
Rym: Oh, that's soju.

1294
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,432
Rym: Soju.

1295
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,300
Guest: Just buy a bottle.

1296
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,140
Guest: Buy a bottle of Chamey Sewell Original and take a look at the guy holding it.

1297
00:59:14,281 --> 00:59:14,490
Guest: That's me.

1298
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:14,956
Guest: Yep.

1299
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:17,959
Guest: Chamey Sewell Original, by the way, is the only soju you should drink the end.

1300
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:19,120
Guest: The only.

1301
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:20,180
Guest: That's the one.

Scott: Well, you endorse it.

1303
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,454
Scott: You're on it.

00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:23,720
Guest: Well, I mean, obviously they pay me the right.

1305
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:23,816
Scott: Yeah.

1306
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,913
Scott: I feel like if William Williams told you to drink St.

1307
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:26,960
Scott: Paint, it's not going to happen.

1308
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:28,657
Rym: It is no worse.

1309
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,800
