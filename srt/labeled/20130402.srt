1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,268
Rym: It's Tuesday, April 2nd, 2013.

2
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:10,470
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:13,159
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,808
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,900
Rym: Tonight, ground floor.

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,219
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,979
Rym: Oh yeah, and I guess we're back from PAX.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,385
Scott: Hooray.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,587
Scott: GeekNights has returned.

10
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,479
Scott: We are not a dead podcast like all those before us.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,544
Rym: Mostly returned.

12
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,720
Rym: I got back from PAX and went to work and everything was fine for like two days.

13
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:40,286
Rym: And then I got sick.

14
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:43,218
Rym: And it wasn't just the normal like, "Oh, I'm sick after a

15
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:43,539
Rym: con.".

16
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,140
Rym: I had influenza, like an actual flu.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,180
Scott: Did you go to a doctor?

18
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,540
Rym: No, because there's no point.

19
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:57,240
Rym: Unless they were going to give me a tube or something, there's nothing to do for a flu unless you're dying of it.

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,945
Rym: I wasn't dying.

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:58,872
Rym: I just had 103 fever.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,999
Scott: That sounds like dying.

23
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:03,340
Rym: I've had worse fevers.

24
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:08,280
Rym: This was easily the sickest I've been in about a decade.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,740
Rym: And today is the first day I'm not horribly ill.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,800
Rym: So I brought Scott over into the plague house to hopefully catch some plague and experience this the way I did.

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,000
Scott: I did call in sick today so that I could do laundry and play X-Com.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,320
Rym: It would thus be ironic if you actually got sick.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Scott: It would be indeed, but that's okay.

30
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:29,608
Scott: No, it's not.

31
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,579
Scott: I don't want to get sick.

32
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:34,477
Rym: I hope none of your coworkers listen to this like, "I thought Scott called in

33
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:34,859
Rym: sick.".

34
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:35,467
Scott: Whatever.

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,098
Scott: They don't give a shit.

36
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,620
Scott: I haven't been sick from work in like forever.

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,789
Scott: I have five sick days.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,820
Scott: They reset in July.

39
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,237
Scott: I'm going to use them.

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,666
Scott: I'll probably use another one.

41
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,380
Scott: It's like go biking in June or something.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,020
Rym: See guys, this is why if you're on a company, you're better off just giving your employees unlimited sick days.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,458
Scott: That's right.

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,960
Rym: They don't feel obligated to use up the sick days you give them.

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,580
Scott: If I had unlimited sick days, I would have gone to work today because you don't want to be caught abusing the infinite sick day policy.

46
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,879
Scott: But if you have a set number, it's like, "Well, that's how many days I'm going to be sick minimum.

47
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:11,959
Scott: If I'm legitimately sick longer than that, then oh well, I'm going to get a doctor's

48
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:12,140
Scott: note.".

49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,260
Rym: No, then I'm coming to work anyway.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,520
Scott: Also that and getting all the other employees sick and ruining your company.

51
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,238
Rym: I guess you got nothing else to say?

52
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,280
Scott: Not until we get started.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,185
Rym: We're started.

54
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:26,436
Rym: It's live.

55
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:26,940
Rym: We're back.

56
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:27,924
Scott: Okay, sure.

57
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:31,500
Scott: You want to do some news, I guess?

58
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,344
Rym: I don't know.

59
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,079
Rym: I don't really have any news except for PAX.

60
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,858
Scott: What about PAX that we went to?

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,860
Rym: PAX is pretty great.

62
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,543
Scott: It was PAX East 2013.

63
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,040
Scott: More importantly.

64
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:42,160
Rym: Our ninth PAX?

65
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,050
Rym: It was our 22nd panel out of PAX.

66
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,018
Scott: Okay.

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,280
Rym: Which was kind of, we've done more PAX panels.

68
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,859
Scott: How have we done 22 panels in nine PAXs?

69
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,540
Rym: Because we used to do three panels per PAX for several PAXs in a row.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,860
Scott: All right, now we're doing one.

71
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,178
Scott: Oh, we did two this time.

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,640
Rym: We did two, but they were in the little theater.

73
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,940
Scott: The tabletop theater that needs to be renamed desperately.

74
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,508
Rym: Kobold.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,580
Scott: We're thinking Kobold Theater, but it might be something else.

76
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,780
Rym: I can't come up with a name better than Kobold Theater.

77
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,238
Rym: But yeah, we got to experience PAX from a very different perspective too.

78
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,660
Rym: Many of you know because we tweeted about it and talked about it, but we actually were enforcers this year.

79
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:22,600
Rym: Me, Scott, and Emily.

80
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,740
Rym: We were on the other side.

81
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,079
Scott: Emily was an enforcer last year.

82
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:26,639
Rym: She was.

83
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,280
Rym: She was a veteran.

84
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,360
Rym: She has an extra pin beyond what I have.

85
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:29,731
Scott: Oh no.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,820
Rym: But we've seen the inner secrets of the enforcers and we can reveal all their secrets to you now.

87
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,760
Scott: All the non-really exciting secrets.

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,738
Rym: You know what the secrets are?

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,419
Rym: They're smart people who are allowed to act with their smartness and they just do the right thing to make PAX happen.

90
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:46,498
Rym: That's it.

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,280
Rym: That's the secret.

92
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,939
Scott: All staff confident.

93
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:49,677
Scott: The end.

94
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:50,890
Scott: Well, staff 99% confident.

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Rym: I did not meet an incompetent enforcer.

96
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,620
Scott: No, I did not meet an incompetent enforcer, but there were people who were mostly confident, but had some amount of incompetence to them.

97
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,980
Rym: I believe all people have some amount of incompetence.

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,738
Scott: That's what I said.

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,379
Rym: I lost an episode of GeekNights to Ether one time.

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,349
Scott: That's why I said 99% confident.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,940
Rym: You apparently didn't realize that you can change volumes and recordings of audio.

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,407
Scott: I do.

103
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:15,737
Scott: I'm just too lazy to do so.

104
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,459
Rym: But yeah, PAX was the same as PAX always is.

105
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,519
Rym: The expo hall was bigger.

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
Rym: Tabletop seemed smaller, but it was, it appears that it was actually slightly bigger.

107
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:42,974
Scott: Well, it's hard to tell, but they changed the shape of it and we don't, I didn't count the chairs, so there's no way to know, but at least, uh, whether it was bigger or smaller, it was, there was always somewhere to sit at least, you know, even when it was super full, there was like a chair here and a chair

108
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:43,377
Rym: there.

109
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:44,299
Scott: Not like that.

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,952
Scott: And you know, a year ago it was 100% full.

111
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,000
Scott: You cannot sit in there.

112
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,600
Scott: You have to go to extra tabletop.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Rym: But the thing is last year there was extra tabletop.

114
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,900
Scott: And this year there was not.

115
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:04,599
Rym: And now that extra tabletop was gone and yet regular tabletop was not full the whole time, either there was more space in tabletop, which I don't think there actually was.

116
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,340
Rym: Two, there was more space elsewhere in the con that people were tabletop gaming.

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,098
Scott: Seemed about the same.

118
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,060
Rym: Three, less people were tabletop.

119
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,477
Scott: I think that might be somewhat true.

120
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,740
Scott: Uh, let me, let me tell you a story, right?

121
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:29,320
Scott: So I'm enforcing and I'm standing in the area between the expo hall and the tabletop sort of near the, uh, the line for, you know, swag bags and such, right?

122
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:29,840
Scott: Oh yeah.

123
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,596
Scott: There's an old dude, middle aged dude, maybe 40, 50 something.

124
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,778
Scott: And his son who is way young listeners.

125
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,799
Rym: I just want to let you know, this is a story that you're going to be amazed by.

126
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:39,837
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,019
Scott: Maybe eight, nine years old, something like that.

128
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:42,357
Scott: Right.

129
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Scott: And you know, the guy, you know, I'm standing there and what's happening in this area is the Mike and Jerry autograph signing.

130
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,892
Scott: Right.

131
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,617
Scott: And there's a line.

132
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,060
Scott: This dude asked me, Hey, what's his line for it?

133
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,720
Scott: I'm like, Oh, Mike and Jerry autograph signing, you know, and pin trading also.

134
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,219
Scott: Right.

135
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,519
Scott: And he's like, who are they?

136
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,540
Scott: And I'm like, you know, that's understandable.

137
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:02,840
Scott: Right.

138
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,180
Scott: Not everyone that comes to PAX knows about penny arcade.

139
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,633
Scott: Right.

140
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,440
Scott: Not everyone knows who Mike and Jerry are.

141
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,058
Scott: And I'm like, Oh, well.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,274
Scott: Yeah.

143
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,059
Rym: I mean, how many people go to anime cons and don't know who anime is?

144
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Scott: Right.

145
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,000
Scott: Of course.

146
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,058
Scott: So I'm like, Oh, well, you know, it's the penny arcade expo.

147
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:20,200
Scott: Uh, these guys, you know, are the reason we're here.

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,780
Scott: They made a web comic called penny arcade about, you know, 10 plus years ago.

149
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:24,140
Scott: Right.

150
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,400
Scott: And you know, from that web comic, they have created this convention, which is in three places in the world every year.

151
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,120
Scott: And you know, you're at it right now.

152
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:33,900
Scott: Welcome to our penny arcade.

153
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,320
Scott: Right.

154
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:41,760
Scott: And he's like, first of all, I don't remember the, I'm not going to exactly remember every word that was said, but here's the gist.

155
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Scott: Number one, uh, he didn't realize that packs was penny arcade expo.

156
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,319
Scott: It took him like a few minutes to get that.

157
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,979
Scott: Right.

158
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:53,520
Scott: Uh, he was like, Oh, packs penny arcade expo.

159
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
Scott: He didn't realize they were the same thing.

160
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,580
Scott: He thought right that he was here with his kid for packs.

161
00:06:59,620 --> 00:06:59,690
Scott: Yes.

162
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:07,640
Scott: He thought the expo hall was packs physically speaking, and he thought that all this stuff going on behind that wall was another convention.

163
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,160
Scott: Now when I said penny arcade expo, he thought I was talking about something that wasn't packs that was in the rest of the convention center.

164
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,879
Scott: That wasn't the expo hall.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,060
Scott: Now,

166
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:32,219
Rym: while that seems crazy in retrospect, thinking about it a little bit, and you can understand why normal people would think that because normal people who don't go to a lot of conventions or who only go to like New York comic con, San Diego, comic con, dragon con, things like that.

167
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:37,060
Rym: They expect conventions to pretty much be a gigantic expo hall and little else.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,352
Rym: Right.

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,300
Scott: It's like you go to the auto show, it's one big room and that's it.

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,640
Scott: So this guy bought tickets to packs, came to PAX East.

171
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,180
Scott: And if you think about it, you come to PAX East, there's an info booth.

172
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:52,619
Scott: You go in the front door and there's the expo hall and there's walls and weird hallways to go to anything else.

173
00:07:53,581 --> 00:08:04,518
Scott: And you don't get your program and all that stuff that gives you information about the other or the maps or anything unless you go beyond the expo hall to the baggy area behind it where the guy was.

174
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:05,220
Scott: All right.

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
Scott: So I pointed him obviously to go get a program.

176
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:08,000
Scott: Right.

177
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:14,800
Scott: And I told him, yeah, this entire building, even these hallways on the side that you don't see and in the back is all packs.

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,219
Scott: You have a badge to all of this.

179
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,198
Scott: You're missing 90 percent of what's going on if you only stay in that room, et cetera.

180
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,720
Scott: But, you know, I was talking about how, yeah, Penny Arcade is it's a webcomic.

181
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,980
Scott: And the last thing the guy was like, yeah, I've never heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Scott: I'm like, oh, well, when you go home, you know, search for Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

183
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,977
Scott: And he's like, oh, maybe my kid has heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic.

184
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,919
Scott: So I'm like, I'm going to go to the kid and I'm like, hey, have you heard of the webcomic Penny Arcade?

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,900
Scott: And he says, I don't know, apparently, you know, he was failing at the English comprehension.

186
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,258
Rym: Little kids are like that.

187
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,540
Scott: Right.

188
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,120
Scott: But he was like, he said to me, these are the exact words is the webcomic homestuck.

189
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,619
Scott: So few words to a yes or no question of have you heard of Penny Arcade, the webcomic?

190
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,720
Scott: He said, is that homestuck?

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:16,099
Rym: Well, no, Penny Arcade is so few words, but have so adequately expressed the youth of America coming up into this world as is that homestuck?

192
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:20,720
Scott: Yeah, it's like, no, Penny Arcade is not homestuck.

193
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Scott: The letter A is not the letter B. Apples are not oranges.

194
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,432
Rym: I feel like we could turn that back into some sort of old, you know, the old, is this Battletoads memes?

195
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,719
Rym: Like, is this homestuck?

196
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:32,420
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:38,460
Scott: I asked Robert Koo, you know, if there was a way that we can better serve these people and he said he didn't seem too worried about it.

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,540
Scott: He's like, yeah, people like that come to the convention, whatever.

199
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:41,699
Scott: We have maps.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,534
Scott: It's up to them.

201
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,894
Scott: And I was like, and the thing is, you can't hand out.

202
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,879
Scott: the one thing you could think of would be to hand out the programs in the front.

203
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:50,659
Scott: But there's nowhere to do that.

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,397
Scott: There's no space.

205
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:51,710
Rym: Yep.

206
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,760
Rym: There's not enough space to line people up inside.

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,260
Scott: And I don't think you could put the X ball hall.

208
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,020
Scott: You could put the Q room closer to the front of the con and move the X ball hall back.

209
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:01,897
Scott: Right.

210
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,411
Scott: But then that sort of ruins that whole effect of looking in the window and seeing the X ball.

211
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,038
Scott: I don't know.

212
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,060
Rym: I don't think there's any good way around it.

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Rym: But all that really does is solidify that point that I was talking about.

214
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,019
Scott: If you go to PAX Prime, all right, that shit's a maze.

215
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Rym: We've talked about this over and over, over again on Geek Notes.

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,560
Rym: There are just people who are really into something who somehow are so off the radar.

217
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:27,759
Rym: It's like they have a hobby that they've never Googled for.

218
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,160
Rym: They've never looked up on the Internet with any other search engine.

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,636
Scott: They're going to this PAX thing, but they didn't bother to look up anything about this thing they're going to.

220
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,480
Rym: They seem to know it's about video games.

221
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:43,320
Rym: They somehow bought tickets online in advance, despite the fact that it sold out pretty quick.

222
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:43,913
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,780
Scott: They somehow got to go to it.

224
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,340
Scott: Maybe they read about it in the Boston newspaper or something.

225
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:49,194
Scott: I don't know.

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:58,540
Rym: But just how there are so many nerds who are really nerdy about something yet seem to just never take it upon themselves to learn more about the thing.

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,136
Scott: Whatever.

228
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,260
Rym: Maybe we just need to brand all those things as home stock.

229
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,519
Scott: So the only other thing I want to say about PAX, you know, PAX is like the home stock of video games.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,100
Scott: Sure.

231
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:12,940
Scott: Is in the X, you know, things I saw at PAX that were cool.

232
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,360
Scott: I was enforcing a lot and doing panels a lot, so I didn't see too many cool things.

233
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:16,876
Rym: Yeah.

234
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,060
Rym: I walked through the expo hall once on my own because I never met up with you when you were walking through.

235
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,579
Scott: And I told you I was with at the only booth in the back right with George and you didn't.

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,920
Rym: I was walking over there.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,980
Rym: And then by the time I got there, you guys, I waited there for like five, 10 minutes.

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,596
Scott: You didn't show up.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:40,659
Scott: Anyway, I walked around that expo hall and the one thing the expo hall that really stood out that I remember that was that I'm going to spend money for for sure is this game called Shovel Knight.

240
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:45,540
Scott: So Shovel Knight, I think, is coming out for PC, might be coming out for some other things.

241
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,536
Scott: You can look it up online, see videos of it.

242
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:58,259
Scott: Basically, it is a game that combines all the greatest aspects of all these games that I have already know and love.

243
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,920
Scott: So you're a knight and you have a shovel as your weapon, right?

244
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:02,897
Scott: You can dig with it.

245
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:07,400
Scott: So it's a 2D platform game that looks like an NES game.

246
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:10,320
Scott: And the level design is very much like Megaman.

247
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,080
Scott: And there are many Megaman-esque enemies in it.

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,860
Scott: So you're playing a lot like Megaman.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,300
Scott: You can jump and you can shovel.

250
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:20,020
Rym: But the way your powers are, you're a little also like a Scrooge McDuck.

251
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,998
Scott: Well, OK, so there's a little bit of Scrooge McDuck in the things you can do with the shovel.

252
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,740
Scott: For example, you can down stab onto a guy to bounce off of him like a Scrooge McDuck.

253
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:34,283
Scott: You can also down stab like a Zelda, like a link from Zelda 2.

254
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:39,880
Scott: You can also use the shovel to reflect shots back at enemies, sort of like a Zelda 2 link.

255
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,660
Scott: You can also press up and attack to use a secondary weapon like a Castlevania.

256
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:52,820
Scott: So it's like you have secrets in the levels like a Kirby's adventure.

257
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,679
Scott: Wait, so Scott, it's a typical 8-bit throwback game, but it's got all those aspects from all those things.

258
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,100
Rym: It's got Scott's best aspects.

259
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:11,700
Scott: All the best aspects from the best games combined into one plus, right, the controls and the designs and the arts were all super perfect.

260
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,300
Scott: Usually a lot of these games come out and they're a little flimsy in one way or another.

261
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:16,800
Scott: This game wasn't even out yet.

262
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,660
Scott: It was just like PAX demo and already the controls were like dead on.

263
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,359
Scott: It was so good.

264
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,238
Rym: How long did you play it?

265
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,019
Scott: For like five minutes, ten minutes, something like that.

266
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,500
Scott: Enough to like beat a whole level.

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,075
Rym: I'll believe it.

268
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:27,594
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:32,120
Scott: So when you see Shovel Knight hitting Steam, buy that shit.

270
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:41,779
Rym: I was pretty excited about, not that I knew about this game, but I kind of just ignored it like it was in the file of games I planned to play at some point, but that Don't Starve that people were talking about.

271
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Scott: I've heard of that.

272
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,160
Rym: I looked at it and it looked cool.

273
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,580
Scott: What's it about?

274
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,720
Rym: You really don't know anything about it?

275
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,158
Scott: I've heard there's a game called Don't Starve.

276
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Scott: So the deal is... Is it a scary game I think?

277
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Rym: You're a dude by yourself in a world and you have to not starve.

278
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,200
Rym: So, I don't know, start fucking farming before you die.

279
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,040
Scott: Okay.

280
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Rym: Grab some, you know, think of it as like an adventure game with a little bit of this sort of Minecraft, like go and get things to do things with and build your little settlement.

281
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:14,277
Rym: It sounds really fun and now that I've actually seen it and poked at it a little bit, it looks really fun too.

282
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,000
Rym: So I think I'm going to move it up in my queue.

283
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:16,446
Scott: Mmm.

284
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,866
Scott: Bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo, bargo.

285
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:29,250
Rym: But the game I'm the most excited about that I saw that was new to me is the DuckTales remake.

286
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,910
Scott: Oh yeah, it was new to everybody.

287
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:38,730
Rym: Because DuckTales, what's funny is just before PAX, I was showing some people who'd never heard of it, the DuckTales NES game in our apartment.

288
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,069
Scott: Just before PAX, I happened to have been playing it on my NES emulator on my DS before going to bed.

289
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,710
Scott: And that game is balls hard.

290
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,070
Rym: Serendipity, that game is, you know, I beat it as a kid many times.

291
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,129
Scott: Game is balls hard.

292
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,830
Rym: I would be hard pressed to beat it today.

293
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,169
Scott: I was dying in like level two.

294
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,047
Scott: I was just like, ah.

295
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,887
Rym: Wait, level two.

296
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,944
Rym: Which, what order do you do?

297
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:57,770
Rym: the levels in, Scott?

298
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,510
Rym: It's like Mega Man.

299
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,290
Rym: It's very important.

300
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,810
Scott: Well, I mean the first level, you don't have a choice, right?

301
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,019
Scott: No.

302
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,110
Scott: It's just the side scrolly forest level with the monkeys.

303
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:05,421
Scott: What?

304
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:05,675
Rym: No.

305
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,650
Rym: You can pick whatever level you want.

306
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,498
Scott: What?

307
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,750
Scott: I pushed start and I was in that monkey level.

308
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,589
Rym: That is not how that game works.

309
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,430
Scott: I gotta go back and check.

310
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,393
Rym: You just pick a place and go to, are you sure you're not referring to DuckTales 2?

311
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:20,390
Scott: Maybe I played the wrong one.

312
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,870
Scott: I was definitely screwed to McDuck using the pogo stick cane.

313
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,010
Scott: Okay, so apparently I just pushed start and went to the Amazon directly.

314
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,390
Rym: Scott, that game is burned into my memory.

315
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:29,965
Scott: Okay.

316
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,405
Scott: But I didn't own it as a kid.

317
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,029
Scott: I only played it like a few times.

318
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:33,670
Scott: I owned it.

319
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,369
Scott: At some other people's houses.

320
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:42,930
Rym: It amazes me that it's one of those games I could beat pretty handily as a kid that I have some surprising difficulty with re-beating today.

321
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,569
Scott: Yeah, Mega Man 2 I can beat today, but.

322
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:45,730
Rym: I don't know.

323
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,073
Rym: When is the last time you beat Mega Man 2?

324
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,470
Scott: You wanna play right now?

325
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:50,086
Rym: Let's see.

326
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:53,269
Rym: Which one was Mega Man 2 or Bionic Commando first?

327
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,609
Scott: Bionic Commando 2 I think is a shorter game, right?

328
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,183
Scott: I mean.

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:06,809
Scott: Let's go see what the top scores are for speed runs with non-assisted for both those games and we can see if they're roughly the same speed game.

330
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,249
Rym: That'll be our omega-thon.

331
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,719
Scott: And what we can do is, right, we can both do it.

332
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:20,350
Scott: and then instead of just saying who is faster, we say who had a greater percentage overage versus the world record, right?

333
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:33,649
Scott: So if I was 50% slower than the best at Mega Man 2, and you were 60% slower than the best at Bionic Commando, then, right, you're better at Bionic Commando than I am at Mega Man 2, That could be interesting.

334
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:36,630
Rym: But yeah, otherwise, I mean, PAX was PAX.

335
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,130
Rym: The concerts were the concerts.

336
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,987
Rym: There was a band, a new band at PAX that I actually wanted to see.

337
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,306
Rym: that I ended up not going to see.

338
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:52,350
Rym: I was who, when they fight, do something about fighting, I already forgot because everyone I talked to who saw them said that they weren't actually that good.

339
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,950
Rym: So I'm kind of glad I didn't bother.

340
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Rym: They were supposed to be a Final Fantasy themed equivalent of the Proto Man.

341
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:06,970
Rym: That's how they were described by many people to me with the added bonus of really good rock ballad vocals.

342
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,169
Rym: It turns out that's not exactly what they are.

343
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,890
Rym: And everyone I talked to who told me to listen to them told me never mind.

344
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,868
Scott: Was it a Friday night concert or a Saturday night?

345
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,909
Scott: Friday night.

346
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:19,329
Scott: Those who fight.

347
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:19,990
Rym: Those who fight.

348
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:21,589
Rym: So I did not hear them.

349
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,150
Rym: I did not see them perform.

350
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:27,430
Rym: But everyone who told me to see them later told me never mind.

351
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:28,626
Scott: Okay.

352
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,850
Rym: But I mean, everything else was the same.

353
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
Rym: I mean, the concert was full.

354
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:33,286
Scott: Sure.

355
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,428
Scott: Magfest, though.

356
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,129
Scott: Machine supremacy.

357
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,930
Rym: That's a whole different ballgame.

358
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,030
Scott: What are you going to do?

359
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:44,510
Rym: I wonder if there's going to be trouble at Magfest with that big a concert there.

360
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,390
Rym: They don't have that big a venue for the concert.

361
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,330
Scott: It's not going to be that big.

362
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,270
Scott: It's going to be as big as any of the biggest concerts at Magfest.

363
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,310
Rym: But they've never toured in the US ever, have they?

364
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,810
Scott: You think a whole, you think a zillion people are going to suddenly show up at Magfest for machine supremacy?

365
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,510
Scott: Who have never gone to Magfest before?

366
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,390
Rym: A ticket to Magfest is not really out of line with a ticket to a major stadium concert.

367
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:04,717
Scott: No.

368
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,189
Scott: But it's not, they're not a major stadium group.

369
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:08,869
Rym: You never know.

370
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,349
Scott: You think there's that many people in the US that are going to go all the way to DC and get a hotel room just to see them?

371
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,030
Scott: They might.

372
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:16,370
Scott: They're not that popular.

373
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,309
Rym: We'll find out.

374
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,229
Rym: I mean, there were a lot of people who were at that one Otakon just to see Larkon CL.

375
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,370
Scott: Larkon CL is a lot bigger than machine supremacy.

376
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,169
Rym: True, but how big are they in America?

377
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,209
Rym: I mean, I'm not counting the crazy people who flew from Japan to see them here.

378
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:32,550
Scott: Anyway, we'll see.

379
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:39,310
Rym: But yeah, the only bad part of PAX, it was really sad, is the Omegathon finale for the first time.

380
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,150
Scott: I missed it for the first time.

381
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,190
Scott: That's really sad.

382
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,550
Rym: So it was great at first because it turned out it was Half-Life 1 ricochet.

383
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,190
Scott: Sure.

384
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:51,989
Scott: That would have been a great game for...

385
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:52,847
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,650
Rym: So Scott couldn't see the Omegathon finale because he was enforcing and I was enforcing.

387
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:58,990
Rym: but I was enforcing main theater.

388
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,348
Rym: I was like doing security at the front of the room.

389
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:02,217
Scott: So...

390
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:14,721
Rym: So I'm in there doing my thing, getting the crowd all situated, and our friend Ro walks up to me and says, "So I know that you're thinking, how are we gonna prank Scott because he's not

391
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:14,946
Rym: here?".

392
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,347
Scott: I even texted Ro, "Don't lie to

393
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:17,528
Scott: me.".

394
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,261
Rym: And I looked at her and said, "I've been trying to come up with the perfect game to lie to him for the last

395
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:23,665
Rym: hour.".

396
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:30,367
Rym: And then we collaborated and we agreed that we came up with many possible ideas and we threw them all out.

397
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,070
Scott: But what were some of your ideas?

398
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,680
Rym: So Ro's first idea was NS2 and I was like, "No, that'd be way too obvious.

399
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,332
Scott: It'd be too

400
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:43,598
Scott: hard.".

401
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,380
Scott: That couldn't be an Omegathon finale game.

402
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,279
Rym: Unless they'd primed them and taught them how to play ahead of time and set up teams.

403
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,980
Scott: That would have been so boring, not suspenseful, not exciting, too hard to play.

404
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,480
Scott: I would not believe that for a second.

405
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:04,978
Rym: And then we debated a little more and we tried to come up with some old NES game or something and Ro was like, "You know, Outlaw would be perfect, but it's only two

406
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:05,360
Rym: player.".

407
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,878
Scott: That's right.

408
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,059
Rym: And then eventually we realized...

409
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,240
Scott: You could have easily fooled me at PAX Prime by saying Outlaw, easily.

410
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:13,118
Scott: I would believe that.

411
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,320
Scott: In fact, that should be the PAX Prime Omegathon finale.

412
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,539
Rym: You know, it'd be great if someday you're enforcing at Prime and you miss the Omegathon finale and it is Outlaw and then you don't believe us.

413
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,558
Scott: Nah, then fuck me.

414
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,698
Rym: So eventually we realized that Half-Life 1 Ricochet is the best one because...

415
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:30,500
Scott: It did have a team mode.

416
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:31,820
Rym: It does have team mode.

417
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
Rym: It's quick and easy to learn, easy to spectate.

418
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,320
Scott: It would have been great for spectating with using HLTV as people were falling off to their desks and getting decapitated and getting the triple shot.

419
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,080
Rym: It's the kind of game that someone with no experience could play very well.

420
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Scott: As long as you know how to control an FPS with the mouse and keyboard, basically, you can play that game because there's only two attack buttons and that's it.

421
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,318
Scott: There's no jump.

422
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,719
Scott: You just... You guess you can jump, but you don't want to.

423
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
Rym: Players would learn together.

424
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:00,460
Rym: Everything would work out.

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,179
Rym: It'd be a perfect game.

426
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,000
Rym: Also, it's just weird enough to where it would be like the crazy Omegathon finale.

427
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,480
Rym: And of course, Ricochet is very near and dear to me and Scott's hearts.

428
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,500
Scott: It would make a great Omegathon finale at either Omegathon.

429
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,260
Scott: Just a straight up duel.

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,840
Scott: They could do best of five or whatever and be awesome.

431
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:27,980
Rym: So what we agreed to do, we coordinated this shit, is that we were going to text Scott simultaneously when they actually announced it.

432
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,179
Rym: That way we would be in sync.

433
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:31,198
Scott: You were in sync.

434
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,940
Rym: And then we each wanted to tweet or text or tweet at him a little bit later some details from the game to see how long we could keep it going.

435
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:47,919
Rym: And I think my favorite moment was I texted you and I said, "Man, no one's gotten a head shot yet.

436
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,790
Rym: Triple shot is

437
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:49,235
Rym: ruling.".

438
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,393
Rym: And you responded something like, "Well,

439
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:52,078
Rym: obviously.".

440
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:53,160
Scott: Yeah, right?

441
00:21:53,581 --> 00:22:01,000
Scott: It takes less skill to hit someone with a triple shot, especially with the bouncing off the walls, that's going to get some hits from people who aren't paying attention in all directions.

442
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,319
Scott: And if you've never played before, you probably don't know about the right-click chainsaw shot and it's hard to hit with even if you know how to use it.

443
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,100
Rym: So I was very proud of the horrible prank we played on Scott.

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,620
Scott: It fooled me for about a minute because the other enforcers in my area got correct information from other people.

445
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,057
Rym: Well, it was a little longer than a minute because I have the timeline of the text to and from.

446
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,116
Scott: It was a matter of minutes and I was just like...

447
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,420
Rym: Minutes, but not minutes.

448
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,940
Scott: And I was also not trusting.

449
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,372
Scott: I was only like 75% fooled, not 100% fooled.

450
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,378
Scott: If I was 100% fooled, why would I have been asking other enforcers to confirm, right?

451
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,940
Rym: Maybe you weren't.

452
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,114
Rym: Maybe you were just like, "Oh man,

453
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:41,398
Rym: ricochet.".

454
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:50,292
Scott: It was indeed though very plausible and a very good choice, which is why I was like, "Oh, I'm going with it until I had to ask

455
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:50,696
Scott: somebody.".

456
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,118
Rym: I was proud of that.

457
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:58,160
Rym: We did our due diligence in pranking, but the actual omega-thon was Space Team.

458
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,440
Rym: Now Space Team actually was a pretty good omega-thon, like it was a good idea.

459
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,196
Scott: It could be, yeah.

460
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:09,920
Rym: When it worked, it was actually really funny to watch, especially the way they did it.

461
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,360
Scott: How did they get the video on the screens?

462
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Rym: They had people holding HD cameras over everyone's heads like this.

463
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,540
Scott: They didn't use the video out from iPhones?

464
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:17,479
Rym: Uh, no.

465
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,239
Scott: That sucks.

466
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,200
Rym: They talked about different ways to do it.

467
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:24,340
Scott: If they're going to spend money, they could have gotten those particular Android phones.

468
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,160
Scott: It's on Android, right?

469
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,860
Scott: Or is it iPhone only?

470
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,820
Rym: I think it's iPhone only.

471
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,060
Scott: Well, iPhone, you could get the video out cable, right?

472
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Rym: That wouldn't have worked out so well.

473
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:31,720
Scott: You could get it.

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,197
Scott: No, no.

475
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:43,818
Rym: Seeing them actually touching the screens kind of matters to the drama and also seeing them doing the things like flip it over, turn, twist it around, all that stuff, shake it.

476
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,743
Scott: Mmm.

477
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:45,871
Rym: Mmm.

478
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,400
Rym: So they had HD cameras like over everyone's shoulders and the two omega knots had to pick teammates from the Penny Arcade crew.

479
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,499
Scott: See, I'm not a fan of this.

480
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,349
Scott: This is scenes who have been happening in recent.

481
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,719
Scott: omega thons where, you know, it's the omega thon at PAX East is two versus two.

482
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:03,040
Scott: Find a game that's two versus two.

483
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,660
Scott: If it's four versus four and you've got to like pick people for your team now, whether you go to Germany or not, it doesn't lie solely in your and your partner's hands.

484
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,134
Scott: It lies in the hands of these other people that don't get to.

485
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:15,699
Scott: don't care because they don't get to go to Germany if they win or lose.

486
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,378
Scott: I mean, now they're not going to try to win.

487
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,070
Scott: But still, it should it should always be.

488
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,300
Scott: if you want to make it two versus two, make it a two versus two game.

489
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:23,920
Scott: End of story.

490
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,000
Rym: Now, see, I disagree.

491
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,360
Scott: Crokinole was so perfect.

492
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,660
Rym: I disagree because the primary purpose of the omega seems to be to entertain the crowd.

493
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,940
Scott: Yeah, that is definitely very important to the omega.

494
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,880
Scott: The game must entertain the crowd.

495
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,678
Scott: However, also, you cannot forget that those people up there are battling for a significant prize.

496
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,175
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,920
Rym: But at the same time, what's funny is that I see well.

498
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,940
Rym: So I was actually at the Jenga, the pre-Omegathon finale, and that was great to watch.

499
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,820
Scott: They've done that before.

500
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:52,780
Scott: But yeah, it's always every year.

501
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,600
Rym: They seem to add a complication like this year.

502
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,699
Rym: They taped the people together in these really awkward ways and then made him do it.

503
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:04,298
Rym: And it got to the point where one of the teams like they were stuck, they touched a piece of the head to pull it.

504
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,720
Rym: But there is no way they could pull it without knocking the whole thing down.

505
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,399
Rym: But they had unlimited time, so they kept going for it.

506
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,098
Rym: And they kept going for it.

507
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,978
Rym: And he's like, "Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika, Wika,

508
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:18,219
Rym: Wika.".

509
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,420
Rym: This goes on for several minutes.

510
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,060
Scott: This is the giant Jenga set, too, right?

511
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,797
Scott: Giant Jenga.

512
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,900
Rym: And Mike's like, "Come on, you can do it.

513
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,609
Rym: The crowd's with

514
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:25,751
Rym: you.".

515
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,899
Rym: And then as it keeps going on, eventually the crowd...

516
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:42,220
Scott: If I touched a piece that I knew is impossible to remove from the Jenga, but was therefore forced to remove that piece, losing the Jenga, instead of trying to remove the piece, well, first I would give it a minimum effort to see if there was maybe a possibility.

517
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:42,760
Scott: Rage quit?

518
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,080
Scott: As soon as there was no possibility, I would just like jump into the Jenga or kick it or dive in first into it.

519
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,659
Rym: I've never seen the Jengas until now.

520
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,120
Rym: There's a long tradition of the losing team being one who actually does exactly that.

521
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:56,560
Rym: Losing style.

522
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,954
Rym: But no, they went for it.

523
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,695
Scott: Body check it.

524
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,008
Rym: They started losing the crowd, and at one point, the crowd just starts chanting, "Physics, physics,

525
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:05,819
Rym: physics."

526
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:09,460
Rym: And then they started stomping their feet to try to make it just fall on its own.

527
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:11,539
Rym: It was pretty great.

528
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,680
Scott: That's pretty great.

529
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,318
Rym: A bunch of people in the audience coordinated and went, "One, two, three," and all jumped at the same time.

530
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:17,813
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:25,499
Scott: They should do that not just to get those people to lose, but they should do that when the winners are up there doing their normal Jenga.

532
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:26,520
Scott: It's no good.

533
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,819
Scott: Just everyone constantly jump up and down.

534
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,899
Rym: That might be what happened during the Omegathon finale, for all we know.

535
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:32,379
Rym: Hey.

536
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,220
Rym: Could just be a troller.

537
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:33,716
Scott: Sure.

538
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,880
Rym: But the funny part was Mike was pretty much on with the quips the entire time, and at one point, he's like, "You know, guys, you could just buy a ticket to Germany.

539
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:43,784
Rym: Might be

540
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:44,233
Rym: faster.".

541
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,600
Scott: See, those guys have been practicing that quipery for basically over a decade.

542
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,020
Rym: Well, it shows now, like in Strip Search.

543
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,058
Scott: Have you been watching Strip Search?

544
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,020
Rym: Oh my God.

545
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,838
Rym: The thing is- Mike and Jerry, I salute you.

546
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,371
Scott: Yeah.

547
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,360
Scott: It's like artists, 30 minutes is less time than what you have.

548
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,893
Scott: You have 40 minutes.

549
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:14,323
Scott: But it's like they come up with a joke like that, and that's Mike's favorite thing to do is come up with a clever joke and reuse that joke over and over again, maybe tweaking it slightly.

550
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:17,520
Scott: so, the mega time, mega tea, mega toe, over and over again.

551
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,336
Scott: That's his favorite thing.

552
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,145
Scott: There's even a podcast.

553
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:34,380
Scott: once, like a few years ago, where he did some word joke, and he did the word joke again with a different word, but it's the same joke, and he said, "I think, I remember, yeah, when I find a joke like that, I just latch onto it, and it's never unfunny.

554
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,445
Scott: You just keep using it over and over

555
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:35,908
Scott: again.".

556
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:53,139
Rym: So anyway, the Omegathon finale, Space Team, it was going to work out fine, and the first round went great, and then there were some network issues, and then there kept being network issues, and eventually, they just had to call it, and all the Omeganauts get to go to Germany.

557
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,238
Scott: Who's going to pay for that?

558
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,380
Rym: Penny Arcade?

559
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:55,977
Scott: Sure.

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,538
Rym: They got money.

561
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:57,760
Rym: Okay.

562
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:11,480
Rym: What's sad is that it was super exciting up to that point, like they finally got a good run in, like one team got all the way to like the sixth or eighth, I forget what zone they got to, and the game didn't crash, they died legit.

563
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:16,719
Rym: So the other team had to either get past them or it was over.

564
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:25,819
Rym: So the other team goes, and we're already at the end now, the other team gets to the same zone they were in, and then the game breaks.

565
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,640
Rym: So you might think, and I thought this at first too, maybe they didn't test it fully.

566
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,180
Rym: Maybe they didn't test it with everyone in the room.

567
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:44,079
Rym: I have verified with everyone who knows, they tested this more than any of us could have dreamed of testing it.

568
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:45,498
Rym: They tested it.

569
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:46,640
Scott: I just never tried.

570
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,040
Scott: See, I wouldn't even bother testing it.

571
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,139
Scott: I would have ruled it right out.

572
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,030
Scott: No wifi, no internet needed for anything ever.

573
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,799
Scott: in any event I do at a live thing ever, because it cannot be trusted.

574
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,460
Rym: But they seriously, they tested it behind the stage.

575
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:03,079
Rym: Imagine how nervous they were, because they can't let anyone in on what it might be.

576
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:11,760
Rym: I mean, it'd be suspicious if you see a bunch of people playing Space Team just all over the place who are on the PA staff behind the scenes.

577
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:14,939
Rym: But they tested it during the concerts.

578
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:22,719
Rym: They tested it apparently on stage when the crowd was already in for the omega-thon, like 10 minutes before go-live, and everything was fine.

579
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,318
Rym: It only failed in the actual omega-thon.

580
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:32,200
Rym: Even after they asked people, and Coop was like, "Yeah, this is ghetto, I know, but whatever," to go into airplane mode.

581
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,939
Rym: It still didn't help.

582
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:33,458
Scott: Nope.

583
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,178
Scott: Who knows what that was causing it?

584
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:35,753
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,800
Rym: It's some sort of wifi disturbance of some kind.

586
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,579
Rym: It's hard to tell.

587
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:43,537
Scott: Some people I heard were saying, "Why didn't you use

588
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:43,960
Scott: Bluetooth?".

589
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,839
Scott: That was apparently an alternative that might have worked.

590
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:51,780
Rym: From what I've been told, that was considered and not viable.

591
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,267
Rym: Mm-hmm.

592
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:53,092
Scott: I don't know.

593
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:55,840
Scott: All I'm saying is, I would never do anything.

594
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,320
Scott: I wouldn't even bother being like, "Testing the wifi, it works.

595
00:29:58,461 --> 00:29:58,977
Scott: Okay, let's do

596
00:29:59,019 --> 00:29:59,060
Scott: it.".

597
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,758
Scott: I would be like, "No.

598
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,180
Scott: We are never going to do anything that requires wifi or internet, because we cannot trust

599
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:04,345
Scott: it.".

600
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:05,419
Scott: End of story.

601
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:18,209
Scott: Maybe if I had a dedicated internet line coming in, like a T1 that I rented and tested and had ethernet cables going to it, and I was visiting web pages on it, I'm like, "Okay, we can use

602
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,413
Scott: this.".

603
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:20,820
Rym: I would trust internet just fine.

604
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,460
Rym: What I do is cut off attendee access to the internet before.

605
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,540
Scott: I would trust a wired LAN game as well, obviously.

606
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:28,739
Scott: That's fine.

607
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,560
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

608
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:40,360
Scott: You've seen a lot of performances on the internet of music.

609
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,719
Scott: This is not a new thing.

610
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,659
Scott: It is super old.

611
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,461
Scott: In fact, this particular video is from 2010.

612
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,800
Scott: I just didn't see it until today, because, well, not even today, like a couple days ago.

613
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,600
Scott: What this is, is a guy named James Hill.

614
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,700
Scott: The video was uploaded by Gordon Mayer on YouTube.

615
00:30:56,462 --> 00:30:59,380
Scott: This is at the Dusty Springs Seattle Uke Fest.

616
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,530
Scott: He's playing a uke, a lele, ukulele.

617
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,760
Scott: He is playing the song "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.

618
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:17,420
Scott: The way this guy plays this ukulele, it is like he is playing five or six instruments simultaneously, even though it's only one instrument.

619
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:18,940
Scott: It is pretty impressive.

620
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:20,270
Scott: It's worth seeing.

621
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:20,999
Scott: if you haven't seen it.

622
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:28,179
Scott: It's probably, even I, who have seen almost everything on the internet, in reality, I've only probably seen 90% of things on the internet.

623
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,460
Scott: This is one of those 10% of things that comes around again.

624
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,834
Scott: It's like I'm seeing it for the first time when everyone else has seen it for the second time.

625
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,737
Scott: But whatever, now you can remove this from your 10% and move up to 91% of internet being seen.

626
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Rym: So this, what I have for you, my thing of the day, winter's over.

627
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,179
Rym: It's a winter wrap up, if you will.

628
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,880
Rym: This is a fan made, sort of stop motion, live action.

629
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,879
Scott: It's not stop motion, it's live motion.

630
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:02,300
Rym: You can argue that it's just incredibly high frame rate stop motion.

631
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,978
Scott: No, it's not.

632
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,638
Scott: It's regular videoing.

633
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:14,459
Rym: This is a highly accurate representation of the winter wrap up scene from My Little Pony, done with real life models.

634
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,580
Rym: And it's just extremely well done and very charming to watch.

635
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,519
Scott: It's charming, I'll give you that.

636
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,327
Rym: There's something, it warmed the cockles of my heart, or maybe that's my fever coming back.

637
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,359
Scott: It does have three quarters of a million views, almost.

638
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,680
Rym: Yeah, that says something.

639
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,119
Scott: It says something, all right.

640
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:34,180
Scott: Bargo, bargo.

641
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,976
Rym: In the meta moment, the book club book, which you still haven't put on the website is...

642
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,420
Scott: Oh, I will do that when I get home.

643
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:44,800
Scott: It is The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks.

644
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,179
Scott: It is the most GeekNights a book can possibly be.

645
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:55,500
Scott: I started reading it and then I haven't read it again in a little while because of PAX and stuff, but I'm going to continue reading it very soon.

646
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,959
Scott: I think Emily's actually read more than either of us.

647
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,860
Rym: Yeah, because she borrowed my Kindle and she's been reading it, so I gotta borrow it back.

648
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:03,140
Scott: I thought she had her own Kindle.

649
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,860
Rym: Yeah, but I bought the book, I can't just give it to her.

650
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:08,059
Scott: Oh, you bought it?

651
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,460
Scott: See, this is why I don't buy Kindle books ever with the DRMs.

652
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,840
Rym: We both buy books, but then we just trade Kindles periodically.

653
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,080
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

654
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:17,120
Scott: Anyway.

655
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:17,659
Rym: I don't know.

656
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,819
Rym: I don't pirate everything because I got money.

657
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,800
Scott: Yeah, I got money too, but I'm still not going to buy a DRM book.

658
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,299
Scott: If they were selling a DRM free book, I'd probably buy that.

659
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,487
Rym: So you wouldn't buy a DRM book for like $2?

660
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:28,677
Scott: No.

661
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,740
Rym: But you'd pay, how much would you pay for the paperback of that book?

662
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,620
Scott: Whatever it costs on Amazon.

663
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,879
Rym: What if it was like 20 bucks?

664
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,578
Scott: No, I probably wouldn't just buy it at all then.

665
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:41,899
Scott: I'm not going to pay 20 bucks for a paperback, you crazy.

666
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,680
Scott: I'm paying the reasonable paperback price.

667
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:50,020
Rym: But yeah, our next conventions are Kinetic Con.

668
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,840
Scott: Anime Boston.

669
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,899
Rym: And Anime Boston.

670
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,231
Scott: In May.

671
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,800
Scott: This weekend is the Mocha Festival in New York City.

672
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,079
Scott: You should go to that.

673
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,840
Rym: We'll be there Saturday hanging out, looking at comics, buying comics.

674
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,838
Rym: I think I spend more money at Mocha than any other convention I ever go to.

675
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,779
Scott: It doesn't say anything I want to buy, really, except PAX t-shirts at PAX.

676
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,580
Rym: I guess I'll spend more getting to PAXOS, but that's a different expense altogether.

677
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,539
Scott: It's a different situation, right.

678
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,398
Scott: Kinetic Con.

679
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,099
Scott: Spend more on food at Anime Boston.

680
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:28,578
Rym: And Kinetic Con, we're basically in the process of scheduling the con, but if you haven't submitted a panel yet and you really want to submit, and your submission's really, really good, you might still make it in.

681
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:33,699
Rym: In particular, we got fewer anime submissions than we've ever gotten.

682
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,539
Scott: So if you submit a crappy anime panel, it's actually likely to get accepted because we need anime.

683
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,020
Scott: It's a multi-genre convention.

684
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,078
Scott: We want to give time to all genres roughly, equally, or fairly.

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,179
Scott: So any genres that are underrepresented or medias or geekeries that are underrepresented are more likely to get their panels accepted.

686
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,459
Rym: What's interesting, though, is that for three years now, the number of anime panels submitted has dropped precipitously every year.

687
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Scott: And we keep trying to solicit people to come do some panels, Mike Tool.

688
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,935
Scott: But they don't.

689
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,200
Rym: And the trend, it amazed me the trend has continued.

690
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,760
Rym: So I am now not surprised when certain people I know at Anime Cons are complaining that they don't get any panel submissions.

691
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:18,680
Rym: There might just be a drying up in general of Anime Con content.

692
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:19,916
Scott: There may be.

693
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:20,839
Rym: It's hard to say.

694
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:21,675
Scott: Maybe.

695
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:30,460
Scott: There's not much left to say about anime, or the people who have things to say don't have things to say about anime, or the people who have things to say about anime are few and far between.

696
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,799
Rym: I mean, we're doing five.

697
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,680
Scott: Or they've already said everything they had to say and there's not really much new to say.

698
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,920
Rym: We're doing five panels in Anime Boston.

699
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,439
Rym: We could have done more, but we didn't want to.

700
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,031
Scott: Yeah.

701
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,177
Scott: No, I don't want to do more than that.

702
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,420
Scott: We still got to do the really hard one, though.

703
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:42,908
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:45,600
Rym: Let's start on that before July.

705
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Scott: Let's divide up the, before July, the cons in May.

706
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:55,313
Rym: But anyway, at PAX, we played a game that looked like.

707
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,400
Rym: I looked at it and it looked amazing.

708
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,820
Rym: It looked like exactly the kind of game that is totally my jam.

709
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,700
Rym: A bunch of our friends were playing it and they all said, "This game is great.

710
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:05,798
Rym: You've got to play

711
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:05,860
Rym: it."

712
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,200
Rym: Including some of them who are not known for their love of complicated, boring German games.

713
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,159
Scott: So I played this game, actually.

714
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,340
Scott: I don't think Rym was playing the time I was playing, right?

715
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,680
Rym: I played in one game that didn't finish after you already knew something about the game.

716
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:28,760
Rym: And then I played another game of it the next day with only fast people that also did not finish.

717
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,540
Scott: Basically, let's just get to the point, right?

718
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,460
Scott: I played this game and we didn't finish, but I thought that we didn't finish because some of the people we're playing with were new.

719
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,019
Scott: I was actually new to it as well.

720
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,120
Scott: He's new to this game, even though I was playing quickly.

721
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:40,680
Scott: And they were playing slowly.

722
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,800
Scott: So I was like, "All right, we're just going to end this now because it's too late.

723
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:47,798
Scott: We'll play this again another time with only fast people and it'll be

724
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:48,200
Scott: awesome.".

725
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,680
Scott: Because so far, everything in this game is super fun and awesome.

726
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:54,100
Scott: So then we came back and it was the day after PAX.

727
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,379
Scott: Only awesome people were left.

728
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,160
Scott: People were fast and awesome at board games.

729
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,959
Scott: We played this game and it took for fucking ever.

730
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,240
Scott: This game is so goddamn slow, even though it's fun.

731
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:09,867
Rym: I literally, in my opinion of this game, went from, "This is going to be one of my favorite board

732
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:10,174
Rym: games.".

733
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:12,660
Scott: You said you were going to go home and buy it.

734
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,780
Rym: I almost bought it that night.

735
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,619
Rym: I just fell asleep before I remembered to in the hotel room.

736
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,400
Rym: I'm so glad I didn't buy this game.

737
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:20,919
Scott: So glad.

738
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,860
Scott: So really, the game is called Ground Floor.

739
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,718
Scott: Did we mention that already?

740
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,760
Rym: Ground Floor is a game that is a pseudo-simulation of a company growing.

741
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:40,039
Rym: And you'll add floors to your building and specialize out your building and hire workers and then distribute those workers around the board doing stuff for you.

742
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,344
Rym: Not in a normal, traditional worker placement way, but more like you have an abstraction of.

743
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:47,380
Rym: you add an employee.

744
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:52,100
Rym: An employee has three time markers that designate what they're doing with their time.

745
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:52,700
Scott: Yeah.

746
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:57,640
Scott: So you spend these time markers to choose all around the board and all the different places.

747
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,039
Scott: And each different place on the board that you can put workers is basically like a game in and of itself.

748
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:17,040
Scott: So it's like on this big board, there's a bunch of little tiny games and you can buy in to play those games by spending your two different currencies, the money and the information currencies and your time markers into those games to play them.

749
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:21,851
Scott: And of course, if you play and do well at those games, you get more resources out of them.

750
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:34,920
Scott: And the only game that really matters is the final game on the board, which is the construction game, which allows you to build new floors in your building and new windows for your building so that you can get victory points.

751
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,200
Scott: You can also get victory points by upgrading things on your own card to make your games more efficient.

752
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:42,399
Scott: But that's pretty minor.

753
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:52,599
Scott: It's really all about playing a bunch of tiny games with your little pieces in order to get resources to get, you know, victory points in the last the construction game.

754
00:38:54,142 --> 00:39:05,660
Rym: So now it's interesting that the game has so many structures, yet actual victory points are relatively few and far between and are really only in this sort of construction phase.

755
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:10,960
Rym: Like adding floors and adding improvements to your building gets you a few victory points.

756
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:19,940
Scott: It also makes it easier to get more victory points because those added floors to your building give you vast powers, powers greater than any other power available in the game.

757
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Rym: But that there's such complexity in the game before that point and so little complexity there at the end was kind of surprising.

758
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,100
Rym: It wasn't what I usually expect from games.

759
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:42,040
Scott: Well, I think the reason the complexity drains out of the game is because as you get those improvements to your building, you actually can now ignore some of the other games.

760
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,521
Scott: Right.

761
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:48,599
Scott: So if you were to get, say, in the third phase of the game, the accounting floor, which I really wanted, but we didn't get to the third phase goes too long.

762
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:51,380
Rym: Yeah, we didn't even get to the third phase.

763
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:51,740
Scott: Right.

764
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:09,380
Scott: You can use that accounting floor to just get cash money, which means you can now ignore pretty much the factory retail part of the game, which is usually the best way to get cash because you now have your own supply of cash that all you do is just spend some workers and get cash directly.

765
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:10,759
Scott: So screw that.

766
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:11,302
Scott: All right.

767
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:16,979
Scott: There is also other things that like get you add information to your income so you can get tons of folders all the time.

768
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:24,419
Scott: You can now if you get that, you can now ignore the folder getting game, except when it's really obvious and easy to get a ton of folders out of it.

769
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:36,658
Scott: So in that later game, you're pretty much just rushing to construct very quickly and ignoring most of the other bits, except for the marketing bit, which you can't ignore at all the whole game.

770
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,465
Rym: Now, the way the game works fundamentally is you've got your little board with, you know, your building on it.

771
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,320
Rym: It's got this cute little thing as you add floors.

772
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:53,840
Rym: They like rise up out of the top of your board, like the production values are super high quality, but you'll have your CEO and you choose to hire or not hire employees.

773
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:58,360
Rym: And the cost of hiring depends on the current economy and how many other people hired.

774
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:04,622
Rym: And that's a trend in the entire game that things you do depend heavily on who did it before you.

775
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:11,080
Rym: Sometimes it's affected by who does it after you and is affected by the economy, which has its own sort.

776
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,880
Rym: It's like a weather in the game that changes like it's a recession.

777
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:14,989
Rym: Now it's stable.

778
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,200
Rym: Boom times, depression.

779
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,005
Rym: It jumps around.

780
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:18,660
Scott: Yeah, but you can always see what's coming.

781
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:21,280
Scott: So it's not like you can get surprised and screwed by luck.

782
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,140
Rym: It's like you only see a little bit into the future.

783
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:28,860
Scott: You can see one into the future, which is pretty much enough to plan a turn ahead.

784
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:29,164
Scott: Right.

785
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:30,439
Scott: Which is all you really need the plan.

786
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:30,723
Scott: Right.

787
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,400
Scott: It's like, you know, next year is going to be recession.

788
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,345
Scott: Money is going to be tight.

789
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,739
Scott: Get money now during the boom times.

790
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:47,160
Rym: So the problem with this game and I want to talk about the problems rather than getting into more detail about how to play, because the rules are very difficult to follow.

791
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,220
Rym: We were taught to play by one group of people.

792
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:57,279
Rym: And as a result, we messed up like four different parts of the game because they didn't understand that part of the rules.

793
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,022
Rym: Yeah.

794
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:03,840
Rym: Rereading the rules and playing again, those parts of the game were still messed up, but in different ways.

795
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,346
Scott: Yeah, it's like I read.

796
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:09,704
Scott: I reread the rules to how to play the marketing game like three or four times.

797
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:19,640
Scott: And I read something different each time because different parts of the rule book, the rules for it were spread out over different parts instead of all concentrated in one, you know, direct area.

798
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:27,160
Scott: And the flow was way out of whack and we got it wrong a bunch of different ways, a bunch of different times before getting it right.

799
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:27,800
Rym: Yeah.

800
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:38,298
Rym: The fact that we couldn't get the rules straight in repeated play and repeated rereadings of the rules bothered me because I cannot think of a game that has given us that much trouble that we didn't just out of hand dismiss.

801
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,259
Scott: And just remember, this is all pros playing this game.

802
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,480
Rym: Hellas was the last game where I had this level of rules.

803
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,780
Scott: Well, the problem with Hellas is that the rules were just wrong, right?

804
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,140
Scott: They were just the rules didn't fully explain themselves.

805
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,480
Scott: You had to go get a rat online or something to explain it.

806
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,740
Rym: But this game theoretically resolvable.

807
00:42:54,881 --> 00:43:03,060
Rym: But the fact that all of us smart, super gamer people are reading the rules together over and over again had trouble agreeing on what the rules.

808
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,280
Scott: Yeah, it's like the rules did have everything written down in there somewhere.

809
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:20,657
Scott: But every time we reread it, we found something different that re-explained or, you know, we know we actually were doing that wrong and we're doing a little more right this time, but we're doing it's like because the main problem is you do things in different orders and the order matters a lot.

810
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:23,820
Scott: And sometimes the order it's just like popularity order.

811
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,200
Scott: OK, but it also matters on like, well, the popularity just changed.

812
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,797
Scott: So do we change the order now and do we do it in the order of this?

813
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:41,839
Scott: You know, do we do broadcast, then print, then networking, or do we do, you know, this person in all three and then this person in all three?

814
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,559
Rym: Now, this is the crux of the problem.

815
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,260
Rym: It wouldn't be so bad if it were just that the rules were confusing, but the game was fine.

816
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,960
Rym: The problem lies in the fact that while the rules are confusing, the actual mechanics the rules are describing are extremely nonintuitive.

817
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,780
Rym: As a result, if you try to intuit how it should go, you're going to get it wrong.

818
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,500
Rym: But if you try to read the rules and figure it out, you're going to get a hell of a time getting it right, because it's hard to grok what the rules are saying because they don't match with what you'd expect.

819
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:14,219
Scott: I feel like this game could work.

820
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,933
Scott: It's one of those ones where obviously it could work if it was a video game, because that makes everything faster, right?

821
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:23,100
Scott: But even then, it's just, it's not a fast game.

822
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,620
Scott: Every round, you've got to do all this stuff, right?

823
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,200
Scott: It took us like two hours to get halfway through the game.

824
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,260
Scott: It's going to be like a four hour motherfucker with, you know, even people playing on a computer.

825
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,500
Scott: Maybe it's gonna be three hours.

826
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:36,580
Scott: You can just play clips instead, right?

827
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,344
Rym: As I was going to say, Buttroom and Scott, you play four and five hour games all the time.

828
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:41,320
Rym: and yes, that is true.

829
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:49,420
Rym: But in a game of Eclipse, my brain is engaged the entire time and I feel this deep sense of satisfaction about the decisions I'm making.

830
00:44:49,520 --> 00:45:04,554
Rym: In this game, I was never satisfied with the decision I was making because I had almost no directional heuristic whatsoever to tell me if what I was doing was going to help me win and if not, what I could do differently.

831
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,400
Rym: that would be better.

832
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,880
Scott: It's like when you play Eclipse for four hours, you're getting your four hours worth.

833
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,800
Scott: If your four hours is packed with Eclipse, you know, it's a full meal the whole time.

834
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:17,800
Scott: This is like eating snacks for four hours, you know, waiting for dinner.

835
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,198
Scott: It's like, dude, I could have just eaten this.

836
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:26,660
Scott: You know, this is, it feels like a lighter game than it is, you know, the mechanically, it feels like a Euro game, you know, more like a Puerto Rico.

837
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,460
Scott: It should take 90 minutes, but it just drags and drags and, but you're not doing enough stuff that it feels like it should be that long.

838
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:44,580
Scott: So very unsatisfying, even though I guess, you know, mechanically speaking, if you follow the rules and you're willing to sit there for that long, it's not really that bad.

839
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:45,698
Scott: It's actually pretty good.

840
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,580
Rym: Now I worry that it is still bad.

841
00:45:49,022 --> 00:46:03,638
Rym: And my, the reason I worry that it's bad is that having played through it and tried to figure it out, I realized that most of the game is not very complex and the decisions are usually pretty obvious and direct.

842
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,060
Scott: There are many obvious decisions.

843
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:08,818
Rym: So what determines who's doing?

844
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:09,080
Rym: well?

845
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,458
Rym: It seems to come down to the advertising agency and the quote unquote popularity metric in the game.

846
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,340
Rym: And this is where the game just fails me.

847
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,078
Scott: It's also the part where the rules are fucked up.

848
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:25,600
Rym: That the metric there has the same problem that that Viva Java game had.

849
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:30,360
Rym: In fact, I would say that this game and Viva Java share many of the same problems.

850
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:40,420
Rym: This game uses a mechanic where you have a, a slider, a metric of popularity, and you put your little color token on it to show you how popular you are.

851
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:43,940
Rym: And you'll move up by moving your token steps to the right.

852
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:51,600
Rym: But because this is not granular enough, you'll almost always end up being on top of other people.

853
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,340
Rym: There'll be three or four players stacked on one spot at any given time.

854
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:02,140
Rym: The precedent's order of how that tie is resolved is confusing, counterintuitive.

855
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,439
Rym: I would argue the opposite of what I would expect from historical games.

856
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,840
Scott: Well, I mean, you can sort of understand, right?

857
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,298
Scott: Let's say we're both at popularity one and you're on top of me.

858
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:14,719
Scott: You're more popular because you're on top of me.

859
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,720
Rym: That makes sense on an intuitive level.

860
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:19,480
Scott: So you gain three popularity, right?

861
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,119
Scott: Then I gained three.

862
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,977
Scott: Well, you would think on the one hand, you gain the popularity first, which means you're better than me.

863
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,209
Scott: Right.

864
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,219
Scott: Therefore, you should be more popular than me.

865
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,440
Scott: But because I moved second physically, my token is now on top of yours.

866
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:45,080
Scott: And now I'm more popular, which makes sense in a different way in that, you know, someone who's catching up, you know, it's a slight, you know, uh, you know, we know there's no catch up mechanism, right?

867
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,460
Scott: But it's, it's a slight catch up kind of thing.

868
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:54,860
Rym: Like, you know, the guy who got away first, the catch up mechanism and that it narrows the playing field between, you know, percentage chance of victory and failure.

869
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,679
Scott: You got the benefit of going ahead first because you went ahead first, whereas I'm coming up from behind.

870
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,015
Scott: So now you have to, you know, use that benefit you got from going early to keep getting away from me.

871
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,599
Rym: But game designers take note.

872
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:18,000
Rym: That just becomes an extremely annoying heuristic for people to actually deal with if they're trying to win your game, because it's very counterintuitive in practice.

873
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:27,179
Rym: Never use the mechanic of getting to the point second makes you the winner of the tie to as a catch up mechanism.

874
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,419
Rym: Never do that.

875
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:34,499
Rym: I've decided having run into a few games that have done it only recently, I've never run into this before.

876
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,900
Rym: It's only, it only seems like these recent games.

877
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,618
Scott: I think a better idea would have been to have the popularity just be, you know, popularity points.

878
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,160
Scott: Right.

879
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,680
Scott: And people would just have these points and, you know, it'd be some number.

880
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:50,477
Scott: And, you know, instead of having a scale from like, what does the scale go?

881
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:53,600
Scott: from like one to ten or something only goes up to nine.

882
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:53,938
Rym: Yeah.

883
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,558
Scott: Have it.

884
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,280
Scott: Let it be just from zero to a lot like zero to one hundred.

885
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,539
Scott: So everyone has like a, you know, a very, you know, a much more granular scale.

886
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,860
Rym: This and Viva Java both had that problem.

887
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:11,279
Rym: The pot, the scale they use for this mechanism of determining who gets to go first in different areas is just not granular enough.

888
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:15,000
Scott: Or in another way you could think about it is that it's too granular.

889
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,080
Scott: If you think about Kalis, the turn order, there's five players, there's five spots.

890
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:20,220
Scott: They're always in order.

891
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,360
Scott: One, two, three, four, five.

892
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:21,860
Scott: Exactly.

893
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,099
Scott: There's no one's on top of anyone or anything like that.

894
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,500
Scott: There is a exact way to determine that order precisely.

895
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,059
Scott: Power grid.

896
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:29,960
Scott: What's the turn order?

897
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:30,899
Scott: There's this numbers.

898
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,620
Scott: You just line up the people in specific order.

899
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:35,699
Scott: No one's tied in the turn order.

900
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:48,280
Rym: So I think having read through this and just played the game, I think the reason that this advertising agency that determines your popularity is so confusing because we're just talking about the popularity points.

901
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:50,780
Rym: This is not all the bullshit around them.

902
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,900
Rym: The fact that they decline and you lose popularity every turn.

903
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,439
Scott: Remember, this is a game that has like seven tiny games in it and this popularity thing is just one of those games.

904
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,320
Rym: Nevermind the fact that affects all the other games.

905
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:16,579
Rym: Even getting popularity, you have to put guys onto this advertising agency and then populate them into one of three things that score popularity in a really extra doubly non-intuitive manner.

906
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,459
Scott: It's like you got to put your guys in here.

907
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,080
Scott: Then once they're in there in the holding area, then they can go into the actual game.

908
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:28,680
Rym: But some abilities let you go right into one of these areas early, but then you lose a bonus and it gets complicated.

909
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,480
Scott: But I think that that costs less resources.

910
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,259
Rym: That complicated bullshit is all there to obfuscate the fact that the rest of the game is pretty brain dead.

911
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,839
Scott: Yeah.

912
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:43,720
Scott: It's like when you're going in the factory, it's like the decision what to do in the factory is pretty simple.

913
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,830
Scott: The warehouse is buy a box there.

914
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,739
Scott: if it's the good way to get a box instead of using the assembly.

915
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:50,059
Scott: Right.

916
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,140
Rym: And if it's too expensive, just buy the box from your own building instead.

917
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,786
Scott: The folder game is pretty much just like if you need folders, you can get a whole bunch of them here if you know.

918
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:02,200
Scott: and you know, see if you're going to give that other person folders and whatever.

919
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,279
Rym: It always fills up.

920
00:51:03,902 --> 00:51:06,771
Scott: And the construction is get in there.

921
00:51:06,872 --> 00:51:14,579
Scott: first, if you care about somebody taking a specific building you want to buy, if not, just get in there if you can afford it, because that's victory points.

922
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,900
Scott: You want to get those as soon as possible.

923
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,980
Rym: Don't worry about not getting in because you have like a thousand actions.

924
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:20,495
Scott: Yeah.

925
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
Scott: It is like that's the real problem, right?

926
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:29,640
Scott: Imagine if you're playing a curricula instead of having a five family members, each family member had like five units of work each day.

927
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,400
Scott: So you had twenty five different workers and there were like 50 jobs.

928
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:36,640
Scott: And you could, you know, you put on your guys all different jobs.

929
00:51:36,821 --> 00:51:38,220
Scott: That's why the game takes forever.

930
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:42,620
Scott: They really should have abstracted more of this stuff to make it less granular overall.

931
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:48,739
Scott: And I think you could have had a good game there because the simulation of company does sort of work out.

932
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,980
Rym: Oh, the game was super fun.

933
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,699
Rym: And this is the problem.

934
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:58,840
Rym: The game is super fun in the first couple of turns until people have enough actions to actually use the advertising agency.

935
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:00,780
Rym: And then the game bogs down.

936
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,437
Scott: And that's the other reason it bogs down is because advertising is the only thing you can really do for free.

937
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:12,799
Scott: So at the end of your turn, we have all these extra time markers, slash worker tokens, and you have nothing else to do with them.

938
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:16,020
Scott: You just dump them all in there for free, basically.

939
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:24,080
Rym: And you still got to follow the turn order and go around procedurally, because depending on what I do, other people might do something different.

940
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,700
Rym: And it ends up being really unsatisfying.

941
00:52:29,253 --> 00:52:29,499
Scott: Very.

942
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:36,620
Rym: Now, I really think if you fix the advertising agency, there's no game there.

943
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,759
Rym: And that's the problem.

944
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,760
Scott: Or what you could do is you could make the advertising agency the whole game.

945
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,882
Scott: But the advertising

946
00:52:42,943 --> 00:53:05,420
Rym: agency is super unfun because not only is it not intuitive and is the popularity game just non-granular and annoying and difficult to figure out, it also requires a large amount of procedural calculation on the place in the place of the players to figure out what to do with every one of their actions.

947
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:19,220
Scott: And the thing is, most of the time I was calculating, actually not sure if this is something clever the game designers did or not, is I would be like, OK, if I put my guy into networking directly, I'll get this.

948
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:23,139
Scott: Well, if I pay this to get him into networking, then I'll get two guys in there.

949
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:29,220
Scott: So if I do that, I'll actually just be losing a dollar because I could just put two guys in there directly.

950
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:38,760
Scott: But rather than spending a dollar and a folder and one guy to get two guys in, I can just spend two guys with the dollars that you might go into print instead.

951
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:39,182
Scott: Right.

952
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:47,580
Scott: And I calculated all these different possibilities every turn and they all turned out to be equal, except for a few where I would just lose a dollar for no reason.

953
00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:49,180
Rym: See, now they're equal in a vacuum.

954
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:50,880
Rym: But the problem is you get both.

955
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:55,520
Scott: They were equal in terms of the number of popularity points I would have received.

956
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:01,100
Rym: Ah, but were you also taking into account the fact that whoever has the most tokens, each one of those areas also gets bonus popularity?

957
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,719
Scott: I was, at least in those specific scenarios that I was in.

958
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:05,964
Scott: You know, I could not.

959
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:14,278
Scott: I would basically have gained the same whether I put two workers directly into networking to one guy into advertising.

960
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:25,900
Rym: Would you have gained the same effectively if you would land on the same space as someone else and they were in print, but you were in broadcast instead of networking?

961
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,693
Scott: I couldn't figure that out because the rules are all.

962
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:29,457
Rym: that's the part.

963
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:30,140
Rym: that's the problem.

964
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:37,800
Rym: Even if I figure out that if I do this, this is my optimal way to get the same number of popularity points is what I calculated.

965
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:44,878
Scott: But I didn't calculate whether I would land there second or third or first, thus determining my actual popularity order.

966
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:49,238
Rym: And in general, some parts of the board, it's a benefit to be the first one in.

967
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,139
Rym: in some parts of the board is the benefit to be the last one in.

968
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,439
Rym: And the game just doesn't take that into account very well.

969
00:54:57,304 --> 00:54:57,400
Scott: Nope.

970
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,199
Rym: So I don't know what I can say about this game.

971
00:55:03,043 --> 00:55:04,777
Rym: Other than that, I kind of hate it.

972
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:08,374
Scott: I don't know if I hate the game and I'm definitely not going to.

973
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:10,659
Rym: I hate it because I enjoyed it so much.

974
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:19,360
Rym: And then after the first third, I realized that the game is going to take four hours and just going to be increasingly tedious.

975
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,448
Scott: Yeah, I don't hate it.

976
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:22,759
Scott: We're definitely never going to play it again.

977
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,820
Scott: Apparently, this game was part of a Kickstarter where you got two similarly themed games from the same designer.

978
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:33,680
Scott: The other game that came with this is Skyline, which is sort of a nice Yahtzee.

979
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,445
Scott: I kind of like it.

980
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:35,779
Rym: Skyline is actually pretty fun.

981
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,105
Scott: Yeah, it's a Yahtzee.

982
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:41,297
Scott: You roll dice, you reroll the one, you know, but there's a little different rules to it.

983
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,783
Scott: Are you trying to build buildings instead of matching particular slots on your Yahtzee card?

984
00:55:46,488 --> 00:55:47,940
Scott: You can roll different kinds of dice.

985
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:52,561
Scott: If you're looking for a Yahtzee type of game and you don't roll through the ages, you can play.

986
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:54,780
Scott: roll through the ages or you can play Skyline.

987
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,200
Scott: They're both better than Yahtzee.

988
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:59,656
Scott: And they're pretty much, you know, fill that same niche or same role.

989
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,075
Rym: I thought about buying Skyline, but it's 30 bucks.

990
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,482
Scott: Fuck that.

991
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:08,820
Rym: It's not 30 bucks for what amounts to a pile of dice.

992
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,402
Rym: Yeah.

993
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:12,579
Rym: And in some cards for that, you might as well just play Yahtzee.

994
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:13,244
Scott: Yeah.

995
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:14,840
Scott: Or roll through that much as roll through the ages.

996
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:15,831
Rym: I don't know.

997
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:16,499
Scott: Check it.

998
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,111
Rym: Roll through the ages is 30 bucks.

999
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:20,760
Scott: OK, well, neither of those.

1000
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:22,340
Rym: No, that's roll through the ages.

1001
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,180
Scott: Bronze Age is an expansion.

1002
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:28,220
Rym: I don't see anything but roll through the ages.

1003
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,839
Scott: Oh, no, that is roll through the ages.

1004
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:30,745
Scott: That is it.

1005
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:32,660
Rym: The Bronze Age.

1006
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,439
Scott: Yeah, it says the Bronze Age on it.

1007
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,419
Rym: I haven't played this game in almost two years, I think.

1008
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:39,045
Scott: Yeah.

1009
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:39,999
Scott: Yeah.

1010
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,780
Scott: Don't spend thirty dollars for Yahtzee clone.

1011
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:42,978
Scott: That's crook slightly so.

1012
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:44,139
Scott: Yeah, with a different theme.

1013
00:56:44,482 --> 00:56:47,417
Rym: But it's just this game is you?

1014
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:47,860
Rym: try it.

1015
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,979
Rym: If you have some don't buy it, don't buy this game by any means.

1016
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,260
Rym: But find someone else who has it or pick it up in a tabletop library.

1017
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,480
Rym: Get someone to teach you how to play it and play the first few rounds.

1018
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,379
Rym: You'll see what we mean.

1019
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,999
Rym: It's super fun until you get about three rounds in.

1020
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,820
Scott: And everyone's got a bunch of employees and way too many time markers.

1021
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,100
Rym: And also that's when someone's like, you know what?

1022
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:10,620
Rym: I want to have my popularity.

1023
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:13,080
Rym: And then everyone's got to start playing that popularity game.

1024
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:14,579
Rym: that becomes the whole game.

1025
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,399
Rym: It's not intuitive and not fun.

1026
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:23,140
Rym: The game requires so much calculation on the players parts to have any chance of doing better than other players and winning.

1027
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:28,932
Rym: And that part and all the other rest of the game is just completely obvious brain dead decisions.

1028
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:29,960
Rym: Ninety nine percent of the time.

1029
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:35,480
Scott: If you want to play a game that consists of a bunch of separate smaller games that tie into each other, just play power grid.

1030
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,482
Scott: Right.

1031
00:57:36,563 --> 00:57:37,112
Scott: Don't play this.

1032
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:37,519
Rym: Yeah.

1033
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,520
Rym: And if you want to play a good worker placement game that isn't a curricula, just play Kalis.

1034
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,454
Scott: You can also play, I guess, Le Havre is out.

1035
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,400
Scott: there is a lot of them.

1036
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,739
Rym: I like Le Havre OK, but I don't like it that much.

1037
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,089
Scott: Yeah, I've only played like once.

1038
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,260
Scott: I don't know if I played it twice.

1039
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:51,925
Rym: I own it.

1040
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:52,695
Rym: We can play it again.

1041
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,039
Scott: I own it.

1042
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,178
Rym: I thought I owned it.

1043
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,815
Scott: No, I bought Ora at La Vara, which is also.

1044
00:57:58,056 --> 00:57:58,879
Scott: maybe we could play that, too.

1045
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:10,220
Rym: Yeah, I haven't played those other ones enough to know if I like them more or less than it's hard to say, because as much as I like them when I play them, whenever I think back to Kalis, I forget how much I actually really like Kalis.

1046
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,058
Scott: Kalis is really good.

1047
00:58:11,423 --> 00:58:12,880
Rym: Yeah, I feel like I could play Kalis again.

1048
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,500
Rym: It's all about the castle.

1049
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,260
Rym: 20 cubes in the castle.

1050
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,625
Scott: That's right.

1051
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,379
Scott: Except that one guy beat us with the gold frickin jeweler.

1052
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,223
Rym: Yeah, that was.

1053
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:24,019
Rym: that was a close really run affair, though.

1054
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,239
Rym: If I'd gotten a couple more stone, I would have beaten him.

1055
00:58:27,183 --> 00:58:30,139
Rym: Yeah, plus he pretty much gold, gold, golded in a vacuum and we ignored him.

1056
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,640
Rym: Scoffed at him, in fact.

1057
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,800
Scott: Let's let's end the show with this by saying Netrunner is still the best game play.

1058
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,183
Scott: Netrunner.

1059
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:37,799
Rym: Netrunner is a pretty good game.

1060
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,339
Rym: Scott's been playing XCOM, so we'll probably talk about XCOM in an upcoming game.

1061
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,249
Rym: I'm not playing XCOM.

1062
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,057
Scott: That doesn't begin with the letter N. I'm not playing that.

1063
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,318
Scott: I only play games that begin with the letter N.

1064
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,912
