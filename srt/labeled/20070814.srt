1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,469
Scott: It's Tuesday August 14th.

2
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:12,573
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:20,660
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight natural selection and not the science kind.

4
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:31,407
Rym: Let's do this Man, I think it's FPS season again.

5
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:34,277
Scott: I think it just might be well.

6
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:34,980
Rym: the show started.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,237
Rym: Well, we started recording a little bit late because Scott was playing counter-strike, and he wouldn't stop.

8
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:48,645
Scott: well You know it was an icy world and I basically would spawn with the para Hold the button down die spawn with the para hold the button down die And it was pretty much.

9
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,320
Scott: I was living for the rounds where I actually killed the whole other team.

10
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:52,949
Scott: It's like you know.

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,469
Scott: you got the para So you go around the corner you die.

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,676
Scott: you go around the corner you die.

13
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:59,487
Scott: you go around the corner You die you take a tricky path you die.

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,933
Scott: you take a different tricky path.

15
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:05,760
Scott: you get to the behind the enemy lines And you just hose them down, and then you die.

16
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,354
Rym: See pretty much whenever I like you know there's all those delay.

17
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:10,820
Rym: I don't play a counter-strike for a while.

18
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,919
Rym: It's time to get back into it.

19
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:17,480
Rym: I always play icy world for a couple weeks just to get my click on the guy's head skills back.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,065
Scott: I I was.

21
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:24,090
Scott: I think I was getting more headshots than any other sort of kill But that might have been a result of the weapons of choice.

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,857
Rym: well remember the trick with the para.

23
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:31,109
Rym: if you really want to be good with it is aim for the head and Nintendo wrist a little bit with a mouse.

24
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:31,872
Scott: that's what I did.

25
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:33,860
Scott: is I was just going to be behind the enemy lines.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:44,429
Scott: I would aim at the general mass of enemies aim high and just shake it back and forth And it would be like headshot headshot headshot rampage And I'm like yes, and then I would die.

27
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:47,481
Rym: actually in any icy world my favorite weapon is always the Mac 10.

28
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,991
Rym: It's a headshot machine.

29
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:49,636
Scott: It's pretty good.

30
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:50,180
Scott: It's pretty good.

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:57,220
Rym: I was actually also kicking it up with the aug and the m4 plus over the weekend something We used to do back when we had I don't know free time.

32
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:00,238
Rym: We actually played some games with some of you people out there.

33
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:13,213
Scott: Yeah Ever since I bought all those ID software games on Steam, and I've been using my laptop a lot more my piece my desktop Which I don't use so much has been sitting in windows with steam action going on.

34
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:19,439
Rym: so playing some Defcon Playing some CS source that water is poison handed our asses to us.

35
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:20,607
Scott: He did.

36
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:24,222
Scott: we're not so good at Defcon a game I've played maybe four times But

37
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:35,673
Rym: we were playing some awesome two-on-two counter-strike with him and bees knees and Right before Scott and I were talking in the tea in the chat, and he says Rym I'm worried you think we're not as good as we used to be.

38
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:45,985
Rym: what if we get hosed by these two kids that's not gonna represent well, and then we come around the corner, and they're right there laid in perfect ambush and Two seconds later.

39
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:49,160
Rym: I had headshotted both of them and was raping one of their corpses.

40
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:55,440
Scott: Yeah, my p90 had bullets left in it, and he was like ah There was one particular set of kills.

41
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,426
Rym: They ambushed Scott and got him and I had almost no health And I just ran around the corner with the pair and killed him both, and I think bees knees typed And I quote holy shit.

42
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,220
Rym: Yeah, Scott had some magnificent kills.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,374
Scott: They had me pinned down at one and I'd been around and I jumped off the.

44
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:09,896
Scott: he was.

45
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,519
Scott: he was coming up the stairs And Rym was at the top of the stairs.

46
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:20,580
Rym: I was behind the wall like to get to get to get out with almost no health left running out of bullets And they were coming toward me about to kill and they came up the stairs.

47
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:25,790
Scott: So I just walked to the side of the stairs Jumped off and came up the stairs behind him.

48
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,134
Scott: and not that they're dead.

49
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:28,760
Rym: It was absolutely beautiful.

50
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,217
Rym: I called for assistance and the next thing I know is Scott is standing there over the bodies of the fallen.

51
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,208
Rym: yep God, I love counter-strike.

52
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,275
Scott: Yeah, we're good at that game.

53
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,547
Rym: alright Well, I got us.

54
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,002
Rym: I just want to say that playing counter-strike I'm used to playing.

55
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:47,752
Rym: you know 10 on 10 20 on 20 whatever playing just a two verse two in a good map I forgot how absolutely intense that is.

56
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,789
Scott: you want to is not so bad It's just one-on-one kind of sucks.

57
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,680
Scott: Yeah, and like two on one sucks.

58
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:57,724
Scott: Also, yep three on two still kind of sucks like four on four I think is pretty good.

59
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:01,077
Scott: ten on ten is of course perfect, but you know as long as you get

60
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:13,156
Rym: in a different way I mean when you got like the two on two or the three on three the strategies get very specific like I'm gonna hide behind This and give you cover fire while you run forward with that flash ten on ten.

61
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:18,079
Rym: It's bomb a Bambi camp mommy.

62
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,287
Rym: Those are good strategies, or if you're a CT in certain maps.

63
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,735
Rym: hosties camp one of the two.

64
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:29,527
Scott: oh Good times good times.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,536
Rym: I love that game anyway.

66
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,608
Scott: anyway I guess news action.

67
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:35,994
Rym: I don't know we don't have anything else.

68
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:36,859
Rym: What are we gonna talk about?

69
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,911
Scott: I've been playing some paper Mario on the virtual console.

70
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,940
Rym: We've been playing a lot of Mario strikers.

71
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:45,431
Rym: I'm currently up in way in games, but not by much.

72
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:46,756
Rym: I think I'm one.

73
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:55,020
Rym: every game was always close Like a domination, I think I'm like 1% better than Scott And I think as we play more that's gonna even out like it does in most games.

74
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,879
Scott: I think I'm better than you now, but you know it sort of depends like you just played about you.

75
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,176
Scott: Well, no It's like you played me after you had just played a whole bunch and gotten a bunch of practice.

76
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:17,362
Scott: and since we're both nubs Like if someone has played like a few more games against the computer especially if they just played them And they're already in the groove You know it's like you were in the groove from playing the computer a bunch and then me who hadn't played since the day before Came in.

77
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:23,612
Rym: I'm not gonna win see it's hard to say because sometimes I get in the groove by doing that and sometimes I just Get fatigued by doing that.

78
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:30,340
Scott: yeah, it depends But I think we need a lot more playing before we can just pick it up and be on the you know on the ball.

79
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,313
Rym: The only thing I do want to say is playing it single-player.

80
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,740
Rym: You know it's a game, and it's really good.

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,366
Rym: It's the same as the other Mario strikers.

82
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:46,566
Rym: Just you know better in every way, but playing it multiplayer While it's really fun in terms of tactics or strategy or how you actually have to play It's a completely different game.

83
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,080
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna have to learn a completely different style of play.

84
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,114
Scott: Well talk about it next week or something not now.

85
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,420
Scott: Yeah, but anyway.

86
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,351
Scott: So this is I don't know if you've ever heard of this thing.

87
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,597
Scott: It's called camp Hyrule.

88
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,363
Scott: obviously It's a Nintendo thing.

89
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,908
Rym: I've heard of it from you.

90
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,880
Scott: Yeah, basically what Nintendo has been doing for the past few summers.

91
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:24,040
Scott: I'm not sure how many years they've been doing it, but basically on the internet they make a summer camp with a Zelda theme and they give away prizes and they have chat rooms and they Organize the users into cabins and you have cabin activity things and this flash games and all sorts of stuff.

92
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,070
Scott: So it's sort of like a summer camp for people who can't go to summer camp And it's got Zelda action and Nintendo marketing and such.

93
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,983
Scott: and back in the day when I first heard this thing existed I was like ooh.

94
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:37,797
Scott: There's a super secret camp that only for cool people about Zelda.

95
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,519
Scott: This is something I got to get in on oh shits.

96
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,753
Scott: So I tried to get in on it and I failed.

97
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:51,447
Scott: and the next year I remembered it when it summer came around and I actually got in on it and I was like, oh man Oh man, I'm in the super secret thing.

98
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,069
Scott: No one's in.

99
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,153
Rym: he was so excited.

100
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:57,800
Scott: So I log in and It was totally lame.

101
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:05,280
Scott: I mean There was some cheesy flash games that weren't even as good as the kind on congregate that had some Zelda themes.

102
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:10,299
Scott: There were chat rooms full of punk Pokemon kids talking about how they leach mudkips.

103
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,628
Scott: only They weren't even talking about how they leach mudkips.

104
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,720
Scott: They're talking about a BS six geodudes that can't lose.

105
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,807
Scott: Well, no, it's like that.

106
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:21,288
Scott: the chat rooms were like, you know, man Zelda is the best oot for the win.

107
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,796
Scott: not even that cuz it was so more primitive than that cuz it was so many years ago, they didn't have the new internet speak.

108
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:41,300
Rym: it was just AOL kids see I think the issue here is that Nintendo of America when they do anything They really only market and cater with these online things toward 12 to 12 point five-year-olds.

109
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:50,640
Rym: Great team much and I think the reason is they have to get those kids excited and get him on cuz you know when you Were 12 your attention span was like point two seconds pretty much.

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Rym: So Nintendo just has to keep grabbing him and grabbing him and saying Pokemon Zelda Pokemon Zelda and they just yell right back Pokemon Zelda.

111
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:01,819
Rym: But for us they've already got us they don't need to market the next Zelda game.

112
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:09,206
Scott: to me It's like everything Nintendo does is targeted to a specific You know demographic and they don't.

113
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:18,065
Scott: and it's sort of annoying because even when something has a potential wide appeal It's sort of like they they narrow it down, you know They have all these very.

114
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:22,440
Scott: it's like they're shooting with a sniper rifle when they should be using a shotgun sometimes.

115
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,243
Rym: Why do you say should?

116
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,960
Rym: because their strategy in terms of making money for Nintendo is brilliant and flawless.

117
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:34,299
Scott: Yeah, but there's some times where you know, they they aim something at one particular spot and they hit it perfectly.

118
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:39,039
Scott: But there's some people out there who would have also could have been hit perfectly.

119
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,522
Scott: But they don't.

120
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:43,840
Scott: they only use one bullet per thing and it's like come on you could is you still could have done better?

121
00:08:44,179 --> 00:09:04,560
Rym: Nintendo seems to always go after the low-hanging fruit first and go after it until they've got all of it And then after that they really don't care because they're already making so much money and we'll buy the games anyway And there's there's no reason for them to cater to us in any way other than making games that are good enough For us to play while at the same time grabbing infinite hordes of 12 year olds.

122
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,260
Scott: Well, it's basically you do one thing that's stupidly easy and you get a zillion dollars.

123
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,265
Scott: There's another thing you could do that is also easy But not stupidly easy.

124
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,140
Scott: that could get you another zillion dollars and they just don't bother with the second thing.

125
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,381
Rym: I mean.

126
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,645
Rym: look at this in terms of this camp.

127
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,190
Rym: I rule what is this?

128
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:20,833
Rym: boil it down?

129
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,358
Rym: It is just marketing.

130
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:25,067
Scott: pretty much They don't need to market to anyone.

131
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,095
Scott: here's the thing this marketing right.

132
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:27,817
Scott: apparently.

133
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:28,520
Scott: check this out.

134
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:40,580
Scott: there's no mention on this thing at all of the Phantom Hour glass Zelda game that's coming out not a one and It seems like the only thing going on there as a contest to win a full-size link statue.

135
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:53,677
Rym: I think what they're doing is they're just trying to imprint upon these 12 year olds the word Zelda because remember the kids don't grow up with that the way we did so in To get them into this Nintendo flock and make money off of them well into their 30s.

136
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,440
Rym: They have to just brad it into their brains that Zelda is amazing and awesome.

137
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:11,820
Scott: My thinking actually is if you look at the talk on the internet it's that people were saying Oh camp Hyrule isn't gonna happen this year and I think that Nintendo wasn't planning on making it happen this year that they sort of pulled it out at the last second.

138
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,498
Scott: That's what I'm thinking, huh?

139
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:28,344
Scott: Usually there's like a big build-up to camp Hyrule like this emails and this stuff on websites and stuff and You know suddenly you know this sort of people on the internet We're talking like a couple weeks ago like hey Where's camp I rule at?

140
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:32,538
Rym: maybe Nintendo realized they could have the same effect with much less effort.

141
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:33,220
Scott: perhaps.

142
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,971
Rym: See now the thing is in terms of I mean marketing.

143
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:50,775
Rym: I don't care about but when it comes to games I just would like to point out that lately the style of Nintendo games that I like the most on terms of gameplay but in terms of the style around the game is Mario strikers just the attitude of the characters and the character designs and the way they do it.

144
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:56,472
Scott: because instead of just taking You know the Nintendo characters and putting them forth in their usual idiom.

145
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:57,796
Rym: It's a me a Mario.

146
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:03,760
Scott: They sort of Waluigi They sort of applied You know another thing on top of that.

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,681
Scott: It's like now everyone is sort of badass and really wants to kick your ass at soccer and it's like oh, yeah You know.

148
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:17,224
Scott: so I think if they started taking their characters that are in every goddamn game like look at Mario Kart and Mario Kart Mario is just Mario.

149
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:23,323
Scott: What if in Mario Kart they made all the characters sort of like NASCAR and like yeah I'm good.

150
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:26,459
Scott: I'm uh you know riding around the track in a circle?

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,289
Scott: I Don't know, but you know they give them some attitude of some sort.

152
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,656
Scott: they could really flash it up some.

153
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:37,964
Rym: but yeah at any rate I don't really care about Nintendo's marketing campaign.

154
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:44,586
Scott: my main point of doing this news is to let anyone know who's thinking that Oh Camp Hyrule this cool secret Awesome thing that's sort of exclusive.

155
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:46,111
Scott: Don't even bother with it.

156
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,114
Scott: It's a waste of your time.

157
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,680
Rym: It's a secret to everybody.

158
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,848
Scott: Yeah, just don't don't care about it.

159
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:51,731
Scott: Don't worry about it.

160
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,320
Scott: You're not missing out if you're not in Camp Hyrule.

161
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,485
Scott: Go to real summer camp.

162
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,851
Scott: It's a thousand times better.

163
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,619
Rym: You know I've never been to summer camp.

164
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,660
Rym: Yeah, really pretty much no one where I lived went to summer camp.

165
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,383
Rym: Just it wasn't.

166
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:08,428
Rym: it was the thing where people were here like summer camp in a movie or on TV And literally none of the kids.

167
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,333
Rym: I knew knew what it was.

168
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:09,715
Scott: no one.

169
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:10,540
Scott: salute your shorts.

170
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,828
Scott: Yeah, that's what it was.

171
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,559
Rym: see I had band camp instead.

172
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,111
Scott: Imagine if it was salute your shorts last eight weeks.

173
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:18,355
Scott: How long did band camp last?

174
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:19,860
Rym: band camp was two intense weeks.

175
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:21,355
Scott: Yeah, so eight weeks.

176
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:21,820
Rym: I don't know.

177
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,977
Rym: I wanted to be at home with my video games and all my friends and my bike and my stuff.

178
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:31,348
Scott: yeah Well, it's the thing about summer camp is like you have your school friends And then you have your summer camp friends.

179
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:36,128
Scott: you get twice as much action plus You can have a lot more awesome action at summer camp.

180
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,011
Scott: That's not action.

181
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,840
Scott: You can have at home like what it's.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,767
Scott: It's only for summer camp people to know.

183
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:45,000
Rym: uh-huh well considering the ages of summer campers.

184
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,509
Rym: I doubt it's the things that I'm particularly interested in.

185
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:48,191
Scott: I don't know.

186
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:51,387
Scott: summer camp like ages go up to like 15 16 year olds.

187
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:55,010
Rym: uh Even so that's yeah.

188
00:12:55,473 --> 00:13:00,340
Rym: Yeah, anyway We've always been interested in packs, and we want to go to it.

189
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,800
Rym: I think it would probably be the perfect convention for me and Scott to go enjoy ourselves instead of you know Doing the things we do at conventions, and we just never get around to it.

190
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,179
Rym: We're always busy, or it's always the wrong time on the other side of the goddamn country.

191
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,420
Rym: Yes, stupid other side of the country.

192
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,939
Rym: Yeah, I mean maybe you in Europe who listen to our show to realize it.

193
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,100
Rym: But to get from where we live in New York to California is Washington State not California.

194
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:30,413
Rym: California's where the other stuff we want to go to is yes But why we have to get from New York to Washington?

195
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:41,246
Scott: Seattle Washington not Washington DC Which is easy to get to by train in like a couple hours, but Seattle Washington State on the other side of the country It's touching the other ocean.

196
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:42,931
Scott: We're touching the Atlantic Ocean.

197
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,316
Scott: They're touching the Pacific Ocean.

198
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,700
Scott: They're far away.

199
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,892
Scott: They're about as far away as we are from London.

200
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,039
Scott: ish kind of almost so.

201
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:58,392
Rym: Every time there's a PAX announcement it always something that says oh wow Rym You really should have been there, and you really should go there.

202
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,618
Scott: How many paxes have we missed?

203
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:00,059
Scott: like three?

204
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,540
Scott: We've missed all of them obviously obviously, but there's been a lot more than just one and they were all awesome.

205
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:06,599
Scott: We've missed all of them.

206
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:14,823
Rym: I mean everyone I mean like the anime con out west you know built itself up And then when it actually happened it failed to deliver Pax.

207
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:20,745
Rym: every year it builds up and builds up and then we don't go and then it happens and the news Afterward is always bad.

208
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,793
Rym: It was more awesome than you could have ever imagined.

209
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:24,660
Scott: I mean they got that omega-thon action.

210
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,192
Scott: They've got that awesome concert action.

211
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:32,152
Scott: They've got the Freaking video games and tabletop gaming galore.

212
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,060
Scott: I could buy just stay in the tabletop gaming all day.

213
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,066
Scott: They got more DS's than any con.

214
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:42,309
Scott: I've ever been to supposedly and I know all this and I totally believe it There's no doubt in my mind plus.

215
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:55,309
Scott: It's sort of like the new e3 for Consumer facing you know video game industry sort of dealer room action, so you got all that together and We don't get to go because it's too far away.

216
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,680
Rym: I have a feeling we're gonna go next year.

217
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,512
Rym: I think we're just gonna bite the bullet and force ourselves to no matter what.

218
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:11,159
Scott: I think we'll just get a hotel in frickin Seattle whatever and take an airplane and maybe stay over there and do some other stuff That's to do in Seattle and go to the packs and then come back.

219
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:21,479
Rym: But anyway, they have added yet another event there's and not only that but this event is attempting to break a world record Really world record for most DS's on at once.

220
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:27,707
Rym: Well, apparently they're going to have a all-con long con wide LARP.

221
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:33,600
Scott: Aha now if I don't want to play in the LARP and I want to go to the con you don't have to all right.

222
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,980
Rym: Apparently it's it's Terradrive live and there's a bunch of details here.

223
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,499
Rym: I'm not gonna read them because you probably don't care.

224
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:55,614
Rym: But basically they're gonna try to teach everyone the rules and apparently it's pretty simple and there's gonna be zones and stuff and a modified version of rock-paper-scissors with cards that give people power ups and things and You can get into clans and fight with people and take over territory and whatever.

225
00:15:55,634 --> 00:16:03,119
Rym: they haven't really said a lot yet But yeah, they're gonna try to teach everyone in line Thursday and Friday how to play and just kind of wing it from there.

226
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:11,420
Scott: Aha so, how will they verify if they have broken a world record for largest learn I imagine because they say they're actually gonna try to do the Guinness Book thing.

227
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,700
Rym: So they're probably gonna have someone there counting the number of people participating.

228
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:27,138
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, how do you know everyone's participating if you just go down the line of 20,000 people and say hi I've taught them all the LARP and then you know The people start out like a in line a plan a little bit and then they all kind of go

229
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:27,540
Rym: in.

230
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:37,602
Rym: Well, the way the Guinness Book works is that when they set a list of requirements and then they send judges And if those requirements are met then they award the award and that's it Uh-huh.

231
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:41,020
Rym: So obviously the judges are going to set some sort of threshold for parties.

232
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,120
Scott: I just wonder how what kind of requirements they'll be and how they'll verify that because it sounds pretty difficult to in a mask.

233
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,424
Scott: I got 20,000.

234
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,997
Rym: Scott will determine it is the Guinness Book is completely stupid bullshit.

235
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:52,860
Rym: I've always hated it.

236
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,002
Scott: Thank you for finally bringing up the point I was trying to make.

237
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,284
Rym: the Guinness Book is crap.

238
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:02,778
Rym: the world records in it are almost always crap except for the sports ones and I don't care about it at all.

239
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:14,395
Scott: And there's some verifiable ones like fattest guy as of this year Actually, they just weigh it and find unless they've changed They stopped doing anything that was an oddity of humanity because they thought that that encouraged.

240
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:15,819
Scott: but that was the only interesting part.

241
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:21,185
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so yeah, I just remember when I was a kid in elementary school We'd have the book club whatever.

242
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:23,920
Rym: you could order a bunch of books and I always ordered like Calvin and Hobbes books.

243
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:30,460
Rym: Everyone in my classes always every time only got the mad libs and the Guinness Book for that month or year or whatever.

244
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:34,220
Rym: Yeah, and no one ever bought any other books and I always thought they were all stupid.

245
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:43,267
Scott: I got real books and once I got a mad lib and other people got the Guinness Book and I would look and look at the picture of the fattest Guy and then I wouldn't actually buy it now.

246
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,875
Scott: and that was it plus the library.

247
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:50,339
Scott: the school library had some Guinness Books And I would look at the picture of the fattest guy in there or the tallest guy.

248
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,720
Rym: The thing is things like this can be cool.

249
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,181
Rym: I mean we malign LARPing a lot but most of that is just due to the fact that we went to school in Rochester New York.

250
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:08,622
Rym: the LARPing community in Rochester, New York around the Rochester Institute of Technology is by and large full of well Let me put it delicately Scary.

251
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,868
Rym: no scary ass motherfuckers.

252
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:13,355
Rym: Yeah, that's about as delicately as I can put it.

253
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,380
Scott: these people they do fuck mothers work.

254
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,540
Rym: Oh, you know the fact that that is actually true.

255
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:24,913
Rym: anyway Scary people we avoided them at all costs once we realized what these people were.

256
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,100
Rym: and I say what's with a lot of venom?

257
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:27,562
Scott: Yeah,

258
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:39,440
Rym: but there is a lot of good LARPing and back when I lived in Michigan I used to go to a lot of local gaming cons and I participated in a number of D&D based LARPs And while some of them sucked a lot of them were really really awesome.

259
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:44,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean LARPing isn't inherently bad like, you know, it's not like all LARP suck.

260
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:54,940
Scott: the problem is the vast majority of LARPs out there suck and it's actually Pretty difficult to make a LARP good, but it's not impossible and good LARPs do exist in many places.

261
00:18:55,131 --> 00:19:06,840
Rym: well the other thing gaming LARPs like LARPs at a gaming con tend to be awesome because they tend to be the weird ones like a Paranoia LARP or they tend to be something like this where it's a really light con-wide kind of ongoing.

262
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:09,280
Scott: Hey, I'm totally gonna say it's almost not even a LARP.

263
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,920
Scott: It's just sort of like a silly kind of game in a way, but yeah, I guess it counts.

264
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:13,659
Rym: It is a LARP.

265
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,220
Rym: I mean people are gonna have roles and there's gonna be territories and clans and whatever and you walk around your thing.

266
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:23,282
Rym: But I mean so you're in line and you see an enemy and you just happen to attack and have a little fight and then Keep going.

267
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,471
Scott: but a LARP at an anime con is not good.

268
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:26,556
Scott: It's very bad.

269
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:27,359
Scott: Do not do it.

270
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:37,250
Scott: It's pretty much just scary fan people living out their anime fantasies and trying to bring you into their anime fantasies or maybe Taking turns fulfilling each other's anime fantasies.

271
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,920
Scott: It's I don't know why cons have them fight an anime con.

272
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,663
Scott: I wouldn't have a LARP.

273
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:46,520
Rym: I'd be like, hey, well the thing is one they're popular - They can be run really well and the people are into that.

274
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:53,930
Rym: I mean, I don't like cosplay is terribly much even though I like cosplayers and I don't like masquerades very much Just because I've seen all the good ones.

275
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,714
Rym: I think in the world.

276
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:55,940
Rym: Yeah total ever.

277
00:19:56,322 --> 00:20:04,140
Rym: I don't think any anything will ever beat the ones I've seen maybe but You still gotta have met a con because a lot of the people there like them and they're big event.

278
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,960
Scott: I guess they do serve the purpose of keeping those scary people out of anything else while LARP is going on.

279
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:14,560
Rym: I wasn't going to say that outright but I was gonna spend a few minutes and eventually make that point a really roundabout way.

280
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,659
Scott: Well good now we can just get on with the show can't we?

281
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,945
Rym: Things of the day?

282
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:32,058
Rym: so I stumbled upon this kind of randomly but back in the day on the NES Maniac Mansion was one of my favorite games.

283
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,279
Scott: Maniac Mansion is a game I had heard the name of and I never really played it even though somehow I knew all about it.

284
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,587
Scott: But well never really played it or owned it.

285
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,460
Rym: that might have been due to the Nintendo power where they described many of the secrets.

286
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,290
Scott: I didn't have Nintendo power.

287
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:48,959
Rym: Oh, yeah, you're one of those heathens.

288
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,600
Scott: Yeah, so at any game pro until like sixth grade so and that was when there was already Sega Genesis action.

289
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,100
Scott: So, uh, I don't know how I know about Maniac Mansion.

290
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,662
Scott: I just do.

291
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:05,460
Rym: well Maniac Mansion is the microwave one of the most one of the more famous video games ever made.

292
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,367
Rym: I mean a lot of people have heard about it it.

293
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:13,469
Rym: it's a cult classic among numerous generations and sadly I never played it on a computer ever.

294
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,660
Rym: the first time I ever saw it was on the Nintendo Entertainment System

295
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:32,423
Scott: Basically for those you don't know I'm not gonna go in depth about this but Lucas ours the people who make you know Obviously Star Wars games and such they made back in the day a bunch of point-and-click adventure games such as day of the tentacle Indiana Jones and the Atlantis.

296
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,169
Scott: something you didn't realize.

297
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:41,788
Rym: the day of the tentacle was Maniac Mansion 2 basically Sam & Max Full throttle etc.

298
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:46,356
Scott: And they were just these point-and-click adventure games where you know You'd sort of click on the screen.

299
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:54,360
Rym: Oh the pirate one Monkey Island anyway, yes the games especially Maniac Mansion.

300
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,960
Rym: We're really kind of off-beaten Gooney and Maniac Mansion was really kind of dark and weird especially as a kid.

301
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:15,651
Rym: I mean walking into the house and you go into the kitchen, you know you're breaking into this mansion basically and suddenly when you get to the end of the kitchen this crazy old woman in a nurse's outfit sees you and starts screaming and chasing you and you freak out and I remember just looking at things.

302
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,600
Rym: There's weird stuff everywhere.

303
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:24,940
Rym: you can pick it all up and mess with it and The game wasn't really meant to be beaten on the first try because you could very easily make it impossible to win.

304
00:22:25,382 --> 00:22:26,647
Rym: the game was more one of those.

305
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:32,007
Rym: you explore the world you start to figure things out and Eventually you figure out how to beat the game.

306
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:35,580
Rym: and there were many many different ways to quote-unquote beat the game.

307
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:42,060
Scott: yeah, but basically it's all about exploring this wacky mansion and looking at all this weird stuff and trying to do weird stuff.

308
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:50,319
Scott: and There's a lot of weird things you could do and weird things you could encounter and it was just a lot of fun to Sort of poke all the bits and see what they all did.

309
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:52,060
Rym: So that's my things of the day.

310
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,246
Rym: We'll talk about these games in some show someday.

311
00:22:54,888 --> 00:23:02,274
Rym: our two speed runs of Maniac Mansion one on the computer and one On the NES and they do it in just under 10 minutes.

312
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:15,420
Rym: both of them Wow Yeah the thing is they look very different and granted part of that is the fact that of course Nintendo of America being fruitish as They were back then censored and replaced a lot of things in Maniac Mansion.

313
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,175
Scott: I mean Maniac Mansion was the only one of these games to ever come out on the NES.

314
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:24,840
Scott: all the rest of them just sort Of came out for like DOS and the PC and the max and not really anything else.

315
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:26,618
Scott: I guess that's because they had a mouse.

316
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:31,180
Rym: It was I mean, it was actually really hard to play Maniac Mansion on the NES.

317
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,328
Rym: I'll admit that it pretty much sucks.

318
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:36,480
Scott: If you want to play Maniac Mansion, seriously, you should get the PC version.

319
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:49,800
Scott: There's a thing called scum VM that you can get for free and then you can get the data files for all these different games By buying them, which is the only legal way and then you can play them on modern computer.

320
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:58,480
Rym: Well, I'm pretty sure that in day the tentacle if I recall correctly There is a place where you could end up booting up a computer and playing Maniac Mansion 1 in its entirety.

321
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:00,833
Scott: Wow, I did not know that.

322
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,039
Scott: I'll have to go check that out.

323
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,719
Rym: The one thing I want to point out I wouldn't recommend you watch the entire speedruns unless you're a masochist.

324
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:15,340
Rym: they're interesting in that they show you the quickest path to beat the game as far as I can see and They show you the differences in the graphics and the aesthetics and the music.

325
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:16,692
Rym: I'm just gonna point out the music.

326
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:21,480
Rym: you can Say what you will about the music or lack thereof and one or other of these versions.

327
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:23,627
Rym: The music did get really annoying though.

328
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:24,470
Rym: I remember as a kid.

329
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,637
Rym: I usually turned it off after about five minutes.

330
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:29,149
Rym: Yeah Granted it was.

331
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:33,240
Rym: I forget the term for it But the music wasn't just like theme music playing out of nowhere.

332
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:38,157
Rym: Every kid had a CD player or a tape player or something on him that you could turn on or off.

333
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:38,919
Rym: that played the music.

334
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:42,107
Scott: But they have CDs.

335
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,560
Scott: in those days, I don't remember I probably must have been a Walkman.

336
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,784
Rym: CDs were pretty old.

337
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,272
Rym: I had a CD player relatively early.

338
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,880
Scott: Yeah, but I mean this was like way early.

339
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,495
Scott: Yeah, this game didn't come on CD-ROM.

340
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:57,747
Scott: It came on floppy disk Wasn't until the later ones they came on CD-ROM.

341
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:00,034
Rym: remember CDs were out long before.

342
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:01,960
Rym: there were CD-ROMs with computer games on.

343
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:04,033
Scott: I know I know but you get my point.

344
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:05,060
Rym: Yeah, I do get your point.

345
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:09,000
Rym: But the other thing I'd like to point out is that these games are really fun.

346
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,589
Rym: If you're just playing through them and you're exploring it's all.

347
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,095
Scott: just try to play one of these games.

348
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,420
Scott: They're all great.

349
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,404
Scott: There's a reason that someone made the scum VM thing to allow us to play them in modern machines because they still get good games Worth playing.

350
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:33,909
Rym: but the thing is a speedrun of a game like this Almost makes the game look like shit because it skips all the interesting stuff and it's just run run run object Run run run object run object run object.

351
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,716
Rym: meteor in the edge of the launch into space game over.

352
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:50,440
Scott: Yep I guess if you all if you like playing these games after you play them all they're putting out new Sam and Max games in Sort of episodic fashion, but you can like buy at the store or on Steam like packs of all the episodes.

353
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:57,195
Scott: So if you're liking the Sam and Max Especially the old, you know the old one they got new ones that people are pretty pleased with.

354
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,800
Scott: apparently you can go for those.

355
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:03,433
Scott: Alright, so my thing of the day Rym you love the television, don't you?

356
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:05,680
Rym: Well the Intellivision - alright.

357
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:08,510
Scott: Anyway, this is a video for 1983 or 84 if I may.

358
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:15,151
Scott: Yes, when we were one or two years old.

359
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:31,960
Scott: if it were yes, and this video is Spa of and by some people at Mattel electronics home of the Intellivision, uh-huh, and Basically, it's a bunch of them just fooling around in the office making a silly video.

360
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:41,567
Scott: It's sort of like they knew YouTube was going to exist in the year 2007. so 23 years in advance there's 25 24 years in advance.

361
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,420
Scott: They decided to make this video knowing that one day it would be on YouTube for us to watch.

362
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:56,199
Scott: Where of a bunch of silly old-school video game programmers fooling around in the office making jokes Hating each other with water balloons being naked.

363
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:57,863
Rym: What was that?

364
00:26:57,924 --> 00:26:59,228
Scott: making fun of video games?

365
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,971
Rym: Well, what was that?

366
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:06,580
Scott: One of the guys is naked actually naked I'm not sure but you don't see any of his bits, but he could be naked under there.

367
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:15,386
Rym: See that that's very misleading because there are many pictures of me particularly in the ocean at the shore or back in high school In band where it looks like I'm naked.

368
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:29,494
Scott: basically, he's he's sitting in a chair at an at a table in a conference room and You can see his torso above the table and he's got his legs up on the table But his bottom and his bits are below the table in the seat.

369
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:32,906
Rym: I will wager I would got some shorts on that.

370
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,833
Rym: He's wearing some sort of speedo.

371
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:36,860
Rym: Maybe a one-piece bikini down there

372
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:53,977
Scott: Possibly but that the point is it's a funny video made in the olden times and it's got a lot of that old styling kind of early 80s computer nerd kind of humor, which is almost identical to YouTube current current day humor, so you should watch it.

373
00:27:54,339 --> 00:28:00,077
Rym: man I suddenly have this urge to get my grandpa to send me the old and television too so I can play those games in a Format that works.

374
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:05,575
Scott: Yeah, but my favorite part actually is the guy when he starts talking about all that.

375
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:07,180
Scott: there's a video game for everything.

376
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,589
Scott: What video game could we possibly make next?

377
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:14,039
Scott: and he's got just this pile of all these video game boxes And he's throwing them all around.

378
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:17,032
Rym: They made a lot of games for the in television.

379
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,920
Scott: It's like every sport imaginable.

380
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,140
Scott: curling.

381
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:22,608
Rym: Yeah, I played a curling game.

382
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:23,913
Scott: I know it's not good.

383
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:25,679
Scott: It's not real curling.

384
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:26,120
Scott: It's not good.

385
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,164
Scott: How can fake curling be?

386
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:29,130
Rym: curling is not curling so pretty fun smart.

387
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:29,873
Rym: It's interesting.

388
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:30,816
Scott: No, not really.

389
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,599
Rym: Yeah, it is now.

390
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:38,680
Scott: If you ever played it once when a time when back in the day what day I don't remember.

391
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:40,077
Rym: How do you curl Scott?

392
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:50,840
Scott: Yeah for one person takes the the rock and you try to throw the rock down the ice and some other people with the brooms go Broom, broom, broom, broom, broom, and they want the rock to stop in the in the bullseye area.

393
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,313
Scott: But then another person throws a rock and they might bump you out.

394
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,859
Scott: So it's like shuffleboard with ice.

395
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:57,846
Rym: What is the up rooming?

396
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:02,200
Scott: do it makes it the the the rock either go faster or slower?

397
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,066
Scott: It sort of makes the ice, you know You can broom the ice in a certain way to sort of guide The rock to where you want it to be.

398
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:13,040
Rym: most of what you've said could be derived from common knowledge of the sport.

399
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:15,768
Rym: I don't believe for a second you've ever curled.

400
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:16,590
Scott: All righty.

401
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,694
Rym: I'm gonna call you out.

402
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:19,238
Scott: I curled one time.

403
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,291
Rym: when One time give me a year.

404
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:29,926
Rym: Give me a range of years Late 90s late 9 between 95 and 98.

405
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:31,200
Rym: In what circumstances?

406
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,440
Scott: My friend's dad was like all about the curling.

407
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,071
Scott: So one time I just happened to be there and I curled.

408
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:39,496
Rym: one time happened to be there.

409
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,820
Rym: where did he have a curling rink?

410
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,680
Scott: Yeah, there's a. there was a the wonderland of ice place.

411
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,740
Scott: They they curl on the the ice that they usually play hockey on the curling time.

412
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,630
Rym: So you went there with the family and then you curled with the dead?

413
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,025
Scott: No, I rolled I threw the rock one time Exactly, uh-huh.

414
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:55,808
Scott: That was it.

415
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,052
Scott: And I said, uh-huh.

416
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,320
Scott: It's shuffleboard might as well be shuffleboard, which is better.

417
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,350
Scott: So seeing as we're all back into the FPS actions.

418
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:04,613
Scott: We remembered.

419
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:06,117
Scott: Hey, there are some FPS.

420
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,428
Scott: as we played back in the day I wonder if we can play those.

421
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:12,139
Scott: FPS is again in addition to you know counter-strike.

422
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:26,356
Rym: Yeah I think part of it with at least terms of the show was that like Alex was over and you two were in the living room talking about FPS and whatever and I was in the other room and natural selection came up and then Suddenly I ran into the room and said we never did a show on this did we?

423
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,560
Scott: I guess not.

424
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:29,778
Scott: Let me search again to make sure.

425
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,777
Scott: Sure, we never done a show a natural selection and not the Darwin kind and sure enough we hadn't.

426
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,798
Rym: scarily enough I mean, this is one of my favorite games ever.

427
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:52,075
Scott: actually, I just searched and apparently we have mentioned the game in the show before because once I did a news about how there Might be dynamic infestation in the sequel remember that video.

428
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:52,336
Rym: Yeah.

429
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:53,178
Rym: I remember that video.

430
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:53,660
Rym: It's pretty cool.

431
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:54,624
Scott: It's pretty cool.

432
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,273
Scott: But who knows if we'll ever see that.

433
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:57,620
Rym: I don't know why you searched for that.

434
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,673
Rym: We already did that, you know weeks ago when we decided to do this show.

435
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,022
Scott: I just so I didn't search I wasn't there I don't remember.

436
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,206
Scott: Oh, well, whatever.

437
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:08,560
Rym: Yeah natural selection is a mod to the FPS half-life.

438
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:12,720
Scott: Yes, and you know calling it a mod is sort of crazy.

439
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,180
Scott: I mean technically speaking it is a mod.

440
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,800
Scott: It uses the half-life one engine and creates a different game on top of that engine.

441
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,720
Scott: But more strictly speaking, this is more like a total conversion of half-life.

442
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:33,788
Scott: I mean only the most expert of FPS players if you gave them this game would recognize that it was actually Half-life 1 not half-life 2.

443
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:43,634
Rym: half-life 1 the game from like the 90s now It was made by a guy named Charlie Cleveland, but most people in the world know him as Flaira Flayra, yep.

444
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:52,903
Rym: I think he eventually went on to found the company that's now unknown worlds, which is Theoretically working on natural selection 2 and natural selection for the source engine.

445
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:56,719
Rym: the odds of natural selection 2 coming out are Pretty low.

446
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:03,930
Scott: I'm gonna say yeah I mean They're supposedly working on it and once in a while there's drips and drabs of news and they say stuff.

447
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,005
Scott: But I've never seen anything substantial other than that dynamic infestation video.

448
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:12,136
Scott: That was a news back in 2005.

449
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:20,030
Scott: Oh No December 5th 2006. but yeah, I'm not getting my hopes up for any more natural selection.

450
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,833
Scott: I'm just gonna be happy with the natural selection We've already got.

451
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:28,660
Rym: now the thing is I mean I say this is one of my favorite games ever and I think Scott will agree On that point, but it's a pretty good FPS.

452
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,132
Scott: I gotta tell you that I mean, it's one of those games You know.

453
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:41,313
Rym: periodically like we talk about anime and certain shows like Ava bebop eska flown a lay They just try gun they come up again and again and again and they're just they're timeless They never die.

454
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:47,350
Rym: They're said such an influence on us and in video games the same way and in FPS is particularly.

455
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:55,744
Scott: It's pretty much counter-strike natural selection tribes - pretty much the thing about natural selection is.

456
00:32:55,804 --> 00:33:02,250
Scott: it's one of those things where someone comes up with a Genius idea and it's maybe it's an idea that a lot of people have come up with before.

457
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:08,470
Scott: Let me tell you this is an idea that a lot of people have come up with before But no one is able to execute the idea.

458
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,614
Scott: No one does it like.

459
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,704
Scott: for example the idea of dig was an idea that slash dot.

460
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:18,669
Scott: people had for years and years and years And years, but no one actually did it, you know, or did it successfully for the longest time?

461
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:30,073
Scott: Natural selection is pretty much the only successful implementation as far as I'm concerned of an RTS plus FPS ever and it's a really good Implementation of that.

462
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:34,005
Scott: somewhat obvious, but everyone recognizes the awesomeness idea.

463
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:49,392
Rym: So let's describe the game a little bit Basically, it's an FPS straight up, but it's asymmetric and there are two teams the aliens the Cara the infestation Whatever you want to call them and the Marines the humans the quote-unquote good guys You

464
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:56,330
Scott: can tell this is based on the the movies You know with the aliens and the spitting and that and the stomach exploding in the such.

465
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,729
Scott: Yeah, now it's that kind of theme in the game.

466
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:04,310
Rym: I mean, you're pretty much gonna be sure that that is definitely an influence when you see the century turret.

467
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,329
Scott: Yeah, and you know some of the guns.

468
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:21,447
Rym: now a lot of games that are FPS is of two or three sides and they're asymmetric like pirates Vikings Knights for each side as Different but equal powers and as a result, they have different advantages and disadvantages even counter-strike terrorists counter-terrorists.

469
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:24,868
Scott: They have different weapons You know, they're not exactly the same but they're.

470
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,909
Scott: you know One team is not better than the other team.

471
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:44,858
Rym: Natural selection takes it one step further and that not only are the teams themselves in terms of their capabilities Completely different and asymmetric but the way you play the game the way you see the game and the way you interact with the game on a Fundamental level are completely different.

472
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:45,781
Scott: Yeah.

473
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,949
Scott: I mean it's really not like any other FPS you're gonna play.

474
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:58,330
Scott: I mean basically what it comes down to is The aliens when they play in a game of natural selection are trying to kill all the Marines.

475
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,510
Scott: They want to spread their alien infestation around the entire map and eat all the Marines and eat all the marine equipment.

476
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:17,716
Scott: And if they can destroy all of the Marines important machines and eat all the Marines The Marines can't teleport in and the aliens have conquered that place and they can infest it with aliens all they want with no interference Yep.

477
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:25,070
Rym: So basically if the last marine dies and there's no way for anyone to respond The game is over and the Marines the Marines don't respawn.

478
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:29,350
Scott: They have these teleporters and new Marines are teleported in from marine base.

479
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:34,370
Scott: Also, the Marines are trying to clean out the alien infestation.

480
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:46,548
Scott: They will not be satisfied until all of the aliens and all the alien hives are destroyed so that they can use this You know marine, you know human facility for its original intended purpose.

481
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:52,330
Rym: again Obviously, it's some sort of space base that was taken over by the aliens and you're coming to save everybody.

482
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,269
Scott: There's a lot of different bases and things.

483
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,988
Rym: You find out that oh everybody's dead.

484
00:35:57,008 --> 00:36:01,249
Rym: now We just got a flamethrower over the place and then put more scientists here and hope this never happens again.

485
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:01,912
Scott: Yep.

486
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,498
Rym: Now which one should we talk about?

487
00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:06,670
Rym: first because I think the Marines and the aliens are equally interesting.

488
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:07,820
Scott: They are equally interested.

489
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:28,763
Scott: That's part of what makes this game Awesome is usually when you have an asymmetric game where you have two or more teams that are so drastically different you find people Really want to stick with just sort of one side like people playing World of Warcraft, you know I mean everyone likes the different teams in World of Warcraft or Starcraft But any particular person likes to stick with just one.

490
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:32,983
Scott: usually I mean you find a Zerg guy He's all Zerg or it's really like Warhammer.

491
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:42,261
Scott: people pick one and they stick with it But that's probably because of money mostly but in natural selection people who play They most of them play both sides and they don't really mind.

492
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:43,586
Scott: It's not like ah shit.

493
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:44,710
Scott: I'm on aliens crap.

494
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,874
Scott: It's like alright aliens.

495
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:46,999
Scott: Alright Marines, whatever.

496
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:47,641
Scott: It's all good.

497
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,990
Scott: Even though the two teams are so different.

498
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,617
Rym: They're basically different games though.

499
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:54,610
Rym: I will say there is one big exception to that and that is the commanders.

500
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:56,810
Rym: Yes, but they're reading of their self.

501
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,530
Rym: Let's talk about the Marines first because that you mentioned the RTS FPS and yes, I think that alone.

502
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:05,581
Rym: So, I mean that's what sold me on the game before I even knew anything else.

503
00:37:05,903 --> 00:37:06,043
Rym: Yep.

504
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,750
Scott: So the way the Marines work is.

505
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:15,090
Scott: They spawn into the map and their Marines and they walk around and they have guns and it's like playing a normal FPS.

506
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,100
Scott: You have a machine gun a light machine gun.

507
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,326
Scott: It's not very powerful, but it is.

508
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:19,130
Scott: it is pretty good.

509
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:27,520
Scott: You got a pistol and a knife and you can sort of you have a. you can use your use button to sort of work Different machines and that's you walk around the map.

510
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,548
Scott: You're trying to kill aliens and such.

511
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,597
Rym: now There's one chair this big machine.

512
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,660
Rym: that's sitting there in the room.

513
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,849
Scott: you start in and that's the command chair and whoever goes and sits In that chair is playing a different game from everybody else what they sit in that chair.

514
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,568
Scott: Suddenly they're playing an RTS.

515
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:52,424
Scott: They look at the map that the FPS map the same map that you everyone else is playing an FPS on and they see it with an overhead view and they have.

516
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:59,930
Scott: it looks a lot like Starcraft and you could build things on the map and you have resources that you can spend and earn on different things.

517
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:04,869
Rym: You can group up Marines and give them a waypoint and then the game will tell you when they get there.

518
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:13,630
Rym: Yeah, humans you're playing with are no longer FPS and humans as far as you you're concerned They're just units that you have at your disposal.

519
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:19,937
Scott: But unlike a game like command and conquer where the units do exactly what you say The units are real people.

520
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:24,033
Scott: each single one is a real person playing an FPS and you know they might suck.

521
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:30,259
Scott: their individual skill determines whether they'll win or lose a lot of the time and They might not follow your orders.

522
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:31,344
Scott: They might be incompetent.

523
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:40,609
Scott: They might follow your orders too You know, so it's imagine if when you're playing command and conquer every guy that you gave an order to was a real person playing an FPS.

524
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:45,527
Rym: The nice thing is though while they might not listen to you sometimes and sometimes just there's problems.

525
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:52,590
Rym: at least Every individual marine will get out of the way of something dangerous if it's right there and coming to kill him.

526
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:57,789
Rym: Yes, they will do that and conquer not so much and I lost a lot of men to my own harvesters.

527
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:12,436
Scott: Okay, so the commander basically what he tries to do is first the goal unless they have a crazy strategy and not going to talk about crazy strategies in this game because there are many is To get more resources.

528
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:16,716
Scott: and the way you do this is there are certain points on the map which everyone knows where they are.

529
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:34,156
Scott: once you know the maps where there are resource nodes and The the commander can say alright I'm gonna spend X resources to build a resource node there and a resource node appears, you know a resource harvesting thing appears on the node and That isn't enough.

530
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:37,090
Scott: because if that if it was that easy, what would be the point of the game?

531
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,023
Scott: You know the guy would just build resource nodes all over the map right at the beginning.

532
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,229
Scott: get all the resources win.

533
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:45,970
Rym: Well, remember what Scott's saying applies to any structure that the commander can build ever.

534
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:53,450
Scott: Yeah, when he builds the resource node or any other structure Marines have to go over to it and make it work.

535
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:59,188
Scott: They have to go stand next to it and push a button on it in order to fix it and turn it on and it Takes a while.

536
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:01,383
Scott: So you build a resource node.

537
00:40:01,423 --> 00:40:08,789
Scott: you're gonna need Marines Standing next to it to make it work to defend it from being eaten by aliens before it starts working etc, etc, etc.

538
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:13,785
Rym: Now this really really creates an interesting game first.

539
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,190
Rym: We'll talk about from the players perspective.

540
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:22,426
Rym: So you spawn and you're in this really dark world with weird music and there's noises all around.

541
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:28,153
Rym: the atmospheric effects in these games are Absolutely amazing.

542
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:29,176
Scott: for half-life 1.

543
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:33,730
Rym: they're double amazing maps are so well made and so perfect.

544
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:41,502
Scott: I think they're the best maps in all of FPS is period pretty much and So you get up and someone's elected the commander and they start building stuff.

545
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,647
Rym: They secure the base.

546
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:43,530
Rym: They build some stuff.

547
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:48,407
Rym: maybe they build a shotgun and they give it to the player that they knew from the previous game is really good.

548
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:53,424
Rym: and then You go out and it'll get divided into teams like you three.

549
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:54,990
Rym: go to this waypoint.

550
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:59,128
Rym: Wait for me to build a resource tower build it and defend it until I tell you.

551
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:06,670
Rym: otherwise You three go build this resource tower then go to this other point and wait for further orders defending that point at all costs.

552
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,650
Rym: Yeah, you stand and watch that hallway if anyone comes yelling scream granted That's how it's supposed to work on paper.

553
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:16,969
Scott: And if you practice with like a team for a long time, it will work like that.

554
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,602
Scott: But in general pickup games, it doesn't work like that.

555
00:41:20,763 --> 00:41:26,443
Rym: actually now that I've been playing again It works like that almost all the time really everyone listens to the commander.

556
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:34,349
Rym: The commander is God, uh-huh granted I think it's just that the game's been out so long that it's mostly Hardcore players and newbies who really want to get into the game.

557
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,229
Scott: All right.

558
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,326
Scott: But anyway You go out and you stand next to this resource point and it sort of appears out of nowhere.

559
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:42,812
Scott: and now you're holding on To it.

560
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:47,646
Scott: and while you're holding on to it trying to turn it on and make it work to get your team more resources You can win.

561
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:49,430
Scott: Aliens might be coming.

562
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:57,423
Rym: so usually you got like two guys building it and one guy standing off to the side with a shitty machine gun kind of nervous looking around.

563
00:41:57,787 --> 00:42:05,836
Rym: because Basically, whenever you're walking around anywhere as a marine if you are alone You're probably Already dead.

564
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:11,886
Rym: You just don't realize it yet because The aliens just come out of nowhere and they wait for you in ambush.

565
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:12,970
Rym: You go around a corner.

566
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:14,580
Rym: You're being real careful.

567
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,069
Rym: You're swinging your machine gun around.

568
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:21,234
Rym: Suddenly you hear tick tick tick tick tick and before you can finish trying Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

569
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:21,735
Rym: You're done.

570
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:22,598
Rym: You're dead.

571
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:23,781
Rym: You tell the commander.

572
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,850
Rym: There's some skulks over in data processing.

573
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:28,689
Scott: Yeah I like how it on the maps.

574
00:42:29,272 --> 00:42:32,850
Scott: Every part of the map has a name and that name shows up on your screen.

575
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,254
Scott: So you always know where you are.

576
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:39,270
Scott: so you can learn the maps and easily communicate about different parts of the map to your team.

577
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,359
Scott: Like, you know up guys in data guys and sensory bad guys in.

578
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,100
Rym: you know dark hallway and Parts of the map are worth more than other parts.

579
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,230
Rym: and there's choke points and there's vents.

580
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:56,310
Scott: Yeah, this place there's like some of the maps have double res where there's a spot that has two resource nodes.

581
00:42:56,812 --> 00:43:01,870
Scott: You know some of the place that the alien hives can only be built in three different locations.

582
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:04,839
Scott: So, you know where those those are pretty important spots.

583
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,350
Scott: and the place where the marine base starts is also pretty important.

584
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,770
Rym: So it's really scary walking around.

585
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:15,426
Rym: But the fun part is it's not like counter-strike or FPS and most people are used to.

586
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:19,542
Rym: you move Really slow and you make a lot of noise.

587
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:24,886
Rym: if you don't want to make a lot of noise You hold down shift or whatever and you walk really slow.

588
00:43:24,907 --> 00:43:27,416
Rym: you go so slow It's almost painful and furthermore.

589
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:31,350
Rym: I wish more games did this counter-strike would be a lot better if they did this.

590
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:37,050
Rym: In natural selection you move at your normal speed when you're walking forward or turn it or whatever.

591
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:41,810
Rym: But if you were trying to walk backwards while looking behind you you move slow.

592
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:50,049
Rym: Yep, so that means instead of you know in any counter-strike game You're backing away from an enemy shooting and that's just what you do in this game.

593
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:51,394
Rym: You have a choice.

594
00:43:51,455 --> 00:44:01,350
Rym: the moment aliens come either stand your ground and shoot Retreat slowly shooting behind you or shooting in front of you you're walking back.

595
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,010
Rym: Yeah, you're walking backwards, but you're still shooting back in the direction.

596
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:11,055
Scott: Yes, if you try to walk backwards and shoot forwards You will walk insanely slow Even if you're not trying to shoot.

597
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:14,210
Scott: walking backwards is twice as more than twice as slow as walking.

598
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,865
Rym: So as a result when something horrible suddenly happens, like you think you're good.

599
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,970
Rym: You almost built the phase gate.

600
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,613
Rym: You've got four Marines with you and suddenly three fades run into the room and everyone's going fade fade Fuck.

601
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:26,540
Rym: they got an early fade.

602
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:26,923
Rym: Fuck.

603
00:44:26,943 --> 00:44:27,629
Rym: They got a second eye.

604
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:36,210
Rym: But at that moment a lot of Marines you'll see him they know they can't win.

605
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:37,935
Rym: They're not even gonna try to retreat.

606
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,142
Rym: retreat in an orderly fashion because they don't want to die.

607
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:42,308
Rym: they turn around and run.

608
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:51,870
Scott: Usually that's not enough But it's it's a lot faster than trying to back up while shooting your piddly pop gun at this giant nasty alien.

609
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:56,350
Rym: It makes the game a lot more realistic and a lot more immersive and a lot more frightening.

610
00:44:56,551 --> 00:45:05,550
Scott: Yeah, so basically as the Marines you're trying to build a lot of structures Which means you need Marines to go to where the structures are build them defend them from aliens.

611
00:45:06,057 --> 00:45:15,820
Scott: Get a lot of resource see that you can build most of the structures in your base where they'll be relatively well defended and you can build defensive things like Automatic turrets Allah aliens the movie and such.

612
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:19,910
Scott: that will defend your structures when when Marines aren't there to do it You know themselves.

613
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:41,220
Scott: But the resource nodes are all around the map and you need to go and get them in order to have enough resource points For the commander to pay for all those important things and you need to pay for all those important things or else Marines won't be able to get better guns and they won't be able to get better armor and they won't be able to get better Anything and aliens will own you.

614
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:50,270
Scott: and basically you're just trying to get enough resources To get enough upgrades to your weapons and armor to be able to go out and destroy the aliens without worrying about it.

615
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:58,561
Scott: You know because if you just go out there with the stuff you start the game with they're gonna bite you Unless you're really really good, which is unlikely.

616
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:02,376
Rym: now the commander has I mean, there's all this stuff He has to deal with it.

617
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,030
Rym: You don't really see but he has a tech tree.

618
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,226
Scott: He spends resources on different things and eventually basically playing an RTS.

619
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:16,410
Rym: Yeah, I mean he builds up Research and eventually get shotguns and the super machine guns and grenade launchers and jetpacks and the super awesome heavy armor.

620
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:25,254
Scott: Yeah and there's also other stuff he can buy like That you might not realize like the sensors that will tell you where aliens are or the beacon Which will.

621
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:30,384
Scott: which if all the humans get when you die as a human They're these teleporters that you teleport in.

622
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,350
Scott: I talked about them already.

623
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:36,270
Scott: They're basically the spawn points and if you have no spawn points left, no one can spawn into the map.

624
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:44,317
Scott: So what sometimes will happen is they'll be maybe two or three spawn points and all the humans will die because they rushed an alien Hive and they all got killed.

625
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:51,569
Scott: and they'll spawn in kind of slowly You know because they can only spawn in at a certain number of Marines per second.

626
00:46:52,050 --> 00:47:08,210
Scott: There's per minute per spawn point and the beacon is one of the things the commander can use to say everyone spawns Who's dead immediately and it's good for the like the last ditch when the aliens are in the base and everyone died Suddenly everyone spawns in the base and maybe you'll have enough to push the aliens.

627
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,213
Rym: That's one thing about natural selection that makes this game So great.

628
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:16,106
Rym: is that in a lot of like once you've lost a game, you know You've lost and now crap.

629
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:25,470
Rym: now I got a way for this to play out whatever and people to stop caring in this game Even though you'll know you've lost a good five or six minutes before it finally happens.

630
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:28,610
Rym: You lost the double res you try to retake it and you failed.

631
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,189
Rym: You know the aliens have the whole eastern half of the map.

632
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,377
Rym: You're basically being defensive.

633
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,930
Rym: all your expeditions out fail all the scouts you send out get killed.

634
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:43,410
Rym: Eventually, the Marines kind of realize they're all gonna die and the commander realizes this and you move into this.

635
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:46,098
Rym: It's weird because you don't feel bad about it.

636
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:49,128
Rym: You just realize that now it's time for the last.

637
00:47:49,228 --> 00:47:57,050
Rym: stand Yeah and you start just Barricading yourselves in and trying to live as long as possible and it's just as fun as when you're winning.

638
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:58,274
Scott: I think part of it.

639
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:12,429
Scott: what it is is that the game makes you feel as if you've always got a chance like I Could sneak out all alone get into a place if there's no aliens there and totally owned with my little knife I could cut up their whole hive and I've done it before it happens.

640
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:28,390
Scott: It's not common But there's always this crazy chance that with some covert mission of like two Marines with knives Going out there maybe a little help from the commander Maybe a shotgun they can totally turn the game around or at least make a setback for the aliens.

641
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:40,110
Rym: Yep or maybe you defend it so well and you Defend it early enough when you realize the tide was against you and you held out long enough to build out the resources To suddenly make a heavy train and March your asses out.

642
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:46,590
Scott: I think what it is is that even if you've already lost you are still able to sort of hold the enemy back.

643
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,779
Scott: It's not like you've lost and then you're crushed.

644
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,724
Scott: and because you still have the ability to hold them back You really feel like you can make a difference.

645
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:59,348
Scott: if you can hold them back Why can't you push them back, you know, and if they decide to suck then you kind of can.

646
00:48:59,368 --> 00:48:59,910
Scott: sometimes

647
00:49:00,412 --> 00:49:08,844
Rym: You really start to develop a camaraderie with the people on your team because everyone's voice chatting pretty much Almost everyone who plays this game voice chats and you hear people talking and it's

648
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,446
Scott: necessary

649
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:13,119
Rym: commander given orders and you really start to feel like you're a part of something.

650
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:15,255
Rym: and it's really scary.

651
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:24,931
Rym: when you're out with a team and the team gets taken out by a sudden fade and It's just you and you survive because you hit around the corner or the team got taken out around the corner and you were guarding the rear.

652
00:49:24,952 --> 00:49:28,003
Scott: then or when you decide on your own that you're gonna you just gonna take.

653
00:49:28,144 --> 00:49:40,632
Scott: you're gonna take your welder and open up This vent with your welder and you're gonna sneak through these vents where you know Nobody's there and it's all dark and there's no one in there not even aliens because it was a vent that was welded shut You know.

654
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:47,054
Scott: and then you're sneaking through the secret way all alone and it's gonna come out who knows where on the map and there's Stuff there.

655
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:47,798
Scott: Who knows what?

656
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,175
Scott: and you're gonna open up the other end with your welder and But a single marine.

657
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:58,130
Rym: and if you if an alien comes you're dead and there's almost nothing you can do about it.

658
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:01,762
Scott: It's right, but if no aliens come you can fuck shit up.

659
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:02,464
Rym: Yeah.

660
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:04,170
Scott: All right, so let's talk about the aliens.

661
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:06,210
Rym: Well, I got one more thing to say about the Marines.

662
00:50:06,532 --> 00:50:08,103
Rym: I the way the guns work.

663
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:13,910
Rym: not gonna go into details But unlike counter-strike where you know, you got to hit the head pick pick pick and double tap.

664
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:26,870
Rym: This is a game much like certain scenes in certain movies involving chain guns where the light machine gun your primary weapon Shoots a fucking lot of bullets really fast in a general direction, but they're kind of weak.

665
00:50:27,205 --> 00:50:32,390
Rym: No But the thing is the big gun shoots a bunch more bullets in a general directions.

666
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:37,425
Scott: It's big bullets like freaking imagine like Desert Eagle bullets like on a chain.

667
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:39,270
Rym: just damn the guns are ludicrous.

668
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:44,828
Rym: The point is that when you fire it's not like I got to walk slowly and like pick the guy off.

669
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:53,209
Rym: all realistically It is aliens the movie guns where you run down the hall with your minigun Blowing shit up and hoping you don't die.

670
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,756
Scott: There's a grenade launcher that shoots for.

671
00:50:55,877 --> 00:51:07,936
Scott: it's basically a revolver that holds four grenades and it's like doom doom doom doom And then you reload it kind of slowly and carefully, but when you fire those four grenades God damn Do you fire four fucking grenades.

672
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:11,630
Rym: the visceral feeling you get when you fire any weapon in this game is?

673
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,770
Rym: Amazing because it's basically point and shoot and empty your clip.

674
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:18,561
Rym: You pretty much empty your clip every time you shoot the other.

675
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:19,986
Scott: the other things the commander can buy.

676
00:51:20,006 --> 00:51:25,510
Scott: if you're the heavy armor in The jetpack, let's just talk about this for a second the heavy armor, but you can't have them both at the same time.

677
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,272
Scott: It's one or the other.

678
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:30,564
Scott: the heavy armor basically makes you really hard to kill.

679
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:49,391
Scott: aliens will have a seriously difficult Time killing you because you have so much armor on and plus they usually give you a welder with a heavy armor Which lets you repair someone else's armor, and they repair your armor, so you're basically when you have a train It's called a heavy train a whole bunch of guys in heavy armor lined up with welders and guns Which

680
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:51,390
Rym: is generally the goal of any commander?

681
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:57,998
Scott: It's really hard for any aliens to fuck with that and they just march around the map in a group destroying Everything like.

682
00:51:58,018 --> 00:51:59,550
Scott: it's just a big alien cleanup.

683
00:51:59,610 --> 00:51:59,891
Scott: But then

684
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:12,655
Rym: again the aliens can win because if the chain like say they realize the chains coming and they have one onos and they Send him in the middle of the chain and the chain splits in two and then they start picking off the stragglers one by one Which is actually kind of easy to do.

685
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:18,376
Rym: yeah a heavy by himself is just as dead as an unarmored guy by himself Depending on how strong the aliens are.

686
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,578
Scott: but anyway yet the heavy armor you walk really slow But you're a freaking.

687
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,530
Scott: it's like freaking robot armor.

688
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:26,909
Scott: You're dangerous as all hell.

689
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:30,806
Scott: Then the jetpack is slightly different because you don't have the heavy armor.

690
00:52:30,826 --> 00:52:35,250
Scott: when you have the jetpack You're pretty easy to kill just as easy to kill as anything else.

691
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:43,221
Scott: But you can fly around and move really fast all over the place like crazy And it's kind of difficult to control the jetpack.

692
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:54,690
Scott: it takes a lot of practice with the jump button and such But once you've got the hang of it You can fly around with your mad skills and basically zoom past aliens and go straight for the hive and start fucking it up.

693
00:52:54,890 --> 00:53:04,899
Scott: Or you know flying aliens can't escape you by hiding in vents and places and you can fly around getting otherwise Difficult to reach things and just rape it them apart.

694
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:06,885
Rym: now the aliens.

695
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:11,841
Rym: playing as an alien Like I said is basically a completely different game.

696
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,987
Scott: It's really silly and awesome.

697
00:53:14,248 --> 00:53:15,842
Rym: first off There's no commander.

698
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:26,730
Rym: instead There's a hive mind and the way that works is you get a bunch of information constantly Visually and audibly About the state of your fellow aliens and the state of the state of the game.

699
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:40,897
Rym: So you can see in the distance all these kind of glowing waypoints all your alien friends all your alien structures where your hives are all this stuff and you hear noises and sounds that tell you things like an alien is under attack.

700
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:43,326
Rym: and then you see that alien blinking red and you know where they are.

701
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:48,122
Rym: or Structures under attack and you know that the Marines are attacking some alien structure somewhere.

702
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:50,330
Scott: or there is no commander on the alien team.

703
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,494
Scott: Everyone is the same.

704
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,096
Scott: You're all.

705
00:53:52,257 --> 00:53:53,301
Scott: basically it does.

706
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:55,930
Scott: there's no difference between one alien player and another alien.

707
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:04,092
Rym: Everyone gets all the same information and the players just by talking come to a general consensus as to how to act based on that Information.

708
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:04,313
Rym: Yep.

709
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:07,870
Scott: Now you might be saying well your team gets resources, right?

710
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,733
Scott: Yes, you do.

711
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:11,262
Scott: you are competing for the same resource nodes.

712
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:12,788
Scott: The Marines are competing for.

713
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:18,566
Scott: however What happens is instead of the resource is going to one alien who decides so they will be spent.

714
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:28,030
Scott: they are divided up semi-evenly according to some algorithm amongst all the players and everyone can spend their share of the resources and the way they see fit.

715
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:29,555
Rym: Now the aliens.

716
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:33,590
Rym: you start as everyone starts to the same little alien and you get one of three hive locations.

717
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:40,590
Rym: You all start there and then this voice says cleanse the intruders and then you run off your little skulk and skulks.

718
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:51,389
Rym: Basically, I have one thing they can do but I just go bitey bitey bitey bitey bitey bitey bitey bitey bitey Big mouth, that's all it is.

719
00:54:52,832 --> 00:55:00,256
Scott: And you're pretty small and you're really fast and you're hard for Marines to kill and you can go on the walls Without doing it.

720
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:01,986
Scott: You just walk on the walls or the ceilings.

721
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:02,590
Scott: It doesn't matter.

722
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:18,526
Rym: so generally what you do is the game starts and the aliens either all rush the Marines start and there's this sudden immediate melee at the start of the game where and then it kind of evens out into battle lines or The aliens kind of scatter and they set up ambushes.

723
00:55:18,546 --> 00:55:19,270
Rym: That's what I usually do.

724
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,674
Rym: they'll be like three skulks you

725
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:33,288
Scott: hide you go to like two doors away from the Marine base near one of the resource points and You wait for a marine to come by and you're hiding up in the ceiling in like a dark crevice And he's that marine is gonna walk right under you.

726
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:37,306
Scott: So you just wait for him to walk through the doorway and he keeps walking.

727
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:38,919
Scott: He doesn't hear you He doesn't see you.

728
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,890
Scott: you're hiding in the dark.

729
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:48,088
Scott: You're a little tiny alien in the ceiling and after he walks by you you fall down off the ceiling Go up behind him and bite his butt right off.

730
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:51,137
Rym: just Yeah, it takes like one or two bites to kill.

731
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:57,521
Scott: and it's kind of weird because playing as the Marines aliens are scary and dangerous Like whoa shits like in the movie aliens.

732
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:02,530
Scott: playing as the aliens They're kind of silly and happy like buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy buddy.

733
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:04,840
Rym: I feel really sympathetic toward the aliens.

734
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:06,468
Rym: when I'm like when I'm playing an alien.

735
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:06,950
Rym: I like him.

736
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:07,796
Rym: I like him a lot.

737
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:09,589
Rym: those fucking Marines should leave him alone.

738
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:14,148
Rym: But when I'm a marine aliens are scary and they kill me immediately.

739
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:15,415
Scott: aliens Just want to have fun.

740
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:20,216
Rym: Let me tell you now think of this when you're a marine Aliens just kill you if you're alone.

741
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:24,210
Rym: when you're an alien if a marine sees you you're pretty much dead.

742
00:56:24,858 --> 00:56:32,038
Scott: Yes the reason the aliens just kill Marines when they're alone by default is because Marines usually don't see the aliens coming.

743
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:37,278
Scott: the aliens are small and fast and they're on the walls and the ceilings and they come and They bite him before the Marines have a chance.

744
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:45,084
Scott: and but if you're an alien and there's a marine down the hallway And he sees you sitting there he has a gun you're far away.

745
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:46,930
Scott: you're gonna bite him from down the hallway?

746
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:47,715
Scott: I think not.

747
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:49,629
Scott: his machine gun will kill you.

748
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:51,230
Rym: You have to sneak up on him somehow.

749
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:59,182
Scott: He had to move really fast and really cleverly and even then like running up if you think Rushing at the marine by running up the wall while rushing at him.

750
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:00,266
Scott: He sees you.

751
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:01,370
Scott: he has a machine gun.

752
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,514
Scott: It shoots a lot of bullets.

753
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:06,469
Scott: They're pretty weak individually, but there's a lot of them now this they will kill you.

754
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:10,487
Rym: This is the sign of an excellently designed asymmetric game.

755
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:18,620
Rym: the doom game I hear is the same way where if you play as one side or the other side Both sides are equally afraid of the other side.

756
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,650
Rym: or you think wow how could I ever win against that?

757
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:28,364
Rym: But you think that for every side you hear about yep That that's the sign of a perfect game or at least a really good game a really good asymmetric game.

758
00:57:29,027 --> 00:57:34,851
Rym: and in this game I mean the worst thing in the world is you're an alien and you go like you're walking out of your way to a resource tower.

759
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:44,169
Rym: you're gonna cap it do whatever and you come around the corner and suddenly you see like four Marines Working on stuff and they're all talking and you don't know what's going on.

760
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:48,755
Rym: But you see him and you hear him and they haven't seen you yet and you don't know what to do.

761
00:57:49,077 --> 00:57:55,381
Rym: and then suddenly while you're thinking like you're trying to back into the shadows one of them looks Up and suddenly they're all pointing guns at you.

762
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:57,670
Scott: Yeah, it's it's kind of weird.

763
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:02,568
Scott: It's like Marines will walk down the hallway and a bunch of aliens are hiding there.

764
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:11,961
Scott: Oh, no But they'll be the same situation where a bunch of aliens walk down the hallway and there's a bunch of Marines with a bunch of Equipment they're setting up and it's like oh shit.

765
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,166
Scott: We can't go over there.

766
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:13,507
Scott: God damn.

767
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:17,365
Rym: now I said the Marines are all talking and I was serious.

768
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:18,550
Rym: one thing about this game.

769
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,430
Rym: I talked a lot about the environmental stuff and a lot of that's in the maps.

770
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,437
Rym: But it's also in the game itself.

771
00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:32,530
Rym: when you're a marine or an alien your guy depending on how Exerted you are and what you're doing will say things into his calm and just say things and make noises.

772
00:58:33,132 --> 00:58:39,251
Rym: And the aliens kind of burgled in belch and groan and just creak and make noises all the time and the Marines just keep saying Stuff.

773
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:44,650
Rym: so you'll be like sneaking along and then around the corner you hear two Marines say something to each other.

774
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:54,010
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of cool It feels it really does feel real despite the lack of modern graphics or sound technologies.

775
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,425
Rym: Now there are other kinds of aliens.

776
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:56,848
Rym: you can be.

777
00:58:57,252 --> 00:58:58,210
Rym: The way it works.

778
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:07,566
Rym: Well, the resources like Scott said get distributed around evenly and you can either turn into this one kind of alien The best kind called a gorge and they're the only ones who can build

779
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:14,050
Scott: as a default Alien, if you die as an alien and come back to life, you're a skunk you can spend what 10 resource points?

780
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,968
Scott: I think yep to become a gorge.

781
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:25,321
Scott: basically, you your alien will go pop and turn into an egg and you have to wait while you're sitting in the egg and Sometimes the Marines will come and kill you while you're an egg.

782
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,110
Scott: and that's not pleasant because there's nothing you could do.

783
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,154
Rym: But only if you're stupid.

784
00:59:28,174 --> 00:59:40,241
Scott: only if you're stupid and you turn into an egg in the middle of like the hallway Where this Marines walking around and then after a little while when you're done Gestating in your egg you pop out and you're a different kind of alien.

785
00:59:40,262 --> 00:59:42,790
Scott: You're a gorge, which is nothing like a skulk at all.

786
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,889
Rym: Now that's the only one that can spend resources real quick.

787
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:51,987
Rym: There's also the lurk and the fade and the onos and the onos stands for onos.

788
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:55,753
Scott: That is exactly because Both

789
00:59:55,833 --> 01:00:08,445
Rym: sides have this moment where you realize that you're fucked and when you're the Marines It's when you're doing your stuff and you think you're doing okay, you're not doing great But you're doing okay, and you're gonna win and then suddenly some guy somewhere out there yells.

790
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:09,087
Scott: Fuck.

791
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:21,789
Rym: Oh, no Oh, no, so does that means that some alien had so much excess resource like a hundred resource points Ludicrous they decided I'm going to spend that all on being an onos.

792
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,661
Rym: now Remember if you die as an onos you go back to being a skulk.

793
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,030
Scott: and all those resources all those resource points.

794
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:32,545
Rym: So that guy is sure of himself and an onos will take out almost any number of Marines.

795
01:00:32,825 --> 01:00:35,413
Scott: and onos is basically this giant rhinoceros.

796
01:00:35,453 --> 01:00:35,935
Scott: you turn you.

797
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:42,920
Scott: basically you go from being this little tiny bitey guy to a giant Rhinoceros and you can hit people with your horn.

798
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:45,830
Scott: you can charge into people and ram them with your horn.

799
01:00:46,194 --> 01:01:06,058
Scott: You can devour Marines with full health and the most expensive equipment whole with a single click and then they will basically sit there unable to do anything as they watch goatse for a few seconds and then you eventually shit them out when they die from the Horrible acid in your giant rhinoceros stomach.

800
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:10,675
Rym: now theoretically if they can hack the onos to pieces they can pull you out of the stomach If

801
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:21,509
Scott: you if there are other Marines with them Let's say there's three Marines with heavy armor and heavy machine guns and you eat one of them and they're in your stomach dying If the other two kill you before the one inside of you dies.

802
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:27,346
Scott: Basically you die around him and he just stands up and goes ah, oh god.

803
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:28,650
Scott: Oh, that was disgusting.

804
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:39,870
Scott: I'm not gonna talk much about the other aliens But the lurk is a flying alien that can spit and spit gas at people and he's pretty stealthy and annoying.

805
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:41,838
Scott: He's basically the pestering alien.

806
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:47,008
Rym: if what I run pestering them when I was much better at the game I used to always do the early lurk, but I'm not good at it.

807
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:52,761
Scott: The lurk can fly which is pretty good Especially if the other people have jetpacks and the fade is just the dangerous.

808
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:57,877
Rym: it runs into the room and kills like four Marines suddenly And that is aid is sort of like controlling.

809
01:01:57,897 --> 01:01:59,181
Scott: the fade is the only one.

810
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:06,000
Scott: that's anything like controlling a human because it's a bipedal Alien and it has two really dangerous claws.

811
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,344
Scott: It can go really fast.

812
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:09,130
Scott: It can shoot acid rockets.

813
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,997
Scott: It's basically Frickin dangerous, but not an onos.

814
01:02:15,061 --> 01:02:19,178
Scott: and then the gorge is the alien that builds things, you know We've already gone pretty long.

815
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,610
Rym: We might have to break this up into two shows.

816
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:23,010
Scott: Let's just talk about what the gorge builds and we'll be done with it.

817
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:23,533
Rym: All right, though.

818
01:02:23,554 --> 01:02:24,822
Rym: I have a lot more to say about NS.

819
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:25,870
Rym: We're gonna have to do another show.

820
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:27,250
Scott: No, I don't have that much more to say.

821
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,113
Scott: I have a lot to say.

822
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:32,169
Rym: all that all the remember all the stories all the interesting stories.

823
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:34,609
Scott: I just want to talk about the game to get people to play it.

824
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,130
Rym: I don't know.

825
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:39,650
Rym: We pressure to spend more time talking about the fun parts of the game and less describing the individual guy.

826
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:46,096
Scott: The thing is the game is so amazing that and it's so different that you sort of have to describe it So the people can understand what's.

827
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:50,776
Rym: I think you could have described it in more general terms, perhaps But anyway the gorge.

828
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:52,021
Scott: he builds things.

829
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:54,910
Rym: I tend to play as the gorge almost exclusively.

830
01:02:55,052 --> 01:03:01,633
Rym: Most people don't like being the gorge But I like to be the workhorse of the team and when Scott and I play on a server together We're usually the gorge.

831
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,115
Rym: now one.

832
01:03:02,155 --> 01:03:14,770
Rym: the gorge builds structures and you can build like offensive structures that hurt Marines and you can build defensive structures that give powers to the aliens and Gorges also are the ones who will build additional hives, which is kind of how you win the game.

833
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:20,407
Scott: Yeah, so when you're a gorge, all you can really do is spit this weak-ass acid spit.

834
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:21,210
Scott: That doesn't do much.

835
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:29,970
Scott: You can use this healing spray that heals aliens and alien structures and also kind of hurts Marines if the team's winning really like super.

836
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:31,190
Rym: Well, you got multiple hives.

837
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:34,327
Rym: You have this thing called a bile bomb where you can take out marine structures.

838
01:03:34,368 --> 01:03:37,442
Rym: really well But aside from that you're really web.

839
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:38,969
Rym: You're pretty much defenseless.

840
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:40,033
Scott: Yes You're just as little.

841
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:44,690
Scott: it's sort of like a pig and it walks around and it doesn't do much in terms of combat.

842
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:51,109
Scott: but you can spend resources to build things and Building things is really awesome.

843
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:57,410
Rym: Now the other important thing about the gorge is that there would be for whatever reason never made a jumping animation.

844
01:03:57,571 --> 01:04:01,170
Rym: So when the gorge jumps it just kind of floats up and floats back down.

845
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,027
Scott: It doesn't like wiggle its legs or move its legs in any way.

846
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:06,261
Scott: when it jumps It just goes straight up and straight down.

847
01:04:06,623 --> 01:04:16,379
Rym: and a while ago they said all right We're gonna fix this and the community went nuts and said no because the people who play gorges are kind of weird and they want the Gorge to stay exactly the way it is.

848
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:17,384
Rym: I agree with them.

849
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:21,274
Scott: I also agree Basically the gorge.

850
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:30,226
Rym: if I talked about the aliens building silly the gorge is the silliest of the silly partly because while you're gorging You know, I've built the hive and I built defenses for the hive.

851
01:04:30,749 --> 01:04:35,370
Rym: now I'm just waiting for resources and otherwise, I'm just defending whatever point I'm at.

852
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,135
Scott: I mean if I start walking around the map I'm just gonna be killed.

853
01:04:38,215 --> 01:04:43,710
Scott: if I spend resources to become something other than a gorge Then I have to spend more resources to become a gorge again.

854
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:52,430
Scott: So a lot of time when you're a gorge you spend a good minute or two sitting around and waiting Usually with other gorges who are also waiting.

855
01:04:52,931 --> 01:05:02,114
Scott: So you sit there waiting next to a resource point in a defense tower or whatever and you just sort of look at each other Spit at each other jump up and down Be silly.

856
01:05:02,134 --> 01:05:06,790
Rym: Yep, a lot of gorges start dancing playing the spit game playing spit tag.

857
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:12,670
Scott: Yeah, another thing about this game is that when you're not playing when you enter a server You're not actually put directly into the game.

858
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:25,889
Scott: You're putting the ready room and the ready room is this room that you can walk around and do whatever you want in and it Doors and some of the doors say become an alien and some of the doors say become a marine and some of the doors Say join a random team.

859
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:33,702
Scott: But people like to fool around in the ready room and the ready rooms usually have things in them to fool around with like one Ready room has a picnic table with some cheese on it.

860
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:33,983
Rym: Yep.

861
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:38,250
Scott: One of them has a wet bar Yep, and people will fool around in this ready room.

862
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:46,368
Scott: I remember one time I was in a ready room and there was a guy who was a gorge in the ready room and He was playing music through the voice chat.

863
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:53,530
Scott: It was like And he was dancing his little gorge and he did that and I entered the game and then I left.

864
01:05:53,610 --> 01:06:02,727
Rym: I went back to the ready room and there he was dancing Still and Scott tells me this and I'm like, alright, so I left the game because we were losing anyway.

865
01:06:03,008 --> 01:06:04,413
Rym: at this point I was like whatever.

866
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:09,690
Scott: one funny thing about NS is that there's a. you could push the f4 button in the f4 button.

867
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:15,775
Scott: What it does is it sends you to the ready room if you're in the game and you don't want to play anymore Or you just kind of tired.

868
01:06:15,795 --> 01:06:20,634
Scott: take a break you push f4 and it sends you to the ready room and then you can enter The game again later.

869
01:06:21,316 --> 01:06:30,710
Scott: So usually when a team is losing or something happens everyone will say Everyone f4 f4 f4 and everyone will push f4 and go to the ready room and the game will sort of reset.

870
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:33,206
Scott: That's sort of like the signal like everyone f4.

871
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:37,468
Rym: Yeah, a lot of times people will fight to the end and they'll joke like everybody f4.

872
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:41,709
Rym: But sometimes if it's totally over everyone f4 is just to play another game.

873
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:51,014
Rym: But that one time I have Ford and then I saw this dancing and Scott wasn't lying so I started dancing with him and More and more people.

874
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:54,768
Scott: yes for people to sit around in a room jumping up and down while music plays.

875
01:06:55,009 --> 01:07:09,249
Rym: one time I remember why joined a game and we're and Scott was there later and we're all in the ready room and a few people have joined the game but not enough to let the game start yet and Everyone just stayed in the ready room making a pile of Marines trying to see how high they could get it.

876
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:14,370
Rym: Yeah, and after a while someone comes out of the game and says what the fuck are you guys doing?

877
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:20,372
Rym: We're trying to start the game because there's like three people in the game and like I think you're piling up on top of That cheese.

878
01:07:20,493 --> 01:07:21,216
Rym: I think we were.

879
01:07:21,236 --> 01:07:24,769
Rym: yes, but there were like 15 people in the ready room piling up on this cheese.

880
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:29,307
Rym: We're making a little marine pyramid on top of the cheese and the guys like what the fuck is wrong with you people.

881
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,737
Rym: Ah But he didn't go back into the game.

882
01:07:31,777 --> 01:07:34,328
Rym: He watched for a while and eventually jumped on top of the pile.

883
01:07:34,348 --> 01:07:35,634
Scott: Yep That's that's.

884
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:37,482
Scott: that's the way NS is it's.

885
01:07:37,563 --> 01:07:39,090
Scott: it's a serious really?

886
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,315
Scott: Atmospheric RTS FPS.

887
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:53,830
Scott: that is like no other game and it is is unlike many other gaming experiences but at the same time It's just a lot of silliness going on and a really great community of laughing and having a good time.

888
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,636
Rym: The community is fantastic.

889
01:07:55,716 --> 01:07:57,684
Rym: Most of the people who play are awesome.

890
01:07:57,724 --> 01:07:59,350
Rym: There's almost no shit cocking.

891
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:04,953
Scott: Yep, and I guess we could actually talk about that combat game that was added later But let's not.

892
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:07,747
Rym: maybe we could do a separate special on that if we needed to it.

893
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:09,034
Scott: Yeah special I think would be good.

894
01:08:09,054 --> 01:08:10,321
Scott: talk about combat and then we're done.

895
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:11,970
Scott: basically they got.

896
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:13,755
Rym: We were out of time.

897
01:08:13,775 --> 01:08:14,418
Scott: There's another game.

898
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:15,121
Scott: We're out of time.

899
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:15,703
Scott: You can play.

900
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:19,138
Rym: there's a bunch of mods of NS now And they're mostly crap except for combat.

901
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:19,499
Rym: Yep.

902
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:20,243
Scott: That's it.

903
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:23,332
Rym: But the game is I mean we say It's free.

904
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:28,938
Rym: If you have half-life 1 it is one of the best multiplayer FPS is ever made.

905
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,536
Rym: I might go play some right now and when I say that I mean I'm dead serious.

906
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:34,145
Rym: I will defend that statement to the death.

907
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:34,970
