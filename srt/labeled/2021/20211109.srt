1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,628
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:09,930
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:13,140
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,484
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,791
Rym: Tonight, we're reviewing WarioWare.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,700
Rym: Get It Together on the Nintendo Switch.

7
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:21,878
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:28,020
Rym: So, one thing I didn't do during the entire quarantine until just now was get new glasses.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,219
Rym: Like, most people get glasses if you have a prescription every year.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,700
Rym: Sometimes every other year, but usually people do it every year for a lot of reasons.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,460
Rym: Because most people's prescriptions, if you need glasses, they change over time.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,199
Scott: I feel like people with money might do it every year or two.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,020
Scott: I think most people don't have money and don't do it that often.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,975
Rym: Well, people with insurance, because if you have insurance, you can get, like, they won't be stylish glasses, but they are glasses every year for mostly free.

15
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:01,295
Rym: And the exam, you also get every year from the insurance.

16
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:02,640
Rym: Even crappy insurance covers that.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:14,840
Scott: I think also, though, people outside the United States, whether it's free healthcare or not, are not as subject to the glasses monopoly and other difficulties that we have.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,532
Rym: I mean, I buy my glasses overseas once I get my prescription.

19
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,376
Rym: I don't use the U.S.

20
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,300
Rym: glasses monopoly.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,289
Scott: Right, but most people in the U.S.

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,454
Scott: are sort of stuck with the U.S.

23
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:24,719
Scott: glasses monopoly situation.

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,334
Rym: Oh, no, my European coworkers get glasses whenever they need new glasses.

25
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,760
Rym: They're not stuck waiting a year.

26
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:34,800
Rym: Like, if they need glasses halfway through the year, they're not stuck waiting until the next year to get new glasses.

27
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,267
Scott: But also, they're not paying a fortune, right?

28
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:42,280
Scott: Because in other countries, you just figure out your numbers for your eyeballs, right?

29
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,220
Scott: And then you can go to any place and just give them your numbers and they'll sell them to you.

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,381
Scott: In the

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:46,722
Scott: U.S.,

32
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:48,068
Scott: it's like, "Oh, you want contacts?

33
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,196
Scott: You got to go to a special prescription

34
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:50,799
Scott: place.".

35
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,050
Rym: Or you just go online and buy them like I do.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,940
Rym: Like, I don't buy glasses from my places.

37
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,190
Scott: But that wasn't an option until recently.

38
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,380
Rym: And I think, you know, it's still a lot of people don't do that.

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,978
Rym: It's been an option for about a little over a decade.

40
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,680
Scott: I think a lot of people still don't do that.

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,426
Rym: Oh, yeah, because they don't know.

42
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:06,940
Rym: They go to, like, LensCrafters or something.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,291
Rym: Right, if you look around, you know, Optician- That's how Warby Parker got so big, because they were like, "Yo, dawg, come online.

44
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,815
Rym: We'll sell you glasses for, like, 200 bucks.

45
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,357
Rym: that are great.

46
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:16,239
Rym: And we take your

47
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:16,620
Rym: insurance.".

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
Scott: But then, look how many physical stores they're opening, right?

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,200
Scott: Optician and Glasses Place is, like, one of the still brick-and-mortar businesses.

50
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:29,440
Scott: You know, just like Nail Place and Hair Place, you know?

51
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,933
Scott: The online ones have not, you know, been strong enough.

52
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,700
Scott: I mean, you know, they've got some strength, for sure.

53
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:35,012
Scott: Yeah.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,677
Scott: But have not completely crushed the store.

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,343
Rym: Well, I'd go further.

56
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:46,200
Rym: It's fucked up that eye correction is not considered healthcare like going to a doctor.

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,780
Rym: It's like a separate- Well, obviously, that goes without saying.

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,399
Rym: Yeah, like, see, also, why is dental care not covered by, like, health insurance?

59
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,440
Rym: But, again, America's a very fucked up place.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,678
Rym: Anyway, my eye doctor was kind of weird about it and did the exam twice, because, basically, my prescription has not changed in 11 years now.

61
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:13,940
Rym: Despite having extreme myopia that is specifically and commonly associated with continued degradation.

62
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,435
Rym: So, I'm a weird case, apparently, but I got brand new glasses.

63
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,279
Rym: I got them on right now.

64
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,093
Rym: And I actually asked him to give me a stronger prescription, and I got 2010 testable vision.

65
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,260
Rym: Slight zoom on my glasses.

66
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:28,642
Scott: Okay.

67
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:32,200
Scott: I can see perfectly with no aid whatsoever.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,443
Rym: Yeah, good job.

69
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:35,972
Rym: I know you probably went outside a lot as a kid.

70
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,020
Rym: I was mostly inside playing video games.

71
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,908
Scott: How much inside did I do?

72
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,598
Scott: I was inside just like every other nerd.

73
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:41,919
Scott: What was it?

74
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:47,519
Rym: So, there's a bunch of news, and this one's kind of, this one's really funny to me.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,463
Rym: So, as of now, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.

76
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:56,099
Scott: So, not one.

77
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,698
Rym: Yeah, not one, but two and three.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,480
Rym: Konami has been forced to remove these games from pretty much every platform they exist on today that they have control over.

79
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:18,079
Scott: So, the PlayStation- So, they're just taking things out of the store so people can't buy it now, but if you've already got it, you've already got it.

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,940
Rym: Yes, except for any iteration of this game that phones home, it won't let you play it right now because of the takedown notice.

81
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:28,639
Scott: Is there even such a thing?

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,339
Rym: So, they have taken it down from Nvidia Shield.

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,787
Scott: Oh, those are streaming.

84
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,175
Scott: Those are live streaming ones.

85
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,040
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

86
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:41,834
Rym: The Nintendo 3DS, read Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Xbox 360, the HD edition.

87
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:54,000
Scott: Right, but most of those are, so it's basically, it's taken out of stores, but if you own the game already, you can play it as long as you don't own it on something like, you know, the Nvidia one, which is a streaming one.

88
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,459
Rym: Yep, if you've got like an old disc that you can get to work in an old console, it'll still work.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:08,038
Scott: Obviously, if you bought it on Steam and you've already downloaded it, if you bought it on GOG and you've already downloaded it- Apparently, you can't re-download it right now.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,659
Scott: No, but if you own it, you own it.

91
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:22,453
Rym: Yep, so Konami has been forced to take down Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 from every platform they can take it down on because of a DMC violation from a company.

92
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:30,559
Rym: they bought the rights to a small amount of historical war footage that they- Well, they didn't buy the rights, they licensed.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:30,920
Scott: They

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:52,855
Rym: licensed the rights and when they attempted to renew this license, it appears that this company wouldn't just renew them and there's a lot of secrecy about exactly what happened, but all we know is that as of right now, Konami said these games are unavailable, we cannot say when they will be available, and we're trying to work with this licensor to re-license-

95
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:09,627
Scott: Three, this is why if you're making games or whatever, this happens a lot.

96
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:20,200
Scott: There's been lots of situations where someone included some music in their game, like GTA has the radio and Tony Hawk games have a lot of music in them.

97
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:28,199
Scott: We talked about Evangelion with the anime, with the Fly Me to the Moon at the end, it's like you put in something that-

98
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:41,320
Rym: Even there are a lot of anime soundtracks that come out that just have certain songs missing from them because they only license them to be in the show, or they only license them for the first time the show aired on TV, and then when you buy the DVD, different songs.

99
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:45,203
Scott: You have to put in different music or cut stuff out.

100
00:06:46,064 --> 00:07:00,857
Scott: My recommendation is that if you are making artwork and you are going to include something that is not public domain, not royalty free, and not yours in it, that you need to get some sort of in perpetuity deal.

101
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,979
Scott: You can't be getting these limited deals.

102
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:03,880
Scott: It's just not going to work.

103
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:21,096
Rym: One thing I've learned from some indie creators over the years is that by and large, real music, I'm making quote fingers obviously, anything that's licensed by traditional companies, they just won't work with you to get that kind of license.

104
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:25,620
Rym: They will just be always a threat unless you get your own music.

105
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:34,340
Scott: It's like, okay, so let's say I would like to include some, I don't know, rock song, a famous rock song.

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:45,720
Rym: You're making, say, a game based on the anime Speedgrapher, which is about photographing girls, and you want the song Girls on Film to be in your game, and you make a cutscene around it.

107
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,523
Scott: You might like to do that.

108
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:47,964
Scott: Sure.

109
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:48,545
Scott: I understand.

110
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:49,226
Scott: That makes sense.

111
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:53,253
Scott: But it's going to be a pain in the ass if they're not going to work with you.

112
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,337
Scott: You're better off just not doing it.

113
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:55,878
Scott: Just don't.

114
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:56,920
Scott: Don't fight them.

115
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:18,340
Scott: If you think about it, in pretty much all mixed media forms, movies, video games, audio and visual forms, the best works are things that tend to have original scores, which is music made for the thing.

116
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:23,108
Scott: Think about the legendary video game musics, especially Capcom has so many of them.

117
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,572
Scott: Those are all made by Capcom's sound team.

118
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:30,600
Scott: They didn't buy music from somewhere else as they hired people who made music.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,781
Scott: And it's like.

120
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:34,126
Scott: Mega Man doesn't have to worry about this problem.

121
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,153
Scott: Street Fighter doesn't have to worry about this.

122
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:38,717
Scott: Nintendo doesn't have to worry about this.

123
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,200
Scott: They make their own goddamn music.

124
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,542
Scott: Star Wars, okay, they hired John Williams.

125
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,184
Scott: He made music for Star Wars.

126
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,165
Scott: It's the Star Wars music.

127
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:49,008
Scott: They don't have to worry about something happening there.

128
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,433
Scott: And old movies, it's like, okay, you never turn on an old movie.

129
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:53,914
Scott: What do you hear?

130
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,915
Scott: You hear classical music.

131
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:56,216
Scott: They don't got to worry about it.

132
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:57,758
Scott: They got Tchaikovsky play it.

133
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:58,278
Scott: They're fine.

134
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,620
Scott: Nothing's going to happen.

135
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:08,380
Rym: I mean, you'll still, if you do something online with that thing, you'll probably still get a takedown from some random orchestra that recorded that same song, even if it's not the recording you use.

136
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,877
Scott: Well, not if it's a recording from an orchestra that existed in the 40s.

137
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:22,660
Rym: You'll often get takedowns anyway, because sometimes those recordings in a modern recording, functionally indistinguishable, or the company that owns the rights to a recording doesn't give a shit.

138
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Scott: The point is, if you think about the movies and video games especially, but also other things that have legendary music, it's almost always, almost always stuff that had its own score.

139
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:45,200
Scott: So if you are making something, I would encourage you to avoid this problem and make your own score or hire someone to make you a score.

140
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,349
Rym: Well, look at Undertale, one of the greatest scores to a video game in recent history.

141
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,800
Rym: And that was basically composed for Undertale directly, that score.

142
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,321
Scott: Right.

143
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,428
Scott: That's the right way to do it.

144
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:56,979
Scott: That's the right way to do it.

145
00:09:57,341 --> 00:10:07,420
Rym: But it does suck in general that it's basically impossible to use music in video games these days, partly because of all these problems and partly because of streamer modes.

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,510
Rym: And like, if you want to stream a game, you got to cut all the music out.

147
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,280
Rym: To this day, if I want to play Rocket League, sure.

148
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:18,400
Rym: If I want to stream Rocket League, I got to turn off all the music that's in Rocket League or my videos get taken down.

149
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,039
Rym: So you got any gaming news?

150
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:31,716
Scott: It's not really so much a news other than the fact that this game is out and I've been seeing, I haven't played the game yet, so it's not a geek bite, but I have seen a lot of talking about

151
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,036
Rym: it and a

152
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,520
Scott: lot of content from it on various places.

153
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:39,034
Scott: So the game is called, is it Unboxed?

154
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:39,778
Scott: Unpacking?

155
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,320
Scott: Unpacking.

156
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,100
Rym: Unpacking.

157
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,362
Scott: Unpacking.

158
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,887
Scott: So this is a game.

159
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:48,080
Scott: It's got that sort of three quarter view pixelated style.

160
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:53,014
Scott: If you see it, you'll know that isometric, you know, somewhat pixely, but small pixels.

161
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:54,718
Scott: You've seen this style before.

162
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,320
Scott: This is static.

163
00:10:57,063 --> 00:11:04,800
Scott: And it's a game in which you are put into a house and there's a bunch of boxes and you unpack the stuff.

164
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:14,240
Scott: So it's a game sort of, you know, it falls in line a little bit with like the, you know, the house flipping simulator type game, right?

165
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,588
Scott: Where or even Animal Crossing, right?

166
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,800
Scott: You're expressing yourself by arranging items.

167
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,824
Scott: So that's fun.

168
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,551
Scott: But this game is.

169
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:29,240
Scott: there's two things I know about it that make it like really off the wall.

170
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,621
Scott: Right.

171
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,045
Scott: The first thing is that the sort of like a replay mode.

172
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:41,220
Scott: So you can get the game to sort of show you a replay of yourself unpacking and you can use this to create like fun stuff.

173
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:47,700
Scott: And the example I saw on the Internet here was somebody unpacked a bunch of stuffed animals and kept moving them around.

174
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:53,900
Scott: And then when they watch the replay, the stuffed animals like playing soccer because it's like, oh, I'll move them here.

175
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,622
Scott: I'll move them there.

176
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:55,325
Scott: I'll move the ball.

177
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:55,988
Scott: I'll move me.

178
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:56,250
Scott: Right.

179
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,580
Scott: And then when you replay that, it's like you made a little movie.

180
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:09,380
Scott: So it's you know, you can get even more expression out of this game using the replay mode and not just, you know, arranging the room just so and expressing yourself that way.

181
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:19,620
Scott: The other thing I saw about the game that I'm still trying to wrap my head around how they did this for a game that's only 20 bucks and is presumably an indie indie kind of deal.

182
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:32,500
Scott: There's a little video going around showing they supposedly have 14000 plus different sound effects in the game for placing items.

183
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,047
Scott: It's like place a metal item on the wood table.

184
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:37,775
Scott: And it sounds like you placed a metal item on a wood table.

185
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,440
Scott: You place it on the toilet.

186
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,506
Scott: It sounds like you placed a metal item on a porcelain toilet.

187
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:52,620
Scott: And it even sounds different when you put it on different areas of the toilet or the toilet lid or, you know, you take a cardboard box and lay it down on a carpet.

188
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:01,320
Scott: And it sounds like you put a cardboard box on a carpet and like every conceivable possible combination of materials, you know, weight, et cetera.

189
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:07,889
Scott: They have the sound effect that matches like exactly as if you place that item in that spot.

190
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,334
Scott: Did they do this manually?

191
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:15,580
Scott: How that would be some herculean effort if they didn't do it manually.

192
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,782
Scott: How the hell did they do it?

193
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,205
Scott: Where did they get all the sound effects from?

194
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,808
Scott: But how the hell does this work?

195
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,529
Scott: Right.

196
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,373
Scott: I don't even know.

197
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:26,360
Scott: But it's it's if you play the game, it's in there somehow.

198
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,663
Scott: So that's just fucking incredible.

199
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:37,017
Scott: And that alone just makes you want to play the game like you could just make that as an app, like choose two materials and hear the sound effect.

200
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,080
Scott: that could stand alone as an app.

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,182
Scott: That was worthwhile.

202
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:40,903
Scott: Right.

203
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:50,420
Scott: So the fact that that is just a component of this larger game is really incredible and makes me want to give them the 20 bucks, regardless of whether the game is any fun or not.

204
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,473
Scott: So, yeah, I think that's worth mentioning, even if it's just a new game was released and I've never even played it.

205
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,638
Scott: That's so incredible that it deserves.

206
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,500
Rym: It is.

207
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,524
Rym: It was also making the rounds.

208
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:11,420
Rym: That's how I encountered it, because people were freaking out that kids have no idea what a GameCube is and they can't figure out what.

209
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,281
Scott: Yeah, one.

210
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,825
Scott: So one person on Polygon made some clickbait.

211
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:25,040
Scott: that was like, you know, they wrote an article that was published today and they're like, yeah, the game, you know, in unboxed one of the items that you can unpack looks basically like a GameCube.

212
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,062
Scott: It's a GameCube.

213
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:29,067
Rym: I don't want two tweets of people who don't know what it is.

214
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:29,989
Scott: Right.

215
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:30,310
Scott: It's like.

216
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,135
Scott: there are a couple of people who are like, you know, what is this?

217
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,377
Scott: They like put it in the kitchen.

218
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:36,020
Scott: They thought it was a kitchen appliance.

219
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,347
Rym: I'm going to go one step further, though, regardless of the clickbait side of it.

220
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,215
Rym: That's not a GameCube because it's wrong.

221
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,200
Rym: That's not what the front of a GameCube looks like at all.

222
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,410
Scott: Obviously, you couldn't make it just look like a GameCube because Nintendo would sue you.

223
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,439
Scott: It's a GameCube-esque video game console.

224
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:51,800
Scott: Right.

225
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,341
Rym: Yep.

226
00:14:53,822 --> 00:15:01,075
Rym: I would argue that we need a copyright regime where you could just put a GameCube there because it's a physical object you're representing in a simulation game.

227
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,499
Rym: But again, copyright is just super broken.

228
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,060
Rym: We can't.

229
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,961
Scott: I agree.

230
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:12,854
Scott: It's the same as if like if I take a photo on the street in a public place and there happens to be an advertisement there with the trademark logo in it.

231
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,260
Scott: It's like, you know, I can still publish that as my work.

232
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,984
Rym: But we're not going to dwell on that because GeekNights.

233
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,186
Rym: Mad about copyright since 2005.

234
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,790
Rym: We don't need to compete that horse to 2005, 2000.

235
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,672
Scott: Oh, I mean, GeekNights didn't exist until 2005 publicly.

236
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,374
Rym: So, OK, sure.

237
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,613
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

238
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:39,915
Rym: Cute little video.

239
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:41,638
Rym: Very well done.

240
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:43,901
Rym: It's the scene from Jurassic Park, I guess.

241
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:50,230
Rym: Spoilers, if you've never seen the scene, the raptor scene, the beginning of the T-Rex scene.

242
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,052
Rym: When the T-Rex attacks the jeeps.

243
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:58,297
Rym: Spoilers, the dinosaurs escape in Jurassic Park like that happens.

244
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:14,410
Rym: So someone did a really good job of taking what looks like their own cat and compositing their cat in in place of the T-Rex and compositing other things into the scene to make this make even more sense than it should have.

245
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:22,338
Rym: But otherwise, it's so well done and so funny that it's 100 percent worth watching.

246
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,180
Rym: Like, you got to see this.

247
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:33,230
Rym: It takes multiple steps, more effort than you would have expected a video like this to make just to make it like that one percent funnier.

248
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:35,712
Scott: All right.

249
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:40,822
Scott: So recently I did a thing of the day, which was like a little ASCII calendar generator.

250
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:44,830
Scott: We're going to continue our little ASCII thing of the day situation here.

251
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,215
Scott: This is ASCII dot alien melon dot com.

252
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:51,480
Scott: And it's an ASCII paint tool.

253
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,710
Scott: So, you know, the way it works is you choose the size of your canvas because it's going to be a grid.

254
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,131
Scott: Right.

255
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,976
Scott: A solid grid of ASCII is obviously ASCII characters.

256
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:08,290
Scott: And then you choose your which ASCII characters you want to like load into the paintbrush.

257
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,354
Scott: So there's five automatic choices, right?

258
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:13,958
Scott: Like dingbats, Unicode, alphanumeric, et cetera.

259
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:21,089
Scott: But you can also make a custom one and just type in like, OK, I only want to use like X and O and that's it or whatever you choose.

260
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:25,137
Scott: And then you just use your mouse cursor and paint on the grid.

261
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:30,970
Scott: And it's just like using the paint brush tool or the pencil tool in your favorite paint program.

262
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,556
Scott: Only of the characters that are currently loaded in your brush, random ones come out.

263
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:37,858
Scott: Yeah.

264
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:47,610
Scott: So you can draw stuff in ASCII way easier than, you know, sitting there with notepad trying to manually justify your ASCII arts.

265
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:53,205
Scott: But obviously, because it's random characters, you can't be too precise in your ASCII arts.

266
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,990
Scott: You're not going to be able to make something really elaborate.

267
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:02,665
Scott: Yeah, but you can make like a quick drawing in ASCII and then export, you know, as a JPEG really easily.

268
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,950
Scott: Well, not as far as a JPEG.

269
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,576
Scott: Basically, you click the build ASCII button export as ASCII.

270
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:09,738
Scott: Right.

271
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,541
Scott: It basically exports it as a text.

272
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:16,570
Scott: You get a text file and you can copy paste it or you can screenshot it or both.

273
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,032
Rym: It's fun biz.

274
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:22,260
Scott: Yeah, really, really useful little tool here for your ASCII ways.

275
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,550
Scott: And I appreciate the DOS GUI stylings of the UI in the bottom right.

276
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,960
Rym: Yeah, that that that's an aesthetic that we've talked about before.

277
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,982
Rym: Yeah.

278
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,810
Scott: You can still make apps with that aesthetic if you want.

279
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,251
Scott: Yeah.

280
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:40,798
Rym: In the meta moment, the gig notes book, the tale of Genji, we're still playing along.

281
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,963
Rym: I'm reading it every day because I've only.

282
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:48,150
Scott: I only have 12 days of work remaining this year.

283
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,658
Scott: And when I don't have work to do, I'm going to have a lot of time for just getting this.

284
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,521
Scott: I really have a lot.

285
00:18:55,581 --> 00:19:01,290
Scott: You know, I've been reading it, but especially because I got my new, you know, newer Kindle.

286
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:02,432
Scott: You know, I'm using that.

287
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:07,380
Rym: I did pause to read a volume of Jujutsu Kaisen, but not read more of that.

288
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:07,941
Scott: Yeah.

289
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:13,570
Scott: No, my you know, but my goal is basically, you know, get this book done by the end of the year.

290
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:24,250
Scott: And that way we can start next year, like with all this tragic bullshit behind us and go fresh on some other literature.

291
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:24,751
Rym: Yep.

292
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:30,683
Rym: Especially because we'll be starting a new book in an era where I am traveling and thus I am reading.

293
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:34,270
Rym: So let's see what else we got going.

294
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:36,953
Rym: So Scott will not be there.

295
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:37,674
Rym: Very likely.

296
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:39,778
Rym: There's like a point one percent chance Scott will be there.

297
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:46,549
Rym: I will be at PAX Unplugged for about two hours on Friday, December 10th.

298
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,996
Rym: I'm going to roll in, do a panel, Rare Game Mechanics at 1 p.m.

299
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,219
Rym: in the Crab God Theater on Friday.

300
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,710
Rym: We did a pilot version of this panel years ago at a magfest and I started rewriting it back then.

301
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,940
Rym: And then, you know, COVID, we never had a con to do it at again.

302
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,424
Rym: So I'm going to do it at unplugged.

303
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:08,650
Rym: I'm getting rid of all the video game stuff, just focusing on tabletop.

304
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:11,012
Rym: It's going to be videoed.

305
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:16,200
Rym: So if you're not already planning to go to PAX Unplugged, do not go to PAX Unplugged to see this panel.

306
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:20,467
Rym: It will 100% be on YouTube by like Sunday that same weekend.

307
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,830
Scott: Isn't it already on YouTube in a different version?

308
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,141
Rym: Yeah, an old version of it where me and Scott did it at magfest, kind of spitballing and trying things out.

309
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:35,630
Rym: But I've already rewritten it kind of substantially based on watching that video again.

310
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,962
Rym: I mean, I'm getting rid of all the video game stuff for one.

311
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:41,050
Rym: We spent like a good quarter of the panel talking about video games.

312
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,489
Scott: Oh, it's PAX Unplugged, so yeah, that makes sense.

313
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,713
Rym: Yeah.

314
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:48,129
Rym: But yeah, it'll be our first brand new panel in a while since Atari Game Design.

315
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:49,848
Scott: It's not brand new.

316
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:50,978
Rym: It's new content.

317
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,329
Rym: There's new stuff in there.

318
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,817
Scott: It's not brand new.

319
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,764
Scott: Brand new means 100% new.

320
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:57,989
Scott: If it's even 1% old, it's not brand new.

321
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,652
Scott: It says who?

322
00:20:58,913 --> 00:20:59,376
Rym: Brand new?

323
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:01,588
Rym: Oreo flavor is still fundamentally just an Oreo.

324
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,990
Scott: But it has to be a flavor that they have never done before.

325
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,449
Rym: Says who?

326
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,762
Scott: At all.

327
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,485
Rym: What if it's still chocolate but they put like a different kind of mint?

328
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:13,890
Rym: It's wintergreen on the inside.

329
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,330
Scott: Have they ever done chocolate, mint, or green before?

330
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:22,910
Rym: What if they've done every chocolate and mint combination except wintergreen specifically?

331
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:24,869
Scott: That would still be new.

332
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,430
Rym: Yeah, so this is going to be different slides and different topics.

333
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:31,678
Scott: It's the same exact thing.

334
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:35,370
Scott: At least in the example you gave of the Oreo, at least the name of the flavor is different.

335
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:36,767
Scott: The panel name is the same thing.

336
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,395
Rym: Judge Anime by its cover.

337
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:40,506
Rym: Totally different set of anime every time.

338
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:41,370
Rym: Same panel title.

339
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:44,193
Scott: No.

340
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:44,797
Scott: Whatever.

341
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:46,530
Scott: It's not new.

342
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,390
Scott: Brand new.

343
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,891
Scott: One last thing.

344
00:21:48,911 --> 00:22:00,170
Scott: We are, since I'm not working, and we got some assistance from someone that we're paying real money, we're remaking finally the GeekNights website.

345
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:10,330
Scott: So I'm going to give you two things that you can do to get, well, three things actually you can do to get involved with the new GeekNights website.

346
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,250
Scott: Number one, you can come find us anywhere we live on the internet.

347
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,950
Scott: You know, discords, forums, emails, twitters, whatever.

348
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:23,310
Scott: And you can give us some fucking suggestions for the website.

349
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:23,913
Scott: Right.

350
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:27,230
Scott: You know, obviously, some of the suggestions are not necessary.

351
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,490
Scott: Like, yeah, we're going to have search that doesn't suck.

352
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:29,874
Scott: It's good.

353
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:30,845
Scott: You don't need to tell me that.

354
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:31,169
Scott: We know.

355
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,709
Scott: But maybe you have a really good idea.

356
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,269
Scott: You know, a clever new idea for the website.

357
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,738
Scott: Wouldn't hurt to tell us.

358
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,209
Scott: I can't promise I'm going to do it.

359
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:41,104
Scott: I want to hear it.

360
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:53,890
Scott: Two, the website actually has this very old feature that still works, by the way, where you can go to this GitHub repository and add show notes.

361
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,222
Rym: Oh, I forgot about that.

362
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,170
Rym: Holy shit.

363
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:58,651
Scott: Right.

364
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:02,350
Scott: Well, because we're we're digging through the website, so we're finding all this stuff in there.

365
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:02,591
Scott: Right.

366
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:03,878
Rym: We used to have a lot of listeners.

367
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,870
Rym: Well, not a lot, but like several listeners.

368
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,852
Scott: That is not true.

369
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,334
Scott: What is

370
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,899
Rym: true is that for an extremely

371
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:21,970
Scott: for an extremely brief period of time, mostly one, really, maybe two, but mostly one listener wrote show notes for an extremely short period of time,

372
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:22,692
Rym: for a

373
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:28,969
Scott: very small number of episodes a long time ago and never did it again and no one else did it again.

374
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:31,723
Scott: But we are probably going to.

375
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:37,730
Scott: I don't know if we'll have it immediately, but we're going to have some sort of show note solution of some kind.

376
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,292
Scott: I don't know.

377
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,910
Scott: It might not even be user some who knows of something.

378
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:48,830
Scott: But if you're interested, if you want to write show notes for episodes, that may be a thing.

379
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,035
Scott: So, you know, just let me know.

380
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:56,793
Scott: And I guess the third thing is that while we're working on the website, you're not going to.

381
00:23:56,994 --> 00:24:01,070
Scott: you know, we have set up beta dot front row crew dot com.

382
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,809
Scott: If you go there right now, you're going to see the words beta dot front row crew dot com and nothing else.

383
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:10,750
Scott: But it will slowly appear, I guess, as we work on it.

384
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,230
Scott: So you can track our progress and also, you know, comment.

385
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:23,228
Scott: Obviously, nothing that you see there is any close to final because when it's final, it'll be moved to front row.

386
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:23,810
Scott: crew dot com.

387
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,354
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:32,621
Scott: You know, so don't pretend like just because you see something there that it's going to happen and, you know, needs to be criticized because we're in the.

389
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:34,790
Scott: we're in the middle of working on it, obviously.

390
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:37,682
Scott: But, you know, I'll let you know that it's there.

391
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:38,306
Scott: That can't hurt.

392
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:38,547
Scott: Right.

393
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,090
Scott: Go take a look.

394
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,933
Scott: What are you going to do?

395
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:40,334
Scott: Right.

396
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:41,579
Scott: Nothing.

397
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,723
Scott: You can't harm it.

398
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:44,730
Scott: So go right ahead.

399
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,510
Rym: Yeah.

400
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,173
Rym: And one other thing.

401
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,830
Rym: I can say that I didn't look into this yet because I only noticed it a little while ago.

402
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:57,190
Rym: But someone or maybe YouTube did it automatically and I didn't notice because that YouTube chapters feature was added a while ago.

403
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,461
Rym: Where you can like put chapter a long time ago.

404
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,205
Scott: Yeah.

405
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:00,668
Scott: It's been.

406
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:00,969
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:09,850
Rym: So what I noticed is that for almost all of our GeekNights lectures, there are extremely accurate chapters for like every topic we talk about.

408
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:11,373
Rym: OK.

409
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,277
Rym: On all our videos.

410
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:14,689
Rym: And all I'm saying is I did not do that.

411
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,598
Rym: So either YouTube did it automatically?

412
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,869
Rym: or one of you use the crowd feature to do it.

413
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,036
Rym: So I'm going to look into that.

414
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:25,349
Scott: If someone does the crowd feature, don't you have to like review it and approve it?

415
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:27,578
Rym: At least for captions and other things.

416
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:30,930
Rym: I opened it up and left it all unapproved for a long time because people.

417
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,104
Scott: The unapproved captions is dangerous because someone can write racist slur.

418
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,737
Rym: I've been keeping an eye on that.

419
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,830
Rym: And by and large people like everyone.

420
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,764
Rym: People are still contributing legit captions to our videos like all the time.

421
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:46,350
Rym: Crazy random people.

422
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:51,749
Rym: I might actually disable it now only because the auto captions are better than what people have been submitting.

423
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:54,314
Rym: But yeah, I don't know.

424
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:59,350
Rym: I don't know where the chapters appeared in our videos because I had not made a plan yet to use that feature.

425
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:07,030
Rym: And suddenly I noticed it appeared on almost all of our panels, except for old panels that like no one has watched in a long time.

426
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,342
Rym: But old panels that get watched a lot have very detailed chapters.

427
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:12,490
Scott: So, OK, that's nice.

428
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:12,871
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:14,013
Rym: All right.

430
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:15,055
Rym: WarioWare.

431
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:23,010
Rym: Last time we talked about WarioWare on GeekNights was in 2007 when we reviewed WarioWare Smooth Moves for the Wii.

432
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,490
Rym: And looking at the notes from that episode, we gave it a very poor review.

433
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:27,912
Scott: Right.

434
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:31,410
Scott: So the problem with WarioWare Smooth Moves, if you don't want to go back and listen to it.

435
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:39,090
Scott: That was the Wii one is that, you know, a lot of the games were trying to use, you know, the Wii motion controls and whatnot.

436
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:43,010
Scott: And that's and thus they had limited sort of staying power.

437
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:43,410
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:49,810
Scott: And also all the multiplayer, all the multiplayer modes basically were, you know, mediocre at best.

439
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:50,571
Scott: Yeah.

440
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:53,901
Scott: So and then the greatest WarioWare.

441
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:56,950
Rym: And after that WarioWare, we just didn't play a lot of WarioWare.

442
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,397
Rym: Like a Wii U one came out.

443
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,322
Rym: We didn't have Wii U's.

444
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,569
Scott: Obviously no one has a Wii U.

445
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:06,110
Rym: So we got back into the Wario game just recently with a new one that just came out on the Switch.

446
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:06,972
Scott: Right.

447
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:13,409
Scott: Well, we played the demo of this when it came out, when we were at the beach and it was kind of fun, you know.

448
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:19,307
Scott: So I went ahead and, you know, I chose to be the sacrificial lamb on this one.

449
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,510
Scott: And I went out and I bought the new one and I played the single player.

450
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:32,846
Scott: So what I can tell you about the single player in this Wario is that much like all the other Wario micro games, the way it works is you start with Wario.

451
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:33,490
Scott: Right.

452
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,128
Scott: And there's a section of groups of micro games according to the different characters.

453
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:38,510
Scott: Right.

454
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,518
Scott: You know, Ashley has these games.

455
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,261
Scott: Right.

456
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,050
Scott: Orbulan has these games.

457
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,794
Scott: Nine vault has these games.

458
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:49,890
Scott: And you go through this plot and each plot you encounter the characters one at a time.

459
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:55,390
Scott: You know, you encounter a character and you had to play a bunch of micro games themed to that character.

460
00:27:56,352 --> 00:27:59,970
Scott: Then you have to do some sort of boss fight, which is, you know, unique and interesting.

461
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:06,870
Scott: And then you go to the next character and you keep doing that until you've beaten all the characters sets of micro games.

462
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,565
Scott: And there will still be micro games to unlock further.

463
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:11,790
Scott: The game isn't like done yet.

464
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,696
Scott: But that's just how the single player goes.

465
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:17,669
Scott: You progress through a whole bunch of games and bosses and then you beat the game.

466
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:32,229
Scott: So as a Wario micro game, it's like if you enjoyed the old, you know, the original ones like the GBA one, the first one or the GameCube one single player, you're going to enjoy this single player, too.

467
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,850
Scott: It's, you know, got a lot of, you know, the same kind of, you know, games going on.

468
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,129
Scott: Some of them are really interesting and fun and have fun themes.

469
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:44,205
Scott: You know, especially everyone always loves the Nintendo themed ones.

470
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,010
Scott: Those are always great.

471
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:52,270
Rym: It's also added a little interesting complexity, which we'll get into with the characters that I don't think any Warioware had done before.

472
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,592
Scott: No.

473
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:58,450
Scott: So this is like a positive and a negative and is the key feature of this Wario.

474
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:08,970
Scott: See, unlike a lot of the previous Warios that were relying on like the Wii one went hard on the Wii motion controls, the DS one went hard with the stylus.

475
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:14,810
Scott: So this Switch one, the Switch has motion controls, but they just went back to button pressing.

476
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,730
Scott: They didn't go with any of that stuff.

477
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,092
Rym: The correct call.

478
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:26,110
Rym: You only use the control schemes that are used by the majority of games and people unless you're making like DDR or something.

479
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,910
Scott: Yeah, D-pads and buttons, right?

480
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,331
Rym: Yep.

481
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:32,970
Rym: You can have an extra mode of like the motion minigame, but don't make that required.

482
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:33,612
Scott: Yeah.

483
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:35,398
Scott: There was the GBA twisted one, right?

484
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:38,930
Scott: Where you got to tilt the controller, had the thing built into the cartridge, that one.

485
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,201
Scott: But anyway, this one goes back to normal controls.

486
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,810
Scott: So what did they do to mix things up on the Switch?

487
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,370
Scott: Well, it's get it together is the title of the game because all of the characters are together.

488
00:29:51,510 --> 00:30:02,770
Scott: See, all of these micro games are games in which you are controlling one of the characters that is in the wide array of WarioWare characters.

489
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:08,010
Scott: And each of those characters controls and plays completely differently.

490
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:09,898
Scott: Some of them can fly.

491
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,989
Scott: Some of them can shoot some of them.

492
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:19,010
Rym: Some of them are jumping constantly and shooting objects like they're like, some of them are extremely weird and hard to control.

493
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:19,871
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:23,270
Scott: So each character is wildly different in the way it works.

495
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,077
Scott: Some can only shoot straight up.

496
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:29,349
Scott: Some, you know, it's like they're all very different from each other.

497
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:39,990
Scott: So and every single micro game can theoretically be beaten no matter which character you happen to have chosen.

498
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:49,010
Scott: But based on which micro game it is and which character you have, it may be really, really easy or really, really hard.

499
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,078
Rym: Like a mini game, a micro game of avoid.

500
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:56,030
Rym: the thing is real hard when you're playing the constantly jumping character.

501
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:56,832
Scott: Right.

502
00:30:56,912 --> 00:31:02,950
Scott: Or the game where it's like, oh, you just have to shoot something that's on the right side of the screen, but you've got the character who always shoots to the left.

503
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:06,590
Scott: So you've got to hustle to the right side of the screen and shoot it from the other side.

504
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,353
Scott: Yeah.

505
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:08,136
Scott: Right.

506
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,048
Scott: So that's that.

507
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:21,690
Scott: And then but as a result of all these characters that control completely differently, if you play the single player, it teaches you the characters one at a time.

508
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,632
Scott: You start with Wario.

509
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:23,114
Scott: Yeah.

510
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:23,394
Scott: Right.

511
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,299
Scott: And then there's a tutorial.

512
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,290
Scott: It gives you tutorials for each new character as you encounter them throughout the game.

513
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:33,690
Scott: And then you're obviously only playing with characters you've already learned about.

514
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:43,650
Scott: So if you play the single player game, you get it sort of like a positive experience where it really old games become new and fresh again because you have a different character to play with.

515
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:50,350
Scott: You know, you're constantly it's not very samey as you go through the game, like each new level is like a whole new thing.

516
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:58,330
Scott: Playing through the game again, you know, and trying to unlock new stuff might actually be interesting if you're using different characters the second time through.

517
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:06,470
Rym: Like it might have the most single player, like novel content that's actually differentiated than any other WarioWare today.

518
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,510
Rym: Just because of that, you multiply the number of micro games by the large number of characters.

519
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,356
Rym: There are more characters than you're expecting, too.

520
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:14,338
Scott: Mm-hmm.

521
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,150
Scott: So yeah, and those characters you didn't even know were going to be in there, like hidden ones at the end.

522
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:21,914
Scott: So that's kind of a positive.

523
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:40,642
Scott: Like as far as WarioWare games go, if you like that kind of game, you know, I sort of put them in the same category as like, you know, even though these are micro, If a WarioWare game is not micro, it ends up looking a lot like Shapes and Beats or Super Hexagon, right?

524
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:44,870
Scott: Like a really simple input, you know, high skill kind of game, right?

525
00:32:45,250 --> 00:33:00,450
Scott: The skill in WarioWare games is lower, but because the game is so fast, the actual skill is not beating the games, but is instead recognizing the game, figuring out how to beat it, and then executing in a short amount of time.

526
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:14,470
Rym: Yep, and that's where, unlike other kinds of games, WarioWare games are games where how we would review it from a single player perspective might be radically different from how we'd review that same game from a multiplayer perspective.

527
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:26,850
Scott: Yep, so in this new Wario, of course there are multiplayer modes, which are the ones of most interest to us, because when those multiplayer modes have been good in the past, which was exactly once.

528
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:32,670
Rym: WarioWare GameCube, I can't believe we never did a review of it, we've talked about it in panels often.

529
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:42,150
Scott: All you have to know is that on WarioWare GameCube, there are many multiplayer modes, but two or three of them are actually quite good, the turtle one being the best one.

530
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,950
Rym: Turtle one, the dance party one, because it's simple and it does the job, and the space one are the three good ones.

531
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:48,172
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

532
00:33:48,813 --> 00:34:00,330
Scott: So, it's a really fun party game, like Bomberman level, quality, amazing party game, so every time a Wario comes out, if it has multiplayer modes, you're like, "Ooh, is this going to be an amazing party

533
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:00,530
Scott: game?".

534
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:12,469
Scott: So this new Wario, it does have quite a few multiplayer modes, and I would say that they are, you know, not all of them are good, but some of them are pretty good.

535
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:24,510
Scott: The problem is, those characters, if you sit down to play this as a party game, only someone who's played the single player knows all these characters.

536
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:37,409
Rym: And that is a radical departure from how multiplayer has succeeded in old WarioWares, in that with WarioWare GameCube, the pattern we would see everywhere, almost no one had played that game single player.

537
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:43,330
Rym: But, at any party, any event, you could just put it on the screen, people would sit down, and have a lot of fun.

538
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,302
Scott: Even if you had played it single player, it wouldn't really help you that much, right?

539
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,870
Scott: You'd just have more practice with a few of the games.

540
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:59,410
Rym: Yep, you might know all the mini games and be better at them, but you're not having that much of an advantage compared to someone who's never encountered them before.

541
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,550
Rym: And the person who's never encountered them before can engage with them and learn them very quickly.

542
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:08,500
Scott: And it's not really about an advantage, it's about disadvantage.

543
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,710
Scott: So here, every game you play, you've got these characters.

544
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:22,270
Scott: And if you don't know what the different characters do, there are times you might have to choose a character, or get stuck with a random one.

545
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:36,822
Scott: And in a short microgame, even if you can recognize the game, recognize how to beat it, etc, etc, when you add in extra time for "How do I beat it with this

546
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:37,504
Scott: character?"

547
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,390
Scott: Well, now you're sort of at the limit.

548
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:53,090
Rym: I would say, 90% of the games we played with our group of friends, who won a given mini game came down to which character happened to naturally be better at that microgame.

549
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:59,190
Scott: But also, even if you have the character who's naturally better at that game, Do you know how to use that character?

550
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,170
Scott: Do you know that character already?

551
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:10,050
Scott: If you don't know the character already, even if you are perfect at all the other aspects, that puts you over the top into the failure zone.

552
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,220
Scott: So it is not a huge advantage to have played the single player.

553
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,230
Scott: It is a tremendous disadvantage to have not played the single player.

554
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:27,930
Scott: If you don't know all the characters, you can't just jump into this, even if you're playing one of the good multiplayer modes.

555
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,810
Scott: You're just going to lose and lose and lose until you eventually pick up on the different characters.

556
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:40,970
Rym: But I'd say it's almost a deal breaker because the time it takes to learn the characters well enough to engage with this game There's so many of them.

557
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,190
Rym: Is far longer than the frustration threshold of losing in multiplayer for most people.

558
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,875
Scott: Right, if you're at a party, it's a party game.

559
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:50,078
Scott: You want to pick up and play.

560
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:54,570
Scott: You don't have time to play for 20 minutes, now we're ready to play for real.

561
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:58,350
Scott: It's like no one at a party is spending 20 minutes doing that.

562
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,921
Scott: So it's like only people who've already played the game.

563
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,430
Scott: And even if you've already played the game, have you played it recently?

564
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,589
Scott: Do you remember all the characters and how they work?

565
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,215
Scott: You know, I played it recently.

566
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:08,979
Scott: I bought it.

567
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:09,822
Scott: I own it.

568
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:11,369
Scott: And I don't remember all of them.

569
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,735
Scott: So that's sort of like a struggle.

570
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:16,801
Scott: You can't just jump in and play.

571
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:19,368
Scott: Well, a party game you can't jump in and play is a non-starter.

572
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:26,950
Rym: And I think that turns it into, I would say this is a upper tier, maybe top tier single player WarioWare game.

573
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:31,870
Rym: And it's a not bottom tier, but near the bottom.

574
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,115
Scott: Well, I would say it's.

575
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,090
Scott: in terms of multiplayer, I'd say it's second best, right?

576
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,490
Scott: You lose that ability to have people at a party jump in and play.

577
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:53,310
Scott: But if by somehow you have that scenario where everyone knows the characters or you're in college or something and everyone's playing it a bunch, then the good modes could be really good.

578
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:58,710
Rym: Like if we were at RIT, we would just play this like every other night for four years.

579
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,711
Scott: Right.

580
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:04,570
Scott: So let's go through, I guess, most of the different multiplayer modes and just talk about them quickly.

581
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,372
Rym: There aren't that many.

582
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:09,290
Rym: And honestly, none of them are even close to the GameCube WarioWare.

583
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:10,979
Scott: The balloon bag one.

584
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:11,725
Rym: It's the closest.

585
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,095
Scott: So there's gotta bounce.

586
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:20,270
Scott: So gotta bounce is basically keep the ball in the air mode, but it's multiplayer.

587
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,190
Scott: So you're all working together to keep the ball in the air without letting it hit the ground.

588
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:28,610
Scott: The longer you keep it up, weird stuff starts happening to keep it interesting.

589
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,970
Scott: But at any given moment, the ball is matching the color of one of the players.

590
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,810
Scott: So let's say the ball is green and I'm green and Rym's red.

591
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:44,730
Scott: Rym, there's nothing stopping Rym from like bouncing the ball and keeping it up off the ground because, you know, he's still a character.

592
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,176
Scott: He's still there at all times.

593
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,049
Scott: But we don't score any points for that.

594
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:55,890
Scott: It's if the ball is green, the green player must hit it and that will change its color and score a point.

595
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:01,050
Scott: So you basically need to not only coordinate, don't let it hit the ground.

596
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:06,209
Scott: You need to basically trade off between which player is hitting it according to its color.

597
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:16,750
Scott: But you don't necessarily, even if it's not your color, you don't necessarily want to run away from the ball because you might need to be the backup to keep it off the ground because that's game over.

598
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:17,249
Rym: Yep.

599
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,042
Scott: So this could be an interesting fun time, but I think it would get old.

600
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:24,750
Scott: Like once your group got good at it, you'd be like, all right, that's enough.

601
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,216
Rym: I mean, even before we got good at it, I'll be honest.

602
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:32,850
Rym: I was bored with it after a couple of minutes because it's just, can I make this integer go up before like we lose?

603
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,970
Scott: I think if you get it going longer, more interesting things start to happen.

604
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:44,470
Rym: But we never got it going that long for the things that are like is no one in our group understood the characters and partly because everyone got bored with this mode very quickly.

605
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,038
Scott: So the next one is daily grind.

606
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:49,730
Scott: So daily grind is like this competitive side scroller.

607
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:57,850
Scott: It's like an auto scroller and you each have a character and you're going sideways through this level where you can break bricks.

608
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,107
Scott: You can pick up contracts because it's like a business, right?

609
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:01,650
Scott: Daily grind.

610
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:06,439
Scott: Um, there's these guys that come and try to steal your contracts, uh, and whatnot.

611
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:12,810
Scott: And there's also these blocks you can hit that will make balls come out and the balls associate with other characters.

612
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:17,790
Scott: And if you grab a ball, you can spacey switch your character, which might be good or bad.

613
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:22,950
Scott: You have to be able to recognize which ball is which character and do you want to switch to that character?

614
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:28,250
Scott: And then can you dodge or intentionally grab the ball before someone else grabs it?

615
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:28,691
Rym: Right.

616
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:33,990
Scott: Um, and then you score points based on how many contracts you're holding when you get to the end.

617
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,799
Scott: And if you get hit too much, you get eliminated.

618
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,227
Scott: It's a little competitive side scroller thing.

619
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,270
Scott: It's okay.

620
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,710
Rym: Yeah.

621
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:45,370
Rym: I guess the problem I had with it was one, the side scrolling was too simplistic and too repetitive.

622
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,375
Scott: Like I would much rather play.

623
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:47,476
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:52,610
Scott: Like, uh, you know, new Mario brothers co-op with multiple players or something like that.

625
00:40:52,830 --> 00:41:02,490
Rym: And the other problem was this one, even more so than other modes, if you don't know how all the characters work, you can't even engage with the only interesting mechanic in this mode.

626
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,454
Rym: Picking, like grabbing the ball to switch to a character.

627
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,395
Rym: Yep.

628
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:10,582
Scott: Uh, so yeah, there's a friendless battle, which is one player only.

629
00:41:10,662 --> 00:41:11,443
Scott: I didn't try that.

630
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:16,110
Scott: Maybe I should, uh, there's a high five mode, which is like a volleyball.

631
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,276
Scott: So the way this works is, you know, you're playing volleyball.

632
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:26,250
Scott: It's much very similar to the, the God of bounce, keep the ball in the air, but you're split into teams two on each side.

633
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,412
Rym: So it's actually competitive versus game.

634
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:29,313
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:33,538
Scott: Uh, and you obviously are trying to score in volleyball, right?

636
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:43,849
Scott: Every time though you hit the ball and keep it on your own side, it ticks up to number five or down, down to one.

637
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:44,390
Scott: It doesn't matter.

638
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,812
Scott: It's counting down.

639
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:51,038
Rym: It's like a shot clock almost, but the closer, the more accounts down, the harder your shot is.

640
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:51,999
Scott: Right.

641
00:41:52,059 --> 00:42:01,090
Scott: So you want to volley it to your own team several times and then hit it over the fence, the net, and it'll be a much harder, nastier shot.

642
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:05,821
Scott: But sometimes you don't want to do that because obviously you just get it over quickly.

643
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:06,021
Scott: Right.

644
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:08,227
Scott: It's better if you keep it on your own side, there's a risk.

645
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,650
Scott: You'll just drop it on your side.

646
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,031
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:13,095
Scott: Um, and there's also, I think there is a shot clock.

648
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:17,241
Scott: I think if you try to like dilly dally too long, you just, you know, a point gets scored on you.

649
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:20,345
Scott: Uh, but yeah, you're playing team volleyball two on two.

650
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:21,106
Scott: It's, it's all right.

651
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,790
Scott: I'd rather just play a volleyball game though.

652
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:23,990
Scott: Like.

653
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:30,382
Scott: I feel that like just like windjammers kings of the beach for the NES is probably more fun than this.

654
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:30,743
Rym: Yep.

655
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:34,470
Rym: Or even just like analogous games like windjammers are more fun than this.

656
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,730
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:43,736
Scott: Uh, there's a Julius Maximus, which is just a pretty straightforward, like who can do the micro games faster kind of thing.

658
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:45,137
Scott: Uh, why not?

659
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:47,859
Scott: It's a one on one, you know, thing, Julius, right?

660
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,160
Scott: Doing not much to say about that.

661
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,062
Scott: Rising star is also a dueling kind of thing.

662
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:53,903
Scott: This is interesting.

663
00:42:54,443 --> 00:43:01,288
Scott: Basically you are doing this mini game sort of together, right?

664
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,369
Scott: With the other player that you're competing with.

665
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:10,438
Scott: Uh, and then there's a, there's an AI judge of sorts that is judging who contributed most.

666
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,302
Scott: So if you lose the mini game, you all, you lost it, right?

667
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:18,970
Scott: But if you complete the mini game together, the judge is like, ah, that player contributed the most.

668
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:24,057
Scott: They're the star and it will give them a star and you can also lose stars, right?

669
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:29,084
Scott: And it's sort of a, you know, on the one hand, you're just trying to get to five stars and win.

670
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:33,750
Scott: Um, I'm not sure if you get eliminated when you go down to zero stars or not.

671
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,219
Scott: But yeah, you're just trying to convince, you know, play the mini games in such a way that you win them.

672
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,082
Scott: If you don't win them, you don't care.

673
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:45,610
Scott: But if you win them, you want to be the player that did the mini game better than the other player.

674
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,994
Scott: This concept I think is good.

675
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:52,081
Scott: Uh, cause you're, it's sort of co-op and competitive at the same time.

676
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:53,604
Scott: A lot like four swords, right?

677
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:56,549
Scott: You're working together, but also trying to get more gems and the other players.

678
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:56,810
Scott: Right.

679
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,634
Scott: But the judge is just so.

680
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:03,198
Scott: sometimes the judges makes perfect sense.

681
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:05,902
Scott: Uh, like, oh yeah, that clearly that person did better.

682
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:11,909
Scott: And the judge is like, yes, but sometimes like who the judge gives the star to it's like, how is he judging?

683
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,330
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:20,530
Rym: Well, I've noticed the judge would basically give a tie so often that I worry it wasn't even looking at enough like factors to differentiate.

685
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:26,417
Scott: I don't know how the judge works is probably, and I imagine pros will find some way to manipulate the judge.

686
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:29,782
Scott: So you just really can't take this mode seriously at all.

687
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:31,544
Scott: Uh, okay.

688
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:32,245
Scott: So good modes.

689
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:33,346
Scott: Here's some good modes.

690
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:33,987
Scott: Good mode.

691
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:36,270
Scott: Number one is balloon bang.

692
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,933
Scott: So the way balloon bang works is it's hot potato.

693
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:41,076
Scott: One person is playing mini games.

694
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:44,981
Scott: Every other player is inflating a balloon.

695
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:50,668
Scott: Whoever is playing mini games at the moment, the balloon explodes, loses.

696
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:52,530
Scott: everyone else wins hot potato.

697
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:58,757
Scott: All the players who are right, trying to inflate the balloon are playing like this.

698
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:03,222
Scott: Like they're, they're trying to do weird stuff outside of the mini game, right?

699
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:09,350
Scott: They're like spinning things and you know, and depending which character you have, you know, there's different interesting ways to interact.

700
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:12,650
Rym: All it does is are you pumping the balloon up faster or slower?

701
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:15,554
Scott: Well, it's the same as with turtles, right?

702
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:26,230
Scott: Biting the turtle tower, you know, uh, it's just, instead of the politics of choosing which turtle tower to bite, you're basically always attacking whoever is currently playing micro games.

703
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:38,110
Scott: If you're playing micro games, as soon as you successfully beat a micro game, you, as you escape the hot potato and the next player has to get sucked in and has to start playing them.

704
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:38,511
Rym: Yep.

705
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:41,730
Rym: And you're trapped in there until you beat a mini games or a micro game.

706
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,960
Scott: So if you just keep failing in micro games, you know, you might, that might be okay.

707
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,770
Scott: You know, let the, if the balloon's not inflated very much, yeah, let it inflate and then beat a game at the last second.

708
00:45:52,030 --> 00:46:00,601
Rym: The only drawback, like the only like problem I have with this mode is that in a four player or three player, especially four player, there's three of you pumping the balloon.

709
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:07,650
Rym: You pumping faster or slower or deciding not to pump at all really doesn't matter if the other two people are pumping it.

710
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,216
Rym: It's going to go around the same time.

711
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:11,959
Rym: And it's really just hot potato.

712
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:16,770
Rym: Like that part, you don't have much agency or interaction with the game on that sidebar of pumping.

713
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:17,671
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,737
Scott: The, the pumping is fun and interesting to try to figure out how to pump harder.

715
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:30,230
Scott: Uh, and it might make it, that might make a difference when it's very close to being popped in terms of like whether it's one or this player loses or the next player.

716
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,509
Rym: Except all your info really is, is am I pumping at maximum speed or am I not pumping at all?

717
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:44,186
Scott: You could pump, you know, a little bit or I don't think you could plan enough for that to try to pump at maximum speed and fail at the execution of it.

718
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,210
Scott: Cause it does, you know, mix things up over there.

719
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:55,650
Scott: But yeah, it's basically the pumping is just a timer effectively, but it's a, you know, it's a slightly variable timer based on player input, right?

720
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,939
Scott: It's like the balloon is going to pop after a roughly X seconds from the start of the game.

721
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:07,610
Scott: And if you're based on how good everyone is and whoever is playing at that moment will be the loser.

722
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:09,372
Scott: Right.

723
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:09,532
Scott: Okay.

724
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:11,395
Scott: The next one, sly angle.

725
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:19,048
Scott: So in this one, you play like these sorta, uh, you, you have to like grab characters to the middle, right?

726
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:20,370
Scott: There's like a little game for that.

727
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:27,163
Rym: Which this is a big problem because grabbing the characters is a skill base is the primary skill input into this other than the micro games.

728
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:31,130
Rym: But if you don't know all the characters that won't, you won't engage with that game.

729
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:36,510
Scott: It's also kind of hard to, even if you can see the characters spinning around real fast and know which one you want.

730
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,550
Rym: It's still real random.

731
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:44,650
Scott: It's still real random, but then you play games and if you win the games, you get to put a flag in a hole.

732
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:56,090
Scott: And if you put flags in enough holes to, you know, as soon as you get your third flag down, they form a triangle and it covers the triangle now covers territory sort of like Splatoon.

733
00:47:56,451 --> 00:48:00,750
Rym: It's a lot like the space game in WarioWare on the GameCube.

734
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:03,084
Scott: Well, that was a, yeah, that was a bingo situation.

735
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:04,009
Scott: You know, where is this?

736
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:06,130
Rym: That was an Othello situation.

737
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,074
Scott: Oh, you're right.

738
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,490
Scott: Othello situation, exactly.

739
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:13,330
Scott: But when you win games, you basically are winning the right to conquer territory.

740
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:18,990
Scott: And when all the games have been played and it's over, whoever has the most territory wins.

741
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:28,810
Scott: So it's really an abstraction on just a scoring mechanism, you know, just to spice things up a little bit as opposed to just giving you points for beating games.

742
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:35,750
Scott: It's like, all right, well now conquer territory, you know, because you beat a game, you can put a flag down.

743
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:37,810
Scott: It makes it a little bit interesting.

744
00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:38,484
Scott: A little bit.

745
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,850
Scott: You know, it's okay.

746
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:48,410
Rym: I feel like the most interesting mechanic would be the fact that whoever's doing better has less agency in what character they get.

747
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:54,789
Rym: Like it's got a good mechanism there, but it's still pretty, it's like, it's still so random that we couldn't really engage with it.

748
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:55,788
Scott: No.

749
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,729
Rym: And if you don't know the characters, you can't engage at all.

750
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,550
Scott: Right.

751
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:03,970
Scott: What may be the second best or tied for best mode with the balloon bang, pucker up.

752
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:14,670
Scott: So the way this works is the mini game is being played inside of this like hockey puck thing.

753
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:15,930
Scott: Right.

754
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:23,170
Scott: So you're playing a mini game inside this thing and everyone else is literally like smashing into it.

755
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:31,849
Scott: So it's like you're playing on a screen within a screen and everyone else is fuck is outside of that screen, smashing into that screen.

756
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:39,510
Rym: Similar to what you do in the dance mode in the game cube, except way more extreme.

757
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:40,406
Scott: Yeah.

758
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:45,790
Scott: It's like, you know, it becomes really hard sometimes to play a mini game.

759
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:52,510
Rym: It's like if the box you're playing one and we actually got a ground pound going to re squash the screen to the point that you literally couldn't see anything.

760
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:53,488
Scott: Yup.

761
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:57,830
Scott: Uh, but it's like you could beat the micro game inside without seeing anything.

762
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,503
Scott: Somehow sometimes people won the micro games.

763
00:50:00,543 --> 00:50:01,870
Scott: It was like, how the hell did you see that?

764
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,248
Scott: How did you know what was happening?

765
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,926
Rym: Hope it's a press eight mini game.

766
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:05,928
Scott: Yup.

767
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,890
Scott: It's like it could just happen.

768
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:23,250
Scott: You don't know, but yeah, it's a, you know, it's kind of interesting a little bit, but, um, you know, it's, you know, definitely I, you know, I've never seen anything like that where, you know, you're, you're really playing in the game inside a window in the video.

769
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:25,229
Scott: It's like a monitor in a monitor deal.

770
00:50:25,992 --> 00:50:27,829
Scott: Um, so very clever who came up with that.

771
00:50:28,432 --> 00:50:28,722
Scott: All right.

772
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:40,230
Scott: And the last one, this frenemy frenzy is sort of like a, uh, extremely light version of smash brothers where you're, the characters are sort of directly fighting each other.

773
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:40,830
Rym: It's bad.

774
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,347
Scott: It's like, it's just, yeah, it's, it's really meh.

775
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,427
Rym: You're better off playing Brawlhalla than this.

776
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:47,154
Scott: Just play smash brothers.

777
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:47,797
Scott: You have a switch.

778
00:50:47,857 --> 00:50:50,790
Scott: Why are you, why do you need to play this really meh version?

779
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,729
Scott: You can play the real deal.

780
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,760
Rym: Like I, we don't even need to tear it apart.

781
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,564
Rym: It's just bad.

782
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,409
Rym: Like it's not fun.

783
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,268
Scott: It's not, you know, I don't know why they put this in there.

784
00:50:59,309 --> 00:50:59,450
Scott: Right.

785
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:07,370
Scott: I guess if you don't have smash brothers, I don't know, but why would you want to play a really simplified version of, of, uh, a good game?

786
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:16,270
Rym: I guess in the end, the way I'd, what I'd say about this Mario ware is if you are, are into single-player Wario ware, absolutely buy this.

787
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,189
Rym: Like, absolutely.

788
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,760
Scott: Because I mean, when Wario ware is used to come out frequently.

789
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,210
Scott: now, not so much, you're not going to get another one for quite a while.

790
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,870
Scott: And this one's added a lot to the single player.

791
00:51:26,632 --> 00:51:28,650
Scott: Is a lot of replay value because of the characters.

792
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:32,990
Scott: And because there are so many micro games, you will get a lot out of this as single player.

793
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:37,662
Scott: But the price on this right now is the full price.

794
00:51:38,424 --> 00:51:40,810
Scott: I say, wait for the price to go down.

795
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:45,350
Scott: I only bought it at this price because I was the sacrificial lamb, right?

796
00:51:45,871 --> 00:51:46,695
Scott: Don't do right.

797
00:51:46,816 --> 00:51:49,510
Scott: And I, me and I sacrificed myself and my money.

798
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:52,030
Rym: I would pay 20 bucks for a single for this game.

799
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:54,827
Scott: So that you don't have to pay that full price.

800
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:55,290
Scott: Right.

801
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:01,450
Scott: So don't, I'm telling you what I learned is by paying the full price is that you don't have to wait until the price goes down.

802
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:04,382
Scott: It will eventually, it's Nintendo, right?

803
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:06,270
Scott: So it's going to take a while, a long while.

804
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,670
Rym: Only buy it now if you're like a lifer in the Wario ware single player universe.

805
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,124
Rym: Like you played Wario ware.

806
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:14,671
Scott: Yep.

807
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:20,630
Scott: Especially like when this, you know, when the switch is starting to see its waning days, this game will be like probably on sale.

808
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:25,130
Scott: And probably a good purchase and a way to get some extra mileage out of your switch.

809
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:25,991
Scott: Right.

810
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:30,269
Scott: Single player, you know, a few days, maybe a week or two, depending on how much you get into it.

811
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:32,555
Scott: You know, that'll be worth it.

812
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:36,470
Scott: The full price, really tough to say you should spend the full price on this.

813
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:42,770
Rym: If you're into multiplayer Wario ware, only consider this for multiplayer.

814
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:56,230
Rym: If like Scott said earlier, you are confident that you have a group of people who will play it with you regularly, who will themselves play the single player and know how the game goes, or are willing to deal with the frustration of learning all of the characters.

815
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:57,927
Rym: Or the multiplayer is not worth it.

816
00:52:58,772 --> 00:52:58,932
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:05,050
Scott: If your friends are like into it, um, you know, at least you really only need, you know, two people, right?

818
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,450
Scott: Cause there's several good two people modes, you know?

819
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:21,749
Scott: Um, but yeah, if you've got, you know, two plus people up for maximum, obviously you are into it, then it might be worth it to pay the full price cause you'd be doing the multiplayer and the single player.

820
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:34,110
Scott: But if it's just you alone or you're looking for that, you know, the party game aspect and not everyone's into it, hold off or, you know, just pass.

821
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:48,190
Rym: If I had to rake Wario wares in terms of the multiplayer low, like in-person party game experience, cause a lot of them are single player only, this is the second best out of the two that have any amount of local multiplayer that's worth anything.

822
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:49,153
Rym: Right.

823
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:53,990
Scott: I wish they, you know, I guess there aren't GameCube games on virtual console.

824
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:54,711
Rym: Oh my God.

825
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:59,870
Rym: All I want is, I mean, I guess we can just bust out the GameCube to play the good multiplayer WarioWare.

826
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,814
Scott: I don't need to bust out a GameCube.

827
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:03,083
Scott: I have a Wii that plays GameCube games and I have the disc.

828
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:04,630
Scott: I can just play it anytime.

829
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,574
Rym: So there is a third mode.

830
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:18,110
Rym: If you are one of those single player WarioWare people who is deep into WarioWare, like obviously get this, there is competitive online ranked play, the Wario Cup.

831
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:24,010
Rym: We didn't try, I didn't try it obviously, but looking at how it works, it looks like it's pretty good.

832
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:30,050
Rym: The only worry I have is Nintendo does not have a good track record of keeping fake records out of those kinds of things.

833
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:36,510
Rym: I worry that's going to turn into everyone's got perfect scores cheating and you can't interact with it, but time will tell.

834
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:40,219
Rym: But if it works, the ranked mode could be real fun.

835
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,310
Rym: So you can actually prove if you are good at single player WarioWare or not.

836
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,150
Scott: Yeah.

837
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:52,070
Scott: If that's the, if you're deep into that, you know, like, you know, get it, you know, being competitive and getting high scores and things that could be worthwhile.

838
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:57,449
Scott: I didn't really try it, but I could easily imagine what it's like.

839
00:54:58,452 --> 00:55:00,155
Scott: And it will have a lot of depth, right?

840
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:01,899
Scott: Because of all the different characters, right?

841
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:07,310
Scott: Depth beyond what the older micro game would have had if they had a similar mode to that.

842
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,690
Rym: So it might be the deepest.

843
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:24,390
Scott: If indeed it comes to pass that Nintendo does not moderate the leaderboards on there very well and people scam them somehow, you may want to see if, I don't know if it exists, if there's an online community keeping more legit leaderboards.

844
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,516
Scott: Or if there's any kind of speed runs you, you can speed run.

845
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:32,687
Scott: the single player story mode on this would be quite a good speed run if you could do that.

846
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:33,810
Scott: I hope to see it at a GDQ.

847
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:39,388
Rym: Now that I looked at the world record for WarioWare touch speed run appears to be 29 minutes.

848
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,728
Rym: So I'm just going to find a YouTube video of that because I'm really curious to see what that looks like.

849
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:51,027
Scott: It probably, I imagine that you're just going to see every micro game end in like a fraction of a second, like boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, right?

850
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:51,769
Scott: Like something like that.

851
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,985
Scott: And they just had to play so many of them to get to the end, right?

852
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:57,050
Scott: Because that's how it's structured.

853
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:07,470
Scott: So, I mean, overall, I'm glad Nintendo is keeping WarioWare alive because I do love the characters and the idea and it's a unique thing mostly.

854
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:17,950
Scott: And, you know, they still, they made one, you know, I wish Nintendo, you know, there's so many, my favorite Nintendo things are always, you know, the more quirky, you know, smaller type deals.

855
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:24,345
Scott: You know, we love an advanced wars, you know, uh, but you know, they, they brought one back, so that's good.

856
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:26,450
Scott: I'd love to see just a Wario platformer.

857
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,610
Scott: It's been a while since we had one of those was, you know, right.

858
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:29,991
Rym: Yeah.

859
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,229
Rym: I mean, the old Wario Land games were fantastic.

860
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:33,231
Scott: Yeah.

861
00:56:33,312 --> 00:56:38,408
Scott: And all, you know, this, the single player for this, you got all the fun characters and story and stuff like that going on.

862
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:38,790
Scott: It's good.

863
00:56:39,591 --> 00:56:43,649
Scott: But yeah, I wouldn't, the full price, if you're not a podcaster who needs to discuss it.

864
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:44,570
Rym: Yup.

865
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:51,120
Rym: At this point, I almost, the last magfest we went to before COVID, there was some like bootleggy game.

866
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:58,290
Rym: people were making that was like all this Toho stuff, but they basically made WarioWare from the GameCube, like that kind of game.

867
00:56:59,091 --> 00:57:00,855
Rym: And it was pretty good.

868
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:06,710
Rym: I feel like if we want that kind of experience, you just got to make it as an indie game and not try to make a WarioWare game.

869
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:13,550
Rym: Because based on Nintendo's track record, the local party mode that Scott and I are obsessed with is not what they're going for.

870
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,709
Rym: The one WarioWare that we talk about so much was the aberration.

871
00:57:18,612 --> 00:57:18,753
Scott: Yeah.

872
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:20,259
Scott: So yeah, the, the price of this game is $50.

873
00:57:20,259 --> 00:57:20,762
Scott: It's like, uh.

874
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:23,613
Scott: 20.

875
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,970
Rym: I would pay 20 to play the single player of this game.

876
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,919
Scott: Oh, so because I just searched, uh, I discovered, I guess I missed this somehow.

877
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,090
Scott: There was a WarioWare gold for the 3DS that had 300 plus micro games in it.

878
00:57:38,031 --> 00:57:40,310
Scott: Um, and I guess I completely missed that one.

879
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,525
Rym: I still have a 3DS if I can get that game cheap.

880
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:43,270
Rym: Yeah.

881
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:43,731
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:48,426
Scott: And there was also the DIY one where you make your own ones for the regular DS.

883
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:49,530
Scott: I never played that one either.

884
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:50,894
Rym: I never played that.

885
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:52,660
Rym: I don't know why when I think back.

886
00:57:53,062 --> 00:57:54,286
Rym: I think, I don't know.

887
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:55,350
Rym: I don't know why I didn't play that.

888
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:02,750
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, I'm glad WarioWare is a thing, but they have not yet recreated the greatness of the game people.

889
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,395
Rym: I doubt they ever will at this point.

890
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:08,749
Rym: The WarioWare games are single player or situational multiplayer at best.

891
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,187
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

892
00:58:15,227 --> 00:58:20,220
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

893
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,620
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

894
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,568
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

895
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:32,800
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

896
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,816
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

897
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,170
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

898
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

899
00:58:44,781 --> 00:58:49,036
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights in November the 9th.

900
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,517
Rym: [unintelligible].

901
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,765
Rym: So while we were doing the show, someone just tweeted at us.

902
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,454
Rym: And basically, can't believe you guys are still doing GeekNights after 16 years.

903
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,780
Rym: One of the OG listeners here.

904
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:16,799
Rym: So yeah, super cool dude.

905
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:27,120
Rym: Also, we will announce the new Book Club book officially once we do the episode where we talk about Genji.

906
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:36,540
Rym: However, for any of you who watch the livestream, I did say what the book will be in that chat of the livestream from this episode.

907
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:38,999
Rym: But we have not officially announced it anywhere else.

908
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:42,290
Rym: So do with that what you will.

909
00:59:42,311 --> 01:00:12,080
Rym: And for now, I leave you with... The man was a genuine cyborg!

910
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,044
Rym: He was a tactical genius.

911
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:19,420
Rym: He figured out a way just six ragtag villains could hijack the ninth wonder of the world.

912
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:26,160
Rym: Because he calculated the precise time, the entire Gargantua crew could all be found in one place.

913
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,708
Scott: Extra, extra!

914
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,300
Rym: It's Movie Night 2!

915
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,591
Rym: Wait a minute!

916
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,518
Rym: I call bullshit!

917
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,280
Rym: You're talking about the Movie Night Massacre, the night Jonas Venture died?

918
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:38,299
Rym: That wasn't part of our plan.

919
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:39,528
Rym: The massacre.

920
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,299
Rym: That wasn't us.

921
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,724
Scott: Yeah, no kidding.

922
01:00:42,824 --> 01:00:47,060
Rym: Because every OSI grunt knows it was Sphinx killed Jonas Venture.

923
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,033
Rym: Yeah, you guys will believe anything.

924
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:52,479
Rym: Sovereign knew that.

925
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:59,979
Rym: So instead of executing us when he found out how our unsanctioned raid went south, he made lemonade.

926
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:03,869
Scott: That set off the Pyramid Wars.

927
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,840
Rym: I got recruited to fight in those.

928
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,470
Rym: Yes, and you did one heck of a job.

929
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,959
Rym: Wiped our competition right off the map.

930
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:13,125
Scott: Oh, look at that!

931
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:18,320
Rym: I have never actually seen a man realize his whole life has been a lie.
