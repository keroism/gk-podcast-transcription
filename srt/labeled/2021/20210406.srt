1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,949
Rym: It's Tuesday April 6th 2021.

2
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,278
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,090
Rym: We are talking about JRPGs the genre.

4
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:19,619
Scott: let's do this.

5
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,291
Rym: So we didn't want to review the game.

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:30,423
Rym: We just played and actually I'm looking at the Final seconds of this game, but we're playing another train game right now called 1828.

7
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:31,851
Scott: Let's just become train nights.

8
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,139
Scott: forget this GeekNights business

9
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:42,988
Rym: I mean, I feel like a big reason why we're playing so many train games is because we're stuck inside at home all day while we're working and Like this website

10
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,600
Scott: happened to come into existence at the exact right time

11
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:58,720
Rym: we happen to have a group of people who already knew the deal with train games and They really suit themselves to asynchronous play far more than a lot of other types of games for a lot of reasons We talked about in a recent episode on asynchronous play.

12
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:13,740
Rym: So, you know, but all I want to say is if I guess it we could be a geek bite this 1828 one Intrigues me quite a bit and I think it's equal in my eyes now to 1817 in terms of want to play it again.

13
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:16,910
Scott: Yeah, this 80 this is a good one.

14
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,499
Scott: This 1828 I would recommend.

15
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:21,960
Rym: Yeah, like I think the and well 12 reviewed at some point.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,700
Rym: We just don't want to do a million train reviews all in a row and I've got to play it again.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:40,520
Rym: But the thing I'll say is that the sign one of the signs we've noticed of a good train game compared to a mediocre one Or just an okay one is if after the first play We all go whoa, and then the next time the same group of people play we play it radically differently.

18
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,490
Rym: That's usually a sign that it's one that's got some staying power.

19
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,440
Rym: Mmm, if there's one like 1889 I like but every like second time I played it I did the exact same thing.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:59,118
Rym: I tried to do the first time just better third time fourth time every time it almost always goes the same basic way, but this one looks like it can go in a lot of different directions.

21
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,332
Rym: and Like going back through my early moves in this game.

22
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,660
Rym: What the fuck was wrong with Rym?

23
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,364
Rym: Why did he?

24
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,637
Rym: why did he wait to par Michigan Central?

25
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:07,260
Rym: Like that was a mistake?

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,300
Scott: This one I mean how I didn't understand what the I didn't realize the 8e wasn't just an eight train.

27
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:21,340
Rym: I love how you looked at in a 3d and thought oh that D. Yeah, you understood the D. That's a big deal.

28
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:25,035
Rym: We talked a lot about the D But at no point where you were like, why does that other train have any?

29
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:25,739
Rym: I guess it's not.

30
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:25,940
Scott: I did.

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,156
Scott: I said why I thought to myself why is there an e that must mean something?

32
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:30,745
Scott: and I'm like, yeah I'm not gonna look it up.

33
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,208
Scott: Whatever.

34
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:34,753
Scott: I'll just do play the game and then it's like oops Actually, it was a big deal.

35
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,459
Scott: I messed it up.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,616
Rym: Well, not like the 1817. we played with the listener where I literally just forgot that outstanding market shares dropped stock price at the end of the SR in that one and made a catastrophic error.

37
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,280
Rym: Yep, what I should have done is mutually shorted and that would have been fun.

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,932
Rym: But instead I was like, oh, I'm fine.

39
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,120
Rym: He can't rust any trains.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,144
Rym: This is gonna be fine.

41
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:57,036
Rym: And then when the OR starts and I saw that stock price drop.

42
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:00,378
Rym: I was like, oh, yeah 1817 fuck.

43
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:06,124
Rym: Anyway Anyway, there is a decent amount of gaming news But we're gonna start with.

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,033
Rym: is that PAX East?

45
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:09,600
Rym: this is officially announced.

46
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:13,013
Rym: There is gonna be no PAX East this year as we assume.

47
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:13,635
Scott: Oh my god.

48
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,940
Scott: I didn't see that coming.

49
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,724
Scott: Whoa, what a surprise.

50
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:16,931
Rym: Better call James Randi.

51
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:22,936
Rym: We got an Nostradamus here But uh, you're gonna need an Nostradamus to call James Randi.

52
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,746
Rym: Oh, yeah Rest in peace.

53
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,933
Rym: You were a cool dude, but pexis.

54
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:34,907
Rym: There's gonna be no pexis this year because April May probably June like.

55
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:43,013
Rym: I'm not gonna speculate about the rest of the year in terms of like odds of a convention happening, but Spring and early summer is just off the table.

56
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:47,447
Rym: Like it is too soon Like things there's things are still evolving.

57
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:51,720
Rym: I applaud packs for making these decision and they have a statement that we'll just link to.

58
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:58,999
Rym: But also they're gonna do another packs online because it actually went really well and whatever that looks like we're gonna be there for it.

59
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:00,737
Scott: All right, sure.

60
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:02,809
Rym: Maybe we'll do a new panel.

61
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,675
Rym: I got I got a panel.

62
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:05,344
Rym: I've been working on It's in the.

63
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,260
Rym: I've actually I've done some research.

64
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,532
Rym: I've got a little bit of data, but I got to get more.

65
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,020
Rym: the problem is to get more data.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,341
Rym: You know what?

67
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:11,743
Rym: I got to do.

68
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:15,760
Rym: I actually have to go record myself playing Team Fortress 2 with randos.

69
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:28,824
Rym: Okay, like I literally need a few hours of footage of me earnestly trying to play Team Fortress 2 online against real people trying to win and I need to do it with every single character class.

70
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:33,904
Rym: So I need like two hours of my own play for every character class as Data for this panel.

71
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:34,325
Rym: Thankfully.

72
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,738
Rym: I already have more than that for overwatch because that's almost all I play these days.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,720
Rym: But I look forward to a packs online, I think it's the right decision.

74
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,940
Rym: We'll see if PAX West happens.

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:56,340
Rym: I think that's iffy because even if September like a miracle happens and the world is way safer My suspicion is it's gonna be too late to plan September cons, especially cons that involve big industry presence.

76
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:57,824
Rym: So we'll see.

77
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:03,071
Rym: I feel like PAX Unplugged is the first big Convention that has a chance of happening.

78
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:03,775
Rym: that I would like

79
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:07,625
Scott: it has a chance But I'm not even gonna give it a 50% chance No, but it's

80
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:11,668
Rym: one where if I was in a casino when I saw those odds I might throw a little bit of money at it

81
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,517
Scott: if you have to bet on one, right?

82
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:19,380
Scott: Yeah, and it's like if the gate if you made a game and the game was okay.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,999
Scott: Here's a list of all packs is for the next three years.

84
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:28,039
Scott: Right put a token on the first packs that will happen without going over.

85
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,160
Scott: That's it's either that one or soon after is where it's either that or it's like.

86
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,012
Rym: I don't even know about South because the whole Texas situation.

87
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,820
Rym: so it might be East if it's not unplugged.

88
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,503
Scott: Yeah, all right.

89
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:46,640
Scott: It's like that's the area where the tokens car with the current odds are likely to lay, right?

90
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:48,387
Scott: So yeah.

91
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,094
Rym: Yep.

92
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:49,579
Rym: All right.

93
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:57,551
Scott: So III the horrible conferences existed our whole lives which is it had such a mystique like before?

94
00:05:57,611 --> 00:06:03,229
Rym: we knew what it was like like In those early internet days like early petty arcade days.

95
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,858
Rym: there was a weird mystique like everyone wants a mistake even in the 90s.

96
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:21,414
Scott: Yeah because it was like hey all the video game all the big video game companies get together in this place once a year and show off all the new video games before anywhere else and there weren't really like Big fan cons like you know them today.

97
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:22,660
Rym: that were gaming company, right?

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,843
Scott: That were all you use.

99
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:28,440
Scott: the only thing you you could only experience e3 through the pages of a video game magazine.

100
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,640
Scott: Right, like someone telling you I went to this amazing Holy Land.

101
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:36,083
Scott: Let me tell you about it with some photos and some text and it's like Holy.

102
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:40,300
Rym: I see a photo and be like wait, are they playing a prototype of hardware that didn't come out yet?

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,378
Rym: I would like salivate over those images.

104
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,781
Scott: Right and there was like these mysterious was like Hall E or something Like.

105
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:52,754
Scott: there was supposedly this hall that had like, you know, the small time Rondo stuff that we write.

106
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:57,955
Rym: that was like Not to be confused with the special hall at the San Diego comic-con.

107
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:58,758
Rym: That's a whole other thing.

108
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,319
Rym: Hall D I forget which one's which that all blurs together, right?

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,186
Scott: The San Diego comic-con one is just.

110
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,520
Scott: that's just a big panel room that has the big lines and the big celebrities.

111
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:17,505
Scott: the one at the E3 is like the secret room where the small time places are showing off these, you know rarity games like hey kid Here's the good stuff Right exactly.

112
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,880
Scott: Anyway, the point is obviously e3 is you know, it's gone up.

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,289
Scott: It's gone down up and down all over the place.

114
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,014
Scott: bad good getting their lunch eaten by packs Who knows companies have left saying we don't need you.

115
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,039
Scott: We'll do all our own thing.

116
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,668
Scott: Oh wait We'll come back and we'll work with you.

117
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,197
Scott: We're gonna not happen.

118
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:33,619
Scott: We're gonna happen.

119
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,423
Scott: Pandemic reasons.

120
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,992
Scott: other reasons what's happening with e3 this year?

121
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,380
Scott: e3 is not only happening this year.

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,118
Scott: It's an online only deal and all the big companies seem to be going in on it.

123
00:07:46,740 --> 00:08:00,640
Rym: Nintendo's like yeah Okay III will come and do your online e3 and then such and such so make sense because they need There's that you need to tie your buzz to a broader buzz or have earth-shattering news to get noticed.

124
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,849
Scott: I know they got their Nintendo direct today.

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,474
Scott: What do they need e3 for?

126
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:06,657
Scott: but I guess they're going in on it.

127
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:11,908
Rym: So What was the next buzz Nintendo was gonna have until they announced dates?

128
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:22,866
Scott: for breath of the wild - I Don't know the point is be on the lookout for Big hot news is from all the video game companies all at once in a blob around.

129
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,090
Scott: the time actually happens.

130
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:25,053
Scott: There's a split.

131
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:29,328
Rym: so Nintendo Microsoft Konami and Ubisoft are like doubling down on e3 online.

132
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:36,068
Rym: Yeah, Activision and Sony are not going to be included at this time, right?

133
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,841
Scott: Yeah And you know not every company's.

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,650
Scott: it's gonna be June 12 through 15.

135
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,409
Scott: So in early June look for big video game news.

136
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:52,408
Scott: Yeah You can expect you know April May to actually be a dry spell for big triple-a video game news because they're gonna be holding their cards until e3.

137
00:08:53,703 --> 00:09:00,090
Rym: Yeah Okay, so in some other news this happens often, but it's happening again for another platform.

138
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,597
Rym: So it's worth sort of just pointing at.

139
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,270
Rym: but PS Vita or Vita games.

140
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,379
Rym: I never had one but there were a lot of games that were released on that thing that were exclusive to it Like they were developed for it.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,549
Rym: They only came out on it.

142
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,514
Rym: It wasn't like a piece.

143
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:19,990
Scott: there are a lot of games that were exclusive to PSP, you know PS Vita whatever all the portable PlayStations of which there probably will never be another one.

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,786
Scott: I am not I guess I can't guarantee that but it seems likely.

145
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:26,895
Scott: Yeah and You know there were a lot of some of the.

146
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:33,141
Scott: there were some good games on there some exclusive ones and Some of them got ported to other systems and some of them didn't.

147
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,650
Scott: I think us the switch is like a really good destination.

148
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:41,804
Scott: Any developers or publishers that put games out on those platforms Would do well to just shove them in the switch.

149
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:42,850
Rym: Esha hundred percent.

150
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:53,070
Rym: The tricky part seems that a lot of the companies that made these things are either gone or have changed radically Don't have the resources to do a port and probably couldn't make enough money to justify the port.

151
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,910
Rym: So there's sort of a race to preserve these games somehow.

152
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:01,906
Scott: Right, you'll probably see things like I remember there being like a PSP contra or something.

153
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:02,950
Scott: That wasn't anything else.

154
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,393
Scott: That's like.

155
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,562
Scott: that's how old my memory is.

156
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,530
Scott: that was when I was in college.

157
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,695
Scott: But it's like yeah, you can see.

158
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,985
Scott: probably, you know, maybe it was re-released and I didn't notice.

159
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:16,480
Scott: but you could probably be like in the Future like, you know PSP mega pack.

160
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,370
Scott: and it'll be like, you know, 10 bucks 10 PSP games.

161
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,705
Scott: You know some bundle running on who knows what platform.

162
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,536
Rym: Yeah, well just like on the switch We have these compilations of like.

163
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,730
Rym: here's a bunch of old arcade games in a package every Mega Man game.

164
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,858
Scott: You know 50 bucks what I like.

165
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,023
Rym: those are still my weakness.

166
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:34,449
Rym: whenever there's a package of like.

167
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,179
Rym: hey Here's every game in some series that you've played.

168
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,930
Rym: a little bit of part of my brain says oh I should just buy that.

169
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:40,675
Rym: So I have it.

170
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:41,721
Scott: good thing.

171
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,889
Scott: I have my policy now.

172
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:54,829
Rym: Yeah I have implemented the similar policy of I only buy a game if the price it's on sale to the point that arounds down to zero or I am going to play it as soon as it finishes downloading.

173
00:10:55,811 --> 00:11:03,137
Scott: Like I'm gonna sit there and wait for it to download and unless it's litter even if a game is I don't see mine is Even more strict even if it's one penny.

174
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:06,750
Scott: I won't buy it unless I am going to install it and play it immediately.

175
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,118
Scott: If it's zero dollars, okay.

176
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:09,881
Scott: Yeah, then I will.

177
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:11,789
Scott: then I'll just whatever it cost zero.

178
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:17,010
Rym: now I did at the last second by any that Mario 3d compilation the anniversary one.

179
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,015
Scott: No, I had no need for that.

180
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,943
Rym: I bought it in cartridge for me.

181
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,910
Scott: I have all the games in the compilation.

182
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,552
Scott: What do I need?

183
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:31,609
Rym: Yeah, I don't cuz I was sponging off at your we and your gamecube for many years I'd ever owned either of those consoles myself.

184
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:32,851
Scott: Okay.

185
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,779
Rym: Well, but yeah, the all these games are disappearing.

186
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,761
Rym: same old story.

187
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,125
Rym: I got a link to it right here.

188
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,050
Rym: I got a little news.

189
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,797
Rym: This is you might have seen this.

190
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,102
Rym: it kind of made some.

191
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,350
Rym: it made the rounds on like the reddits and everything.

192
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,455
Rym: But you don't know.

193
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:52,379
Rym: Magnus Carlsen is the reigning chess world champion Like just gay.

194
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:59,776
Rym: yeah the chess champion in a recent game against Hikaru Nakamura During a tournament.

195
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:05,709
Rym: He did something that the internet noticed and by the internet I mean even the non chess internet.

196
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,199
Rym: He played an opening.

197
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,430
Rym: that is kind of a joke on the internet.

198
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,389
Rym: That is specifically known as the bong cloud.

199
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,762
Rym: It is a the best way I can describe this.

200
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,325
Rym: I'll link to this.

201
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,089
Scott: you can watch a video.

202
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,664
Rym: a great What a great name, you know what this opening is.

203
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:33,528
Rym: do fucking Ridiculous nonsense and try to put the game in such a broken state that both players are just lost in a fog And may the best player win.

204
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,740
Rym: Okay, break the game and see what.

205
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,030
Scott: he just be just bored doing the same old same old.

206
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,533
Scott: So he went.

207
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:52,950
Rym: now it's it let loose the bong cloud, you know, yeah Apparently this opening was like known among like people who play chess online But like no one played it in like a super serious tournament and the internet like noticed that this was happening.

208
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,169
Rym: There was a whole thing around it.

209
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,817
Scott: He probably learned about it from the internet.

210
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:59,729
Scott: people are on the famous people on the internet to yep He can read reddit, right?

211
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:09,210
Rym: you know like Justin Bieber big Leafs fan like talks about them a lot just randomly online like Probably on leaves to reddit or at least Twitter, you know.

212
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,816
Rym: Yeah, like people who are famous like things that are fans of other people who are more or less famous Yeah, they're reading the same shit.

213
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,278
Scott: You're reading.

214
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,121
Scott: They know what's going on.

215
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,030
Rym: Yeah, there isn't like a secret to it.

216
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,164
Scott: I'm just calls and probably knows it's called the bong cloud.

217
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:21,869
Scott: He's like, you know what?

218
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,581
Scott: It is like if I lose this tournament, that's not a big deal.

219
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:29,992
Rym: It's not Magnus Carlsen's tiny thumbnail I can barely see just from the news page I got up.

220
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:39,690
Rym: I see a stream and it looks like both of the players are like like like One of them is laughing and the other one is clearly like trying to stifle a laugh as the opening.

221
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:45,129
Scott: But they probably both know about the bond cloud, right?

222
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,951
Rym: But it also speaks to something we've talked about a lot not as much on GeekNights But we talked about this a lot in panels we do Around.

223
00:13:52,012 --> 00:14:03,044
Rym: how chess has this endgame where all the attractors in the like the math of chess are draws like Gay like yeah, a eyes are pushing chest to the who won.

224
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,270
Scott: the who won the bond cloud game?

225
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,570
Rym: I don't actually know and I'm gonna find out later cuz I didn't actually do it.

226
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,740
Scott: So I've always been sort of mad on chess.

227
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,339
Scott: cuz I don't like to memorize openings and stuff But the fact that there's an opening called the bunk.

228
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:20,137
Scott: Maybe I should maybe I should memorize that Opening and not learn anything.

229
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:23,670
Scott: I'm not interested in learning anything more about chess than I already know, right?

230
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,324
Scott: You know, I just sort of play naturally like I look a few moves ahead.

231
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,621
Scott: Okay, I'll kill two of your guys And you'll kill one of mine.

232
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:30,289
Scott: That seems good.

233
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:31,736
Scott: That's how I play.

234
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:40,689
Rym: playing the epon first is a very natural opening in chess But moving the king up to e2 is essentially always a terrible second move.

235
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:50,510
Scott: The point is I should learn The the the bond cloud and just play until the openings over and then from there just play naturally just you know.

236
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,321
Scott: However, I feel like yeah, I don't even ever have to play shit.

237
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,810
Rym: I can't imagine what the endgame looks like for the bond cloud.

238
00:14:55,871 --> 00:15:01,762
Rym: I'm actually there's a Early game looks like I have not watched the full video.

239
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:02,564
Scott: This is the first.

240
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:12,090
Rym: this is the first I've heard of it Like ooh, I'm gonna start with the Polish opening and then the other Scott's across from me and he just smiles that King moves forward.

241
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:18,121
Scott: It's anyway I gotta talk about a geek bite this little game here.

242
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,350
Scott: So I don't know how I remember how I found this game.

243
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,055
Scott: It's on Steam.

244
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,365
Scott: It's 10 bucks, but you can play a free demo.

245
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,530
Scott: You don't need to pay the 10 bucks.

246
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,716
Scott: It's still early access.

247
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,550
Scott: You might want to wait for like the full version if you do want to pay the 10 bucks.

248
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:44,350
Scott: I did pay the 10 bucks because I did install it and play it immediately and I've played it Once it once in a while, you know every few days I'll open it up and play it like one time and the game is luck be a landlord Obviously named after the Frank Sinatra song luck be a lady.

249
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,161
Scott: I don't know if that came from somewhere before Frank Sinatra.

250
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:53,063
Scott: it may have and I'm just not aware of it But yeah, so what this game is is something very clever.

251
00:15:53,083 --> 00:16:05,148
Scott: It is Sort of a deck building game in a way right and where you start with five Symbols it was a Robert Alda first performed it.

252
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:15,870
Scott: Okay, and you start with five symbols and then after every spin of a slot machine You add a symbol to the slot machine.

253
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,930
Scott: So it starts out with like a cherry a cat a coin and a couple other thing, right?

254
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,638
Scott: And it's like, okay, you spun the slot machine.

255
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,603
Scott: You got this many coins.

256
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,409
Scott: What do you want to add to your slot machine?

257
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:28,850
Scott: a dwarf?

258
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:35,306
Scott: Like a goose a clam or a goose, right?

259
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:43,489
Scott: It's like, okay I guess I'll add the goose and each thing you add to the slot machine has different rules Surrounding it right?

260
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,932
Scott: So if a dwarf it stops and he's adjacent to meaning in the eight spaces You know.

261
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:53,682
Scott: next not just orthogonally adjacent just adjacent to the dwarf.

262
00:16:54,144 --> 00:17:03,561
Scott: if any of those contain an alcoholic beverage The alcoholic beverage will be removed and the dwarf will give you a whole bunch of coins Cuz he you know to pay for the beer.

263
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:04,748
Rym: Oh, no, this sounds good.

264
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,136
Scott: There's also like a bartender.

265
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:11,749
Scott: the bartender has like a 10% chance of creating an alcoholic beverage.

266
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:21,269
Scott: If you have a key and it ends adjacent to like a safe or a lockbox The key and the lockbox both go away and a bunch of money comes out, right?

267
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:25,270
Scott: So, you know, there's all these sorts of synergies between symbols.

268
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,900
Scott: The best the thing is no matter what symbols you get.

269
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,390
Scott: I have not found anything better than cultists.

270
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,318
Scott: It's like a cultist is one coin.

271
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,290
Scott: two cultists means two coins each.

272
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,572
Scott: They don't need to be adjacent.

273
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,596
Scott: three cultists three coins each.

274
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,199
Scott: four cult is four coins each.

275
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:40,640
Scott: you get it.

276
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,365
Scott: Cultists are just the best.

277
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:47,660
Scott: I'm the only time I've gone deep in this game with huge payouts is with a lot of cultists.

278
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,931
Rym: Well, the game is early access.

279
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:55,860
Scott: Maybe they'll nerf the cultists Maybe but this game is actually updated rather frequently with significant updates.

280
00:17:56,221 --> 00:18:02,657
Scott: It's even a timer on the bottom left of the main menu that tells you how long until the next update launches.

281
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,351
Scott: Whoa There's real fun.

282
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,261
Scott: There's also Items.

283
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,927
Scott: so like you key after every.

284
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:19,202
Scott: basically the it's called luck be a landlord because this the story of this game is That you move into an apartment and you got to pay the rent and the rent starts out at $25.

285
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:23,737
Scott: So and you have I think six spins of the slot machine, right?

286
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,319
Scott: It's like we put.

287
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,039
Scott: don't worry We put a slot machine in your apartment to help you pay rent.

288
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,560
Rym: So I feel like that's gonna move from satire to truth within a decade, right?

289
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,560
Scott: But you get you get a certain number of spins before you have to pay rent and you start with five symbols.

290
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:42,800
Scott: So you're gonna get the rent on the first rent payment no matter what unless you really eff it up, right?

291
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,445
Scott: But then you have.

292
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,674
Scott: then as soon as you pay rent you get an item.

293
00:18:47,116 --> 00:19:04,771
Scott: you get to choose an item Which is like a permanent ability sort of like a relic and slay the spire as opposed to a card Right, and then it's like, okay well Your next rent payment is even bigger and you have this many spins to get to that next rent payment and you keep doing this Until eventually you pay the seven seven seven rent.

294
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:10,071
Scott: as soon as you pay the triple seven rent You've won the game and then you enter endless mode.

295
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:17,140
Scott: if you would like to enter endless mode and keep paying Exponentially higher basically a deck builder, but the deck is a slot machine.

296
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,000
Scott: It's a solo deck builder.

297
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,669
Scott: but you don't draw hands or play hands.

298
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:41,700
Scott: your entire deck gets shuffled on a slot machine and 25 of the symbols in your slot in your The available ones you have appear in a random arrangement on the grid and then score Appropriately and sometimes get consumed meaning, you know, they get they're removed from your deck for the next spin.

299
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,339
Rym: Well, I see one like coal after 20 spins turns into a diamond.

300
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,954
Scott: Diamonds are pretty great because they're sort of like cultists in which their cultists are won by default.

301
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:58,758
Scott: diamonds are I think five by default And the more diamonds you have They all increase each other's value similar to cultists.

302
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,593
Scott: So Diamonds are like the ultimate thing.

303
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:10,325
Scott: just a screen full of diamonds I think might be the highest possible payout you could get because it would be five times 25 plus Some.

304
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,156
Scott: you know the math on that.

305
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:12,658
Scott: It's yeah.

306
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:21,678
Scott: But yeah There's a lot and the thing is a lot of the symbols and the interactions between the symbols and the items are just a whole lot Of fun and are really cute and wholesome.

307
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:27,799
Scott: Most of the time like you have a thief the thief every time he shows up takes a coin from you.

308
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:41,510
Scott: but when you catch the thief either with a banana peel or With the bounty hunter or with like general zaroff who kills all humans Then you'll get every thief the coin stole.

309
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,256
Scott: you will get back times four.

310
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,751
Rym: Oh So apparently also very important news.

311
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,420
Rym: There's a dog and you can pet the dog.

312
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,560
Scott: Yep, there's a lot of stuff going on in this game.

313
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Scott: So it's a really cute fun single-player like very brief thing to do and it changes every so often.

314
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:06,920
Scott: So like every day or two, I'll open it up and play it one time Usually while I'm waiting for something else like a GeekNights to start or something of that nature, right?

315
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,353
Scott: I'll just open it up Like if I've got steam and we're gonna play sieve and everyone's still chatting I'll just open it up play it one time and then up the sieves ready.

316
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:15,557
Scott: Okay, close my slot machine.

317
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,152
Scott: So I recommend this and it's still early access $10 game.

318
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:21,834
Scott: I recommend it.

319
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:32,775
Rym: Yeah, nice and cute but anyway things Of the day.

320
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,140
Rym: so check this.

321
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,826
Rym: this is a video from 2018.

322
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:46,920
Rym: I didn't know this was at the Met But basically this is the oldest piano in the world from the early 1700s like it's the oldest one that exists.

323
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:56,410
Rym: Not only does it exist, but it's playable and This is a video of someone playing the oldest piano in the world.

324
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:07,290
Rym: That is pretty fascinating in and of itself And there's a little bit of explanation about Like how it was built and where it came from and how the guy who made it wasn't actually trying to invent the piano.

325
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,708
Rym: He was actually trying to do something else.

326
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:18,410
Rym: and if you're interested in this the rabbit hole you can follow on the origins of the piano and Where like the clavichord and like what happened to the harpsichord?

327
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:19,435
Rym: There is.

328
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:31,030
Rym: there is so much nonsense there That is way more complicated than you would ever expect But sounds pretty good for an instrument from the 1700s that is still working and not just like a brass instrument.

329
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:36,390
Rym: Mmm, imagine if your job was to maintain this thing though, like don't break it.

330
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:49,949
Rym: I think there's a little bit of ship of Theseus going on But it is like the original keys as far as I've read like almost everything on it is original Except I think they've replaced a lot of the strings of these as they've broken over the years.

331
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,069
Rym: Okay, probably some of the pads - I assume.

332
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:55,888
Rym: So what do you got?

333
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,735
Scott: What do I have as my thing of the day?

334
00:22:58,775 --> 00:22:59,317
Scott: Let me see.

335
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,123
Rym: I know you're trying to run that train.

336
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:02,427
Rym: Oh, yeah.

337
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,650
Scott: Okay, so I haven't.

338
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:09,950
Scott: This is fanfiction that someone posted to an archive of our own.

339
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:15,990
Scott: I don't think I've ever done a fanfictions thing of the day before because I don't read fanfiction.

340
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,176
Scott: I read, you know, I know of it.

341
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,805
Scott: I respect it, but I don't.

342
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:19,730
Scott: it's not my thing, right?

343
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:32,661
Rym: Last one I was at RIT when we read Sailor Moon saves the furries out loud at in capstone that one - okay But yeah, someone named I guess mewd M-e-w-d.

344
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,070
Scott: I think that's the author's name there.

345
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:36,797
Scott: I saw this on Twitter.

346
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:40,434
Scott: someone linked to it and it's the name of the Fanfiction really caught me.

347
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,300
Scott: and then I read the summary and that caught me.

348
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:50,250
Scott: and I read the first page slash chapter And that was enough for me to know that I could make this a thing of the day.

349
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,214
Scott: I haven't read the whole thing.

350
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:54,406
Scott: So let me just read you this summary and the title in the summary.

351
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:59,130
Scott: The title is Daisy and Waluigi dream star wannabes by mewd.

352
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:02,278
Rym: I'm already intrigued.

353
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:06,033
Rym: just that it's Daisy and Waluigi summary princess.

354
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:15,741
Scott: Daisy and Waluigi team up to upstage Mario and become big shot heroes and destroy and/or save the world in the Process and maybe fall in love if there's time after that.

355
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:16,906
Scott: Wow a sprawl.

356
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:26,250
Scott: a sprawling Novel length romantic comedy action Nintendo adventure where Daisy confronts her past her feelings of self-worth and her feelings for Waluigi.

357
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,059
Rym: I'd I'd Sprawling novel leg.

358
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,968
Rym: Okay this so there's a lot of.

359
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,444
Rym: There's a lot here.

360
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:35,323
Scott: It's a lot.

361
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,690
Scott: I mean Just have the summary be the thing of the day.

362
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:45,769
Scott: I don't know and I can't tell you if you should read on beyond the chapter one But like, you know, there are 38 chapters in this thing.

363
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:54,730
Scott: If you are gonna write a fan fiction That is the bar for a compelling summary to get people to care about it, right?

364
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,927
Rym: Um Have a go I'm just skimming it.

365
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,979
Rym: Mouser fry guy claw grip and try Clyde are all in it.

366
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:05,523
Scott: Oh, yeah.

367
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:06,085
Rym: Yeah.

368
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:07,810
Rym: Those are some of my boys.

369
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,242
Rym: In the moment, I'm still stuck inside.

370
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:13,030
Rym: like that much is happening.

371
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,225
Rym: You'll see us probably in some packs online like whatever that looks like.

372
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,049
Rym: We'll probably be on that.

373
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:19,679
Rym: We have a sprawling internet presence.

374
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,309
Rym: So check us out at all the places we exist.

375
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:40,359
Scott: So and I've been working on a thing because I want to make it you know, we keep saying this I'm making a thing where all of the places that GeekNights has an online presence I'm gonna make one page somewhere that you can go to that just has links to every place GeekNights exists on the internet and Sort of organizing all those places in a spreadsheet.

376
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:46,800
Scott: So let me just list for you the 30 Almost 29 places so far that I've.

377
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,967
Scott: we've discovered online presence.

Scott: We have a Facebook page that we don't post to.

392

00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,950
Scott: Who knows we got the patreon that you shouldn't give money to.

Rym: now I guess I say me I actually don't have a twitch channel.

397
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:43,559
Scott: Okay We have a code of conduct.

398
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:50,330
Scott: I guess slash github kinda, you know, I don't know That We have a GeekNights reddit that no one uses.

399
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:51,594
Scott: We have it.

400
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:51,935
Scott: there is.

401
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,661
Scott: you can find this on board game geek.

402
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:57,757
Scott: There is a listing for our podcast as well as Rym.

403
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:02,380
Scott: whenever we do Board game reviews right Rym makes a YouTube video.

404
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,550
Scott: That's just the review and then attaches it to the board game.

405
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:13,385
Scott: So if you go to board game geek and you find a game there in the video section on the game on board game geek You may see a GeekNights YouTube video there.

406
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,017
Rym: Yep Surprising amount of traffic gets comes from that.

407
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,280
Rym: like you'd be surprised.

408
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:22,050
Scott: We have a steam group and steam curator page.

409
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,796
Scott: So those are sort of the same thing.

410
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:25,242
Scott: one and a half things right?

411
00:27:25,623 --> 00:27:27,430
Scott: We have our official RSS feeds.

Scott: We are on Google podcast run Amazon podcasts.

415
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:40,223
Scott: Rym made a LinkedIn page when he treated me.

416
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:48,288
Scott: He said that he basically Instead of a company page He made GeekNights as a company on LinkedIn that someone could theoretically be an employee of.

417
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,729
Scott: yeah I guess maybe I should attach myself to it.

418
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:57,450
Rym: I forgot about it until Scott was asking me to like find places We're not thinking of and I bump into it by accident.

419
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:05,454
Rym: I made that so long ago because like real talk I put GeekNights on my actual resume like I like when I got my current job I like.

420
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,490
Rym: they asked me about it and I was like, yes, this is this thing I do.

421
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:09,536
Rym: It's a whole big thing.

422
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,629
Rym: I'm gonna keep doing it or I'm not gonna work here.

423
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:19,472
Scott: the point is is that the final one that we know that we've managed to list so far is Amazon.

424
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:25,069
Scott: we have an Amazon fashion page where you can buy a nice t-shirt directly from Amazon and I'll spoil it.

425
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,966

00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:38,110
Scott: Yep We had an IRC channel at some point.

429
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,050
Scott: I don't know if it still exists, but there are logs of that IRC channel.

430
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:45,458
Scott: And also this doesn't include all of our.

431
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:52,063
Scott: this only includes things that I consider to be like, you know GeekNights things Right, like, you know a GeekNights listener.

432
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:53,330
Scott: follow me on Twitter.

00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:02,686
Scott: that's not a GeekNights thing.

438
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,610
Rym: Like I like her.

439
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:05,790
Rym: It's public but it's not the GeekNights flicker.

440
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:10,110
Rym: Like if I take a bunch of photos for GeekNights, I'm gonna publish them somewhere else where you'll all see them, right?

441
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,084
Scott: But my personal YouTube my personal Twitter those have the.

443
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,075
Rym: See, we're like my personal YouTube.

444
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:19,182
Rym: right effectively is the GeekNights YouTube?

445
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,666
Rym: just because that exactly.

446
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:21,228
Scott: so some.

447
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:29,746
Scott: so not there are some things that are my Personal thing or Rym's personal thing that are also a GeekNights thing kinda and some that aren't right.

448
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:34,375
Scott: It's like, you know, so Take that as you will.

449
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:36,343
Rym: Yeah, otherwise we're.

450
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,218
Rym: uh, we're reading the tale again G Sure, so read along with us.

451
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:42,141
Rym: It's the first novel.

452
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:42,463
Rym: like.

453
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,430
Rym: read the first one, right?

454
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,434
Rym: You gotta read the thing.

455
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:56,264
Scott: if before you read Daisy and Waluigi Dream star wannabes right the newest greatest novel in the history of humans, right?

456
00:29:56,665 --> 00:30:06,609
Rym: You got to start with the first novel in Genji's just kind of going like Just gets into trouble gets out of trouble.

457
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,090
Rym: Consequences happen mostly to other people.

458
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,647
Rym: Yeah, that's what I've taken away from this so far.

459
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,661
Scott: Okay, so let us go to the main bit and then I need dinner.

460
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:20,548
Rym: All right, let me jump right into that.

461
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:22,580
Rym: There we go.

462
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:30,010
Rym: Okay so JRPGs, we've never really talked about like that on GeekNights except tangentially.

463
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:36,410
Scott: Well, I think what happened is Tuesday is a day where we all we're always playing games more often than other things.

464
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,950
Scott: We always have a game to talk about usually or a convention.

465
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:52,150
Scott: Well, at least refresh the pool and so we haven't had to resort to like, you know more generic sort of Conceptual show ideas for Tuesdays as we do on other days.

466
00:30:52,330 --> 00:31:01,842
Scott: but also we have done a few Tuesday shows on like shmups or Things that right like more just targeting a whole genre at once.

467
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,150
Scott: but we haven't done a lot of those.

468
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:08,989
Scott: So we're like, well, we haven't actually both played a new game.

469
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:12,099
Scott: You know that we haven't done a show on recently.

470
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,604
Rym: who new FPS is.

471
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,430
Rym: I'm gonna try out this weekend.

472
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:22,199
Scott: Okay, and there are a lot of games coming up soon that I think will both play like that one that I linked to.

473
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,845
Scott: that I discovered today, that's like a Like an our xcom plus slay the spire combo possibly.

474
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:29,969
Rym: Yeah, I'm worried about that.

475
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:34,007
Rym: one Might be too good for me exactly.

476
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:40,969
Rym: We're playing a lot of games we've played before and already reviewed on GeekNights - like right.

477
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,489
Scott: I'm not gonna do this big show or another train game show.

478
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,962
Rym: Wait, let's talk about hearts of iron or still are.

479
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:50,150
Scott: so I was like, hey, let's just do a genre show.

480
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,702
Scott: We'll talk about a whole genre of games in general, which there are many genres.

481
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:57,550
Scott: You haven't discussed pick one pick JRPGs.

482
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,137
Scott: Okay, let's talk about JRPGs.

483
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:01,065
Rym: Yeah now full disclosure.

484
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:06,144
Rym: I Don't like JRPGs anymore like for the most part.

485
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:11,070
Rym: like I don't play modern ones I keep an eye on them like I learn about them, but I tend not to play them.

486
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:22,850
Rym: But at the same time as much as I want to say I can't deal with those mechanics I am playing Final Fantasy 4 randomizers for some reason right also.

487
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,630
Rym: Sometimes I feel this urge to go level up in a JRPG like just poke it Final Fantasy 1 in an emulator.

488
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,192
Rym: It's weird.

489
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:37,610
Scott: Yeah, so it's very strange how you know, you know, we had the D&D right the pen and paper RPGs.

490
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:50,117
Scott: Yeah predating for example the piece, you know the RPGs that were on various PCs Right and they varied Spectrums and Commodores and Amigas and DOS.

491
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:54,190
Scott: and you know all those old PC platforms Commodores apples, right?

492
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,409
Scott: There were all cars RPGs on those platforms.

493
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:05,790
Scott: and then Once you know in Japan you had them on you know The MSX or the FM towns or the PC 9, you know all kinds of different platforms.

494
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,091
Scott: And there's

495
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:13,202
Rym: all these different lineages of these games like we get into that history like From a very different world from some of these other games,

496
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:34,529
Scott: right but that core mechanic there right of you know, the the the combat of D&D was just brought over to Video games right in this sort of fashion where it's like you're still calling it an RPG When this like the role-playing element is like, where is it?

497
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:41,555
Rym: You know You're not that's that was our first facts panel that beyond D&D the original version of that where we talked a lot about It's a role-playing game.

498
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,641
Rym: But what actual role-playing are you doing?

499
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:54,514
Scott: Right or even if you are, you know It's like you're limited to just like this subset of actions, right if you play like a gold box game or you know A shadow gate.

500
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:58,294
Scott: those aren't JRPGs obviously, but there's still computer Versions.

501
00:33:58,314 --> 00:34:03,881
Scott: right because computers are so limited then they still even today still are quite limited.

502
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:18,614
Scott: right You know when you're playing a tabletop RPG Even if it's just a dungeon crawly one where you fighting monsters and traps and doing all these things Your you know human brains you affect you have a human GM possibly Depending on the game.

503
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:25,070
Scott: He said this wealth of basically infinite possibilities It's like you know what I could do all this stuff with my 10-foot pole.

504
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,139
Scott: What if I poke the bee's nest with it, right?

505
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:34,152
Scott: It's like whereas in a computer game even today It's like if they don't program in that specific Possibility.

506
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:44,750
Scott: it's not a possibility Right, you know, so The JRPG is like comes out of the fact that they were even more limited in those days.

507
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,928
Scott: they wanted to translate that tabletop D&D experience to the computer.

508
00:34:48,949 --> 00:35:01,170
Scott: and You know the American peep game developers and you know British game developers did it in certain ways and the Japanese game developers did it in the Dragon Quest?

509
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,277
Scott: Final Fantasy way.

510
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:16,506
Rym: Oh, it's interesting because at the same time the actual Japanese role-playing game space at the time was a lot broader than what Americans recognized and Back then no one called those JRPGs.

511
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:28,517
Rym: They were just RPGs and The most popular RPGs in America at the time Ended up being the ones that were mostly on the NES and SNES Just due to like.

512
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,630
Rym: that was when gaming started to become more mainstream.

513
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,623
Rym: That was a very accessible popular affordable console.

514
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:35,370
Rym: for a lot of people those two consoles.

515
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:42,910
Rym: so That was right around when Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest were also available in the US.

516
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,495
Rym: so a lot of people like.

517
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:55,826
Rym: the term JRPG came way later to try to differentiate one subset of Japanese RPGs that are themselves together a subset of like digital RPGs.

518
00:35:56,427 --> 00:36:01,350
Rym: and right term is Not like the fact even though it stands for a Japanese role-playing game.

519
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:07,928
Rym: It's not really a useful or accurate term because Japanese role-playing games are far more diverse than most people would like.

520
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:16,351
Rym: hide lied Arguably comes from that same lineage, but no no one who played hide lied today in America would say oh, that's a JRPG Right.

521
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:34,690
Scott: the common, you know the common tropes of a JRPG right is that there's some sort of overworld right that you walk around on And there's random encounters right and then there's gonna be some sort of turn-based Combat where you know positioning usually doesn't matter too much.

522
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,267
Scott: It's usually you're choosing just an actions per character right fight run.

523
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:45,829
Scott: You know Magic spell special ability of some kind right you know like steel or something.

524
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,945
Scott: You know the bad guys go you go you have hit points.

525
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:50,830
Scott: You don't want to die.

526
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:59,590
Scott: Yeah, you go to towns you talk to people you go to dungeons you walk around There's random encounters in the dungeon, but also boss battles, but also treasure chests full of items.

527
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:08,930
Scott: And then you know through talking to the characters And also cutscenes and dialogue and boss dialogue and things of that nature.

528
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:13,624
Scott: There's usual, and there's usually this really very involved.

529
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:18,963
Scott: You know sort of epic Fantasy story usually a fantasy or sci-fi story.

530
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:29,549
Scott: yeah that unfolds sometimes with cutscenes and cinematics and all sorts of other embellishments usually Fantastic music of some kind.

531
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:36,508
Scott: And you know those elements together is usually what makes a JRPG versus?

532
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:44,970
Scott: yeah, you know Like in a Skyrim, which is definitely a computer video game RPG that doesn't really have all of those elements.

533
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:54,978
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time while we're calling the show JRPGs, and we're gonna talk about these same kinds of games I don't think that term is useful because even like game nerds all Disagree on exactly what it means.

534
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,670
Rym: if you say it means any role-playing game made in Japan.

535
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,570
Rym: Most of them are nothing like what we're describing.

536
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:01,579
Scott: Right.

537
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:08,198
Rym: it's useful in Action JRPG and AJ RPG like that.

538
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,322
Rym: there is not.

539
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:17,550
Scott: there's no consistency in this nomenclature The way I use it and I think the only useful way to use it is you're basically a short way of saying a game.

540
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:24,593
Scott: That's very similar to Dragon quest Final Fantasy yep chrono trigger Etc.

541
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:25,637
Rym: that's what we're going with.

542
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:28,530
Scott: but even there's a game along those lines.

543
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,708
Rym: So I pulled up a Wikipedia page that is interesting because it's a listen Oh blade.

544
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:41,210
Rym: Oh, yeah Lunar is kind of right in our games that we know some people are obsessed with right.

545
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,809
Scott: Yeah, you know all those he's wanders from years and all that or wise yeast is more of an action one.

546
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:54,257
Rym: Yeah They're actually all kind of different because there was the one that a lot of Americans were familiar with on the SNES Which was luffia.

547
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,710
Rym: yeah luffia breath of fire.

548
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:58,675
Scott: Yeah, I said breath.

549
00:38:58,716 --> 00:38:58,896
Rym: Yeah.

550
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,021
Rym: I wasn't listening to you.

551
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,865
Rym: I was looking at this page.

552
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:01,990
Rym: I got this list here.

553
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,225
Rym: It's a Wikipedia page of the best-selling Japanese role-playing game franchise Pokemon earthbound.

554
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,870
Rym: yep, so this is fascinating.

555
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:10,501
Rym: This is franchise base.

556
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:14,888
Rym: These are the best-selling Japanese Role-playing game.

557
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:16,537
Scott: Pokemon is number one.

558
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:19,210
Rym: Pokemon is number one by like double.

559
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:20,653
Scott: Of course.

560
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,500
Rym: number two is Final Fantasy.

561
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:30,707
Rym: so take every Final Fantasy anyone ever bought on any platform and The Pokemons have sold about double.

562
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:37,445
Rym: Okay Dragon Quest is about half again down, and then there's a long tail.

563
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:41,309
Rym: and it's interesting because it's like Monster Hunter Kingdom Hearts Souls.

564
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:43,344
Scott: Monster Hunter is an action.

565
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:51,790
Scott: You know Right it is a Japanese role-playing game franchise, so there's nothing role-playing about it really.

566
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,244
Scott: It's an action game action RPG like let's not random encounters.

567
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:57,529
Scott: You're not walking around the map.

568
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:57,930
Scott: You're not.

569
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,293
Rym: This is why I wouldn't class Not like.

570
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:06,107
Scott: it's not like Final Fantasy or like, but that's just you're like are?

571
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:09,195
Rym: the two are working definition Useful definition of.

572
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,501
Rym: I just really want to drive home.

573
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:22,988
Rym: the fact that the concept of JRPG uses as a genre is Silly and if you're gonna have a conversation like this you actually need to describe what you're talking about Because no one's gonna agree with you like clear at all.

574
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:27,010
Rym: But the funniest thing about this is that one of the franchise is listed.

575
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:28,561
Rym: It's like 15 down like.

576
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:29,689
Rym: it's very high on the list.

577
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:37,943
Rym: It's just called chrono because it's chrono trigger which consists of two games One of which was bad.

578
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:41,583
Rym: in my opinion Chrono cross chrono cross was not a good game.

579
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,790
Rym: I did not even finish it.

580
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,890
Rym: I could not stand it and radical dreamers is not listed because that's yeah anyway.

581
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,904
Scott: So let's talk about games like Final Fantasy Dragon Quest etcetera.

582
00:40:51,945 --> 00:41:04,667
Scott: So I first when I was young Right when I was young I actually didn't have Games like that, right Those were not the games that I would buy for the consoles that I had.

583
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:08,724
Rym: those are the games I was the most obsessed with as a kid like I got fight like.

584
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:11,930
Scott: I think I think Had I bought a Super Nintendo?

585
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,310
Scott: I probably would have had Final Fantasy 6 and chrono trigger earlier and then play them.

586
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,209
Rym: See I started way earlier on the NES when I got my NES.

587
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,939
Rym: So I upgraded from the Atari to the NES.

588
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,790
Rym: Final Fantasy 1 was one of the first games I got.

589
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:34,247
Scott: Yeah, see I didn't play Final Fantasy Anything until I basically had emulators in the later 90s like 90s.

590
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,187
Rym: So I played Final Fantasy 1 and I was enough of a nerd.

591
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:42,470
Rym: So when the SNES came out, I got Final Fantasy 2 and 3 and I was obsessed with them.

592
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,550
Rym: It's scary to think that I was playing cuz I have this vivid memory.

593
00:41:46,233 --> 00:42:02,770
Rym: I was playing Final Fantasy 4 which I knew is 2 on the Super Nintendo when I was home from a lot from school for lunch in Elementary school Mmm, and I have this memory of I got as far as the antlion.

594
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:10,990
Rym: I hadn't saved my game and my mom said it was time to go back to school But I had to beat the boss as you wouldn't let me and I had to do that whole fucking dungeon again.

595
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:15,969
Rym: I was mad about it for like Probably an hour and then I forgot but it feels like I was mad for years.

596
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:22,425
Scott: Yeah So at the time that I really started playing them right those late 90s.

597
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:23,850
Scott: I was like, whoa these games?

598
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:36,770
Scott: I've seen them in magazines, right, but I finally understood like ah, that's what these games were I you know because I was somehow despite not having really played them that much all those tropes, right?

599
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:42,370
Scott: I I already somehow had learned those from somewhere like I knew how to play them even though I hadn't right.

600
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,010
Scott: The first time I opened Final Fantasy 1 in nesticle, right the emulator, right?

601
00:42:49,351 --> 00:43:04,030
Scott: I knew exactly how to play it like everything in there was completely familiar to me cuz it's a well-designed game like it the There was not any game that I had the NES cartridge for that even remotely resembled it right in any way.

602
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:04,875
Scott: And I don't.

603
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:07,169
Scott: it's not the kind of game that you would play at a friend's house.

604
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,741
Scott: Now what's definitely is a long single-player deal.

605
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,930
Rym: the problem I ran into is that on the NES?

606
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:19,510
Rym: Ultima Exodus and Ultima avatar To a kid who doesn't know better in an era where there isn't an internet they just looked like RPGs.

607
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,425
Rym: I was like, oh I bet it's like Final Fantasy and in a lot of ways they are like.

608
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:32,158
Rym: I'd argue they're in the same genre but those games were just inscrutable Impossible nonsense to me as a kid.

609
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,537
Rym: I could not like Final Fantasy 1 like Despite kid brain.

610
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,151
Rym: I played it with the aim of beating it Like.

611
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:47,101
Rym: I knew there's something to beat and I like tried but when I played like Ultima Exodus at the same age I was just like water on the world and at no point.

612
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,085
Rym: I have this concept of.

613
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,250
Rym: this is a game that I could be.

614
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,778
Scott: Well, I think that comes down to the linearity, right?

615
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:56,790
Scott: We sort of view linearity as like a negative in some ways, right?

616
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,283
Scott: It's like you want this open-ended game.

617
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,110
Scott: We can do what you want.

618
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:05,249
Scott: It's like the dream and it's like you have like something like an Ultima and it's like alright and it's like What the hell do I do with you that you need?

619
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,403
Rym: There's a very specific like path to win that game you can just approach in any order.

620
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,252
Scott: the problem is not it's not clear it's not.

621
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:29,559
Rym: the game doesn't tell you shit and Like, you know in it like in Final Fantasy or like even Simon's quest like as another example Even if the characters like the translations bad and the characters don't say useful things You can figure out on the puzzles pretty intuitively.

622
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:45,570
Rym: in Ultima the puzzles are things like yeah, if you talk to these ten villagers across these ten different places You'll eventually figure out that in this one map when the moon is a certain way Walk forward three spaces left two spaces and search that empty spot.

623
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:55,890
Rym: That doesn't look any different from any other spot in the world and you'll find a game necessary item Like very different philosophy of design even though superficially they were very similar.

624
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:56,853
Scott: Right.

625
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:01,270
Scott: So in the with the or the JRPG side, it's much more linear.

626
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:06,716
Scott: It's like you can only go one place or you can go maybe sometimes places You've already been or you can

627
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:18,525
Rym: get to places that are a little too dangerous and you kind of avoid them or you figure out A way to do them, but you're always gated like the scope of your world Expands and expands and a lot of them especially the Final Fantasy is this trope.

628
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,050
Rym: I know is in a lot of other games.

629
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:27,389
Rym: They open up after they have taught you like what's going on usually by giving you effectively the airship.

630
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,539
Rym: Yeah, like that was a trope for so long.

631
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:31,262
Rym: Okay.

632
00:45:31,302 --> 00:45:32,085
Rym: Now I got the airship.

633
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,049
Rym: now I can go anywhere.

634
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:41,130
Scott: But even if you are opened up It's like most of the places you can go are all the old places and one new place.

635
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:47,966
Scott: Yeah, right and it's like there's always some sort of gating either by danger of random encounters that will just kill you if you go to the wrong place.

636
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:54,050
Scott: or You literally can't go to a place or you went to a place, but it's not the time to go to that place yet.

637
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:00,116
Scott: So you're just sort of seeing that this town exists, but it doesn't matter You're just here whatever.

638
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,110
Scott: and when you come back to the town later as like ah now this town does something.

639
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:15,680
Rym: But I do think a lot of them do have a moment where they get a little bit rudderless on purpose Like the game has gated you for so long and then finally it's like alright now you can just go anywhere and suddenly you find all.

640
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:24,067
Rym: you explore the world and find all these interesting things to poke at and Usually that's when there's a lot of side quests and things that aren't strictly necessary to win.

641
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:34,612
Rym: you can do But eventually even if you don't try to beat the game You'll poke at everything and the game sort of like guides you back toward the critical path to actually beating it Mm-hmm.

642
00:46:35,274 --> 00:46:36,036
Scott: Well, I think it's part.

643
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:41,830
Scott: usually the games will do that because most of them, you know, really confer like this sort of.

644
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,003
Scott: You know, you don't see a lot of small JRPGs, right?

645
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:46,730
Scott: They're long and big right?

646
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:55,570
Scott: So you're you can't really confer that sense of big and epicness to the player Without sort of opening the world to them in that way, right?

647
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,161
Scott: So it's sort of you do the timing and fashion in which that is done.

648
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:02,170
Rym: like Final Fantasy 1 you walk around the bridge.

649
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:06,326
Scott: Yeah, you get the bridge this bridge and then these credits play like to do.

650
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:07,390
Scott: Okay now the world.

651
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,459
Rym: But then you go you're thinking okay the world.

652
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:14,910
Rym: and then you find a ship and then you're like, oh the world.

653
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:21,130
Rym: But then if you try to go north There's a whole continent that doesn't have a single port and you're like wonder what's up with that?

654
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,229
Rym: And then when you get the airship, you're like, oh I'm going up there.

655
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,945
Rym: I've been waiting to get up there my entire childhood.

656
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,416
Scott: here I come Yeah, or you know.

657
00:47:28,436 --> 00:47:36,750
Scott: sometimes, you know, there's usually also Some point in most of them where it's a common trope to go to like a different world, right?

658
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:45,814
Scott: it's like and you go to the moon or You know some sort of hell or magic land or a world of ruin Yeah, something like that.

659
00:47:45,974 --> 00:47:51,410
Scott: It's like, you know, sort of it's like a terrible secret of space that you've discovered in the plot, right?

660
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,350
Scott: Here's the truth and that's why there's always like a we call it a square boss named after the company square.

661
00:47:56,631 --> 00:48:02,093
Scott: Yeah, this the bad guy that you've known the whole time that's the main bad guy Right.

662
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:02,414
Scott: That's the.

663
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,542
Scott: you think they're gonna be the final final boss.

664
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:05,225
Scott: you beat them.

665
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:11,650
Scott: It's like aha It was actually to do and there's an even bigger boss and Mega Man 2 does the same thing.

666
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,839
Rym: Fuck you, golly.

667
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:13,745
Rym: Wait Zemus.

668
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:14,309
Rym: What's that?

669
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,351
Scott: Right.

670
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:22,001
Scott: It's like you beat Wiley and then it's like another skull and then you fight this robot alien Wiley spoilers for Mega Man 2.

671
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:32,705
Scott: It was Exactly while he was controlling the alien robot with remote control anyway And almost all the JRPGs do a very do that same exact thing.

672
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:34,070
Scott: where it's like it's this bad guy.

673
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,644
Scott: No, it's actually this like god.

674
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:37,710
Scott: That's the bad guy.

675
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:43,150
Scott: Some guy, you know from more some elder, you know thing from another dimension.

676
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:47,630
Scott: Yeah, true evil, but another very true evil is just a guy.

677
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:52,530
Scott: It's like actually he had this much power and possessed by ten demons.

678
00:48:53,731 --> 00:49:00,569
Rym: But there's also epic ending these games because they're not usually real time or time like like.

679
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:12,727
Rym: there's no dexterity component to them sometimes like obviously a lot of exceptions and but There's grinding and leveling up as a mechanic and especially the early ones.

680
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:21,217
Rym: for a long time That was a primary mechanic and this is where like as a reviewer on one hand Like I don't got time for that shit in my adult life.

681
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:27,987
Rym: But on the other hand, I cannot ignore the fact that that was Extremely satisfying to me when I was younger.

682
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:38,630
Rym: Like if you got I'm I would like not you haven't become bored of it yet Yep, I would like walk back and forth next to elf land like fighting trolls to get that silver sword.

683
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:43,288
Rym: I was enjoying every second of that like I can't pretend I didn't.

684
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:45,961
Rym: it's not like I sprang forth from Zeus.

685
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:54,330
Scott: knowing that grinding is bad For me, it wasn't that I enjoyed the grinding is that I was more tolerant of it in those days.

686
00:49:54,571 --> 00:50:04,101
Scott: And then the reward of getting the silver sword finally affording it and then just mowing down people with the silver sword Yeah, that reward was so satisfying.

687
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:04,804
Scott: It was worth.

688
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:06,249
Rym: it was almost like the pain.

689
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,957
Rym: We've talked about this in panels before.

690
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:13,676
Rym: a certain amount of pain like say a super meat boy Increases the pleasure of completion.

691
00:50:13,716 --> 00:50:18,650
Rym: the pain just can't be too deep but when we were young we had an infinite capacity for that kind of pain.

692
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:27,007
Scott: exactly You know, but yeah, it's like that mechanic of random encounters as bad and lazy as it is now.

693
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:30,309
Scott: It's like there is Something to it, right?

694
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:35,590
Scott: You know to sort of fill if you you know, it's like if you just took that out completely.

695
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:37,350
Scott: Right, it's like okay.

696
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:46,559
Scott: Well now if there's no random encounters then the fun parts I like for example like getting items Right going shopping learning magic spells.

697
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,124
Scott: Those have lost all meaning now.

698
00:50:48,224 --> 00:50:48,986
Scott: It's like who cares?

699
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:52,396
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to learn I don't want to get items anymore.

700
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:55,447
Scott: I don't care about getting gold because there's no random encounters - right.

701
00:50:55,548 --> 00:51:05,934
Scott: It's like They put this bad thing in the game That's unfun in order to make it fun to get things to make the unfun part Go away.

702
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:10,190
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like the goal of capitalism is to escape capitalism.

703
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:11,252
Scott: Right.

704
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:16,829
Scott: The goal of the JRPG is to escape the horrible random encounters that they're not a problem anymore.

705
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:20,424
Scott: earthbound I think did really great where if you bump into a bad guy, that's too easy.

706
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,790
Scott: You just automatically win.

707
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:35,341
Rym: Yeah I think it should have been a little more liberal with that because its rule was if that enemy could not hurt you in any Way if it could possibly do even one damage you have to fight it Exactly, but you could usually kill it in one shot.

708
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:36,366
Scott: Yeah, that was the case.

709
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:45,170
Rym: Yeah, it was really weak Yep But some of them like Final Fantasy 4 was always interesting to me in that the random encounters Was what was a resource game?

710
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:56,886
Rym: Like do I have enough resources to get to the next like checkpoint, but then the boss fights were actually kind of like serious puzzles More so than a lot of other JRPGs I had played and that is a common theme of.

711
00:51:56,926 --> 00:52:08,016
Rym: the bosses will have Complexity that is a combination of knowledge and skill of how to deal with them based on what level you're at and what you've got and I always found that really satisfying.

712
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:18,630
Rym: like I think the reason Final Fantasy 4 has such a relatively large Randomizer scene like as small as it is like it's the biggest of the RPG randomizer scenes that I can see.

713
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:36,670
Rym: I think it's because it's basically a boss rush and the bosses in Final Fantasy 4 were really interesting Especially compared to other similar JRPGs from the era Final Fantasy 4 came out The the better JRPGs definitely, you know have more complex or interesting combat systems.

714
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:39,630
Scott: To you know, some of them good some of them bad, right?

715
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,427
Scott: Everyone's different and I can get into all the different ones like.

716
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:48,001
Rym: honestly Maybe I'll complain about Final Fantasy 8 but Combat I didn't find fun.

717
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:49,610
Rym: I liked everything else about that game.

718
00:52:50,732 --> 00:53:06,901
Scott: But the point is the good ones usually have some sort of Puzzly element where it's not just do your highest DPS attack heal when you're low repeat and Usually they'll be structured in such a way to where you know.

719
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:08,546
Scott: sure they're all.

720
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:24,792
Scott: if it has leveling up Mathematically, it's always going to be possible to grind and level up so much given enough time to blow past any amount of puzzles And just beat every guy right that which it's always a way possible in Final Fantasy 6.

721
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:25,715
Rym: That's what I did.

722
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:30,610
Rym: my endgame and I'll add Final Fantasy 6 was just four characters casting Ultima constantly.

723
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:33,594
Scott: right You know, it's like.

724
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:36,750
Scott: that's always gonna be possible as long as leveling up as a thing.

725
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:50,900
Scott: But the good JRPGs the ones that are better will have some sort of way where if you're clever and you figure it out Then you can with much less resources with much less grinding Find a way through right?

726
00:53:51,222 --> 00:54:05,518
Rym: Oh if I'm clever and I use this You know and sometimes it's like He's healing herself serious boss late-game keeps healing herself cast wall on her Like yep, that's a clever bit.

727
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,706
Rym: I remember I didn't figure that out on my own.

728
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:15,083
Scott: someone told me Now some of that stuff I think a lot of it actually ends up just being Knowledge and not really skill like I said.

729
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:16,730
Rym: someone told me I didn't figure it out.

730
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:17,934
Scott: It's like did you?

731
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,780
Scott: if you know it then you know it.

732
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,670
Scott: it's not are you good enough, right?

733
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,149
Scott: It's like just do you know a thing?

734
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:29,770
Scott: It's like a not, you know, if you have some knowledge well now you can grind less because you know a secret, right?

735
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,728
Scott: It's like okay great, you know, it's not very satisfying.

736
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:37,650
Scott: Yeah But at least it's better than just yeah, the only way through is grinding, right?

737
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:40,187
Scott: You know, it takes this many hours to beat this game.

738
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:40,943
Scott: the end Yep.

739
00:54:41,352 --> 00:55:01,877
Rym: But it also points out something about the way like we and like game reviewers talk Think again about like Final Fantasy 1 and like when you like you even said when you finally pick those games up They were very intuitive even though you'd never really played them before that that linear grindy relatively simple mechanism in a game Even if like say rumin Scott have outgrown it.

740
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,604
Rym: it's worth noting that for a young rumin Scott.

741
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:09,073
Rym: Those were killer mechanics Unbelievable game.

742
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:14,318
Scott: like if I had those games like some years sooner, I would have been like, oh my god This is the greatest game.

743
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,540
Rym: Yep.

744
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:20,770
Rym: I was like Ridiculously obsessed with min maxing my Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games.

745
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:28,054
Rym: I played all those Final Fantasy legends that ever like I just I played every RPG I could get my hands on even though really pay for me It was really just.

746
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:31,050
Scott: I wanted to know the frickin story right because they had such good.

747
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,809
Scott: You know music and characters and stories and I wanted to you know.

748
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:38,866
Rym: But I also I really wanted to know like who the were sword.

749
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:39,810
Rym: What does that actually do?

750
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,109
Rym: I want to go find a werewolf now and hit it with it and see what happens.

751
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:44,970
Rym: Like I would want to see what things did in the game.

752
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:53,617
Rym: But there was also an element that that was the era where I started to become aware that wait This is Final Fantasy 2.

753
00:55:53,617 --> 00:56:01,840
Rym: But why did that nerd I met on Prodigy say it was Final Fantasy 4 And I wasn't able to figure that out until the internet either.

754
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:03,666
Rym: I learned it relatively early.

755
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:07,358
Rym: I actually hosted in In the early geocities days.

756
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:14,490
Rym: I had a video game magazines did not tell the secret Hosted a site that had a partially translated Final Fantasy 5 ROM.

757
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,607
Rym: Okay, I was really proud of that when I got it.

758
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:22,248
Rym: but Those like that era for me.

759
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:31,089
Rym: What the moment that I remember and this gets back to these games are often a little glitchy and buggy and had weird stuff That wasn't well explained at least for kids like me.

760
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:43,447
Rym: It was exciting to uncover to discover them and try to solve that mystery because I got a summon That you're not supposed to be able to get in Final Fantasy 2 because it's part it was removed into.

761
00:56:43,467 --> 00:57:07,590
Rym: it was only in four But in an SNES cartridge, there's glitches and things where you might get some of those summons for Rydia and I got it and I had friends who literally did not believe me that I had this summon and I'd like show it to them and they were Like amazed by it and it got into sort of that like creepypasta Unknown exploration like no one can explain this to me, which no kid today could ever experience because they were just looking up.

762
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,559
Rym: There's no way to bring that era back.

763
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:11,021
Rym: I don't think.

764
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,850
Scott: no, I don't think so either.

765
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:16,024
Scott: You need a frog fractions frog fractions.

766
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:17,310
Rym: Just go down.

767
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:24,510
Scott: The frog fractions person recently tweeted that like they put frog fractions for inside of it's like what it's like.

768
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,547
Scott: We can just decompile it though and take a look at the code.

769
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:30,943
Scott: Yeah We don't need to trust them at their word.

770
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:32,269
Scott: Just try to mess with us.

771
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:36,123
Rym: Yeah, I don't really play any modern what we would call a JRPG.

772
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:36,725
Scott: No, I don't.

773
00:57:36,826 --> 00:57:38,030
Scott: I just don't have time for that.

774
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:41,021
Scott: It's - what I really like and we've talked about this a bit.

775
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:43,852
Scott: when I talked about I think I geeked by did cloudpunk And I all.

776
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:46,664
Scott: we also did a show recently on heavens heavens vault.

777
00:57:46,765 --> 00:57:47,428
Rym: Yeah, don't waste.

778
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,051
Scott: much is Right.

779
00:57:49,292 --> 00:58:04,930
Scott: It's like you can get the stir games now that are giving you parts of the RPG the parts that I like at least Right the explore the world talk to people epic plot sometimes multiple endings Right the same a chrono trigger head, right?

780
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,750
Scott: So your choices matter some person replayability or look at a very different genre.

781
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,794
Rym: Now they aspire.

782
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:10,617
Rym: gives me the.

783
00:58:10,938 --> 00:58:14,129
Rym: here's a bunch of complicated bosses and I got to figure out how to fight them.

784
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:20,250
Scott: Yeah, it's like just that, you know, whichever part you want don't you know, I always made this analogy.

785
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:22,039
Scott: So I'll make it again where.

786
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:29,690
Scott: imagine you went to the movie theater to watch Lord of the Rings and you're right or some epic movie and you watch it for like five minutes, right?

787
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,556
Scott: And that was the intro.

788
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:31,926
Scott: that's just like you'd even press start.

789
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,430
Scott: Yeah, right.

790
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:36,846
Scott: and then you know you're watching like the first scene right and then the.

791
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:43,650
Scott: suddenly it pauses and In front of you there pops up like, you know, they give you like a little tablet and it's like on the tablet.

792
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:45,930
Scott: It's like, you know, here are some trivia questions.

793
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,144
Scott: Answer them correctly, right?

794
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:56,629
Scott: Or wait ten minutes and then if you answer them correctly or wait ten minutes Then we will let you watch the next scene.

795
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:00,624
Scott: Otherwise watch this death scene where the and that's the end of the movie.

796
00:59:00,664 --> 00:59:02,470
Scott: the end Frodo dies, right?

797
00:59:04,214 --> 00:59:07,550
Scott: And then go back to the to the quiz again, right after you're watching the death scene.

798
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,981
Scott: And it's like if you had to watch a movie like that.

799
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,295
Scott: It's like you wouldn't watch the fucking movie You'd be like.

800
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,170
Scott: what the fuck is this bullshit?

801
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:18,749
Rym: Let me watch and that's I was always annoyed like that concept of there's nothing different.

802
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:21,730
Rym: Failure just prevents you from proceeding.

803
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:22,774
Rym: I don't.

804
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:23,336
Rym: I don't.

805
00:59:23,918 --> 00:59:28,520
Rym: as an adult and as someone who introspects why I enjoy games I realize that that is.

806
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:48,633
Rym: I'm not here for that But I do recognize that for other types of gamers, especially younger gamers those mechanics that I despise Still hold value to them and that's why there's such a thriving ecosystem of fairly grindy JRPGs that even today Aren't substantially evolved from Final Fantasy 6.

807
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,279
Scott: I mean they're evolved but they're not.

808
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,170
Scott: you know, I think the fundamentals are still are still there.

809
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:55,669
Scott: They've just really polished a lot of the outer edges, right?

810
00:59:56,152 --> 01:00:15,170
Scott: But yeah, it's like sometime around the college times, you know, thanks to playing Mudds in high school Right and learning things there about grinding When Wow came out and I saw people grinding there and the MMO RPGs That's when I sort of realized like hey, why can't I just play Final Fantasy 6 without this fucking ground bullshit?

811
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,026
Rym: That was that was my moment too when I bounced off a Wow and I was like, wait a minute.

812
01:00:19,388 --> 01:00:20,628
Rym: Wait a minute Fuck this.

813
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:27,890
Scott: No, I refuse and my opinions basically been the same since then which is like just let me fucking watch the rings.

814
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:28,111
Rym: I

815
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:30,360
Scott: wanted to stop and answer your goddamn quizzes right

816
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:45,964
Rym: before that like right before I went to RIT I was playing the realm and like grinding out like killing imps to get to experience points for hours and hours and hours at a time to make a number grow up and There was nothing wrong with that in my eyes for some reason.

817
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:50,723
Rym: and when I hit Wow I bounced off of it and then remember you a bunch of us at RIT got into.

818
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:52,790
Rym: uh, oh god, what was that?

819
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,174
Rym: MMO that we got it.

820
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,480
Scott: I mean I played puzzle pirates.

821
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,464
Scott: That was pretty grindy.

822
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:58,870
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty good.

823
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,402
Scott: It's not a J. Not a JRPG.

824
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:03,034
Rym: Yeah But now we play.

825
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:04,321
Rym: we played a couple of like.

826
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:06,110
Rym: we played a Korean RPG at one point.

827
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:08,097
Scott: No, Ragnarok Ragnarok.

828
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,650
Scott: That was the one and I just hit slimes for like a week.

829
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,621
Rym: And yeah, we we both we were all grinding it.

830
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:21,810
Rym: and then we all together was like wait a minute This grind is just gonna unlock a Slightly different grind and we I think we all have a girl grind rats instead of slimes.

831
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,190
Rym: Yeah, I tried to run to the end of the game and it was just a bigger numbers grinding out bigger numbers.

832
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:27,347
Rym: There wasn't anything else there.

833
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:35,758
Rym: Yep, so yeah You know, that's That's just our thoughts on this.

834
01:01:35,979 --> 01:01:36,019
Rym: I

835
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:55,884
Scott: think you know, I think JRPGs these days I think what they've done especially we talked about the most popular one Pokemon Is that to sort of you know Alleviate, I don't know necessarily alleviate but to sort of appeal to a broader audience of people who may not just want to grind and Level up is they add all sorts of other things?

836
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:57,350
Scott: Dragon Quest does this also.

837
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,390
Rym: Well, we're a lot of grinding mechanics that are not game necessary.

838
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,960
Scott: Right this fashion and this side game.

839
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:07,190
Rym: go grow your berries and breed berries or whatever.

840
01:02:08,014 --> 01:02:10,890
Scott: All sorts of other things going on in the game.

841
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,184
Scott: Just all sorts of systems that may or may not interact with the combat system.

842
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,167
Rym: Look at the game of the year.

843
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:23,150
Rym: Look at Hades dating sim dialogue tree unlocking relationships plus like action RPG.

844
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:40,268
Scott: Right exactly, you know They just put lots and lots of systems in there So that there's something for you to be interested in something for you to spend your time in something for everyone to you know do And yeah, you know eventually uncover the plot of some kind right.

845
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:40,529
Scott: so?

846
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:45,222
Scott: And I do think you know regardless of any other negative things about them.

847
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:53,746
Scott: game wise, you know the plots characters You know stories of a lot of JRPGs are still really kind of epic and awesome.

848
01:02:53,766 --> 01:03:01,289
Scott: a lot of the time not all the time But a lot of the time and I really enjoy those kinds of stories and I'd love to like watch them on YouTube As opposed to playing them.

849
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:10,346
Scott: Yep, right because then I can get that story while without wasting such a large portion of my life Just pushing a and waiting for the next, you know to get to the next town.

850
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,754
Rym: Yeah What I wonder?

851
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:18,515
Rym: I suspect we wouldn't feel differently because if we didn't have jobs But somehow didn't need money.

852
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:25,642
Rym: I think we would fill that vacuum trivially, but I do wonder if we had a lot of free time Would we be more tolerant?

853
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:26,609
Rym: I think the answer is no.

854
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:36,520
Scott: I might be more tolerant in that, you know, as long as it was a You know an easier one right one.

855
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,330
Scott: that didn't, you know, it depends on exactly how long it takes, right?

856
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:41,269
Scott: It's like I might be able to get through.

857
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,574
Scott: You know cuz like.

858
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:47,810
Scott: I've played a Pokemon games recently and I usually get like a few gyms in and then stop, right?

859
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,833
Scott: I haven't beaten one since like Maybe.

860
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:51,316
Scott: well

861
01:03:51,336 --> 01:04:03,750
Rym: like they're not that long ago like during kovid I just like fired up Final Fantasy 1 in an emulator because I was trying to test something and Before I knew it I'd beaten garland and the bridge appeared and I was like wait wait Rym you're actually playing stop.

862
01:04:04,272 --> 01:04:05,076
Rym: I had to catch myself.

863
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:16,610
Scott: Yeah, I played final fantasy 7 came out on Steam Maybe a few years ago because I and I went and I played that like alright I'll give this game one more shot, right and I went and I played it and I got through.

864
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:32,421
Scott: I was having a good time going through seeing stuff I'd already seen before going through and then Suddenly I got farther than I'd ever gotten before and the world like opened up into this enormous world outside the town And I didn't even know the game got that big And I was like what the fuck is this?

865
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:34,570
Scott: I don't have time for this.

866
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:38,016
Scott: And then I stopped playing as soon as that.

867
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:44,581
Scott: that was just so overwhelming to have that such big world open up and Realize the game was gonna be that long and that made me stop playing.

868
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:51,962
Rym: Well, that's that that rudderless moment assumes that you have like gotten invested in the game enough to where you're.

869
01:04:52,002 --> 01:04:57,994
Rym: like Hooked you before that rudderless moment.

870
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,257
Rym: I think that's the moment.

871
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:08,374
Rym: Most people would just bounce off of a game Like if you weren't feeling Final Fantasy 1. as soon as you get that airship, you'll be like, oh, there are way too many things up North.

872
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:08,759
Rym: I'm done.

873
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:09,185
Rym: I'm out.

874
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:12,052
Scott: Yep All right.

875
01:05:12,092 --> 01:05:14,220
Scott: So yeah the future of JRPGs.

876
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,003
Scott: I think they're just.

877
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:17,130
Rym: you know, I keep on evolving.

878
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:24,308
Scott: Yeah, I'm not paying enough attention to the scene to know like what the developments are and what.

879
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:28,571
Rym: I don't even finish Pokemon games these days right as an outsider Right.

880
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:40,496
Scott: It just looks like they sort of keep doing You know the same old same old only, you know freshening and advancing and expanding but not really Revolutionizing, right?

881
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,010
Scott: It's like here's another Final Fantasy.

882
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:51,893
Scott: It's a lot like the other Final Fantasy's only better graphics bigger fancier new combat system more things to do Etc.

883
01:05:52,154 --> 01:05:52,335
Scott: Right.

884
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:56,070
Scott: This one is different because it's what dudes pushing a car or something, right?

885
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,750
Scott: Who is that was one of the recent ish ones?

886
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:02,633
Scott: I guess that one's probably old by now right knowing how old I am You know.

887
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:04,722
Scott: and then they just they do how they do it.

888
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:10,378
Scott: I guess there's still an audience for it And it's you know, it's just not it was.

889
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:14,169
Scott: it sort of is and isn't for me at the same time, right?

890
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:26,997
Rym: Yep, that's part of why I'm playing these randomizers because I get to scratch that itch that's still there buried But it's a very concentrated experience that ends quickly and it's just like I'm mainlining.

891
01:06:27,057 --> 01:06:39,833
Rym: the part of those games that I like the most which for Final Fantasies was Especially Final Fantasy's foreign earlier was the boss rush as of Andy like looting more so than the plots Really?

892
01:06:39,873 --> 01:06:44,410
Rym: It was Final Fantasy 6 and chrono trigger where I was more invested in the characters than I was in the game mechanics.
