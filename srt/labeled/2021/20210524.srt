1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,840
Scott:

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,798
Rym: It's Monday, May 24th, 2021.

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:10,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:13,767
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,395
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,710
Rym: Tonight we are talking about video cameras.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,728
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,140
Rym: So, uh, I did actually, you know, I'm fully vaccinated.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,930
Rym: Like, I'm way past the two weeks after my second shot.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,290
Rym: So, uh, I went back into my office once today.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,192
Scott: Wow.

12
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:38,390
Scott: I've not gotten even to Manhattan's except for to get vaccinated and to go to the dentist once.

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:39,490
Rym: Yup.

14
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:50,630
Rym: I mean, so even now, having done this, I can count on one hand the number of buildings I have been inside since the weekend after PAX East last year.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:51,613
Scott: Yup.

16
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:52,329
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,590
Rym: This one CVS this one time on a bike ride, uh, because I wasn't even going to grocery stores because, you know, delivery.

18
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:00,720
Scott: Oh, right.

19
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,730
Scott: I went to the grocery store.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,550
Rym: But still, that counts as one building.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:04,813
Scott: Oh, I went to two.

22
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:07,909
Scott: Actually, there are a few grocery stores.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,592
Rym: Oh.

24
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:10,397
Scott: Family Market.

25
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,688
Scott: We got a Family Market over here.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,730
Rym: Yup, but now it's at the point...

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,313
Scott: There were some takeout.

28
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:14,917
Scott: There were some times.

29
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:17,130
Scott: I got takeout and I went in, got the takeout, and walked out.

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,750
Rym: I was weirdly able to avoid that for almost the entire quarantine because all the places that did pick up had outdoor pickup places.

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:24,879
Scott: Hmm.

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,030
Scott: It's not a big deal to walk in and grab something off a table and walk out.

33
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:29,433
Scott: Yeah.

34
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:41,450
Rym: No, we had... Both of our households were pretty prudent and also lucky in that we didn't have the free... Because, you know, statistically, low odds aren't zero odds, so if you do everything right, you could just get fucked.

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:42,610
Scott: Yup.

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,873
Rym: But we pulled out.

37
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,174
Rym: okay.

38
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,270
Rym: so far, so my observations going to Manhattan is one.

39
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,497
Rym: There is still, like, nobody in Manhattan.

40
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,884
Rym: Like, it is just a ghost town.

41
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,047
Rym: Like, there's almost no traffic.

42
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:55,010
Rym: There's no one on the street.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,190
Scott: When I went to the dentist and when I went for the vaccine, there was less people, right?

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,190
Scott: So the vaccine was, what, six to eight weeks ago when I went?

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,795
Scott: And it's like, yeah, Times Square.

46
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:09,530
Scott: It's like, there were, you know, there was a hot dog vendor and, like, no one buying hot dogs.

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,410
Scott: I think I saw one blob of tourists, right?

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,007
Rym: Yup.

49
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,950
Scott: Stuff is still closed, though, so why would tourists be there, right?

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,501
Scott: It's like, the Broadway is like, "Oh, we're going to open September.

51
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:19,466
Scott: It's way far.

52
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:19,988
Scott: It's months

53
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:20,250
Scott: away.".

54
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:24,010
Rym: Yeah, but New York's not an amusement park, even as much as tourists think it is.

55
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,289
Rym: Like, if you just show up here, it doesn't dedicate you.

56
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,137
Scott: Let's come to New York on vacation, guys.

57
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:28,820
Scott: What are we going to do?

58
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,864
Scott: Stay in a hotel?

59
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,130
Scott: Buy a hot dog?

60
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:31,694
Scott: Yup.

61
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,715
Scott: What else is open?

62
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:35,224
Scott: The gift shop was open.

63
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,150
Scott: You could buy an island of New York.

64
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,412
Rym: You know what?

65
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,570
Rym: You can do all the things that are only fun to people who live here.

66
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,257
Scott: Get vaccinated.

67
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,389
Scott: That's what you can do.

68
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,695
Rym: Like, what do I do in New York?

69
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,323
Rym: Go hang out in our amazing parks.

70
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:44,690
Scott: Don't fly here to do that.

71
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,947
Scott: Yeah, the park wasn't open until recently, so that's not the street.

72
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:48,550
Scott: That's the park.

73
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,710
Scott: So I'm sure if you go to the park, there's plenty of people.

74
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,740
Rym: Dude, pretty much everything is closed, like, permanently closed.

75
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:58,390
Rym: Like, there's so much empty real estate that it was surprising.

76
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,050
Scott: Well, there was before, and now there's more.

77
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:13,110
Rym: Yeah, there's so much is empty, and all the places, with one exception, that I have ever, like, eaten lunch at on purpose more than once near my office are gone and replaced with more generic chains.

78
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:20,490
Rym: Like, all the Maison CaillÃ©'s are all gone and replaced by the shitty version of Le Pen-Quotidien.

79
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:22,349
Scott: Okay.

80
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,455
Rym: So, like, there weren't a lot of lunch places.

81
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:28,427
Rym: The category market is still open and just fine.

82
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:29,390
Rym: Like, they're just totally normal.

83
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,244
Rym: And also, at least, everyone's still wearing masks, except when they're, like, alone outside.

84
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,570
Rym: Like, every store still has their mask signs up.

85
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:41,450
Rym: People are still being pretty cautious in New York compared to other places.

86
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:48,390
Scott: Yeah, it seems like, you know, my office, I only know what's going on there because of, you know, Slack messages, right?

87
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,696
Scott: But it seems like there's more people there than there were.

88
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:58,310
Scott: They had, like, a very regimented system, and it seems like very few people were participating in it previously.

89
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:11,970
Scott: And now it feels, I think, that basically what they, I can't, I don't know exactly what system they have now, but it feels like, based on what I'm seeing, is that, yeah, it's like people who want to go back there are just sort of back there now, you know.

90
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,354
Rym: Yeah, we're at a, like, no one wants to go back.

91
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:21,850
Rym: Like, I know a few people who, like, wanted to go back to the office full time, and that is not the majority opinion.

92
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:28,085
Scott: Even if I go back there, basically no one on my team of people is there, right?

93
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:29,790
Scott: So what am I gaining by going there?

94
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:40,310
Rym: Oh, no, I was only there performatively because, you know, like, I'm a highly visible, like, pretty senior manager, but seriously, almost all my engineering teams aren't even in the US.

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,394
Rym: Like, they're in places where they can't even get the vaccine.

96
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:45,280
Rym: Even if there was no COVID, they're all remote.

97
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:49,850
Rym: Like, almost no one I need to talk to is physically in the same building as me.

98
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,790
Scott: They do keep sending out messages lately of, like, all the food that's in the office.

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,679
Rym: Yeah, we're getting a lot of that too.

100
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:56,988
Rym: They're like, "Hey, we added...".

101
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,100
Scott: In the New York City channel, it's always like, "Free food on 14, guys.

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,320
Scott: Come

103
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:02,641
Scott: on.".

104
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,710
Scott: And it's like, it's sort of like, "Oh, come back to the office and get free

105
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:06,910
Scott: food.".

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,853
Rym: Yeah, you're not tricking me.

107
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,246
Rym: You gave me free food all the time when I was in the office, and I didn't even eat it then.

108
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,250
Rym: You think I'm gonna eat it now?

109
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:20,610
Scott: My thought is, you know, if I do go back there, I'll be sure to only go back on the days when the food is...

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,834
Rym: Nah, Taco Tuesday.

111
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,078
Rym: My plan is to go back in one day a week, and...

112
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,047
Scott: Well, isn't that because you're required to?

113
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,357
Rym: Yeah, well, so it's one of those, I am not officially yet required to.

114
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:43,790
Rym: However, as a highly visible person, I am expected to show up semi-regularly, and it's all kind of a statistics game and whatever.

115
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,736
Scott: Just don't.

116
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:45,768
Scott: Just be like, "Fuck you.

117
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:45,869
Scott: Make

118
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:45,930
Scott: me.".

119
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,754
Rym: Yeah, I'll go out one day a week.

120
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:54,270
Rym: It was novel enough, but I will say, I was way less productive in the office than I would have been at home because, you know what my day was?

121
00:05:54,891 --> 00:06:03,810
Rym: A million meetings with people who are at home using the shittier work computer with the shittier headphones and the shittier webcam.

122
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:16,070
Scott: I don't know if I'm more, you know, it's like, am I more or less productive in the, you know, maybe in the office, maybe actually more productive because I don't have the good screen next to the bad screen.

123
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,995
Rym: Yeah, but at work, it's not...

124
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,033
Scott: If I'm more productive, that's a problem.

125
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:36,230
Scott: Also, the time, you know, even if I am more productive in the office somehow, and I want to be more productive, what about the time I'm losing going to and from the office, just riding a train?

126
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:36,490
Scott: Well,

127
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:54,870
Rym: the thing is, I think, so I think the entirety of the tech and even to a broader set like capital markets sector, like the technology enabled stuff in New York, I think there's going to be a huge exodus of people who are asked to come back into the office, but moved away and are just going to quit and try to find a job.

128
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,969
Scott: People on my team moved away.

129
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,769
Scott: Oh, I know a lot of people.

130
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,950
Scott: Everyone's got different backgrounds on their video chats.

131
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,631
Rym: A lot

132
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:04,552
Scott: of people moved

133
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:18,350
Rym: and a lot of people also, I know I've run into a lot of people who had the long commute for a long time, like people who unlike us just stayed upstate, like that's just their life doing an hour commute and they didn't think much of it previously.

134
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:26,550
Rym: Like they'd resigned themselves to having that long commute, but now they had a year of not doing that commute and they realized how soul sucking it is and they can't go back to it.

135
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,210
Rym: But they also can't afford to buy a place in the city.

136
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,533
Scott: Aren't they right?

137
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,750
Scott: If they're Bloomberg, shouldn't they be getting paid a fortune?

138
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,247
Rym: It depends on what the job is.

139
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,944
Rym: And also, part of the reason why I feel like I'm being paid a fortune is that I am a dink.

140
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,150
Rym: I don't have any responsibilities.

141
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:43,559
Scott: Yeah.

142
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,709
Rym: Most of the people I know who worry about that kind of thing have multiple kids and possibly own a house.

143
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,869
Scott: Well, who told you do that?

144
00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:03,030
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with my, if I work from home, my commute is 45 seconds because I just kind of roll out of bed and go to my first meeting and then I brush my teeth.

145
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,689
Scott: Whether I commute or even on Saturday, I go to the same chair.

146
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:12,870
Rym: But even if I go to the office, it's a 12-minute commute, maybe?

147
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:22,350
Rym: But the other thing, I took a city bike there because you have to get COVID tests before you even go into the building.

148
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,230
Rym: So I didn't want to deal with having to stash my bike and go out and I just took a city bike.

149
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,907
Rym: And they only had e-bikes at the city bike station, Darros.

150
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:31,570
Rym: All e-bikes.

151
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,789
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot more.

152
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:33,956
Scott: I had to pay $1.30 to get one.

153
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,318
Scott: Oh, you paid?

154
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:38,707
Scott: Oh, when I used my...

155
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,628
Rym: E-bikes aren't free.

156
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,950
Scott: Last time I city biked, I actually had to walk to a different dock to get a non-e-bike.

157
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:52,670
Rym: There was literally, the dock was completely full and it was all but one where e-bikes, the non-e-bike, was broken.

158
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:54,309
Scott: Yeah, just go to the next dock.

159
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,063
Rym: The next dock is like five minutes away.

160
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,890
Rym: I have to walk to it.

161
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,210
Scott: Okay, well then pay money.

162
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:00,829
Rym: I paid the $1.30 and the e-bikes are alright.

163
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:08,370
Rym: But I did learn something I didn't think about because these are e-bikes that are designed to make people not hurt themselves.

164
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,466
Rym: And they're designed to not drive unless you're pedaling.

165
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:12,230
Rym: It makes sense.

166
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,987
Rym: So what I discovered is I was going down the Queensboro Bridge and I was like,

167
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:18,228
Rym: "Yeah.".

168
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,141
Rym: So it seems to figure out if I'm pedaling, if I'm pushing against.

169
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:30,490
Rym: the gearing above a certain threshold is when the power assist kicks in and it seems to increase if I push harder.

170
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,949
Rym: So I pedaled as hard as I could on a downhill to see what would happen.

171
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,050
Scott: To just crash into the wall and die?

172
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:41,490
Rym: I was able to get pretty fast for a city bike.

173
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,048
Scott: You don't say.

174
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:47,590
Rym: I got about 40 miles an hour, which is way slower than I can go on my real bike.

175
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,189
Rym: But I did not think I would get a city bike up to 40 miles an hour.

176
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,198
Scott: You didn't.

177
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,889
Scott: The motor did.

178
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,607
Rym: I got it there with the motor's help.

179
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:58,169
Scott: The motor was doing most of the work.

180
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,156
Rym: The fastest I've ever gone on a bike.

181
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,400
Scott: this was exactly 51 miles an hour.

182
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,970
Rym: And that was on a mountain bike in the mountains of Tennessee when I was in middle school.

183
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,229
Scott: Yeah, okay.

184
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,049
Scott: That was a bad idea.

185
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,769
Scott: You don't say.

186
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,983
Rym: Basically we were driving on a family trip.

187
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:19,770
Rym: We'll get into the news.

188
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:27,810
Rym: And we're on the mountains and we're going to take this exit that goes down a really, really long downhill ramp to this parking lot thing.

189
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:31,168
Rym: And my parents were like, "Hey, you guys want to bike down

190
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:31,350
Rym: that?".

191
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,358
Rym: And we're like, "Fuck yeah!

192
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,649
Rym: We just got on our bikes and just went

193
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:33,810
Rym: down.".

194
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:35,090
Scott: Okay.

195
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:36,089
Rym: It was awesome.

196
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,128
Rym: Anyway, got any tech news?

197
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,010
Scott: I do have a tech news, so check this out.

198
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,060
Scott: Where was it again?

199
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:43,607
Scott: There it is.

200
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:45,190
Rym: Free node?

201
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,890
Scott: Oh, do you want to do the free node one first?

202
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,610
Scott: Okay, so if people don't know, free node is a very old IRC network.

203
00:10:54,971 --> 00:11:00,150
Scott: And what free node is, is an IRC network specifically for the open source community.

204
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:10,149
Scott: So all the major open source projects out there, even I guess until recently, and maybe even still today if they're not aware of what's going on.

205
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:19,370
Scott: Usually if you start an open source project and you have a community of people who are actually like developers, and you also need maybe to provide support to users because you're like a real project.

206
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,130
Scott: You're not just something one guy made and slept on on GitHub.

207
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:28,430
Scott: You generally will start a free node channel, an IRC channel on the free node network.

208
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:35,387
Scott: And then people will know that generally, "Oh, this is a somewhat major open source project.

209
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,129
Scott: I need help with

210
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,230
Scott: it.".

211
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,147
Scott: Or, "I'm getting more involved with

212
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:38,248
Scott: it."

213
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,450
Scott: And they'll know that there's going to be a free node channel for it.

214
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,270
Scott: And they go there and they join the channel and there's the other developers and that's what you use.

215
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,610
Scott: You didn't have like a Discord for your open source project.

216
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,901
Scott: You don't need more than one channel.

217
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:53,950
Scott: You just need the one channel.

218
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,421
Scott: What else is there to talk about?

219
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,267
Scott: It's just the project.

220
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:57,589
Scott: That's it.

221
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:08,870
Scott: So what happened was it's one of those situations that we're seeing, I guess, of this pattern of free node is sort of like a foundation.

222
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,230
Scott: I don't even know what its technical organization is or was, but it's one of those sort of like non-profiting groups.

223
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:24,970
Scott: I don't know if it's actually a 401(c)(3) nonprofit, but it's a foundation or something like that, some sort of organization that is not for profit.

224
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,724
Scott: It's just, you know, maybe it has a board or something.

225
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:28,609
Scott: I don't fucking know.

226
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,767
Rym: Yeah, I don't think about IRC much, nor have I for about 15 years.

227
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:40,890
Scott: But it's basically just benevolently administered for the sake of the people and the community.

228
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,659
Scott: It's not trying to make money.

229
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,410
Scott: It's not trying to do anything.

230
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:55,450
Scott: It's just, you know, doing, you know, taking some donations and paying people the bare minimum to keep this thing up, updated, stable, running, you know, and so forth.

231
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:04,230
Scott: You know, volunteers doing, you know, just whatever you got to do to keep the lights on, you know, this rock of the community of open source software.

232
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:17,970
Scott: So what happened recently was this thing I've seen happen before where some sort of profiting organization somehow ends up taking control via means or another, right?

233
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:36,970
Scott: I think in this case, I heard some stories like there was a profiting group that was helping with like conferences on the side, you know, but somehow the contract wording and they ended up grabbing more ownership legally speaking or some business like that, right?

234
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:43,569
Rym: I skimmed this article and couldn't quite make out exactly what went down without deeper reading that I didn't care to do.

235
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:44,532
Scott: Right.

236
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:45,876
Scott: But this has happened a few times.

237
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:50,990
Scott: .org was almost taken over by a for profit entity, but that was stopped, thankfully.

238
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:53,678
Scott: But there have been some other incidents.

239
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,065
Scott: I just can't think of any right now.

240
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:55,949
Scott: This definitely isn't the first.

241
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,870
Scott: Regardless, you know, there's been a lot of hearsay from different people.

242
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:12,290
Scott: I saw one person write a story about how, you know, because they were worried about the state of free node, they opened, they moved, they had like a bot channel and they moved.

243
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:16,650
Scott: They started, they relaunched the bot channel on a different IRC network.

244
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,310
Scott: And in the free node channel, they mentioned that they had moved in the subject line of the IRC channel.

245
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:35,930
Scott: And then they found, and then later on, some, one of the admins of free node who is with the new owners, you know, sort of reset the channel and kick them out and reset the subject.

246
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,016
Scott: But that's just a story.

247
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:43,030
Scott: I guess I could have gone logged into IRC to check and verify, but you know, whatever.

248
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:51,390
Scott: But one thing that I saw that basically gave a lot of credence to all of these rumblings that basically free node is dead.

249
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,855
Scott: Everyone moved to this other IRC network now.

250
00:14:54,797 --> 00:15:00,710
Scott: I forget the name of the new IRC network people are moving to, but is on the GitHub for free node.

251
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,503
Scott: And like the code of conduct area, right?

252
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,670
Scott: You can see, I saw it on GitHub.

253
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:19,210
Scott: There was basically this, you know, commit that was removing the language in the code of conduct that said like, you know, don't be racist, domophobic, transphobic, et cetera, et cetera.

254
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,316
Scott: And that language just got removed.

255
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:27,589
Scott: And there was a comment that was like, oh, so it's okay to just say racist shit on free node?

256
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:27,770
Scott: No.

257
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:30,516
Scott: The comment was along those lines.

258
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,950
Scott: So, yeah, whoever took over free node, someone took it over somehow.

259
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:44,010
Scott: And now all those open source, you know, people are probably going to slowly figure out what's going on and move off of free node.

260
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,450
Scott: Looks like they're moving to LiberaChat.

261
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,032
Scott: Yes, that's the one.

262
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:51,781
Scott: LiberaChat is now the new is the new free node, apparently.

263
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,490
Scott: So, yeah, it had a long, long life.

264
00:15:55,671 --> 00:16:00,350
Scott: I don't know what they hope to gain from owning it, like they're messing with it.

265
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,674
Scott: Like, well, I don't understand.

266
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:09,969
Scott: with these kind of people who are smart enough to run IRC servers aren't going to pay for them when they can run their own and when discord exists and when slack.

267
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,023
Scott: And it's like, what were you hoping to do here?

268
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:13,827
Scott: What's wrong with you?

269
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:22,770
Rym: More of the power play was people who had a weird personal, like anti progressive agenda.

270
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,638
Rym: I don't know what to see that every now and then.

271
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:31,010
Rym: Like, look at the point of doubling down on supporting who shall not be named.

272
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:31,891
Scott: Right.

273
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:39,650
Scott: If you need to go to the IRC channel to get support for an open source thing, go to the Libera, whatever, and not the free node.

274
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:49,910
Rym: I would argue, because actually is the lead into my news a little bit, but I would argue that the culture of go to the IRC to get support is a big part of why a lot of people don't use open source software.

275
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:55,243
Scott: Well, it's usually you're going there not just to get, you know, run of the mill support.

276
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,909
Scott: You're going there for like the deep, the deep support.

277
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:58,130
Scott: Right.

278
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,914
Scott: You know, you're even like.

279
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:10,310
Rym: I have a lot of men who basically the IRC is one of those things that like really old people talk about sometimes.

280
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:11,911
Scott: Yeah.

281
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:21,170
Scott: You go there because like you're involved in developing the project and you need something like you need to actually have a conversation that you can't even do on like the pull request comments or anything.

282
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:21,988
Scott: You really need to.

283
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:30,610
Rym: And it's interesting because on one hand, I feel like most newer projects and things that aren't tied to old open source culture would probably just make a discord.

284
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:33,859
Scott: But, well, usually you can get almost everything.

285
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,710
Scott: these days you can just handle with your GitHub issues and those sorts of things.

286
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:45,830
Scott: You don't really need the chat room, basically, but you the chat room is more for the developers themselves, right?

287
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,198
Scott: Because like at my work, we need a chat room amongst us developers.

288
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:49,379
Scott: Right.

289
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:53,750
Scott: Our GitHub issues aren't enough for your JIRA isn't enough for whatever you're using.

290
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,230
Rym: Like the JIRA is add this thing or do this thing, but you got to decide what's the architecture.

291
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:05,770
Scott: The IRC is basically the actual developers need to have a chat room for themselves and then it's just open.

292
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,399
Scott: If you really need to go, you can actually talk to them.

293
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:08,639
Scott: Right.

294
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,322
Scott: That's what it is.

295
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,288
Scott: It's not for the everyday.

296
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:11,730
Scott: get help.

297
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:14,713
Rym: Yeah.

298
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:15,114
Rym: So we'll see.

299
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:20,550
Rym: I mean, I don't know how much impact this news would even have.

300
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,070
Rym: Like how many people care, think about this at all, would even notice?

301
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,369
Scott: There's a lot of people on Freenode.

302
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,652
Rym: Yeah.

303
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:30,629
Rym: But like how many?

304
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,410
Scott: The open source, a large amount of the open source community is on there.

305
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:37,832
Rym: Oh, let's see.

306
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:44,207
Rym: Freenode has, according to Wikipedia, has an average of like 80,000 users globally.

307
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,404
Scott: No, that's about right.

308
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:47,527
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,193
Rym: All right.

310
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:49,428
Rym: That rounds down to basically zero.

311
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,872
Scott: Okay.

312
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:51,695
Scott: You could have said 800,000 or 8 million.

313
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,061
Scott: You would have been like, eh, it rounds down.

314
00:18:55,751 --> 00:19:00,145
Rym: No, if it was 800,000 or 8 million, I would have been a very different average number of servers, 32.

315
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:00,246
Rym: Okay.

316
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:03,430
Scott: Anyway.

317
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,880
Rym: Oh, well, the Wikipedia already got updated in May 2021.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,290
Rym: Freenode underwent what staff described as a hostile takeover.

319
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,049
Rym: 30 staff resigned.

320
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:14,200
Scott: Yep.

321
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:18,463
Rym: Only a handful of those staff are involved in the Libro chat project.

322
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,130
Rym: Looks like everyone else just bailed completely.

323
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,672
Scott: Yeah.

324
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,548
Scott: They're just like, eh, fuck this.

325
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,072
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,169
Rym: We'll see how that all goes.

327
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:34,050
Rym: So Audacity is basically the most used open source audio editing and recording software?

328
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,611
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:47,010
Scott: I mean, if you want to be able to just talk and record your talking, the software that's available to you for zero dollars free legally, there aren't a lot of great choices.

330
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:55,370
Scott: You know, like, I guess if you're, you know, if you got like your iPhone, there's like the audio recording app and Windows, I think there's some kind of recording app, right?

331
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,722
Scott: I guess GarageBand isn't really great for talking.

332
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,030
Scott: It's more for music focused.

333
00:19:59,370 --> 00:19:59,466
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,768
Scott: I guess you could talk into it, but not the greatest.

335
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:03,030
Scott: Right.

336
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,677
Scott: And you know, you go beyond that.

337
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:05,520
Scott: It's like, well, what are you using?

338
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,163
Scott: It costs money.

339
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,810
Scott: Adobe Audition, right?

340
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:16,810
Rym: Or CoolEdit, which I, well, I pirated, then I pirated a different way and I got a legit license long after that software was gone.

341
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,030
Scott: Right.

342
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,886
Scott: And, you know, so despite the fact that the user interface looking like it's ancient Garbo, Audacity is that program.

343
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:25,708
Scott: It's totally free.

344
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:26,169
Scott: It runs.

345
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:26,610
Scott: It works.

346
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:34,370
Scott: You can plug a microphone into a computer, push the record button and talk and it will record your voice and save it and make an MP3 and do everything.

347
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,699
Scott: And so it's what a lot of people use and they don't need anything more than that.

348
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,648
Scott: So it's, you know, it's a long running, popular project.

349
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,757
Rym: In the old days, we actually used it to record GeekNights.

350
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:53,090
Rym: We didn't edit or master GeekNights in it because it really doesn't, it's GIMP levels of quality for all that stuff.

351
00:20:53,631 --> 00:21:01,430
Rym: But for the recording, we'd recorded Audacity and then I ran a script in a bunch of open source crap that I won't even mention because you shouldn't use it because it's garbage.

352
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:02,968
Rym: But that's what we used to use.

353
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:03,732
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,437
Scott: But, you know, the thing is, it's really old.

355
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,500
Scott: It's been around a long time.

356
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,570
Scott: It's improved a lot over the years, but it's improved.

357
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:13,709
Scott: In some ways it's improved and in some ways it's still the same old Garbo.

358
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:14,959
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:15,849
Scott: But what would you pay for?

360
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:28,990
Rym: One of the two problems I guess I've always had with Audacity is that even when I first tried it, on one it definitely does not at any point have anyone who's even sniffed the concept of UX and their life involved in it.

361
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:29,293
Rym: Nope.

362
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,410
Scott: None whatsoever.

363
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:45,650
Rym: But two, it's informed very heavily by the kinds of things that the loudest and most vocal users of Audacity try to do, which are often weird things that if they knew anything about audio they would not be doing in the first place.

364
00:21:46,990 --> 00:22:00,390
Rym: So you end up with an interface that very prominently centers features that people shouldn't be touching regularly and hides or doesn't even have the things that someone who actually knows audio would literally want to do every time they open the application.

365
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,693
Scott: It's not meant for pros, right?

366
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:16,590
Scott: It's meant for just the average person who wants to record their voice and do a little bit of cut and paste and some of those other things that aren't so easy to do in the sound recording app on your iPhone.

367
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,239
Scott: It's something between that and Audition.

368
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,947
Scott: They don't need any of those other features Audition has.

369
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:23,890
Scott: that makes it worth paying for.

370
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:31,070
Scott: So, anyway, Audition got acquired also by a company.

371
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,414
Rym: Yeah, Audition was cool at it.

372
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:36,606
Rym: Adobe bought it and then actually made it way better eventually.

373
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:37,489
Rym: Like, Audition...

374
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:38,954
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

375
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:41,283
Scott: No, I'm saying Audition.

376
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:44,375
Scott: What's the one where I... Audacity.

377
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,970
Scott: They almost start with Aud, right?

378
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,086
Rym: Well, I didn't want to mention Ardour.

379
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:49,771
Scott: Right.

380
00:22:49,791 --> 00:23:00,750
Scott: Well, Audacity got acquired by this some sort of group of some kind and they don't seem to be bad like the people who took over Freenode are bad.

381
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:09,950
Scott: And they're actually, there are people now who are, they are being paid full time employees to work on Audacity to improve it, right?

382
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:13,900
Scott: So, they're actually going to work on like its user interface and its other things.

383
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,850
Scott: You're going to see probably in the coming time period, years, who knows?

384
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,390
Scott: Audacity get more, better, faster than it has in the past.

385
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,112
Rym: Yep, I would hope so.

386
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:24,898
Rym: Because the GIMP never got better.

387
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,530
Rym: But Audacity I think is way more broadly used than the GIMP is.

388
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,792
Rym: But I digress.

389
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:37,189
Rym: So, Audacity looks like they tried to add some telemetry data collection to Audacity that you could opt in or out of.

390
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,460
Rym: Like, what do people do?

391
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,566
Rym: Like, what do people click on?

392
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,209
Rym: What are they trying to do?

393
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,750
Scott: So this is, you'll see this a lot in like almost all your apps, like, you know, send us anonymous usage data, checkbox, yes, no.

394
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,030
Scott: And what that is, is like it just records you in some, in maybe small or large ways with some amount of detail.

395
00:23:54,751 --> 00:24:00,710
Scott: Like what you use the app for, what features you use, what you don't use, but crash reports, all these sorts of things.

396
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:06,350
Scott: And usually most apps that have this have it on by default and you have to turn it off.

397
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:06,890
Scott: Yep.

398
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:14,930
Scott: So if you have, you know, you might think it doesn't matter, but actually that kind of matters a lot, especially for less popular apps.

399
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:20,290
Scott: That data they get really will inform the decisions they make during development.

400
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:29,410
Scott: If you turn it off for like, you know, your Apple apps or something, it's like, you know, okay, in some small way that might matter for your privacy or who knows.

401
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,189
Scott: But they have so many people who have it on that your data is just, you know, lost in the sea.

402
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:34,811
Rym: Yep.

403
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:43,470
Rym: And that's the kind of data that can tell them like, hey, this button that's prominently featured actually is not used by anyone or it's used by this one jerk.

404
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,714
Scott: Hey, we notice a pattern.

405
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,889
Scott: This crash keeps happening and all the people who have that crash have this exact GPU.

406
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:55,390
Scott: Then we need to get one of those GPUs to test with because clearly there's some, you know, right, something going on.

407
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,535
Rym: Now, what's fascinating is best I can tell.

408
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:03,630
Rym: the developers had planned to ship Audacity with the telemetry in it, but disabled by default.

409
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,549
Rym: So you could opt in.

410
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,031
Scott: Exactly.

411
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,014
Scott: Yes, they were doing it.

412
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:06,395
Scott: They're not.

413
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:07,359
Scott: They're being a good.

414
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,330
Scott: whoever is the new caretaker is doing it seems to be doing good.

415
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:13,338
Scott: They're like, listen, it's off by default.

416
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:17,810
Scott: Just only turn it on if you want to write to help us make Audacity better.

417
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,270
Scott: It's really anonymous.

418
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:24,790
Rym: The user base of Audacity flipped the fuck out about this to the point.

419
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:30,810
Scott: Well, the hardcore vocal user base of Audacity that was like involved in, you know, the Audacity community space.

420
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,830
Rym: The ones I mentioned earlier who do weird, bad things with Audacity.

421
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,550
Scott: The ones who are in the IRC and in the forums or whatever kind of slacks or channels that they have.

422
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,950
Rym: Like, I'm pretty sure these are the same.

423
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:47,810
Scott: Most of the Audacity users are people just making podcasts who are not involved in the Audacity community.

424
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:48,433
Rym: Yep.

425
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:51,690
Rym: But remember how I mentioned those are like the loudest users.

426
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:59,930
Rym: These are the same people who get mad that Audacity has the ability to update itself, like the kind of person who wants to install an old version of the application and keep using it forever.

427
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,850
Rym: Like, it's a weird subset of the usage of Audacity.

428
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:12,929
Rym: And I don't know for sure, but I strongly suspect those people are a big part of why Audacity still has a really bad UX.

429
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:23,010
Rym: But anyway, those people flipped out to the point that Audacity now will not include any telemetry, opted or otherwise.

430
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,635
Rym: Just nothing.

431
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,929
Rym: They're just getting rid of this whole idea.

432
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:36,970
Scott: Alright, so the people who took over are trying to be such do-gooders and trying to ingratiate themselves with the community so much that they bowed and will not make Audacity as better as they could.

433
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,291
Scott: Yep.

434
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:40,830
Rym: But it looks like those people were also mad about the auto-updater.

435
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,650
Rym: So Audacity will also now let you disable checking for updates and downloading new versions.

436
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:48,473
Scott: Okay.

437
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:49,638
Scott: Go right ahead.

438
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:51,726
Scott: if you want to disable new versions.

439
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:52,630
Scott: Be my guest.

440
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:00,070
Rym: It's just like desktop open source software never really has a good design.

441
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:10,710
Rym: This is a topic for another day, but the projects tend to only take feedback from people who will also write patches and contribute code.

442
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,313
Scott: Well, not even that.

443
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:14,581
Scott: You don't even have to write patches or contribute code.

444
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,190
Scott: You just have to be active in the community of the thing.

445
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:17,612
Scott: Yep.

446
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,688
Scott: But... Most of the users are not in the community of the software.

447
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,994
Rym: Well, that's it.

448
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:25,979
Rym: I use a web browser.

449
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,810
Rym: I'm not in the Chrome community.

450
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:31,110
Rym: I'm not like every day just chatting with other people.

451
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:39,930
Scott: Most of the Chrome, sometimes you have a piece of software where, you know, especially something like, you know, that's a developer tool, right?

452
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:44,865
Scott: And most of the people in the community are developers who are using that tool.

453
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:46,270
Scott: It's like a library or something.

454
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:51,050
Scott: But something like Chrome, almost all the users of Chrome are not in the Chrome community.

455
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,090
Scott: They just download, install, and use Chrome to browse the web, right?

456
00:27:54,691 --> 00:28:01,930
Scott: So they have to consider, and they do, that's why they have telemetry, so that they can consider what the actual users are doing with Chrome, right?

457
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,722
Scott: And Audacity, it's like, seems to be, you know, not learning that understanding that like 99.99% of your users have not commented, right?

458
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:23,815
Scott: You're allowing .001% of the users, the ones who care so much about Audacity that they hang out in the Audacity community, to run the show and impact.

459
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:32,270
Scott: the 99.99% of Audacity users who simply go to the Audacity website, download, install it, and never interact with any of the community whatsoever.

460
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:51,650
Rym: And I guess that's the broader point is that I feel like a lot of desktop open source software, especially if it's in the free open source software subset, like the people who also have ideological reasons for being involved, tend to greatly amplify a very small number of voices from a very narrow perspective in just all the decisions they make.

461
00:28:52,390 --> 00:29:10,807
Scott: Well, if you're in the 99.99% of the GeekNights community that just listens and never comments or forums or does anything, you're letting the .001% of the, you know, people who are weirdos who come and talk to us, you know, mess with our minds and influence what kind of GeekNights sausage is made.

462
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:12,210
Scott: So get on in here.

463
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,776
Rym: So in some other news, it's a minor thing.

464
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,181
Rym: Well, it's a small thing.

465
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:17,923
Rym: It's a minor news.

466
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,589
Rym: It's not allowed to say about it, but it's a good thing.

467
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:26,770
Rym: Spotify is adding a bunch of accessibility improvements on their iOS and Android apps around podcasts.

468
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:31,450
Rym: But the one in particular that I want to highlight is automatic podcast transcription.

469
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:35,880
Rym: Which is a moderately big deal because one, it's hard to do.

470
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,410
Rym: Two, most podcasts are amateurs who don't make money.

471
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,323
Rym: And if they actually like, even if they want to do transcriptions, they can't afford it.

472
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,910
Rym: Like, look at us, when we were doing, when we were poor and doing GeekNights.

473
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,773
Scott: We have a lot of money.

474
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:54,350
Scott: We could, we could afford it once in a while, but we could, I guess if we did way less podcasts, we could afford all the episodes.

475
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,370
Rym: But we were doing four hours of content a week for many years.

476
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,250
Scott: To do our archive would be prohibitive, right?

477
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,950
Rym: Yep.

478
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,294
Rym: It was a little bit prohibitive.

479
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:09,070
Rym: I was paying for Spanish subtitle translations for some of our panels a while back and professional transcriptions.

480
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:12,638
Rym: And it ended up adding to all, adding up to a lot of money.

481
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:17,330
Scott: And it covers, it's hard, it's hard time consuming work that someone deserves to be paid for.

482
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:17,871
Scott: Yeah.

483
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:18,192
Scott: Right.

484
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:24,590
Scott: And it's one thing to say, yeah, if you're a big company, you know, you know, a TV network, you have no excuse.

485
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,530
Scott: You better fucking translate that shit to every language known to humanity.

486
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,550
Rym: But if you're just like a hobbyist, not even making money off your thing.

487
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:36,530
Scott: It's like you want to make it accessible, but it's making it accessible is not accessible to someone who has no money.

488
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:40,950
Rym: That's part of why we started live streaming the podcast on YouTube.

489
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:50,970
Rym: It's not just because like there's 20 ish people who watch it on a regular basis, but also because it does make a pretty good transcription that is there for anyone who needs that.

490
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:55,890
Rym: But the fact that this is going to be embedded into the apps for podcasts specifically, kind of a big deal.

491
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:02,550
Rym: It really will open up the accessibility of podcasts to people who are hearing disabled in some way.

492
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:03,771
Scott: Yeah.

493
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:12,630
Scott: What I don't like, though, and you see this with Apple launching their subscription podcast today, right, on iTunes or whatever, or the podcast app, I guess.

494
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,372
Scott: I don't know.

495
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:21,390
Scott: Whatever is that the podcast used to be and they still mostly are technically on the bottom level, this open thing, right?

496
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:34,350
Scott: It's just someone's putting out this publicly accessible text file, you know, available on the Internet via HTTP within RSS format or Adam format that lists all where all the MP3 URLs in a big list.

497
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:35,194
Scott: Right.

498
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:37,206
Scott: With the names of the episodes next to each MP3 URL.

499
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:45,350
Scott: And then you can write software or by hand, you know, subscribe and keep an eye on that file and get all the new episodes.

500
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:53,690
Scott: And, you know, when, you know, we're available on all the platforms, we will always take our feed and just put it into any software that'll parse it.

501
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,493
Rym: It'll just work.

502
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:57,650
Scott: We will always have that raw feed available for you.

503
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,011
Scott: Right.

504
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:04,610
Scott: But other people, you know, their podcasts, you know, especially these sign up with like some, you know, they don't make a website for themselves.

505
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:12,210
Scott: They just sign up with like a podcast, you know, hosting site and they're on Spotify and all these, you know, they're getting onto these closed places.

506
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:16,669
Scott: And now, you know, maybe can't get the podcast so easily the old fashioned way.

507
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,371
Rym: Yep.

508
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:24,170
Rym: Especially because there's always this ebb and flow in podcasting in particular of trying to make money versus trying to expand audience.

509
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:30,630
Rym: And it's not like most people are like GeekNights where even if we didn't make any money at all, we just afford to run this because it's fun to make.

510
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:36,210
Rym: But this cycle right now is moving back into everyone's trying to monetize podcasts heavily.

511
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:37,072
Scott: Yeah.

512
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:40,490
Scott: I'm not liking the closed podcast ecosystem is all I'm saying.

513
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:41,832
Rym: Well, it's starting.

514
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:51,270
Rym: It's interesting because streaming like video game streamers and Twitch streamers in particular versus podcasters are starting to diverge in their strategies for monetization.

515
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:57,630
Rym: I don't think either one is going to work out in the long run, but I'm at least glad to see that there's some diversity in how they're doing it.

516
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:06,550
Rym: Because as much as I don't like closed ecosystems, I much prefer someone pays a content creator dollars to get content.

517
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:16,790
Rym: Rather than all these other like, well, we'll set up a complicated system of redistributing money from like advertising sales and aggregate and all these like indirect methods.

518
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,211
Scott: What about?

519
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:20,750
Scott: people have no money, though, and then now they can't, people have no money, can't get any content.

520
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,051
Scott: Yep.

521
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:29,450
Rym: But people who have no money could never get content until relatively recently when we started making free content by monetizing those people via advertising.

522
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,569
Scott: You mean for the past 50 years since someone pirated a cassette tape?

523
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,031
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:38,690
Rym: But I'm saying like all the broadcast TV only existed because the people watching were the actual product.

525
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,930
Rym: And that just created over time an increasingly toxic ecosystem.

526
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,950
Rym: Really, we just need some form of communism, but I digress.

527
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:48,889
Rym: Anyway, at least these subtitles would be pretty cool.

528
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:51,734
Rym: Hmm.

529
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:51,975
Rym: All right.

530
00:33:52,015 --> 00:33:52,598
Rym: Let's see.

531
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,468
Rym: Galaxy upcycling.

532
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:54,950
Rym: Right.

533
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,172
Scott: Okay.

534
00:33:56,192 --> 00:34:00,450
Scott: So long ago, you can see the story and I fix it to get all the details.

535
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:06,190
Scott: But long ago, Samsung Galaxy unveiled this plan to do this upcycling program.

536
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,489
Scott: The idea would be that like, hey, you got these old Samsung Galaxy phones.

537
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,310
Scott: We know you bought a new phone, right?

538
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,629
Scott: That old phone isn't really good enough to be your phone anymore because you can afford a new one.

539
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,360
Scott: There's a newer version of Android.

540
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,730
Scott: That one's running an old version.

541
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,762
Scott: You don't want to use it as your phone anymore.

542
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:22,748
Scott: We get you, right?

543
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:28,070
Scott: But, you know, maybe the screen's broken, but that is still a useful electronic device.

544
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:35,810
Scott: Somebody could use it in, you know, if they could only run any software they wanted on it instead of the phone software.

545
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:38,690
Scott: That is like a full computer, basically.

546
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,510
Rym: I mean, you know, I was just cleaning out a bunch of my closet space.

547
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,230
Rym: I have four perfectly functional old Android phones.

548
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:47,873
Scott: Yeah.

549
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:50,770
Scott: That's still a perfectly functioning computer, right?

550
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:59,530
Scott: And even though it might not be able to be good enough to be used as like your phone, because you live in New York and you have a lot of money, it could be used as a lot of things, right?

551
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,882
Scott: It could be the computer in some other device.

552
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,550
Scott: You know, who knows what, right?

553
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:12,210
Scott: So the idea was that they were going to be like, hey, you know, give us back all these old phones and we'll find companies that like have product ideas.

554
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:22,630
Scott: And those companies will just use old phones and the boards, chips, batteries, screens, whatever parts from those old phones in brand new devices, right?

555
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:29,450
Scott: And that will be totally, that's way better than fucking recycling or, you know, pretty much anything, right?

556
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:37,900
Scott: It's like, that's like the absolute best thing you can do in terms of environment, you know, environmental niceness when it comes to semiconductors, right?

557
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,750
Scott: It's like, just find a new use for it.

558
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,930
Scott: You know, you bought it, oh, you bought a brand new gaming computer.

559
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:48,650
Scott: Well, take your old gaming computer, which isn't good enough to run games anymore, and we'll use it as a computer in a dentist office.

560
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,391
Scott: Yeah.

561
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,088
Rym: Like look at how many people, like there was a lot, just take an old laptop, that's an HDPC.

562
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:53,470
Rym: It's great.

563
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:54,651
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:57,970
Scott: It's like, you know, just find, keep finding a way to make use of it, right?

565
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:08,570
Scott: So the thing is, is that because Samsung basically said, and they stopped talking about it.

566
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:09,132
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:12,870
Rym: It kind of just petered out to nothing and just disappeared.

568
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:14,332
Scott: Yeah.

569
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:18,570
Scott: And I fix it every time they try to talk to them about it, they just eventually stopped responding, right?

570
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:19,996
Scott: And it's like, oh, what happened?

571
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:30,170
Scott: Well, basically what happened is that like for-profit companies do, they decided it wouldn't be worth it or wouldn't make enough money, you know, to be worth it.

572
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,972
Scott: And they didn't do it.

573
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:39,703
Scott: And it's, you know, it seems to have disappeared or has surfaced in only the most, you know, bare, you know, minimal way.

574
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,768
Scott: that is not sufficient.

575
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:41,090
Scott: Right.

576
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,403
Scott: And it's kind of sad because it's like, hey, I think they're wrong.

577
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,888
Scott: I think it would make them a bunch of money.

578
00:36:49,291 --> 00:37:01,330
Scott: And because what would happen is the idea is that you just, they just need to release a thing, some sort of, you know, app or something that would allow anyone to, with an old enough phone, right?

579
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,308
Scott: Sort of just remove the OS and unlock it to allow anything to be installed on it.

580
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:06,790
Scott: Right.

581
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,085
Scott: Probably someone would just install Linux on it.

582
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:09,710
Scott: I imagine.

583
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:16,910
Rym: Because otherwise, if you want to just reuse an old Android phone, you probably have some like old, un-updateable, insecure version of Android.

584
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,416
Scott: And the Android is of Linux kernel.

585
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:22,689
Scott: So, you know, you just need to have the right drivers in that kernel and you're good to go.

586
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:29,529
Scott: You can run any software on it now then use its peripherals as long as, you know, if you have drivers for the different parts of it, you're good to go.

587
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,190
Scott: That's not too much work from Samsung, I imagine, right?

588
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:41,250
Scott: Not too much maintenance, but apparently it's, they think they wouldn't make enough money to pay for even that small token effort.

589
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:43,697
Scott: But actually, I think they're dead wrong.

590
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:48,130
Scott: If you did that, suddenly there would be a hot market for those old phones.

591
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,761
Scott: You know, whether they were used or new, right?

592
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,410
Scott: Maybe ones they couldn't sell, right?

593
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,850
Scott: It's like you had your overstock, right?

594
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,734
Rym: I mean, it's not just a computer.

595
00:37:56,794 --> 00:38:02,930
Rym: It's a computer with an embedded touchscreen, embedded battery, and between one and three cameras.

596
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:04,091
Scott: Yep.

597
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:29,370
Scott: And then, not only that, but people I think would be more likely, you know, especially if they were, you know, cool, to buy that phone knowing that when it was done with its life, that it would then be able to be unlocked at some point in the future when they upgraded to a new phone, that the old one would be useful as a generic computing device and wouldn't just sit in a drawer as an emergency backup like my old iPhone is, right?

598
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:41,189
Scott: I don't know if it would get me to switch, but if I had to suddenly buy a phone now and wasn't already an iPhone person, if that existed, that would really make me, you know, right?

599
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,714
Rym: Also, I wish it was easy.

600
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,550
Rym: Like, I have so many old Android phones just lying around.

601
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:53,729
Rym: And I always had this idea of, "Oh, why don't I leave them in the house to be like, just, I don't know, even a conversation piece or like a web browser for anyone who happens to be

602
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,970
Rym: over?".

603
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,710
Rym: Because back then, not everyone we knew even had a smartphone or a smartphone that was good.

604
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,162
Rym: Used them as remote controls, set them up as security cameras.

605
00:39:01,223 --> 00:39:03,010
Rym: I got all these cool ideas, but it was just too much.

606
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,329
Scott: All sorts of things you could do with one.

607
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,797
Rym: But it's just too much for me to ask.

608
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:08,029
Rym: Like, I booted one of the old ones up to see what was on it.

609
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,790
Rym: It's proprietary, locked down, and also doesn't really work anymore because it's so old.

610
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,333
Scott: Yep, exactly.

611
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:17,709
Scott: So, it's just a really disappointing story that Samsung didn't go through with it.

612
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,562
Scott: I'm in favor of a law force.

613
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:21,086
Scott: I'm going to do it.

614
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:21,570
Scott: The end.

615
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:33,180
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

616
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,145
Rym: So, you know, I like me a mashup.

617
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,440
Rym: And, uh, YouTube has also figured out that I like a mashup.

618
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,600
Rym: But it also knows that I like very particular kinds of mashups.

619
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,240
Rym: And it's starting to recommend to me relatively obscure ones that are great.

620
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:58,774
Rym: So, I submit to you a very well-made M&M Lose Yourself, but it's Mr.

621
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,878
Rym: Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra.

622
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:07,418
Rym: It is surprisingly well done, and I legitimately like this as a song.

623
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,026
Scott: There's a lot of those on YouTube.

624
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:16,500
Scott: You know, DJs, they find two songs that are far apart from each other, but have the same BPM or close to it, and they just go to town, right?

625
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,809
Rym: Yep, but there's this unquantifiable aspect.

626
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:26,159
Rym: I'm trying to think more about this now that I'm seeing a pattern of which ones of those I like and which ones I just find just tiresome to listen to.

627
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:32,859
Rym: And there's a very delicate line, and I'm trying to, like, articulate exactly what it is that makes one of these good for me.

628
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:34,907
Rym: I have not figured that out yet.

629
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:42,819
Rym: Neil Cicierega, like, tapped it straight to my soul, and this is one of the few I found that also triggers that impulse in me.

630
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,459
Scott: You gotta be in the right mouth mood.

631
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,969
Rym: Yeah, my mouth felt this one.

632
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,012
Rym: I lost myself.

633
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:49,337
Rym: Mom's spaghetti.

634
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:50,100
Rym: Anyway.

635
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:54,048
Scott: So, let's go back in time, right?

636
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:57,520
Scott: It's 1980-something, and you want to make an NES game, right?

637
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,292
Scott: So, today it's really easy to make an NES game.

638
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:02,576
Scott: You get your emulator, right?

639
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:03,540
Scott: You just get your compiler.

640
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,040
Scott: There's even tools to, like, there's NES Maker kind of things out there.

641
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,210
Scott: There's a Game Boy one, actually, on itch.io.

642
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,592
Scott: you can get.

643
00:41:10,612 --> 00:41:11,940
Scott: I forget what it's called.

644
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:16,920
Scott: Well, you can just make games really easily, and you just push File, Save, and it makes a ROM.

645
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,767
Scott: You load it in your emulator, and you play it.

646
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:19,993
Scott: You put it on your flash card.

647
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:20,737
Scott: You put it in your device.

648
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:21,139
Scott: You play it.

649
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,820
Scott: Super easy to develop, relatively speaking, games for old consoles.

650
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,431
Scott: What if you want to do it in the year 1980-something?

651
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:30,140
Scott: It's a lot harder, right?

652
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,068
Scott: Even if you have, like, the NES dev kit.

653
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,538
Scott: What, you think the NES dev kit was easy to use in 1980-something?

654
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,740
Rym: Yeah, you know what a big step was in the NES "dev kit" of that day?

655
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:46,020
Rym: Drawing your pixel art on graph paper, and then using specialized tools to input that data into a computer.

656
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,737
Scott: You didn't have fucking Visual Studio Code, right, in 1980-something.

657
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:51,146
Scott: So, how the fuck did you do it?

658
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:54,820
Scott: Well, one way you could have done it was the way this person does it in this video.

659
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,792
Scott: They've got an Apple IIe, and they set that shit up.

660
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,979
Scott: It's not even as good as my Apple IIgs, Apple IIe.

661
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:05,960
Scott: And they found a card on eBay that is an EEPROM writer.

662
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:17,180
Scott: So, what they can do is they can write a program on the Apple II, which sucks ass to do, and then compile it, assemble it, and burn it to an EEPROM.

663
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:28,180
Scott: And then they put the EEPROM over, they got a separate device that was, you know, that was from back in the day, that lets them copy the EEPROMs, right, and they got physical chips.

664
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,360
Scott: You put the chip in the card in the Apple II, you burn it, right?

665
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:42,800
Scott: You take it out, you put it in the other thing, you copy it, and then you put the chips into this NES cartridge that has two holes to put chips into, and you slap that into an NES, and now you can play the game.

666
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:58,112
Scott: And in the video, he goes through the whole process of, you know, making an NES game the way you might have had to make it in 1980-something if you had an Apple computer, or pretty much any computer.

667
00:42:58,132 --> 00:42:59,697
Scott: Like, what computer would you have then?

668
00:42:59,737 --> 00:43:00,540
Scott: that was better than that?

669
00:43:00,982 --> 00:43:04,317
Scott: It's like, that's the best computer you could have had in those days, right?

670
00:43:04,337 --> 00:43:04,980
Scott: What are you gonna have?

671
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,420
Scott: You know, so, programming was a pain in the ass then, is the reason we don't do it that way anymore.

672
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,560
Rym: You know, it's funny, there's a video just, like it just made the rounds.

673
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,180
Rym: Captain D is back, and he did a long dive into how they made Flight of the Navigator.

674
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:22,540
Scott: I did see the link to that, I didn't watch.

675
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,840
Rym: It's 45 minutes long, it's way in-depth and way good.

676
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,520
Rym: But I am glad that we live in an era where creator tools are much more accessible and easier to use.

677
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,794
Scott: Yeah, it's like, how to make Flight of the Navigator using Adobe Premiere and After Effects.

678
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:38,240
Scott: Oh, it will take you like a day.

679
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,420
Rym: Like, imagine trying to make something like a podcast or a radio show in the 70s compared to now.

680
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,509
Rym: Forget even, like, syndication, just recording it and editing it.

681
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:50,494
Rym: Old audio editing sucked.

682
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:51,797
Rym: Tapes sucked.

683
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:52,840
Rym: I hated tapes.

684
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,378
Rym: I never want to see a tape again in my life.

685
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:56,339
Scott: You have to cut film with a scissor.

686
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:06,820
Rym: Alright, in the meta moment, we're still mostly stuck at home, but there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel.

687
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,996
Rym: We're out doing stuff every now and then, bit by bit.

688
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:19,680
Scott: The book club book is still Genji Monogatari, The Tale of Genji, the first novel ever written by human beings.

689
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:22,129
Scott: The author of Murasaki Shikibu.

690
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,260
Scott: I read like three chapters yesterday, so we're moving along.

691
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:27,999
Rym: I think in June we're going to do an episode on it.

692
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,473
Scott: There's like 50-something chapters in total, I think, right?

693
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:33,200
Scott: So that's a significant portion.

694
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,391
Rym: I think July is the latest.

695
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:36,639
Rym: we will do an episode on it.

696
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:47,340
Scott: Yeah, so just in case anyone, you know, over the past year for some reason decided you're finally going to go for it, right?

697
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:51,770
Scott: We're reading like the unabridged translation.

698
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:54,938
Scott: Who's the person that translated it?

699
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,780
Scott: so you know it's the right one?

700
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,302
Rym: I'm looking to see.

701
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:59,334
Rym: You didn't actually say in the posting.

702
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:00,358
Rym: I was hoping it was there.

703
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:01,600
Scott: Oh.

704
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:04,080
Scott: But yeah, we'll say it next episode.

705
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,480
Rym: And of course, we have to read the best possible unabridged translation, and you didn't say what that translation was.

706
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,100
Rym: And there's a tiny image that is not big enough for me to read.

707
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:13,797
Rym: Wait, wait, I can click on "Purchase the

708
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:13,978
Rym: Book.".

709
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:17,073
Rym: "Tale of Genji Penguin Classics Deluxe

710
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:17,858
Rym: Edition.".

711
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,120
Rym: Uh, "Royale Tyler" is the translator.

712
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,722
Scott: That's the one.

713
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:30,460
Scott: The "Royale Tyler" translation is like, I did research when we chose this, that's like the one, right?

714
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:31,923
Rym: Oh yeah, there's a quote here.

715
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:37,039
Rym: "The world's first novel in a translation that is 'likely to be the definitive

716
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:37,240
Rym: edition.'".

717
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,780
Scott: Yes, that's, I'd say accurate.

718
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:45,660
Rym: Alright, so yeah, June to July, around then, we'll do the show on it.

719
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,059
Rym: So you can start reading it now, and you'll probably finish it around when we finish it.

720
00:45:51,540 --> 00:46:00,020
Rym: My only advice to you, I've said this before, don't stress about it like it's like middle school or high school, and try to like get every nuance of what's going on.

721
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:09,360
Rym: Just read it for entertainment, and if you're not 100% sure like exactly what happened, just keep powering and it usually becomes pretty clear later, and you don't have to sweat it that much.

722
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:17,400
Scott: I think one thing that people might not realize is that, you know, even if you were to get the original text of this book, right?

723
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,700
Scott: Even modern Japanese people couldn't read it, because it's like written in ancient Japanese, right?

724
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:27,596
Scott: So, you know, it would be like if you tried to read old English, right?

725
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:28,299
Scott: It's like, you can't.

726
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,630
Rym: Yeah, old English is not like, "I went to ye old

727
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:32,052
Rym: pub!".

728
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:34,620
Rym: It's like this German sounding nightmare.

729
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,122
Scott: Right, it's like.

730
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:37,607
Scott: it's not, it's not the same.

731
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:41,840
Scott: So, and it wasn't even translated into modern Japanese until like way later.

732
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:47,060
Scott: And it wasn't translated into English that we can understand until even later than that.

733
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,540
Scott: So, and that's why it's got its, you know, quirks, but we'll get there.

734
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,406
Rym: Yeah, otherwise follow us in all the places.

735
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:59,940
Rym: Stay tuned for what will likely be between one and three PAX Online panels.

736
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,074
Rym: And we'll see if any conventions happen toward the end of this year or not.

737
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:06,660
Rym: We're just kind of waiting to see how things go.

738
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:20,540
Rym: I think the con that has the best chance, not saying like this is certain or anything, the con that has the best chance of us being added in person that is soonest is probably PAX Unplugged in November.

739
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:25,760
Scott: Yeah, it's like PAX West seems like it has a non-zero chance of happening.

740
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,380
Scott: But it's getting too close to when it would happen to plan it.

741
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,318
Scott: Right, would I go to it?

742
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,228
Rym: Or could it be planned quickly enough?

743
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:37,620
Rym: Like there's a long lead time to get the game industry to show up to something.

744
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,468
Scott: If it did happen, would I like to go to it?

745
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:42,795
Scott: If it was safe, sure, right?

746
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:44,260
Scott: But can we make it happen?

747
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:55,853
Rym: Yup, there's a lot of things that could get in the way of it that are not, like it might be that COVID, it could be pretty safe to go by September, but that it was too late to know it would be safe in time to plan it.

748
00:47:56,014 --> 00:47:57,880
Rym: That's the kind of thing we can't control right now.

749
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,434
Scott: Or too expensive, right?

750
00:47:59,495 --> 00:47:59,980
Scott: Or who knows?

751
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,342
Rym: Yup, so we'll see.

752
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:08,380
Rym: My main rule is I'm not going to any con that requires masks or social distancing because if they require those things, it's still not safe.

753
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,228
Scott: Exactly.

754
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,933
Rym: If they don't require those things, that does not necessarily mean it is safe.

755
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:16,079
Rym: It's got to also be safe.

756
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,779
Rym: Looking at you, AnimeCon, I'm not going to name that happened like two months ago.

757
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,109
Scott: Right, it has to be so safe that reasonable, intelligent, good people have to be like, "You know what?

758
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,333
Scott: It's as safe as it was in 2018.

759
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:33,380
Scott: We don't need to worry about this pandemic, right?

760
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,124
Scott: We can just have our convention like we used to.

761
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:40,216
Scott: It can't be, "Oh, the pandemic's still going on, but fuck

762
00:48:40,257 --> 00:48:40,577
Scott: masks.".

763
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,018
Scott: It's like, "No, no,

764
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:41,119
Scott: no.".

765
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,143
Rym: Yup, so we'll see.

766
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,930
Rym: And maybe we'll record some stuff.

767
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:50,320
Rym: At some point, Scott and I can be together in the same room, which makes it a lot easier.

768
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,940
Scott: Yeah, that seems like it will be safer sooner.

769
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:01,588
Rym: Yeah, we're going to edge into outdoor meetings of friends and then figure out what to do from there.

770
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:07,394
Rym: We're going to take it slow, and I advise you, not that we are experts, to just take it slow.

771
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:08,615
Rym: Step by step.

772
00:49:08,776 --> 00:49:11,058
Rym: Don't just dive into licking door handles again.

773
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:14,943
Rym: Save that for 2022.

774
00:49:14,943 --> 00:49:15,860
Scott: And this is another one.

775
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,393
Rym: I think the earliest PAX you should lick doorknobs again.

776
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,240
Rym: is PAX Unplugged, maybe.

777
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:22,539
Scott: Who knows?

778
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,900
Rym: All right, so video cameras.

779
00:49:27,582 --> 00:49:30,385
Scott: Somehow we haven't done a show on any sort of camera anything.

780
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:31,307
Scott: I searched.

781
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:35,432
Scott: If anyone sees that we have and Rym deleted them or something, let me know.

782
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:36,473
Scott: But I searched our archive.

783
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:40,258
Scott: I didn't find any photo or video episodes, which seems really wrong.

784
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,740
Scott: I feel like we've definitely done some.

785
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:49,812
Rym: But we're going to focus just on video cameras, primarily post film.

786
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,156
Rym: We don't want to talk about Super 8 camcorders.

787
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:54,500
Rym: Those are cool, but one, that's a different show, and two.

788
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,160
Scott: Right.

789
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,582
Scott: I mean, you know, back in the day, there were film cameras.

790
00:49:57,722 --> 00:50:03,447
Scott: You had a big roll of film, spun it through really fast, you know, expose and those would be a little spinner.

791
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:06,930
Scott: So each was in perfect synchronization with the frames going through.

792
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:12,014
Scott: And it would expose, you know, frames at some rate, usually 24 times a second.

793
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:13,795
Scott: The light would come through the hole, hit the film.

794
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:17,718
Scott: You take a lot of pictures real fast, and then you needed to develop it.

795
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:20,160
Scott: And then you needed a projector to watch it.

796
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:20,700
Scott: Right.

797
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:28,185
Rym: But there were basically two main types of video recording or not even recording in many cases, devices.

798
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:33,689
Rym: You either recorded on film and then you had to project it to play it back into anything.

799
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:40,994
Rym: Or you had a digital like a digital or analog modern electronic video camera.

800
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:45,677
Rym: I'm choosing a lot of vague words because there is a variety of technology that was involved in this.

801
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:49,860
Rym: But the key thing, you know, early video cameras could not record.

802
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,340
Rym: They could only capture and immediately broadcast somewhere.

803
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,180
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,581
Scott: People don't think about this too much.

805
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:56,821
Scott: Right.

806
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:59,864
Scott: But it's like, you know, you look at, say, old movies.

807
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:00,845
Scott: Right.

808
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,466
Scott: Like a movie from the 50s.

809
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:02,866
Scott: Right.

810
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:04,087
Scott: What's a movie from the 50s?

811
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,769
Scott: What, Seven Samurai or something?

812
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,069
Scott: Right.

813
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,630
Scott: You know, Alfred Hitchcock, something like that.

814
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:09,852
Scott: And then look at TV from the 50s.

815
00:51:10,372 --> 00:51:12,694
Scott: It's complete garbage, basically.

816
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:12,995
Scott: Right.

817
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:16,217
Scott: And why is the TV from the 50s garbage?

818
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:18,619
Scott: The TV from the 50s wasn't on fucking film.

819
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,580
Scott: Right.

820
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,906
Scott: They didn't develop the television program on film and then play it back.

821
00:51:27,006 --> 00:51:28,647
Scott: Like, you know, that's not how it was done.

822
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,008
Scott: They had a TV camera.

823
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:30,569
Scott: Right.

824
00:51:30,689 --> 00:51:32,390
Scott: An enormous monstrosity.

825
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:33,051
Scott: Right.

826
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:38,215
Scott: That basically was kind of like a radio, but for vision.

827
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:38,755
Scott: Right.

828
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:44,400
Scott: The same way, you know, it was like instead of having a microphone that then would go to an antenna and broadcast radio signals.

829
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:54,848
Scott: The television camera in those days would basically see, and I'm not explaining in detail how it works, but, you know, and then broadcast radio signals live.

830
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:55,549
Scott: Right.

831
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:56,750
Scott: Of whatever it was seeing.

832
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,293
Scott: And your antenna would pick it up and you watched it live on television.

833
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:02,214
Scott: the same way you listen to radio live.

834
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:05,617
Rym: Like early television didn't have the concept of reruns.

835
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,879
Rym: It was a one time broadcast and it's gone.

836
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,040
Scott: Yeah.

837
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,842
Scott: And if there was a recording.

838
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:11,462
Scott: Right.

839
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:15,285
Scott: The recording would be similar to recording the radio.

840
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:15,566
Scott: Right.

841
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:19,809
Scott: There's an analog signal going out the antenna to play back the TV program.

842
00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:22,972
Scott: You need to play back that same analog radio signal.

843
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:25,834
Scott: You could record it to a magnetic analog tape.

844
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:26,635
Scott: Right.

845
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:29,998
Scott: You know, a big reel to reel magnetic tape is what you could record it.

846
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:32,540
Rym: But that tape was storing analog signals.

847
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:33,661
Scott: Yeah.

848
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:37,004
Scott: It wasn't storing, you know, like film, actual images.

849
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:37,705
Scott: Right.

850
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:42,689
Scott: It was storing, you know, just an analog recording and then you could play it back to broadcast again.

851
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:48,175
Rym: Meaning it was limited to whatever standard and NTSC came way later than some of that early stuff.

852
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:49,216
Scott: Yeah.

853
00:52:49,356 --> 00:52:53,920
Scott: So, you know, those early video cameras were, eh.

854
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,301
Rym: Yeah.

855
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:57,583
Rym: And to really drive this home.

856
00:52:57,643 --> 00:53:02,047
Scott: Film was the king of quality for even, probably even very close to today.

857
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,208
Rym: That's why some TV shows.

858
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:04,269
Scott: Arguably still today.

859
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:12,776
Rym: Like some old TV shows, even things from like the 90s, look great if you get a remastered version because they were actually originally recorded on film.

860
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:17,960
Rym: So they could just re-scan that film to a higher quality modern digital format.

861
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,621
Scott: Yeah.

862
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,982
Scott: You watch some fucking Snow White.

863
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:21,763
Scott: It's like, yeah, it was on film.

864
00:53:21,943 --> 00:53:22,263
Scott: Right.

865
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:29,289
Rym: But then you had some shows that were recorded with TV cameras, meaning NTSC is literally the best quality signal you ever got.

866
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:31,231
Rym: There's no master film anywhere.

867
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:31,731
Rym: There's nothing.

868
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:32,532
Scott: Right.

869
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:36,995
Scott: And that was true up until like, you know, maybe you watched like in the 80s or 90s.

870
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:39,597
Rym: Star Trek Voyager would like, there was no film there.

871
00:53:39,638 --> 00:53:42,680
Rym: That's why Voyager looks like shit compared to TNG that was recorded earlier.

872
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:43,881
Scott: Yeah.

873
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:48,068
Scott: It's like Voyager was not filmed on film like it was a movie.

874
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:49,370
Scott: It was a TV program.

875
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:49,731
Scott: Right.

876
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,634
Scott: It was recorded to tapes, you know.

877
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:52,436
Scott: Right.

878
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:54,720
Scott: Better than VHS tapes, but still just tapes.

879
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,521
Rym: Yeah.

880
00:53:56,661 --> 00:53:58,702
Rym: So, yeah, we got past all that.

881
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:21,020
Rym: And what we really want to focus on is the era of not really camcorders, but video cameras that were accessible to people, even if it was just professionals who are not only at mega studios and news broadcasts, like the super big iron studio stuff, because that could be a whole show on its own that we're also not that versed in because it's all arcade dead technology.

882
00:54:21,821 --> 00:54:31,810
Scott: Fun note, though, you can go like on eBay and other places and buy old studio TV equipment that was pre, you know, digital era.

883
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:38,015
Scott: And some of it is useless, but some of it like this lens is like a lens from an old TV camera.

884
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:41,598
Scott: You know, it's like, hey, yeah, nothing wrong with that.

885
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:41,819
Scott: Right.

886
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,160
Scott: You can slap that on something newer.

887
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:43,440
Scott: Right.

888
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,083
Rym: I mean, that old VHS camcorder I had, like, of course, had a shit sensor and all.

889
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:50,306
Rym: it had a lot of problems, but it had a really good lens in it.

890
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:51,407
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:56,071
Scott: It's like, you know, some of that old stuff has all been thrown out and is going for cheap because people don't need it anymore.

892
00:54:56,091 --> 00:54:57,833
Scott: They've got newer, better stuff.

893
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:58,133
Scott: Yeah.

894
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:02,617
Rym: But like one last point isn't necessarily bad to really drive home.

895
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,038
Scott: Like how much cycle it.

896
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:05,640
Rym: A lot of old TV.

897
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:13,028
Rym: If there's indoor scenes on a set, they were recorded using a TV camera like did like video camera.

898
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:23,240
Rym: And if there were outdoors or on location, they use film because the NTSC or TV cameras were too big and hard wired to be brought anywhere.

899
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:24,101
Scott: Yeah.

900
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:24,903
Scott: Depending on the year.

901
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:25,163
Scott: Right.

902
00:55:25,203 --> 00:55:28,449
Scott: Eventually you had the, you know, the sort of like news broadcast truck stuff.

903
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:28,730
Scott: Right.

904
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,895
Scott: Where, you know, you get that big the van with the dish on the roof.

905
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:32,637
Scott: They still have those.

906
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:33,478
Scott: Obviously they're much.

907
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:34,420
Scott: they're much different now.

908
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,603
Rym: Also, that's a mostly just digital pipeline.

909
00:55:37,444 --> 00:55:37,624
Scott: Right.

910
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:41,550
Scott: But, you know, you used to have 80s, 90s, you know, even 70s, you know, they had the camera.

911
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,734
Scott: that is like big ass thing they put over their shoulder.

912
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:43,854
Scott: Right.

913
00:55:44,034 --> 00:55:47,840
Scott: You get the camera guy with the person with the microphone doing the news report on the street.

914
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,401
Scott: Yeah.

915
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:50,823
Rym: You know, nowadays, most people use a running.

916
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:55,688
Rym: Actually, the camcorder I got is one of the most popular ones for like local news run and gun.

917
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:57,129
Scott: Yeah.

918
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:07,280
Rym: So in terms of like people having digital video cameras outside of this professional settings, like digital ones that recorded to a file of some kind.

919
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:10,384
Rym: Those are actually pretty new.

920
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:15,309
Rym: And ones that were good are scarily new.

921
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,031
Rym: Like they're a recent thing.

922
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:24,520
Rym: During the run of GeekNights, there were not good digital cameras that were affordable for normal people for video.

923
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:24,861
Scott: Yeah.

924
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:27,705
Scott: I mean, you had the ones that recorded to VHS or Betamax.

925
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:28,446
Scott: Right.

926
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:31,651
Scott: All kinds of different tapes, like little tape that goes inside the big tape.

927
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:32,192
Scott: Yes.

928
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:33,093
Scott: Right.

929
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:37,220
Scott: And those are basically just shittier versions of the TV ones that you would use.

930
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:52,597
Scott: And then the first ones, video cameras that were digital, that's like, I don't even know what the first consumer one was, but like they would record and these crappy codex like AA, like what was it called?

931
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,999
Scott: Like ABC or whatever.

932
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:54,540
Scott: Right.

933
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,341
Rym: AVCHD.

934
00:56:55,441 --> 00:56:56,542
Rym: Is that what you're thinking of?

935
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:57,203
Scott: Yeah.

936
00:56:57,223 --> 00:57:11,500
Scott: The encoding chips that would translate the raw signal from the digital camera sensor to a video file, they had to be able to do it fast enough at whatever frame rate there was.

937
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,407
Rym: And it's not like nowadays, like you would stream on OBS.

938
00:57:14,787 --> 00:57:20,040
Rym: Look at how many resources encoding live video uses, even today.

939
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,600
Scott: Right.

940
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,584
Scott: So you have some device that has to be small enough and someone's holding it.

941
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:24,665
Scott: It's a camera.

942
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:26,407
Scott: It's got a sensor, right?

943
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:27,328
Scott: It's got a lens.

944
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:29,671
Scott: It's got all this focusing, all this stuff going on.

945
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:35,798
Scott: And it needs, it's got a battery and it needs to be able to take all the video data that's coming in from the sensor, right?

946
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:37,380
Scott: Without overheating the sensor or anything.

947
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,224
Scott: And write to a file, right?

948
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:45,831
Scott: The frame, the full, however resolution it is 24 times a second, 30 times a second.

949
00:57:46,032 --> 00:57:46,272
Scott: Right.

950
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:51,799
Scott: And then if it fails, you don't want the file to just, or if it runs out of battery, you don't want the file to be broken.

951
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,380
Scott: Right.

952
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,086
Scott: You need that person wants all the video that they recorded.

953
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:55,367
Scott: Right.

954
00:57:55,387 --> 00:58:00,820
Scott: It would be upsetting if like you recorded until the battery died and then your file was, you recorded actually nothing.

955
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:14,677
Scott: Um, so yeah, there were five, there were file formats that were like, you know, basically highly compressed, lost, very lossy, like you'd like, there was this early era, you could buy these cameras that were like record at 720 P 60.

956
00:58:14,677 --> 00:58:15,277
Rym: Like, yeah, cool.

957
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:25,020
Rym: Uh, but each individual frame, like what that video looked like, uh, I think the industry term for what it looked like was dog shit.

958
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,201
Scott: Yeah.

959
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:28,443
Scott: You, it would throw away a lot of the color data.

960
00:58:28,563 --> 00:58:32,268
Rym: It's like early MP3s, like those 64 Kbps MP3s you'd listen to.

961
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:34,470
Rym: It was like that for video, right?

962
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,593
Scott: It's like we had higher quality video files.

963
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,956
Scott: Your computer could play them back, right?

964
00:58:38,976 --> 00:58:42,480
Scott: Cause playing back is actually less CPU intensive than recording.

965
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:52,752
Scott: But you know, it's like you could have, you could, we could even encode them, no problem, but we do have to be able to encode them in real time.

966
00:58:53,092 --> 00:59:00,040
Scott: If you're recording at 30 frames a second, you need to write to the hard drive 30, all 30 frames right within a second or you start buffering.

967
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,421
Scott: Yeah.

968
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:00,621
Scott: Right.

969
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,623
Scott: You start piling up.

970
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:06,354
Scott: It's like, okay, well there's more frames coming in that we're holding in Ram that we haven't written to the hard drive yet.

971
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:09,200
Scott: And if that Ram fills up, well now you can't record anything.

972
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:15,150
Rym: Also Ram eats power and cameras are usually portable and not plugged into anything.

973
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:21,060
Rym: So the more buffer space you have, the less battery you have and the less you could even record in the first place.

974
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:29,751
Scott: So there were all kinds of cameras for quite a while that could record video digitally that consumers could buy, but the quality was really low.

975
00:59:29,912 --> 00:59:36,180
Scott: Even if that same camera could like record really great photos, you know, at a high resolution sensor or something.

976
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,105
Rym: And it was this confluence of the storage.

977
00:59:38,165 --> 00:59:39,528
Scott: The storage wasn't fast enough.

978
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:40,992
Scott: The encoder wasn't fast enough.

979
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,155
Scott: The power wasn't high enough.

980
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,380
Scott: The quality was bad.

981
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,700
Rym: Yep.

982
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,341
Rym: I think we did.

983
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,844
Rym: We had, we did a show on Codex back in like 2006.

984
00:59:47,844 --> 00:59:50,426
Rym: We'll see how that was like.

985
00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:54,650
Rym: Cause that's actually the era when the camera I'm about to talk about came out.

986
00:59:55,131 --> 01:00:03,980
Rym: But in those days, like so many things have changed, but if you had to boil it down, one batteries got more powerful, like battery technology got better.

987
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,781
Scott: The lithium ion batteries became way better.

988
01:00:05,821 --> 01:00:06,041
Scott: Yep.

989
01:00:06,362 --> 01:00:11,205
Rym: Two portable general purpose computing got better.

990
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:15,108
Rym: It wasn't that dedicated chips got better to do this for most purposes.

991
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:26,816
Rym: It was that general purpose chips became power, like economical enough and also economical economical enough to embed in these devices to be able to see.

992
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:33,120
Scott: people don't think that when you buy a digital camera, you're not thinking about the CPU in a digital camera cause they don't really advertise what CPU is in there.

993
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,101
Scott: But guess what?

994
01:00:34,141 --> 01:00:35,381
Scott: There's CPU's in there.

995
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:37,443
Scott: There's video encoding chips in there, right?

996
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:40,605
Scott: And they're way more powerful on the newer cameras than they are on the older ones.

997
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:41,686
Scott: And it matters a lot.

998
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:42,206
Rym: Yep.

999
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:44,808
Rym: And then you also had the problem of Codex.

1000
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:49,991
Rym: The way you encode video have evolved a lot since then.

1001
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:53,934
Rym: Like early Codex had huge problems with editability.

1002
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:55,295
Rym: There used to be this big problem.

1003
01:00:55,335 --> 01:01:02,860
Rym: We ran into it where even if you had a fancy digital camera that could record video, good fucking luck.

1004
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,907
Rym: Doing anything other than playing that video back, try to import it into video editing software.

1005
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:16,440
Rym: Not that there was even that much worthwhile video editing software for consumers in the year of our Lord 2006, but usually wouldn't even work.

1006
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,004
Rym: Like we had a flip camera.

1007
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:22,247
Rym: I spent a lot of money on this thing for GeekNights.

1008
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:24,089
Rym: This thing was handheld.

1009
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,972
Rym: It could record a couple hours of 720p video.

1010
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:33,620
Rym: It was one of the earlier adopters of H.264 and AAC audio, like MP4 file formats.

1011
01:01:34,421 --> 01:01:41,545
Rym: And the video it outputted was so... I'm trying to think how to describe this without getting too jargony.

1012
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:45,808
Rym: It would slew so much and the timing was so off.

1013
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:47,089
Rym: Like it encoded badly.

1014
01:01:47,149 --> 01:01:51,672
Rym: It made a barely formed, probably actually incorrect file.

1015
01:01:52,072 --> 01:01:58,757
Rym: And if you try to import that file into video editing software, you get a ton of artifacts and frame drops and ugly broken frames.

1016
01:01:58,817 --> 01:02:00,678
Rym: Sometimes things would just crash on you.

1017
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,300
Rym: Like video was not very interoperable back then.

1018
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,703
Scott: Nope.

1019
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:06,945
Scott: And the other thing is the storage.

1020
01:02:07,326 --> 01:02:08,628
Scott: Video takes up a lot of space.

1021
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:13,956
Scott: You're taking 24, 30 photos a second, even if you're compressing them and they're low resolution.

1022
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:16,180
Scott: That's going to fill up your storage real fast.

1023
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:27,855
Scott: You know, so, you know, nowadays you can get 128, 256, you know, and even the ultra pro storage on like, you know, pro video cameras.

1024
01:02:27,895 --> 01:02:31,179
Scott: these days, they're just slapping SSDs right into the video camera directly.

1025
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:31,560
Scott: Right.

1026
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,382
Scott: But back in the day, what do you have?

1027
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:38,173
Scott: a compact flash card of, you know, one, you know, a few megabytes on an SD card.

1028
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:38,494
Scott: Right.

1029
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,097
Scott: It's not like today where an SD card holds.

1030
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:41,160
Scott: it holds a crap ton.

1031
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:41,440
Scott: Right.

1032
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,504
Scott: Well, gigabytes and SD cards then were slow.

1033
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:54,073
Scott: So even if it could hold all the video, you you had to be able to write 30, 24 to 30 frames per second to it.

1034
01:02:54,494 --> 01:03:00,780
Scott: Otherwise, again, buffering, you're you're filling up your RAM with with frames that haven't yet been written to the SD card.

1035
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:08,720
Scott: The SD card, whatever your storage is, needs to be fast enough that you can slam the frames onto it as fast as, you know, they're coming in the thing.

1036
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,724
Rym: So before you say, oh, just use an SSD.

1037
01:03:10,784 --> 01:03:13,349
Rym: Those didn't exist in a consumer form.

1038
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:18,498
Rym: Like my first SSD was 16 gigabytes and I paid like 400 bucks for it.

1039
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:19,460
Scott: Yeah.

1040
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:23,319
Rym: And I was glad to pay such a cheap price for an SSD.

1041
01:03:24,281 --> 01:03:30,300
Scott: So the Sony I remember the Sony camcorder we bought in the late 2000s had like an actual just it had like a laptop hard drive.

1042
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,806
Rym: Spinning magnetic disk was just in it.

1043
01:03:32,966 --> 01:03:35,251
Scott: It had a two and a half inch laptop hard drive.

1044
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:37,396
Scott: You couldn't take it out or anything, but like that was a fact.

1045
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,100
Scott: You could tell that was what was in there.

1046
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:39,481
Rym: Yeah.

1047
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:44,494
Rym: You could even feel it spin up when you started like it might have been 64 or 128 gigs.

1048
01:03:44,514 --> 01:03:47,161
Scott: I don't remember exactly how big maybe only 32.

1049
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:48,904
Scott: I remember exactly how big it was.

1050
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:56,760
Rym: I gave the main gig nice camcorder that we've recorded most of our panels with, which was generate one generation better than the camera you're describing.

1051
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,730
Rym: I think it had a 32 gigabyte laptop drive.

1052
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,593
Rym: I gave it to the cold guy.

1053
01:04:00,613 --> 01:04:02,220
Scott: This camera wasn't HD.

1054
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:06,951
Scott: It was just SD, you know, three, you know, three to aspect ratio.

1055
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:07,472
Scott: Right.

1056
01:04:07,492 --> 01:04:08,675
Scott: TV aspect ratio.

1057
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:10,460
Rym: But even worse, you want to get video off of that thing.

1058
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:11,221
Rym: All right.

1059
01:04:11,702 --> 01:04:14,567
Rym: One, it's going to be highly compressed because it can't record.

1060
01:04:14,648 --> 01:04:14,868
Scott: Yeah.

1061
01:04:14,948 --> 01:04:19,316
Scott: You plugged it in with a USB cable to a computer, USB to and you waited.

1062
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:21,119
Rym: It took a while to get a file.

1063
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,663
Scott: I think it did have an SD slot.

1064
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:24,465
Scott: I don't remember.

1065
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:27,470
Scott: I know you could definitely take still photos to the SD.

1066
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:33,160
Rym: I don't remember if you could record video to the one I had one generation newer than yours could record to the SD slots.

1067
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,987
Rym: But back then, you were lucky to have like a one gigabyte SD card.

1068
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:38,809
Scott: Yeah.

1069
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:41,653
Scott: This is only, you know, 10 less than 20 years ago.

1070
01:04:41,713 --> 01:04:41,893
Scott: Right.

1071
01:04:41,973 --> 01:04:45,940
Scott: And even then DSLRs at the time, just still photo digital cameras.

1072
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,260
Scott: Right.

1073
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:49,164
Scott: They didn't have SD cards.

1074
01:04:49,224 --> 01:04:56,100
Rym: They had compact flash cards in those those days for a lot of reasons, partly because back then, compact flash was faster for writing.

1075
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:59,367
Scott: Yeah, but compact flash wasn't going to hold up for video.

1076
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:00,249
Scott: No, I don't think I've ever.

1077
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:01,812
Scott: I don't think I've ever seen a video.

1078
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:04,558
Scott: There might be one, but I've never seen a video camera.

1079
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:05,480
Scott: that's a compact flash.

1080
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:07,401
Rym: Yeah.

1081
01:05:07,521 --> 01:05:08,983
Rym: I'm just thinking back to all the cameras I've owned.

1082
01:05:09,263 --> 01:05:15,813
Rym: But so the era we live in now is so great for video.

1083
01:05:15,873 --> 01:05:17,175
Rym: You have so many options.

1084
01:05:18,016 --> 01:05:20,039
Scott: Your phone is amazing.

1085
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:20,300
Scott: Yeah.

1086
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:20,580
Scott: Right.

1087
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:30,898
Rym: I don't understand how hard it was to record a GeekNights panel in the year like 2008 and like how much shit we went through to have those early videos up.

1088
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:31,940
Rym: That was a nightmare.

1089
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:37,529
Rym: Nowadays, we both have to like 4K cameras on our phones and our pockets.

1090
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,992
Rym: I have a pile of cameras.

1091
01:05:39,032 --> 01:05:40,234
Scott: I'm not even the old go.

1092
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,376
Scott: I have a GoPro five.

1093
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,760
Scott: I think the current GoPro is like, what, nine or something?

1094
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:45,343
Rym: I got it right in front of me.

1095
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:49,409
Rym: This it doesn't say it's a GoPro is the GoPro.

1096
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:50,852
Scott: So that they're at least on eight.

1097
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:51,473
Scott: Right.

1098
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:53,556
Scott: My GoPro five can do 4K 60.

1099
01:05:53,556 --> 01:05:53,837
Scott: Right.

1100
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,361
Rym: Yeah.

1101
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:57,443
Rym: I think this one can do 4K.

1102
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:58,605
Scott: Oh, no, there is.

1103
01:05:58,645 --> 01:05:59,908
Scott: There is a GoPro nine now.

1104
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:00,268
Rym: What?

1105
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:01,892
Rym: That must have just come out because I just bought.

1106
01:06:02,112 --> 01:06:03,354
Rym: No, I didn't just buy the aid.

1107
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,379
Rym: It's COVID fucked up my sense of time.

1108
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:06,120
Scott: Never mind.

1109
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,686
Scott: There's a GoPro nine now, but yeah, my GoPro five can do 4K 60.

1110
01:06:09,686 --> 01:06:11,349
Scott: So there's four newer GoPros.

1111
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:13,552
Scott: It's gotten four increments better.

1112
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:18,120
Scott: So yeah, we're at the point where it's like, yeah.

1113
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:18,420
Scott: Okay.

1114
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:27,000
Scott: The old cameras have, you know, video, digital video cameras for consumers have gotten way better in a short amount of time, but it's still a long enough amount of time.

1115
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,388
Scott: You can buy something five, six, seven years old, just not 10, 15 years old.

1116
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:33,753
Scott: And it will be amazing and cheap.

1117
01:06:34,113 --> 01:06:37,339
Scott: And that's and the new stuff will just fucking blow your mind if you can afford it.

1118
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:37,760
Scott: Right.

1119
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,462
Rym: So where are we now?

1120
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:41,306
Rym: There's basically there's four.

1121
01:06:41,386 --> 01:06:45,374
Rym: I'd say there's four like rough ways to go, depending on what kind of video you want to get.

1122
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:47,318
Rym: One way is seriously, just your phone.

1123
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,080
Rym: It's probably fine.

1124
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:52,868
Scott: Like phone, 90 percent of people, the phone camera is better than if you're.

1125
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:59,520
Scott: it's like the phone camera is going to be better than anything unless you spend a ton of money and learn a lot about video.

1126
01:06:59,881 --> 01:07:02,608
Scott: So why, Bob, unless you're super serious, don't bother.

1127
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:03,269
Scott: Just use your phone.

1128
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:03,650
Rym: Yep.

1129
01:07:04,111 --> 01:07:04,953
Rym: That's the other thing.

1130
01:07:05,074 --> 01:07:06,798
Scott: I'm famous on TikTok with just your phone.

1131
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:07,620
Scott: You don't need anything else.

1132
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:15,733
Rym: The second sort of thread are the hyper portable, durable GoPro and GoPro adjacent type cameras, which are used for a variety of purposes.

1133
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:17,796
Scott: Mostly those are used.

1134
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:18,297
Scott: They're not.

1135
01:07:18,337 --> 01:07:20,520
Scott: that GoPro isn't that much better than a phone.

1136
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:31,420
Scott: Honestly, the advantage of the GoPro is really that it's you know, you don't want to strap your phone to the front of your bicycle or bring it in the ocean or put it on the front of your snowboard or whatever else.

1137
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,283
Scott: Surfing, which is what a GoPro was originally made for.

1138
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:34,984
Scott: Right.

1139
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:36,907
Scott: Because you'll fucking break it.

1140
01:07:37,288 --> 01:07:37,468
Rym: Yeah.

1141
01:07:37,869 --> 01:07:41,234
Rym: But also, my GoPro can just take SD cards like my phone really can't.

1142
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:44,078
Rym: Well, my phone can actually, but that's because I have a weird phone.

1143
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:45,380
Rym: Most phones don't.

1144
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,382
Scott: My phone can.

1145
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:47,063
Scott: I have a dongle.

1146
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,165
Scott: That's how iPhones do.

1147
01:07:48,385 --> 01:07:48,526
Rym: Yeah.

1148
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:51,251
Rym: You're not going to have a dongle plugged into it while it's strapped to your chest.

1149
01:07:51,812 --> 01:07:55,018
Scott: No, you record to it and then you transfer it to the SD card.

1150
01:07:55,098 --> 01:07:56,220
Scott: afterwards is how it works.

1151
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,662
Rym: I want to record one long video.

1152
01:07:57,943 --> 01:08:02,230
Rym: But anyway, if you're doing like a lot of people are doing it, but pay for a phone with more space inside.

1153
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,271
Rym: Yeah, it won't be enough.

1154
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:06,076
Scott: The iPhones come with like a terabyte.

1155
01:08:06,096 --> 01:08:06,917
Scott: You can get big ones.

1156
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:08,540
Rym: Yeah, I could fill it anyway.

1157
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,842
Rym: I guess the other.

1158
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:19,140
Rym: But the GoPro type cameras, a big use of them is people who want to live stream or make like a mini studio of some kind in an apartment or a house.

1159
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:24,270
Rym: You can just buy like three or four of those things and use them as a big multi camera set up.

1160
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:25,774
Rym: They're pretty fucking good.

1161
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:27,138
Rym: Not that expensive.

1162
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,080
Rym: Really easy to use.

1163
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,323
Rym: The third the third and fourth way to go.

1164
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:33,804
Rym: really it's four factor.

1165
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:47,240
Rym: like DSLRs like photo cameras tend to be fantastic video cameras because they tend to have way bigger and better sensors than a lot of even professional video cameras have.

1166
01:08:47,921 --> 01:08:49,363
Scott: So people don't realize this, right?

1167
01:08:49,403 --> 01:09:03,020
Scott: So the first, you know, digital camera DSLR basically that was also a video camera was like the Nikon D 90 I guess something like D something and it came out like 2008.

1168
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,140
Scott: Right.

1169
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:08,611
Scott: So now it just seems like normal that you're using like a digital photo camera to make video.

1170
01:09:08,651 --> 01:09:09,693
Scott: It's a dual purpose thing.

1171
01:09:09,773 --> 01:09:12,238
Scott: But that is not that old development.

1172
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:12,679
Scott: Only 13 years old.

1173
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:13,661
Rym: Yeah.

1174
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:18,439
Rym: Well, like my DX one can not output video on its HDMI port.

1175
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:27,312
Scott: And that original Nikon, I think it could only do like 720 P 30 and didn't do a great job of it.

1176
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:33,359
Scott: So since then, now, of course, you know, you can get four K sometimes even more than that.

1177
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:33,781
Scott: Right.

1178
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,585
Scott: And because a digital still camera.

1179
01:09:36,746 --> 01:09:37,305
Scott: That's right.

1180
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:45,200
Scott: You know, the DSLRs with the lenses and everything or now now that have mirrors, now they're just, you know, digital lens, mirrorless cameras.

1181
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:45,380
Scott: Right.

1182
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:49,627
Scott: Like the one I have, you know, they're meant for still photos primarily.

1183
01:09:49,688 --> 01:09:51,792
Scott: The sensors are big, right?

1184
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:52,974
Scott: Usually a video camera.

1185
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,020
Scott: The sensor is tiny, like a one inch sensor or smaller.

1186
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:56,260
Scott: Yep.

1187
01:09:57,262 --> 01:10:01,630
Rym: That giant fancy camcorder you probably saw when I was tweeting about a thing that we were working on the other day.

1188
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:07,580
Rym: That sensor is tiny compared to the sensor in even like my Lumix GX one.

1189
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:08,481
Scott: Right.

1190
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:10,765
Scott: Your phone sensor is even smaller than that.

1191
01:10:10,825 --> 01:10:12,648
Scott: And look at the phone sensor can do.

1192
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:14,271
Scott: But when you get a bigger sensor.

1193
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:14,792
Scott: Right.

1194
01:10:15,113 --> 01:10:16,275
Scott: It's like having bigger film.

1195
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:17,437
Scott: The quality goes up.

1196
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,040
Scott: You can get less.

1197
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:22,786
Scott: You can get a shallower depth of field is really one of the big advantages.

1198
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:26,472
Scott: You can open your lens up really big and sort of get that separation.

1199
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:30,900
Scott: You know, that blurry bokeh background that the photo people are all excited about.

1200
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,040
Scott: Right.

1201
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,822
Scott: That your iPhone, your iPhone just fakes it.

1202
01:10:33,303 --> 01:10:33,664
Rym: Yeah.

1203
01:10:33,704 --> 01:10:36,608
Rym: A lot of people are starting to fake that even with fancy cameras.

1204
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:44,480
Rym: Sometimes it's easier to get a a deeper depth of field and then just do whatever effect you wanted in post.

1205
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,421
Rym: But.

1206
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:45,762
Scott: Sure.

1207
01:10:45,882 --> 01:10:46,182
Scott: Why not.

1208
01:10:47,263 --> 01:10:47,584
Scott: But yeah.

1209
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,947
Scott: Bigger sensor means higher quality mostly.

1210
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,288
Rym: Better low light performance.

1211
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:52,330
Scott: Oh.

1212
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:53,571
Scott: Low light performance is huge.

1213
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:53,892
Scott: Right.

1214
01:10:53,912 --> 01:10:55,313
Scott: It's like, you know, you take photo in the dark.

1215
01:10:55,353 --> 01:10:56,335
Scott: If your sensor is big enough.

1216
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:56,955
Scott: Right.

1217
01:10:56,975 --> 01:10:58,357
Scott: You can capture more photons with it.

1218
01:10:58,377 --> 01:11:00,039
Scott: You can capture more photons with a bigger net.

1219
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:00,620
Rym: Right.

1220
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,461
Rym: Yeah.

1221
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:02,621
Scott: You get a tiny sensor.

1222
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:04,043
Scott: You can't get that many photons with it.

1223
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:04,623
Scott: It's too small.

1224
01:11:04,663 --> 01:11:06,304
Scott: How many of the photons in the room are hitting it?

1225
01:11:06,704 --> 01:11:06,945
Scott: Right.

1226
01:11:07,025 --> 01:11:07,305
Scott: Less.

1227
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:10,908
Scott: If you had a big sheet of paper, how many photons in the room are hitting it?

1228
01:11:11,248 --> 01:11:11,808
Scott: Way more.

1229
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:13,750
Scott: So, yeah.

1230
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:14,250
Scott: So that's.

1231
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,691
Scott: But the thing is the ability.

1232
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:17,793
Scott: The fact that those can now record video.

1233
01:11:17,813 --> 01:11:18,293
Scott: Right.

1234
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:24,798
Scott: They have powerful enough CPUs and fast enough storage in them that they can now record video from that big sensor.

1235
01:11:25,218 --> 01:11:26,679
Scott: The quality is just like wow.

1236
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:27,139
Scott: Right.

1237
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:27,780
Scott: Unbelievable.

1238
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,323
Scott: The problem is that because of the form factor.

1239
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:32,284
Scott: Right.

1240
01:11:32,644 --> 01:11:33,204
Scott: They're still.

1241
01:11:33,304 --> 01:11:36,847
Scott: primarily were designed originally for stills photos.

1242
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:43,393
Rym: So like they're not comfortable to hold if you're doing like if you're like doing camera work like video work.

1243
01:11:43,753 --> 01:11:46,295
Rym: They also don't have things like XLR inputs.

1244
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:47,376
Rym: They don't have like.

1245
01:11:47,396 --> 01:11:47,776
Scott: You can add them.

1246
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:48,137
Scott: Yeah.

1247
01:11:48,157 --> 01:11:49,678
Rym: You can add them with all these accessories.

1248
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:52,140
Rym: But then you get one of these monsters with a million things plugged into it.

1249
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,621
Rym: They have these.

1250
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:58,927
Rym: They lack all these features, but they have an amazing camera.

1251
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:05,913
Rym: So if you just plug like you're like you just record video with it or just plug an HDMI cable into it and plug that into your capture device.

1252
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:10,758
Rym: That'll be a better camera than even most professional camcorders you might look at.

1253
01:12:11,139 --> 01:12:12,180
Rym: And you already own it.

1254
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:13,620
Scott: Yeah.

1255
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,141
Scott: I mean the people these days.

1256
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:22,847
Scott: what they tend to do is get all these accessories and attach like handles and rigs and cages and all sorts of things to the.

1257
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:28,051
Scott: you know their mirrorless or you know camera to sort of make it good for videoing.

1258
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:28,351
Scott: Yeah.

1259
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:28,592
Scott: Right.

1260
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:32,074
Scott: And yeah it's it's amazing if you do that.

1261
01:12:32,154 --> 01:12:32,334
Scott: Right.

1262
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:34,416
Scott: And you also get the side benefit of.

1263
01:12:34,816 --> 01:12:39,300
Scott: you have an amazing stills camera that you can change the lenses on and it's like the best camera you've ever had.

1264
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:39,560
Scott: You're good.

1265
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:39,920
Rym: Yeah.

1266
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:47,049
Rym: And especially if you were doing something where you're like sticking the camera on a tripod and not touching it or like mounting it on the wall and pointing it at something.

1267
01:12:47,069 --> 01:12:51,214
Rym: It doesn't matter that it's not like all those things a camcorder does are not going to help you.

1268
01:12:51,274 --> 01:12:56,060
Rym: You're just wasting money or you're getting a worse sensor and not using any of those features.

1269
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,180
Scott: Yeah.

1270
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,502
Scott: And you know like I said phones are so good these days.

1271
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:09,409
Scott: there's no reason to buy a standalone camera unless it's significantly better than a phone and you know how to use it so well that you're going to be able to make it better than your phone.

1272
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:09,889
Rym: Right.

1273
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:23,738
Rym: Now camcorders are in this weird space because if you go to the camcorder route instead of a DSLR there is a place like a really good place for the point and shoot equivalent because those things are pretty cheap like a few hundred bucks.

1274
01:13:24,459 --> 01:13:25,960
Rym: They tend to have pretty good sensors.

1275
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:33,688
Rym: And they will record video very easily and very accessibly and you don't have to know that much.

1276
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:36,732
Rym: And you also have to worry about things like a lot of phones.

1277
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:40,055
Rym: if you try to record video for too long can start to overheat.

1278
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:44,160
Rym: They're not really designed to record video for hours on end in a way that these camcorders are.

1279
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,381
Scott: Nowadays they are.

1280
01:13:46,401 --> 01:13:49,564
Scott: The newer iPhones like you can make movies with them.

1281
01:13:49,604 --> 01:13:53,148
Scott: They even show you in the ads people making real movies with iPhones.

1282
01:13:53,248 --> 01:13:54,789
Scott: I've seen movies made with iPhones.

1283
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,771
Scott: You know they're totally legit.

1284
01:13:58,453 --> 01:14:03,418
Scott: You know the only thing you really miss out on using an iPhone is like lenses and even then people have like tiny ones.

1285
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:04,179
Scott: they stick on the front.

1286
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:04,980
Scott: they actually kind of work.

1287
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:05,461
Rym: Yeah.

1288
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:11,890
Rym: But like a three hundred dollar like HD camcorder is really really really easy to use.

1289
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,052
Rym: We'll get some pretty great.

1290
01:14:13,092 --> 01:14:18,100
Scott: I think the only advantage of that really is that is I don't think that's better than an iPhone these days.

1291
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,024
Scott: But however it's cheaper than an iPhone.

1292
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:21,605
Scott: Right.

1293
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,668
Scott: An iPhone is eight hundred dollars.

1294
01:14:23,749 --> 01:14:24,089
Rym: Yeah.

1295
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:24,390
Scott: Right.

1296
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,431
Scott: So that's the play.

1297
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:26,874
Scott: That's why that still exists.

1298
01:14:26,954 --> 01:14:30,960
Scott: is because you know OK yeah your phone can be better if you buy a new phone.

1299
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:35,526
Rym: But there's one other thing that these all have significant optical zoom.

1300
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:36,628
Scott: Yeah.

1301
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:37,469
Scott: That's also true.

1302
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:41,034
Rym: Like phones are doing mostly ninety nine percent of the time.

1303
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:43,137
Rym: all digital zoom unless you're nuts.

1304
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:44,940
Rym: That does not get to the nuts part.

1305
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,208
Scott: But you're not taking sports photos with your iPhone because you need the big zoom.

1306
01:14:50,348 --> 01:14:50,508
Scott: Right.

1307
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:55,376
Scott: You're not taking wildlife photos of the iPhone unless you get really close to the wildlife because you want the big zoom.

1308
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:57,700
Scott: Sometimes you need the big zoom and the phones don't have that.

1309
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:01,464
Rym: And then the full on camcorders like what I use.

1310
01:15:02,025 --> 01:15:14,640
Rym: they mostly are built to be very rugged very durable and they have like a lot of convenience features for the kind of workflow of oh shit I got to get a video of that right now or I got to record something strange.

1311
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:21,886
Rym: Like there's like little things like I can hit a button and pick what neutral density filter I want and it'll just do it on.

1312
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:23,588
Scott: it's all built in it as I love.

1313
01:15:23,628 --> 01:15:24,869
Scott: my little street camera can do that.

1314
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:25,209
Scott: Yeah.

1315
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:25,830
Rym: A lot of things.

1316
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,251
Rym: a lot of video cameras can't do that.

1317
01:15:28,272 --> 01:15:28,492
Scott: Yeah.

1318
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:29,333
Scott: No but yeah you're right.

1319
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:35,879
Scott: The big professional camcorders the purpose they have is the sensors usually aren't as good as the the.

1320
01:15:35,919 --> 01:15:37,400
Rym: the sensor on mine is pretty small.

1321
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:38,421
Scott: Yeah.

1322
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:44,666
Scott: The they come with a lens that's usually a really pretty good lens with a wide zoom range right.

1323
01:15:44,686 --> 01:15:47,888
Scott: So you don't have to worry about switching lenses but you then again you can't switch lenses.

1324
01:15:48,248 --> 01:15:48,969
Rym: Yeah.

1325
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:59,397
Scott: But the advantage they have is all these other things they have built in are things you would have to accessorize and intentionally swap in and out on.

1326
01:15:59,697 --> 01:16:03,560
Scott: you know if you were doing the sort of you know DSLR route right.

1327
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:09,388
Scott: If you had some Sony you know A7 whatever and you would have to apply so many accessories to that thing.

1328
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:14,515
Rym: That it turns into a giant camera that's less durable and like safe to use.

1329
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:15,416
Scott: Yeah.

1330
01:16:15,476 --> 01:16:18,099
Rym: Like you're more likely to bump it into something and snap a piece off.

1331
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:18,620
Scott: Right.

1332
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:29,592
Scott: So features for example that a big semi pro or pro camcorder would have that you know you would have to accessorize would be something like a network cable.

1333
01:16:29,712 --> 01:16:32,014
Scott: You can just plug them right into the internet.

1334
01:16:32,114 --> 01:16:37,220
Scott: direct direct direct RTMP streaming just in it just streams just on its own.

1335
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:43,127
Scott: If you want to add streaming to like you know my if I add streaming to my Panasonic GH5 you can't do that you.

1336
01:16:43,387 --> 01:16:44,548
Scott: the Wi-Fi isn't strong.

1337
01:16:44,588 --> 01:16:46,490
Scott: that it has is not strong enough to stream.

1338
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:55,040
Scott: You have to plug the HDMI output into a capture card of some kind and then get that into a network cable somehow.

1339
01:16:55,220 --> 01:17:04,646
Rym: Things like redundant recording like stick four SD cards into it and it'll record the same video in one codec to two of them and in a lower resolution to the other two.

1340
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:05,727
Rym: like that kind of nonsense.

1341
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:06,748
Rym: Relay recording.

1342
01:17:06,768 --> 01:17:08,949
Scott: I can record to two SD cards at once.

1343
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:10,570
Scott: I can't record two different codecs at once.

1344
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,071
Rym: I can do two different codecs on mine.

1345
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:25,040
Rym: What I what I've often done is one SD card is getting full like the maximum like maximum whatever and the other one is getting like a 1080p 30 basically mixed down that I could edit on my phone or tablet.

1346
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:30,709
Scott: If I wanted to pretty quickly you know multiple microphone inputs right.

1347
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:31,450
Scott: it's like my.

1348
01:17:31,511 --> 01:17:33,113
Scott: you know a little GH5 guy.

1349
01:17:33,173 --> 01:17:37,240
Scott: he's got one microphone input and you can get this accessory to add two XLR inputs.

1350
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,887
Scott: Some of those camcorders it's like they got room for several XLR inputs.

1351
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,391
Scott: You can get your your shotgun mic on the top.

1352
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:47,576
Scott: You can get the microphone that like the news reporter is going to hold in your hand.

1353
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:49,960
Scott: You can get all those hooked up directly to the camera.

1354
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:51,749
Scott: No accessories necessary.

1355
01:17:51,809 --> 01:17:53,819
Scott: It's got like a full mixer on there for all of them.

1356
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,925
Rym: Yeah you can even redirect the output like you can do clever stuff.

1357
01:17:58,185 --> 01:18:09,120
Rym: In fact one thing I've often done is had just the shotgun mic on pointed it at two different audio inputs on the camera and recorded one with a high gain and one with a low gain in case I run into clipping.

1358
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:21,280
Rym: Like all these little like quality of life features that you probably don't need unless you're doing certain kinds of professional video but make it really easy to pick up the camera and deal with whatever shot you're trying to get right the fuck now.

1359
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,723
Scott: Yeah it's just like you know.

1360
01:18:22,743 --> 01:18:23,185
Scott: it's like this.

1361
01:18:23,305 --> 01:18:28,080
Scott: it's an integration of all the pot like the most common accessories into one device.

1362
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,648
Scott: Yeah but then they're sacrificing some of the camera bits.

1363
01:18:32,169 --> 01:18:34,854
Scott: but it's like you're doing video.

1364
01:18:34,935 --> 01:18:37,520
Scott: it's like what you know camera bits you need.

1365
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,581
Rym: Like here's the compromise.

1366
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:42,826
Rym: I have a Leica Dykemar 20x optical zoom lens in this thing.

1367
01:18:42,846 --> 01:18:43,667
Rym: It's a pretty good lens.

1368
01:18:44,027 --> 01:18:44,909
Rym: I can do a wide angle.

1369
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:45,810
Rym: I can do macro.

1370
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:46,390
Rym: There's like.

1371
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:53,919
Rym: there's a lot of elements in there and optical stabilization I can turn on or turn off but it also only has a one inch sensor.

1372
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:59,403
Scott: I mean you know you think historically speaking right.

1373
01:18:59,463 --> 01:19:05,430
Scott: even with film right when you're taking a still photo people are going to look at that one image for a long time right?

1374
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:13,740
Scott: or you're going to use that you're going to print that image out right like on a poster or a billboard or something big maybe right or at least a magazine.

1375
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:20,748
Scott: And you know you really just need the quality of that one image to be unbelievable which is why back in the day you'd still photos.

1376
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:23,571
Scott: they would use like you know sheet film you take like a five inch.

1377
01:19:23,832 --> 01:19:29,919
Scott: you know photo right for some landscape or something right on just one giant piece of film right as big as a whole piece of paper.

1378
01:19:29,959 --> 01:19:31,140
Scott: just enormous right.

1379
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:35,183
Scott: You know nowadays medium format is considered big which is.

1380
01:19:35,383 --> 01:19:37,304
Scott: but you think about it's called medium format.

1381
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:40,006
Scott: There's there's a large format too.

1382
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:40,786
Scott: It's enormous.

1383
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,889
Scott: But even back in the day it's like films on film.

1384
01:19:45,269 --> 01:19:50,413
Scott: right old days it was the 35 millimeter film right spinning real fast.

1385
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:53,915
Scott: you know there wasn't enough light to record on a giant piece of film.

1386
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,136
Scott: Imagine giant.

1387
01:19:55,416 --> 01:20:01,000
Scott: you know large format film going through fast even 70 millimeter is ridiculous for for a movie.

1388
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,502
Scott: And I think it's the biggest you're ever going to see right.

1389
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,124
Scott: It's like you know.

1390
01:20:05,444 --> 01:20:11,951
Scott: So even though you have a camera that is you know a stills format shaped camera it's got this big sensor.

1391
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:21,080
Scott: If I record 4k video on my Panasonic GH5 it doesn't use the whole sensor it's using a 4k shaped piece of the sensor.

1392
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,766
Scott: And the rest a lot of the sensors being ignored because for video you don't need as much.

1393
01:20:26,786 --> 01:20:29,329
Scott: you're only looking at each image for a smaller amount of time.

1394
01:20:29,729 --> 01:20:34,374
Scott: And guess what that smaller image is still 4k still unbelievable.

1395
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:35,776
Scott: That's how unbelievable the quality is.

1396
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:35,996
Scott: just.

1397
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:39,900
Scott: it's not about the video being low quality is about the stills being high quality.

1398
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,201
Rym: Yeah it's what do you optimize for?

1399
01:20:41,241 --> 01:20:55,637
Rym: like a camcorder can get away with a like a lens that has a different performance profile because it needs to be more versatile but it doesn't need to be necessarily as high quality as what you would use in a still camera for like a zoom shot.

1400
01:20:56,077 --> 01:20:59,840
Rym: I just need a lens that goes from like 24 millimeter to 480.

1401
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:09,267
Scott: So what the pros are using these days from what I can see is basically these video cameras like the best possible ones like the you know the reds and the RE ones and all that stuff.

1402
01:21:09,707 --> 01:21:12,570
Scott: And basically what they are is just sensor in a box right.

1403
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,092
Scott: It's like if you ever watch like slow mo guys or whatever the slow mo cameras it looks a lot like that.

1404
01:21:16,152 --> 01:21:21,496
Scott: It's just a box and on one end of the box is a sensor and a hole to attach whatever freaking lens.

1405
01:21:21,516 --> 01:21:26,880
Scott: you can find some ridiculous cinema lens some you know anthropomorphic lens any kind of lens you can.

1406
01:21:27,264 --> 01:21:28,458
Rym: I think you mean anamorphic.

1407
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,342
Scott: Anamorphic yeah or anthropomorphic you don't know.

1408
01:21:31,522 --> 01:21:34,385
Scott: both kinds whatever you know you're filming.

1409
01:21:34,405 --> 01:21:35,666
Scott: who knows right.

1410
01:21:35,927 --> 01:21:42,673
Scott: It's just some lens mount with a big sensor and a basically a computer and everything else is outputs.

1411
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:44,275
Scott: you attach the storage separately.

1412
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:47,518
Scott: you attach the monitor separately right doesn't even have a screen on it.

1413
01:21:47,558 --> 01:21:49,580
Scott: you just everything attaches separately.

1414
01:21:50,081 --> 01:21:51,503
Scott: It's just a sensor in a box.

1415
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:54,468
Scott: you power it up you attach everything else to it.

1416
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:58,574
Scott: you put it on a crane you put it on a dolly whatever you're doing at your.

1417
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:02,160
Scott: you know film TV studio whatever and that's how they're doing.

1418
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,643
Scott: And that's you know for a studio.

1419
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:05,965
Scott: that's very practical right.

1420
01:22:06,066 --> 01:22:07,227
Scott: It's like it's its own piece.

1421
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:09,030
Scott: if it breaks you don't have to replace everything else.

1422
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,215
Scott: you know we can get a bunch of them right.

1423
01:22:12,235 --> 01:22:15,560
Scott: We can attach whatever we have to them to suit our needs specifically.

1424
01:22:15,961 --> 01:22:17,943
Scott: We're not locked into any choices here.

1425
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:21,247
Scott: We have the money we can afford it right.

1426
01:22:21,888 --> 01:22:25,132
Scott: But for a normal person that's completely impractical right.

1427
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:31,060
Scott: It's like you have to go and buy like the whole universe a rat to surround this box.

1428
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,042
Scott: Yeah it's just a sensor and a hole.

1429
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:42,190
Rym: And that is why I own a camcorder specifically like a professional one is because the kind of video I make most often is I just want it to work.

1430
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:45,193
Rym: It's going to be a possibly interesting situation.

1431
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:52,480
Rym: this camera's in and I want to just hit a bunch of buttons and make it work as quick as possible with the minimum effort minimum stress minimum risk of damaging anything.

1432
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:54,742
Scott: So final recommendation.

1433
01:22:55,343 --> 01:22:57,286
Scott: Almost every single person should just use their phone.

1434
01:22:57,927 --> 01:23:00,049
Scott: Like 99.9% of people use your phone.

1435
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:03,394
Scott: If you don't if you're not a professional at photo or video you're not.

1436
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:08,000
Scott: even if you bought something expensive you probably wouldn't be able to do better than you can do with your phone.

1437
01:23:09,181 --> 01:23:18,393
Scott: So if you have the knowledge and the money and it's a hobby or you're into it you're a youtuber for real or something your twitch streamer for real you're big into it.

1438
01:23:18,413 --> 01:23:19,395
Scott: you're actually doing it.

1439
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:21,377
Scott: you're not just thinking about doing it.

1440
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:23,240
Scott: you're actually already doing it frequently.

1441
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,022
Scott: Right you've proven that you're.

1442
01:23:25,102 --> 01:23:27,003
Scott: this is a thing it's for real for you.

1443
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:27,664
Scott: now you're.

1444
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:28,745
Scott: it's now your deal.

1445
01:23:29,185 --> 01:23:31,547
Scott: it's worth spending money on to you right.

1446
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:37,513
Scott: The question is do you ever take are you into stills photos or not right?

1447
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:43,758
Scott: if you're in distills photos go buy some mirrorless camera and whatever lenses and guess what.

1448
01:23:43,778 --> 01:23:45,940
Scott: it's also the best video camera you don't need to buy.

1449
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,685
Rym: Or honestly if you record a lot of video then don't get a DSLR.

1450
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:51,906
Rym: don't even get a still camera.

1451
01:23:51,966 --> 01:24:00,675
Rym: use your phone for still cameras and if you're recording a lot of video for some reason get one of those really small like hand cameras like hand camcorders like a Panasonic or a Sony.

1452
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:02,077
Rym: They're not that expensive.

1453
01:24:02,397 --> 01:24:04,419
Rym: they'll do everything you want.

1454
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:05,100
Rym: they'll look great.

1455
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,803
Scott: Right you're going to save so much money right?

1456
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:12,266
Scott: if you're not doing the stills photos it's like you're saving in.

1457
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:13,808
Scott: you know your phone isn't good enough.

1458
01:24:13,828 --> 01:24:17,531
Scott: maybe got an old phone or you can't afford the newest phone that you know.

1459
01:24:17,551 --> 01:24:18,432
Scott: you can get a 4k.

1460
01:24:18,713 --> 01:24:20,394
Scott: you know one of those right?

1461
01:24:20,434 --> 01:24:21,195
Scott: or GoPro.

1462
01:24:21,255 --> 01:24:23,377
Scott: it's like that might be better than the phone you have.

1463
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,860
Scott: I don't know a phone you have and it'll be cheaper for sure.

1464
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:45,980
Scott: Yeah and then if you are just like a video only person but you are deep in the video zone and the video you are doing is more of the TV style video right the TV style video then you can go for the sort of prosumer camcorder right but if you're doing more of the movie video.

1465
01:24:46,620 --> 01:25:02,732
Scott: Right where you're sort of setting up your shots taking your time then you want to go back to the sort of mirrorless you know area right because you can change out the lenses you can get higher quality right you know put cine lenses on there anamorphic lenses on there

1466
01:25:02,752 --> 01:25:06,395
Rym: like my camcorder unless there's something wrong with the shot.

1467
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:13,100
Rym: I'm using a lot of its automation because I'm trying to capture the events more so than trying to set a mood.

1468
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,944
Scott: Right we're using it for recording a GeekNights panel.

1469
01:25:15,964 --> 01:25:23,336
Scott: if you need to make a movie like we you know we had a screenplay and we had seen I would not use my camcorder isn't?

1470
01:25:23,717 --> 01:25:25,600
Scott: the camcorder is not helping with that right.

1471
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:36,213
Rym: So that type of camcorder there are better versions of that with bigger sensors that are used for film like if you need someone to run along with the camera and all that.

1472
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:38,135
Rym: but those are pretty specialized equipment.

1473
01:25:38,456 --> 01:25:41,440
Rym: they cost a lot more than the camcorder I'm talking about.

1474
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,603
Scott: If you're making a movie you really need to switch lenses out right.

1475
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,144
Scott: yeah I'm doing still photos.

1476
01:25:46,164 --> 01:25:48,606
Scott: you need to switch lenses if you be general.

1477
01:25:48,966 --> 01:25:52,429
Scott: all-purpose lens is really just for.

1478
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:55,232
Scott: I'm recording events right that are not.

1479
01:25:55,312 --> 01:25:55,672
Scott: you know.

1480
01:25:56,553 --> 01:25:57,374
Scott: visually it's.

1481
01:25:57,474 --> 01:25:58,715
Scott: it's not about the the.

1482
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:01,677
Scott: you know the the camera angle or the lighting or the.

1483
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:02,959
Scott: you know the scene right it's.

1484
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:04,680
Scott: here's a recording of our panel.

1485
01:26:05,441 --> 01:26:09,324
Scott: Or you know some some documentary you know reporting type.

1486
01:26:09,605 --> 01:26:13,528
Scott: you know just here's what's happening stuff nothing artistic in nature.

1487
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:14,990
Scott: about the filming itself.

1488
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:26,180
Scott: you know the events that you might be recording might have value but it's you know it's not like your choices as the camera operator that are adding the artistic value to the the video record.

1489
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:26,961
Rym: We went out a little long.

1490
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:32,185
Rym: I think we can end pretty much there but this overlaps heavily with something we talked about in the last Thursday episode of GeekNights around.

1491
01:26:32,225 --> 01:26:39,911
Rym: that like the momentum to get started to do a thing and like trying to overproduce it or over plan it makes it less like you'll do it in the first place.

1492
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:41,833
Rym: that's probably the most important thing.

1493
01:26:42,293 --> 01:26:43,074
Rym: what do you want to?

1494
01:26:43,274 --> 01:26:50,180
Rym: why are you trying to get some video and then think about how much are you willing to deal with before you can actually make the video.

1495
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,044
Scott: Do as much as you can with with just whatever you have.

1496
01:26:55,104 --> 01:26:55,925
Scott: right you got a phone.

1497
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:57,446
Scott: okay go and make.

1498
01:26:57,707 --> 01:26:58,708
Scott: do you want to do a video?

1499
01:26:58,748 --> 01:27:04,354
Scott: do as much of it as you can with your phone and if you can get it done why are you buying anything else?

1500
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:06,537
Scott: just try to get it done.

1501
01:27:06,577 --> 01:27:09,080
Scott: and if you only buy something new if you're saying look.

1502
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,563
Scott: I'm trying to do this thing I've been trying to do with my phone.

1503
01:27:13,064 --> 01:27:14,906
Scott: I researched how to do it with the phone.

1504
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:18,530
Scott: I tried to figure it out and what I found is that yeah I can't.

1505
01:27:18,631 --> 01:27:19,371
Scott: I wanted to zoom in.

1506
01:27:19,411 --> 01:27:22,655
Scott: I wanted to take a photo of birds and I can't do that with my phone.

1507
01:27:22,675 --> 01:27:25,358
Scott: it's like well yeah because you need a fast zoom big zoom lens to do that.

1508
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:26,139
Scott: their birds are flying.

1509
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:26,720
Scott: they're going fast.

1510
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:31,306
Rym: Remember those videos we do of walk around the expo holiday con.

1511
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:35,211
Rym: do you know how much of a pain in the ass those were to record without a camcorder?

1512
01:27:35,231 --> 01:27:36,794
Scott: you could you could do that just with a phone.

1513
01:27:37,715 --> 01:27:41,099
Rym: nowadays we need to excel our inputs into that phone.

1514
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,345
Scott: May that's I guess that would be the problem.

1515
01:27:44,365 --> 01:27:47,373
Rym: yeah I would wear a Marantz on me like on my waist.

1516
01:27:47,794 --> 01:27:49,820
Rym: Scott would wear another Marantz.

1517
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:53,660
Rym: And then we had the camera and we deal with it in post.

1518
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:58,729
Scott: Until you find something that you cannot do with what you have don't buy anything new.

1519
01:27:58,809 --> 01:28:00,774
Scott: but that's the state of what's available.

1520
01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:03,840
Scott: if you do end up in that situation with your video recording.

1521
01:28:10,261 --> 01:28:12,527
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1522
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:17,540
Rym: special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1523
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:22,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

1524
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:30,140
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1527
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,600

1529
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:14,579
Rym: And now, tonight, I leave you with...

1530
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:42,800
Scott: What do you mean, what videos?

1531
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:47,100
Scott: You said people enjoyed the videos, what?

1532
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:55,179
Scott: Yeah, you know when we'd hang out and we'd pretend to be characters and act out scenes and... Dude, you were videotaping that?

1533
01:29:55,701 --> 01:29:57,880
Scott: You saw the camera and the tripod, didn't you?

1534
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,559
Scott: I thought that was just surveying equipment.

1535
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,180
Scott: So you thought we were just hanging out and I was just surveying land on the side as like a hobby?

1536
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:05,622
Rym: Yeah.

1537
01:30:06,828 --> 01:30:08,860
Scott: You never really explained what that stuff was.

1538
01:30:09,061 --> 01:30:11,520
Scott: I mean, but you'd hold it and you'd get shots and stuff.

1539
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:12,263
Rym: Yeah.

1540
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:13,620
Scott: You didn't tell me what I was doing.

1541
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:15,579
Scott: You thought you were surveying the land.

1542
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:15,993
Scott: Yeah.

1543
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:17,319
Scott: When you held the camera.

1544
01:30:18,241 --> 01:30:18,987
Scott: Well, you weren't.

1545
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:20,440
Scott: We were making videos.

1546
01:30:21,034 --> 01:30:21,098
Scott: Oh.

1547
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,278
Scott: And people really liked them.

1548
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:22,951
Scott: Huh.

1549
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:29,400
Rym: But even then, that doesn't explain how you didn't see the videos, because I sent you an email every time we made a video.

1550
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,660
Rym: Those might have gone to my spam folder.

1551
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:37,980
Scott: Why would my emails go to your spam?

1552
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:42,380
Rym: You keep sending me like Roblox stuff, so I just kind of marked everything you send me as spam.

1553
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,060
Scott: Well, you snooze, you lose, because I sent you a Chipotle coupon last year.

1554
01:30:46,621 --> 01:30:46,763
Scott: Oh.

1555
01:30:47,637 --> 01:30:47,840
Rym: Shoot.

1556
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,199
Scott: You could have had a free burrito.

1557
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:50,076
Rym: Dang it.
