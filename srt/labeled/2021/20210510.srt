1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,667
Rym: It's Monday, May 10th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:09,869
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:12,897
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,827
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,540
Rym: We are talking about remote controls.

6
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,478
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,267
Rym: Got a little, uh, got an envelope.

8
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,315
Rym: I only check the mail, like, once every week, give or take, during COVID.

9
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:28,960
Rym: Like, I just don't go down there that often.

10
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:31,740
Rym: Uh, I got a jury summons.

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:32,853
Scott: Uh-oh.

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:39,820
Rym: At least I'm vaccinated now, by the time it'll come up, because I really didn't want to go to a courtroom if I wasn't vaccinated.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,558
Scott: Well, that's how that goes.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,121
Rym: Yep.

15
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:45,395
Rym: But I got it basically right after I got my second shot.

16
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:46,079
Rym: Here it is.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,580
Scott: As long as it's not in a faraway Long Island court.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,839
Rym: Well, it's in any court in Queens, and I'm a standby phone juror.

19
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:56,340
Rym: Oh, okay.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,080
Rym: So, starting on Friday, I got to call that number, go to that website, and every day, I'll find out if I get to skip work or not, basically.

21
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,099
Scott: It seems you're a recurring theme on GeekNights.

22
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:07,090
Rym: Yep.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,419
Rym: I'm confident I will not serve.

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:17,920
Rym: Partly because, I mean, I've been kicked out every time I've ever been called up, and some of the default questions they ask usually just automatically exclude me.

25
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:25,200
Rym: Like, has a member of your direct family ever been a victim of a serious crime, or is any member of your family a member, like an emergency responder?

26
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:26,443
Scott: Well, it depends.

27
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,968
Scott: What if it's a civil court?

28
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:31,179
Scott: I was at a civil court when I, you know, last time.

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:40,039
Rym: One or two times ago, the question where they were like, "Nah, you're done," was, "Would you believe the testimony of a police officer over that of someone, like a private

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,360
Rym: citizen?".

31
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,319
Rym: And they did not like my answer to that one.

32
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:55,725
Scott: Anyway, so in technology, personal news, right, you know that I'm someone who has had, let's see, I have iPhone 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and now I have 12.

33
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,552
Scott: I skipped all 8, 9, 10.

34
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:57,399
Scott: I skipped four iPhones.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:10,320
Scott: So, I'm on my sixth iPhone, and the only phone, I see people with broken phones all over the place, and I'm always looking down on them, like, you know, "So clumsy, why aren't you taking care of your

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,580
Scott: phone?".

37
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,359
Scott: I never put my phone in a case, ever.

38
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:13,597
Rym: Oh, I see where this is going.

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,300
Scott: iPhone 3G I had in a case a little bit, but then I was like, "Fuck this," and I'd give up on phone cases, right?

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,740
Rym: Yeah, I still don't do cases, like, ever for phones.

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,421
Scott: Right.

42
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:24,203
Scott: What's the point?

43
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:30,220
Scott: You know, it's like they put so much effort into making the phone all strong, and then you put some ugly-ass plastic shield on it, it's like, okay.

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,624
Scott: It's like a tablecloth, right?

45
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,447
Scott: It's for old ladies.

46
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:35,116
Scott: The whole point is I bought a nice table to see the nice table.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,340
Rym: Now you gotta cover the couch in plastic so it never gets stamped.

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,721
Scott: Exactly.

49
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,684
Scott: You know, I don't believe in that.

50
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,968
Scott: And so far, that has been perfectly fine for me.

51
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:53,100
Scott: I have never, the only time an iPhone screen of mine ever broke was when the iPhone 5 screen broke, because it was in my bag, and I fell off my bike.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,360
Scott: So it's like, not much I could do about that one.

53
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,620
Rym: I remember when your iPod mini broke.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,160
Scott: Oh, well, that was already, I guess, a dead device at the time already, because I already had an iPod Nano.

55
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,465
Rym: Well, yeah, you say dead.

56
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:09,920
Rym: It worked, but you kept saying how invincible it was, and you were like, look.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,140
Scott: It did see, it was very invincible, although I did have it in, like, a rubbery thing.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,741
Scott: True.

59
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,642
Rym: You had it in a case.

60
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:23,960
Rym: But I just remember, you were like, it's invincible, and you dropped it onto a carpeted floor from a very low height, very gently, and when you picked it up, the screen was shattered.

61
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,620
Scott: No, I stepped on it a few times.

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:25,841
Scott: You did.

63
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,007
Rym: You poked at it with your foot.

64
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:28,113
Rym: You did not step on it.

65
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,340
Rym: You, like, gently tapped it with your foot.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,597
Scott: It was not broken until I stepped on it.

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,760
Rym: Gently tapping.

68
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,179
Scott: It wasn't broken just from the dropping.

69
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,260
Rym: I think it was the combination of the carpet and the slight touch with a toe.

70
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:54,680
Scott: Maybe, but anyway, it was, I never imagined, right, having all these phones and not broken them, except for when I fell off my bike, right, that my Apple Watch screen could break.

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,947
Scott: I'd never seen someone walking around with a broken Apple Watch.

72
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:03,500
Scott: It's like, it just didn't conceive, I had no idea that that was even a possibility, right?

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,578
Scott: Like, how would that happen?

74
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:11,920
Scott: So the other, you know, just the other day I finished, I'm using it as like, you know, a heart rate monitor when I ride my bike to nowhere in the morning.

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,720
Scott: Then I go and take a shower, and I take it off before I go in the shower, and I just drop it from, like, wrist height.

76
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,098
Scott: It lands on the bathroom floor, and sure enough, the screen on the Apple Watch breaks, and I'm just like, what the fuck?

77
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:26,528
Scott: I didn't even know that could happen.

78
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:28,740
Scott: The thing's pretty old already.

79
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:32,314
Rym: I broke a watch in a mountain biking accident once as a kid.

80
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,860
Rym: I just, like, smashed it on a tree.

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,070
Scott: Yeah, so the thing still works, right?

82
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,415
Scott: Everything about it works.

83
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,720
Scott: The screen still displays.

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,577
Scott: The only problem is that with the screen shattered, obviously pieces of glass chip off of it.

85
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,300
Scott: That's not great.

86
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,315
Scott: Obviously, waterproofness is gone entirely.

87
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:51,160
Scott: I'm not here.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,891
Scott: But only the top right of the screen is still sensitive to touch.

89
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,180
Scott: The rest of it is sort of not, so you can't, like, use it.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,940
Rym: That's what happened when my old, god, this was an ancient, ancient Android device.

91
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:08,873
Rym: But I was traveling, and there was a tiny crack on the screen that had been there forever.

92
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,380
Rym: that, like, had been there for over a year, but the phone was fine.

93
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:17,159
Rym: But I guess air pressure flying something, one day, like, the crack just expanded a little bit.

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:25,200
Rym: Suddenly, like, on its own, like, it made a noise, and then the entire touchscreen didn't work anymore, except for a tiny part of the top right of the screen.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,241
Scott: Yep.

96
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:31,951
Scott: So, the thing is that I don't have a lot of great options here, right?

97
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:36,139
Scott: So my ideal would be, like, hey, this is an iPhone iWatch 3, the LTE one.

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,360
Scott: And apparently, they still sell the iWatch 3, but they only sell the Wi-Fi one, Apple at least, right?

99
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:57,060
Scott: And apparently, that one, you shouldn't buy it, because they didn't tell, I don't know if this was public information, at least I didn't learn it until recently, but the LTE version, whether you use the LTE or not, has more memory than the Wi-Fi only one.

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:07,880
Scott: And the Wi-Fi only one has so little memory that you have to, if you want to update the watchOS, you have to erase the whole watch, then update the iOS, then reinstall all your apps, right?

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:19,140
Scott: The LTE one has enough memory that you don't have to do that, which is why, when I read the article, I was like, this is full of shit, I can just update my watch just fine, this person doesn't know what they're talking about, and then at the end, they're like, actually, the LTE one is just fine, and I'm like, oh.

102
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,952
Scott: So you can't buy the iWatch 3 LTE unless you buy, like, a used one on eBay.

103
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,620
Scott: So I can't just replace my watch.

104
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,819
Rym: Alright, just get, like, one of the newest iWatches.

105
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:37,360
Scott: You could do that, I would do that, in fact, but they come out with new Apple watches every September, and it is currently May.

106
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:42,736
Scott: If it was, like, October, I'd be like, oh, perfect, right?

107
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:43,800
Scott: I'll just buy the new one.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,180
Rym: You could just not have a watch until September.

109
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,039
Scott: That's an option as well.

110
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,071
Rym: I mean, how much are you going to be going out in the foreseeable future?

111
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,200
Rym: Like, you can just Strava with the phone.

112
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,568
Scott: You can use it for a lot of stuff, just in the house, though, right?

113
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,480
Scott: Like, timing, cooking things, controlling Spotify.

114
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:04,020
Rym: For whatever reason, I don't use my watch for any of that stuff in the house.

115
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,699
Scott: Yeah, because your watch doesn't do any of that stuff.

116
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,919
Rym: It does do all that stuff, I just don't bother, I just do it on my phone.

117
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,560
Scott: Well, the Apple Watch does all that stuff.

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,319
Rym: Like, if I want to change the volume on the Windows or Futs with anything, I just open whatever app on my phone and do it.

119
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,100
Scott: Apple Watch is faster and easier to do all those things.

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,466
Rym: I don't wear a watch if I'm home.

121
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:23,679
Rym: I don't even know where my smartwatch is because I took it off at the start of COVID, and I'd never put it back on.

122
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,498
Scott: Well, maybe if it was more useful and powerful, we would wear it all the time.

123
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:26,840
Scott: Regardless.

124
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,180
Rym: I'm saying, in my house, I don't want to wear a watch.

125
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,200
Rym: The whole point of the watch is I don't have to get my phone out of my pocket when I'm, like, out and about in the world.

126
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,119
Scott: Yeah, I don't have to get my phone out of my pocket, even in the house.

127
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,740
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so there's not a lot of great options.

128
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:51,660
Scott: To repair it, Apple wants, like, $100 less than the cost of buying, like, a cheapy Apple Watch, right?

129
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,659
Scott: It's, like, $100 more than a used one.

130
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:01,857
Scott: Every option is, like, either wasteful or economically bad.

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,744
Scott: So, we'll see.

132
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:10,800
Scott: I'm basically going to send it into the Apple repair place, which doesn't commit you to paying money.

133
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,448
Scott: You get, like, a quote eventually.

134
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,594
Scott: They gave you a pre-quote.

135
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:14,640
Scott: The pre-quote was high.

136
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:19,240
Rym: I feel like the quote you get back is going to be equal to or greater than the pre-quote.

137
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:20,423
Scott: Maybe.

138
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,119
Scott: But at least for free, I can find out.

139
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,272
Rym: I would bet you money.

140
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:24,979
Rym: that is the case.

141
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:26,864
Scott: Yeah, why not?

142
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:30,660
Scott: For free, I can send it in to get the quote and then decide from there.

143
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:43,020
Scott: But, you know, I just want to point out that for a company that is at the last few keynotes has been doing so much bragging about their environmentally friendliness, right?

144
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:52,700
Scott: And, you know, also is really bad about the right to repair and is fighting it everywhere and doesn't want third-party repair services to exist.

145
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:04,820
Scott: And meanwhile, the third-party repair service for, like, an iPhone screen is significantly cheaper than the Apple one, but the Apple Watch repair service from a third party was not that much cheaper than the Apple repair quote.

146
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,454
Scott: I think it was, like, $180 versus, like, $220 or something.

147
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:09,037
Scott: It was a $40 difference.

148
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:09,929
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,680
Scott: Regardless, they, you know, they should be like, hey, if you want to be better for the environment, here's a perfectly good watch that just happened to get dropped on the floor.

150
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:28,920
Scott: If you would make your repair cost cheaper and make battery replacement cheaper, that would be really helpful.

151
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,880
Scott: You know, in a time when chips are in, you know, high demand, low supply, probably a good idea to keep existing chips operating.

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,957
Scott: There's nothing wrong with them.

153
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:49,240
Rym: Well, I think part of the issue is that a tightly packed, embedded device that's waterproof and has touch screens on it, it's very hard to make that easily repairable.

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,693
Scott: Well, you should, you know, you're the one making it.

155
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:53,336
Scott: Make it better.

156
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:54,040
Scott: Make it easier to repair.

157
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:58,520
Rym: There might not be a better that's better enough to matter to make that cost cheaper.

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:07,119
Scott: Well, and I also found out, I didn't realize this, but, you know, it's something I guess wouldn't have mattered to me until now that I realized that the screen can break.

159
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:12,294
Scott: If you buy, the Apple Watch actually comes in three different materials.

160
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,820
Scott: I don't know, maybe four.

161
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,300
Scott: I don't know if they still have the ceramic choice available, but they have aluminum, the cheapy one, stainless steel, and then titanium, right?

162
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:30,840
Scott: If you get stainless steel or titanium, which are hundreds of dollars more than aluminum, you get a different, the screen is made of a different, better glass.

163
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:32,526
Rym: All right.

164
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,320
Rym: Maybe that's not a problem.

165
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,500
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:47,040
Scott: So of course I have the cheapy aluminum, which I'd never, why would I, you know, but now I might consider, you know, if I end up getting a new one, maybe I will pay more.

167
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,168
Scott: It's like, normally I would just been like, fuck that aluminum.

168
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,239
Scott: But now it's like, well, maybe the stainless steel one.

169
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:04,478
Rym: So in some actual news, the whole Apple fight with everybody, like there's a bunch of Apple lawsuits and fights going on right now.

170
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,560
Rym: We've talked about several of them.

171
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,584
Scott: It's mostly the Apple.

172
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:10,180
Scott: epic is going to keep feeding us news for the next few months.

173
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,223
Rym: That's the big one.

174
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:15,420
Rym: Like the second biggest one is probably the lawsuit over purchasing things on iTunes.

175
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,561
Scott: Yep.

176
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:16,781
Scott: Yep.

177
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:17,002
Scott: Yep.

178
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,507
Rym: But the Apple and Epic game store one is.

179
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:27,840
Rym: it covers so many areas and it's so big that no matter how it falls, the precedent that this case sets is going to be a big deal.

180
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:39,440
Rym: Pretty much no matter what happens, like there's no way for like the entire industry, not just the games industry, but the, the concept of an app store to come out of this unscathed and unchanged.

181
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:50,620
Rym: So there's a bunch of recent developments that are actually interesting enough to where we probably should talk about them because Apple is making a lot of interesting points in court.

182
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,959
Rym: And because this is all public, like you can go read what's happening in this court case.

183
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,221
Scott: Yeah.

184
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,545
Scott: Well, they're trying to appeal to the, to the judge, right?

185
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:58,146
Scott: With this one.

186
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:58,406
Scott: Right.

187
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:06,080
Scott: So, or I don't know if there's a jury or not, but basically what happened was is they're like, look, you know, that epic store on the epic store.

188
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,990
Scott: You can buy, you can download the itch IO store, right?

189
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,877
Scott: And in the itch IO store, there's porn games.

190
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:13,919
Scott: It's like, of course there is.

191
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Rym: So I can download something called a web browser in the Apple store and in that web browser, there is in fact a lot of pornography.

192
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,925
Scott: There is in fact, it's just out there.

193
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:25,707
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,779
Scott: Um, but yeah, it's like that's, Apple is using that as like a point they're trying to make.

195
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,060
Scott: Right.

196
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,351
Scott: And that is, I think one of Apple's, you know, for as good as Apple is on a lot of issues, notably privacy, right?

197
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:43,640
Scott: Being like the one issue they're good on, they've been really bad about this issue right now.

198
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:51,656
Scott: Of course we always say, and I still agree with this wholly that it's like, yeah, you're a private, the own thing, right?

199
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,480
Scott: You don't have to respect freedom of speech.

200
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,365
Scott: You can choose, right?

201
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,612
Scott: What, you know, you want to have on your platform.

202
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,620
Scott: If Apple doesn't want to have porn on the Apple store, that's up to them.

203
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,042
Scott: They don't, they don't have to, right?

204
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,825
Scott: They can make whatever rules that they want.

205
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:12,099
Rym: And you know, uh, the invisible hand of the market and consumer preferences and et cetera will decide if that was a good idea or not.

206
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:13,282
Scott: Sure.

207
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:13,904
Scott: Whatever.

208
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,067
Scott: Uh, capitalism.

209
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:15,528
Scott: Nice.

210
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,195
Scott: But, uh, I just disagree.

211
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,180
Scott: I think their rules are bad rules, right?

212
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:30,400
Rym: Well, Apple in particular has done a lot of just sort of semi-random arbitrary things over the years, mostly under the guise of maintaining a wholesome, uh, reputation.

213
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:43,540
Rym: Uh, like I remember for a while back, despite the fact that cannabis is legal in a whole bunch of states, Apple blocked and removed pretty much all the apps that cannabis nerds used to configure their fancy vaporizing devices.

214
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,541
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:48,271
Scott: I know some of it might have to do with, you know, Apple has their little ad thing.

216
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,300
Scott: Like you can use the official Apple ad thing when you make an app.

217
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,620
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,941
Scott: Right.

219
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:56,847
Scott: Uh, and then, you know, the Apple wants to keep all the apps advertiser friendly, right?

220
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:05,538
Scott: Um, you know, and advertisers, you know, again, the, you know, the problem stems with them not wanting to, it's like, why don't you want your Coca-Cola ad next to some porn?

221
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,319
Scott: What's the wrong with that?

222
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:07,400
Scott: What's your problem?

223
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,002
Rym: Yeah, of course.

224
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:08,565
Rym: Turn that around.

225
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,000
Rym: What about people who don't want their ad next to some right wing nut shop?

226
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,381
Scott: That's right.

227
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:26,300
Rym: The real problem there is that ad networks are fundamentally, it's impossible to make one that's ethical and that has reasonable rules because ad networks dissenter, like they separate who is buying an ad from where the ad is placed and they commodify the ads.

228
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,869
Rym: They make them fungible and that makes a market that's very murky and prune to abuse and disagreement.

229
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,700
Rym: It's not like I say, I want my ad to appear on this app, which is how things used to work in the old days.

230
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,482
Scott: Yep, exactly.

231
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:50,000
Scott: Anyway, uh, but yeah, this is, you know, bringing up all the usual arguments you have, you know, of, you know, hey, you should be like, what's wrong with fricking sex?

232
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:50,660
Scott: Right.

233
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,237
Scott: What do you have against my completely not offensive, just sexually explicit game?

234
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:57,240
Scott: What's wrong with that?

235
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:10,600
Rym: And it's not clear what's wrong with it, according to Apple, because they seem to have brought this up in court just to disgust everyone and try to like win over the judge and like make a big deal about how offensive all this itch.io stuff is.

236
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,108
Scott: Yeah, well, Epic, you know, did, I think, an okay job of explaining what itch.io actually is.

237
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:16,408
Scott: Right.

238
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:20,535
Scott: Which is like, hey, it's actually an amazing platform that supports indie developers.

239
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:23,160
Scott: It's very developer friendly, gives developers a great cut.

240
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:30,519
Scott: But itch.io, you know, with their little bundle for racial justice, gave more money than Apple or anyone did.

241
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:30,700
Scott: Right.

242
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,339
Scott: You know, social justice things over the...

243
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:49,400
Rym: Also, there's a big conflation in this kind of conversation where a lot of people, especially old crappy people, will argue that things are offensive or sexual when in fact they're just LGBT content.

244
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:52,886
Scott: Well, I think that's the thing that's happened a lot.

245
00:15:53,026 --> 00:16:01,520
Scott: is that, you know, LGBT stuff, you know, is, you know, LGBT is an identity that is around sexuality.

246
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:01,760
Scott: Right.

247
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:10,659
Scott: So LGBT content is, you know, not always sexually explicit, but is, you know, always it's sexual content by nature.

248
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,060
Scott: Right.

249
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:20,540
Rym: Well, you also get the situation where straight sexual content is much more tolerated on larger platforms than sexual content that is LGBT is tolerated.

250
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,940
Scott: So there's a huge confluence of all these factors.

251
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:32,300
Scott: Historically, you'd have like a movie, right, and the movie with like, you know, a dude kissing, you know, a lady, right, it's two straight people kissing, would be like PG.

252
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:39,540
Scott: But if it was two dudes kissing and if you made this movie in like 1980 and it had two dudes kissing, that would have been like rated R or some shit.

253
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:42,464
Rym: RPS said this in terms of the whole topic.

254
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:53,659
Rym: Apple in court, I'm quoting the article, made it sound like the excellent indie focused store is an evil demon app that sells games "so offensive they couldn't possibly speak about them in

255
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:53,919
Rym: court.".

256
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Scott: Well, there are, in fact, some, many games that are sold on itch.io, some of which are horrific and some of which are not horrific, but would be horrific to a non-internet person, which I presume a judge is likely to be.

257
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:18,569
Scott: You know, so you tell someone about, you know, some game that's actually not offensive and doesn't contain anything bad.

258
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,780
Scott: It's just like a really sexy game that's, you know, very gay or furry or something.

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,503
Scott: And that might freak out some judge.

260
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:27,185
Scott: Right.

261
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,552
Scott: But it's like, but yeah, there is also stuff like, you know, they did.

262
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,560
Scott: I think they found like the most explicit thing they could find, like sister lust or something.

263
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:47,439
Scott: I tried to search on itch.io for a sister lust and I couldn't find, I couldn't figure out which thing they were talking about, but there was definitely some stuff there that, you know, well, this is like, hey, if you don't want it, don't buy it.

264
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,399
Scott: You got parental controls on your phone, you know, what the hell?

265
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:50,921
Rym: Yep.

266
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:54,186
Rym: And also, like, don't put it in your app store, like directly, like, sure.

267
00:17:54,286 --> 00:18:03,140
Rym: But if there's another app store, you can't use your monopoly powers to keep that app store away, even if that app store itself has a different policy from you.

268
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,199
Rym: We do need a diverse ecosystem of places to be able to.

269
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:15,520
Scott: And this is still getting away from the core issue, which is like, hey, you know, people have to use the Apple App Store, they have to use the Apple payment thing, right?

270
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,502
Scott: That's the issue.

271
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,707
Scott: It's like, it doesn't matter what the content is.

272
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,533
Scott: It's like, you know, you're making everyone use your payment.

273
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:25,040
Scott: You can't just, you can't just use their credit card and give the money directly to someone else.

274
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:28,751
Scott: You're taking a 30% cut of everyone's money, no matter what they do.

275
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:31,018
Scott: It's like, well, they might do porn.

276
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:31,339
Scott: Oh, OK.

277
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,690
Scott: And so you don't want to collect the money for them doing porn?

278
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,111
Scott: I know.

279
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,660
Scott: OK, well, then let them collect all the money for their part.

280
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:47,420
Rym: But it almost seems like they're bringing this up just to try to turn the tide of public and legal opinion against the Epic Games Store's argument.

281
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,696
Scott: It's typical lawyer, you know, typical lawyer strategy, right?

282
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:51,480
Scott: What you do in a courtroom.

283
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,039
Scott: In related news, Steam, which has went from being anti-porn to less anti-porn.

284
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,665
Rym: But still, Steam has the same problem.

285
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:01,147
Rym: Apple does.

286
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,480
Rym: Their rules are not transparent and are applied semi-randomly.

287
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,789
Rym: Two identical games could be released.

288
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,513
Rym: One will be banned.

289
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:10,055
Rym: One's OK.

290
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,079
Rym: And no one can explain why.

291
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:11,960
Scott: Right.

292
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:20,820
Scott: So Steam is allowing, you know, since the news a while ago, right, some more sexual content that some would consider pornography, which is good.

293
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,421
Scott: Right.

294
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,889
Scott: You know, you can block it and whatever.

295
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:24,952
Scott: It's perfectly fine.

296
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,799
Scott: There's plenty of it in the Steam store if you want it.

297
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,173
Scott: But there are rules around exactly what is and isn't allowed.

298
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,120
Scott: Because they're not just a free-for-all on Steam, right?

299
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,683
Scott: They have this line, but the line is very blurry.

300
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:50,600
Scott: And there's a recent case where these people have made these VR porn games/experiences in which they have scanned in the bodies of actual porn actors.

301
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,320
Scott: Right.

302
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,766
Scott: And replicated them in VR.

303
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:59,479
Scott: So it's not like a video of a real person, but it's like sort of like Mortal Kombat 2, right?

304
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,827
Scott: It's like mocap and you got they scan the person's body.

305
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:08,039
Scott: So it's exactly the 3D model matches the actual real person, probably with some touching up.

306
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:08,400
Scott: Who knows?

307
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:15,100
Scott: And Valve rejected those with somewhat vague messages.

308
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,022
Rym: As they do.

309
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,032
Rym: Valve is super vague about anything related to this.

310
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,140
Rym: Like, no one can figure out what their rules actually are.

311
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,481
Scott: Right.

312
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:31,480
Scott: It's like if you've got rules, right, and you want to draw a line, it's like, OK, but you need to, you know, be explicit, explicit about where your line is.

313
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,760
Scott: The developers, you know, someone who works on a game and is going to sell it, right, you know, and there they announce like, oh, I'm going to release my game on Steam.

314
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Scott: They got to know well in advance, 100 percent certainty whether their game will or will not be allowed on Steam.

315
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,070
Rym: Especially when there's so few marketplaces to sell these things at scale.

316
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,780
Rym: Thus, every marketplace that's large enough has a pseudo monopoly by itself.

317
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,279
Scott: Even if you look at the Switch eShop, there's plenty of, you know, sort of games in there these days.

318
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:02,620
Scott: Right.

319
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,084
Scott: But it's like, you know, it's like you can have a line.

320
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:06,625
Scott: Right.

321
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:15,620
Scott: You know, I said I totally believe that, you know, any private, you know, platform has an absolute right to decide what they are and aren't going to allow.

322
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,262
Scott: Right.

323
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:20,639
Scott: But, A, I might disagree that they're allowing or disallowing the right things.

324
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:28,700
Scott: And B, you need to make it clear to users and, you know, anyone you interact with what your rules are.

325
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Scott: You can't have something vague because that's just being a dick.

326
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,244
Rym: You can't get away with being a dick, the game.

327
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:44,580
Rym: You can't get away with it because these vague rules, if you're going to ban something, you should almost be required if you're a big enough platform.

328
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,282
Scott: Absolutely.

329
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:51,900
Rym: To explicitly state why in detail and your rules will get more and more complex as time goes on.

330
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,840
Rym: You can't get away with doing what our legal system has done for so long with porn of saying, you know, we'll know it when we see it because that is right for abuse.

331
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,980
Scott: If you can't cite your rule and write a rule explicit enough to explain to me why it's banned, you should be legally required to accept it.

332
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,879
Rym: At least if a platform is big enough.

333
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:12,401
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:23,360
Scott: If your mastery of the English language is not strong enough to carve out a rule that fits, then you're going to have to make your rule broader or less broad.

335
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,098
Scott: And if I can find examples of things on your platform that are on the wrong side of the rules, you need to be forced to either adjust your rules or remove or allow.

336
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,944
Scott: People should be able to challenge, right?

337
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:45,040
Scott: Even if it's not my game, like if I see a game on Steam that I think breaks Steam rules, I should be able to challenge that and be like, hey, you're selling a game that breaks your own rules, even though it has nothing to do with me.

338
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:54,739
Rym: The logical conclusion of all this is it leads to a situation a lot like why certain restaurants appear in airports and special protected places.

339
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:12,500
Rym: Because you almost get to a point to where the experts who know how to navigate the arbitrary, capricious, and sometimes entirely random rules of a platform like Steam can themselves be the ones who sneak the content in that other people can't get very similar content in.

340
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:16,880
Rym: So you almost have a market for people who can navigate the Byzantine system.

341
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:25,340
Rym: And that is definitely a dark pattern on any platform where it occurs.

342
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,359
Scott: Steam, get your rules in order, and also if anyone wants, you know, the VR porn apparently is getting way better these days.

343
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:51,700
Rym: So in actually similar news, there was a story, this was back in February, I just didn't get a chance to talk about it, but Facebook has a system that will reject ads that might be offensive or break one of their own rules for advertising, which, as you can guess, are similarly arbitrary.

344
00:23:52,381 --> 00:24:08,120
Rym: But Facebook's automated system to flag advertisements as being allowed or not has generally disallowed any ads about accessible clothing and accessible fashion.

345
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,160
Rym: Like fashion for people in wheelchairs.

346
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:29,380
Rym: It has been a specific problem where companies that sell jeans that are designed for someone who's sitting in a wheelchair, the same products, the ad would be put up on Facebook, the ad with the woman standing is totally okay, the ad with the woman wearing the same clothes in a wheelchair gets rejected by the system.

347
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:35,400
Rym: And the system, because it's machine learning driven, doesn't say specifically what the problem is.

348
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:44,060
Rym: And these companies who try to make these kinds of products are stuck just trying to navigate these arbitrary and random "rules" that no one will help them with.

349
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:51,220
Rym: These inexplicable systems, systems that cannot explain the decisions they make, are dangerous to society.

350
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:52,476
Scott: I agree.

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,661
Rym: Granted.

352
00:24:54,603 --> 00:25:02,340
Rym: Arguably, how many humans can actually explain to a suitable degree why they've made a particular decision?

353
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,606
Scott: I ask that question of lots of people a lot of the time.

354
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,229
Scott: I'm constantly asking.

355
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,472
Scott: Someone will say, "I like

356
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:09,733
Scott: this."

357
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:10,935
Scott: And I'll say, "Why do you like

358
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:11,156
Scott: that?".

359
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:11,937
Scott: People don't know.

360
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,240
Scott: People don't know themselves.

361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:22,253
Scott: I'm not saying I know myself, but I'm always at least attempting and introspecting.

362
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,195
Scott: Why did I do that?

363
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:24,957
Scott: Why do I like this and not that?

364
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,540
Scott: Why didn't I do that the other day?

365
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:37,500
Scott: I'm always meta thinking about everything, but meta thinking about myself, whether I'm successful or not is another story, but at least attempting.

366
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:40,325
Scott: If you ask me a question like, "Why do you like

367
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:40,546
Scott: that?"

368
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,850
Scott: I can at least try to answer it.

369
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,679
Scott: Whereas I find a lot of other people, you ask them a question like that, like, "Why did you do

370
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:47,879
Scott: that?"

371
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,583
Scott: "Why do you like that and not

372
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:51,885
Scott: that?".

373
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,032
Scott: All those sort of self-introspective questions.

374
00:25:56,773 --> 00:26:01,260
Scott: I find a lot of people just have a hard time answering them or they just can't even give an answer.

375
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,799
Scott: I just do like that commercial.

376
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:17,800
Rym: So is it not then possibly hypocritical to say that humans should be making those decisions if arguably humans are not more explicable than some machine learning system?

377
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:27,415
Scott: I think that whether you have a machine learning system or an algorithm or a person making a decision, I think it doesn't matter.

378
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:30,060
Scott: I think you just have to provide an explanation of a decision.

379
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:43,000
Scott: If you can explain the decision, it doesn't matter how you arrived at it, but if you can't provide the reasoning behind it, then even if it was a good decision, you couldn't provide reasoning, so get bent.

380
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:53,560
Rym: I would also argue that even though we can't really explain humans, because granted, if human decision-making were truly explicable, maybe we've proven we don't have free will and all sorts of other weird consequences happen.

381
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,940
Scott: I mean, even if you're wrong about why you decided.

382
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,520
Rym: Well, at least being wrong, you can then be challenged on the specific merits of an individual case.

383
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,940
Scott: Right, at least tell me what your thought process was, even if it was a wrong thought process.

384
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,783
Rym: That's actually kind of how the law works.

385
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:19,280
Rym: That's why we have this concept of precedent generally, because it's the idea that, all right, here's a hundred similar problems and the decisions that were made for those hundred problems.

386
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,984
Rym: Now we're looking at a new problem.

387
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:27,640
Rym: Can we inform how we should deal with this problem by how it was done before, or should we change the rules for some arbitrary reason?

388
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:27,980
Scott: Right.

389
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:43,280
Scott: If you have a machine learning thing that is making that sort of decision that affects real people in that way, you should have to keep the complete logs of every single decision it made, and then at least you can show me, like, why did the machine learning qualify this as rejected?

390
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,391
Scott: What was its path it took through its code to arrive at that?

391
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:49,815
Scott: Present that to me as proof somehow.

392
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,086
Rym: So, oh, god, Meat Lust.

393
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:58,056
Rym: Meat Lust is not a porn game, don't worry, but we, uh...

394
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:09,360
Scott: When I was searching for the Sisterly Lust, I'd randomly on itch.io found a game in the search results called Meat Lust, and it looks just like a real simple Quake-ish kind of thing.

395
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,396
Rym: Quake Half-Life, it looks Half-Life 1-esque.

396
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:17,600
Scott: I don't know if this is good, I just saw a page on itch for it when searching for something else for the show.

397
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,604
Scott: Alright, so one last tiny news here.

398
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:28,760
Scott: So, I don't know how many people used Windows way back in the day, or were even alive then, but Windows and icons are a thing.

399
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:37,780
Scott: Back in the Windows 3.1 in 95 days, changing your icons was actually a big thing, because, like, you didn't even have a start menu, even in Windows 3.1, you didn't really have the start menu.

400
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:48,980
Scott: And you would use, like, desktop icons a lot, and you would customize them, and, you know, I remember I had, like... In college, I would, like, you know, I had to do 10 of desktop once, I had Asumanga.io desktop once, right?

401
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:54,519
Scott: You'd change your icons and your Winamp skins, all that sort of stuff that people don't do anymore these days.

402
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,459
Scott: People just change their phone wallpaper, and then you can't change your phone icons too much.

403
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,200
Scott: But anyway, changing Windows icons was a thing, now people seem like they don't bother.

404
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:08,452
Scott: But it's, all that feature is still there.

405
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:11,700
Scott: It's the same feature it's been since Windows 3.1.

406
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:33,180
Scott: Windows allows you to embed icons, you can have them just sitting around as their own file, like ICO files, or I don't know if you can use pings or JPEGs these days, but... You can just have ICO files lying around, but also, .exe files and .dll files can just sort of, I don't know exactly the format, because I don't do Windows, you know, local, you know, native app programming.

407
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:40,620
Scott: But you can just have icons, like, bundled, you can have a .dll, it has a bunch of code libraries, and also a pile of icons just, like, in there.

408
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:40,994
Scott: Yep.

409
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:57,440
Scott: And then when you go in Windows, if you right-click on, like, a shortcut, and you go to an .exe or something, like, change icon, you can browse to any icon file .exe or .dll on your whole computer, and if there's icons there, you can choose to use that icon instead of the one that is chosen for itself.

410
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:09,140
Scott: Obviously, if an .exe has an icon in it, or icons, whichever one is, like, the primary one is sort of, like, the default, right, for that app, that's why the Photoshop icon is, you know, the Photoshop logo and such.

411
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:35,060
Scott: But yeah, so, Windows, since Windows 95, right, you've had this sort of .dll, the Shell32 .dll that has had all these icons in it, the ones that you know and love, the ones that looks like a document, the one that looks like a folder, the one that looks like a computer, the globe with the sort of ring around it, you know, the microchip, the printer, all these same icons are in there, and they're still used in various places around the system.

412
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,963
Scott: To this day, those icons haven't been changed.

413
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,706
Scott: They're the same Windows 95 icons.

414
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:45,754
Scott: Maybe the resolution increased, but the actual art of the icon has not changed since 26 years.

415
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:48,237
Scott: It's a long time.

416
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,080
Rym: I think the article mentions since Bill Clinton was in his first term.

417
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,281
Scott: Yeah.

418
00:30:55,822 --> 00:31:04,920
Scott: So, the news is that in an upcoming Windows version, you know, if you're using one of those Windows 10, like, early release program things, whatever, you probably have these icons already.

419
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:18,540
Scott: But yeah, coming in some time, perhaps, like, October-ish, later this year, the Windows Update, the big Windows Update, will change those icons that have been unchanged to something slightly newer.

420
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,215
Scott: There'll still be some floppy disks in there and some outdated stuff, but some other outdated stuff will be gone.

421
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,080
Scott: So, that will be interesting.

422
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:32,974
Rym: It's interesting how one of the biggest changes is all the things that were kind of at this three-quarter angle are now facing the user directly.

423
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:35,620
Rym: Like, I feel like that's a specific stylistic change they've made.

424
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:42,380
Scott: Well, that was a stylistic change that they made already, I think, in Windows with a bunch of other things, and now they're just sort of bringing it in line, right?

425
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,463
Rym: Yeah.

426
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:44,185
Rym: Go to the article.

427
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:48,898
Rym: You can see the examples of, like, a bunch of them and exactly what the previous one was, what the new one is.

428
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:49,580
Rym: You'll see what we mean.

429
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,640
Scott: Yeah, but that's still, it's, like, a huge kind of thing that, like, these symbols that have been, like, set in stone for 26 years will just be changed, right?

430
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:08,800
Scott: And the fact that you can just change them, like, it's, like, we have symbols out in public, like, say, let's, you know, when you're driving, they'll be, like, interstate signs.

431
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,966
Scott: Like, Garden State Parkway has that circle, right?

432
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,013
Scott: It's, like, the logo of the Garden State Parkway.

433
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,420
Scott: It's, like, you really can't change that easily.

434
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,580
Scott: You know how much stuff you would have to do to change that if they decided they wanted New Jersey?

435
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,180
Rym: Of course, I would argue it's also almost moot because, one, no one who uses Windows changes the icon of anything anymore.

436
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,920
Scott: I'm just saying, but those icons still show up in places.

437
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,760
Rym: True, but, two, no one uses Windows anymore except at work or if they're a professional.

438
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:44,580
Scott: Right, but to change a symbol, like, a publicly known symbol like these icons are, right, in most places in society, in the physical world, is basically impossible.

439
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,295
Scott: It's, like, you're stuck with whatever they picked in 1950-something, right?

440
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,440
Scott: Whatever your country was made.

441
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,420
Scott: But these icons, because they're software, they can actually be changed.

442
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,462
Rym: Well, I mean, think about it.

443
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:58,253
Rym: To this day, we have fast-forward and rewind.

444
00:32:59,175 --> 00:32:59,978
Rym: Like, that won't change.

445
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:00,740
Rym: That'll never change.

446
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:02,659
Scott: Yeah, you know.

447
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:07,200
Rym: And last, we'll talk about this briefly, but we'll see how this all progresses.

448
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,790
Rym: If you didn't notice, there was actually a significant cyber attack in the U.S.

449
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,840
Rym: against a gas pipeline to the point that it is shut down.

450
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:25,500
Rym: And the President declared a local regional state of emergency because we can't actually distribute petroleum distillates.

451
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:36,420
Rym: Fuel prices are slowly rising, but kind of like the canal situation in the Suez, the longer this thing is down, the worse it could get as time goes on.

452
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:45,318
Rym: Because as much as we want to get away from a fossil fuel society, especially in the Northeast, a lot of things like heating and water stuff are driven by gas.

453
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,360
Rym: Like, not even just cars.

454
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,426
Scott: Yeah, so there's a bunch of things.

455
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,833
Scott: It's like, okay, great, we shut down this pipeline.

456
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:54,240
Scott: If it shuts down forever, it seems great.

457
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,402
Scott: But then you think about it.

458
00:33:55,422 --> 00:34:04,198
Scott: Well, short term, we're in the summer now, but as soon as it becomes winter, if it's not fixed, a lot of people will just be fucking cold and they could die.

459
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,200
Scott: People will die.

460
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,580
Rym: Or like a lot of food still gets delivered with trucks that need regular old gas in their tanks.

461
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:14,620
Rym: Like, we don't have fully electric fleets everywhere delivering random bread to your house.

462
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:26,996
Rym: But the attack appears to be from Russia, but also appears to be a pretty simplistic, uh, it's just a ransomware attack that just happened to hit the infrastructure.

463
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,880
Rym: Like, it's not clear if this was targeted or not.

464
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:32,199
Rym: It's just a normal-ass, like, typical ransomware.

465
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:46,100
Scott: Yeah, the typical pattern these days, and I actually linked in our forum a story about a typical security thing that happened quite along these lines, I'm guessing, at a research institute, like a thing in Europe somewhere.

466
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:56,080
Scott: And basically what happened in that situation, not the pipeline situation, is that there was a student and they wanted, there was some visualization software that they use in the lab and they didn't own it.

467
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,041
Scott: Right?

468
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,165
Scott: So they wanted to, they wanted to get their own copy.

469
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:01,029
Scott: And then they saw that it was hundreds of dollars a month.

470
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,913
Scott: So they pirated it.

471
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,780
Scott: And of course, the pirated software they got was actually, you know, bad.

472
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,466
Scott: Because it's the year of our Lord 2021.

473
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:11,150
Rym: All pirated software is full of malware.

474
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,915
Rym: You don't have a hookup.

475
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,840
Rym: You don't know better and you can't tell.

476
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:24,672
Scott: And then not, now the Windows Defender blocked it, but then the student, I guess, had the wrong permissions and was able to disable the Windows Defender and install it anyway.

477
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:30,960
Scott: And then it was a ransomware and they lost like a week's worth of data to the ransomware.

478
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:36,328
Scott: And basically, but the thing that happened was after the ransomware activated.

479
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:36,929
Scott: Right.

480
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:42,299
Scott: But it didn't, it didn't actually like do anything right away.

481
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:42,419
Scott: Right.

482
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:51,739
Scott: But instead, usually the pattern is most likely that someone is out there trying to like distribute, you know, these, these, you know, attacks.

483
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:51,980
Scott: Right.

484
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,266
Scott: And when they catch someone, they don't, you know, attack them themselves.

485
00:35:56,646 --> 00:36:00,411
Scott: They sell, they're like, Hey, I've got SSH access to this server.

486
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:07,080
Scott: You know, anyone out there want to pay me money and I will give you the access and you can do what you want to do.

487
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,641
Scott: Right.

488
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:11,551
Scott: It's like, you know, Hey, I've hacked into this oil pipeline.

489
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:13,135
Scott: Who wants to attack it?

490
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:13,657
Scott: Anybody?

491
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:14,138
Scott: Anybody?

492
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:14,940
Scott: How much will you pay?

493
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,065
Scott: You know, a hundred dollars, a thousand dollars, a million dollars.

494
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:18,266
Scott: Right.

495
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:18,887
Scott: Who wants it?

496
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:20,289
Scott: And then they take their money.

497
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,896
Scott: And then the other person, well, they obviously were willing to pay money.

498
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,080
Scott: They want to do damage and they do the damage.

499
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:31,360
Scott: Or they're hoping they can get more of right ransoming than they can buy, you know, or who knows.

500
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,954
Rym: Now, the fascinating part is we don't know yet exactly how they got into this.

501
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,500
Rym: Like, read the articles, like go.

502
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,700
Scott: Probably a poorly secured Windows computer and someone doing something foolish.

503
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:47,050
Rym: Well, it seems like this is probably the same thing that happened when that water system got hacked.

504
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:53,400
Rym: Someone had a team viewer or a Microsoft remote desktop because they're working from home during covid.

505
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,302
Rym: And there wasn't a good way to do that.

506
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:58,766
Rym: So the the people who run this thing just hacked something together.

507
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:10,060
Rym: And there's a lot of easily guessable or easily compromised remote desktop ways to get to otherwise completely unsecure systems that never had remote access capabilities.

508
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:14,180
Scott: The computers that control a pipeline should be air gats, period.

509
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:21,996
Rym: Remember the movie Mission Impossible, where they had to break into a building to get to the sensitive computer because it was not connected to the Internet?

510
00:37:22,356 --> 00:37:23,018
Rym: That's real.

511
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:24,160
Rym: And that needs to happen.

512
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,401
Scott: Yes.

513
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:36,400
Scott: Every computer that controls essential infrastructure that is of national security importance should have no connection to the Internet and should be never allowed to connect to the Internet ever under any circumstance.

514
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:45,400
Rym: And if you need to give someone remote access to do a job, that has to be an extremely hardened, special means of access.

515
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,322
Scott: No, there's a real easy way to do it, actually.

516
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,346
Scott: Let's say there's an oil expert.

517
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:51,886
Scott: Right.

518
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:56,912
Scott: And they need to remote access to the computers at the oil place.

519
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:57,453
Scott: Right.

520
00:37:57,913 --> 00:37:59,715
Scott: Well, you just and they can't get there.

521
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:00,196
Scott: Right.

522
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:01,658
Scott: For some reason, they're at a wedding.

523
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:03,700
Scott: You just have another person.

524
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:07,966
Rym: Well, the situation here is this is no one who is going to these places because of Covid.

525
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,229
Scott: Obviously, you need to have one person there.

526
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:18,760
Scott: And then even if it's just a person who doesn't even know anything about the oil pipeline, they just know that they just know how to use a mouse and a keyboard and to read the screen English.

527
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,949
Scott: They can call the oil expert on the phone, take pictures of the screen with their phone and like, tell me what to click on, dude.

528
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:27,112
Scott: You know, there are.

529
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:31,940
Rym: there are ways to make secure remote access to certain kinds of systems.

530
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:42,200
Rym: But you'd probably even then want that secure remote access to go to a system that itself is, even if not fully air gapped, at least has some sort of gap between the production systems that do the thing.

531
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,124
Scott: You could even have them on a network.

532
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,306
Scott: That's just not the Internet.

533
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:45,487
Scott: Right.

534
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:46,609
Scott: Their own separate network.

535
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:51,800
Scott: You could network together like I guess it would make it a higher profile target itself.

536
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:59,560
Scott: But if you network, say, like two oil pipelines together, as long as one of the two oil pipelines has a person added, they can handle both of them.

537
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,427
Rym: That's how a lot of very secure things are in the world is?

538
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:07,660
Rym: there are private circuits that connect data centers or cages within data centers directly.

539
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,264
Scott: As long as there's no Internet access, that's not too bad.

540
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:11,605
Scott: Right.

541
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:20,680
Rym: It's like, you know, it's better than a team viewer with a default password that's easily guessed that connects to a like Windows box that doesn't even have a password on it.

542
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:21,281
Scott: Right.

543
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:27,731
Scott: The point is, is that never pirate software in the year 2021 because it's just a security problem.

544
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:30,035
Scott: And yeah.

545
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:33,400
Scott: And also that, you know, the situations like this.

546
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:40,813
Scott: Both of these situations are security problems caused by people not willing to spend money.

547
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:41,053
Scott: Right.

548
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:45,140
Scott: You weren't willing to spend the money to hire someone to actually go to the oil pipe.

549
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:54,680
Scott: But you weren't willing to buy your student the expensive software license, the software license, the company that makes the software was overcharging for hundreds of dollars a month for some, you know, visualizations.

550
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,626
Scott: Well, so I remember an RIT as an example, though.

551
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:04,480
Rym: While the software I needed to do a bunch of my labs was expensive software, the school provided it in labs.

552
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,500
Rym: The only reason I pirated that software is that I did not want to have to go to the lab.

553
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,541
Scott: Right.

554
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:11,382
Scott: But it's like.

555
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:16,050
Scott: there's, you know, there's the level of, yes, security best practices were not being followed.

556
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:16,571
Scott: Right.

557
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:21,360
Scott: You know, but if they were being followed, that would have created a huge hassle and problems.

558
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,580
Scott: Right.

559
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,949
Scott: The student wouldn't have had the software to do their work.

560
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,040
Scott: The person, you know, at the oil pipeline would have had to gone in and risk their life or something.

561
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,405
Rym: But maybe an oil pipeline is important enough to where you should spend the money to secure it.

562
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:33,786
Scott: Right.

563
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:46,140
Scott: If people not spending, if you spend the money right to provide people with what they need, then you not only help people, but you also, you know, shore up your security.

564
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,541
Scott: Right.

565
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:50,487
Scott: If people are have food, you ever heard the term food security?

566
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:53,211
Scott: You're going to have less people doing crimes.

567
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:57,438
Scott: You're helping out security of like the grocery store by giving out free food.

568
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:58,038
Scott: Right.

569
00:40:58,058 --> 00:40:59,000
Scott: To people who are hungry.

570
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:03,507
Scott: You think you're hurting the grocery store by giving out free food.

571
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:05,411
Scott: It's like because you're competing with the grocery store.

572
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:09,980
Scott: It's like, no, you know, less starving people means people aren't robbing the grocery store.

573
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,300
Rym: Yep.

574
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,983
Rym: Or you've got someone who has a very sensitive security job.

575
00:41:13,364 --> 00:41:22,673
Rym: Make sure they're not struggling and poor because the poorer and more struggling they are, the more temptation there is to game the system in some way.

576
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:27,158
Rym: They're more compromise-able by the nature of society and the nature of humans.

577
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:29,020
Rym: Just got to have a hustle and you got to survive.

578
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:30,101
Scott: Yep.

579
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:43,477
Scott: So I think, you know, the lack of support for the, you know, the small, the laborer, right, is definitely hurting the, you know, the wealthy person in terms of causing them security problems.

580
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:43,978
Scott: Right.

581
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:46,060
Scott: By not paying people.

582
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:47,848
Scott: So we're going to see more and more of that.

583
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:50,379
Scott: Not that we haven't seen a ton of it already.

584
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,063
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

585
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:09,680
Rym: I found this randomly, like literally randomly, I think because I was watching a lot of DMX videos and independently I'd been watching a lot of music theory videos, a few of which had been focused on David Bowie.

586
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,285
Rym: And I saw a video that was titled DMX Meets David Bowie.

587
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,188
Rym: And it was about four minutes long.

588
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:21,294
Rym: And it looked and felt like it was going to be a mashup, like some sort of song.

589
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,916
Scott: That's what I'm imagining it's going to be.

590
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:23,697
Rym: That's what I expected.

591
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:25,359
Scott: So I clicked on it.

592
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,520
Scott: You're saying it's not a mashup?

593
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,145
Rym: So it ends up having a mashup song at the end.

594
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:41,800
Rym: It's actually a comedy skit that is David Bowie being woken up in his house by DMX, who wants to hang out and play video games and board games.

595
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:52,673
Rym: And both of them, it's like they use a bunch of interview audio from David Bowie being interviewed and a bunch of DMX singing audio and they cut together dialogue.

596
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:59,040
Rym: And it's like a whole episode of a sitcom where David Bowie and DMX are friends and play games together.

597
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,000
Scott: Well, rest in peace to those two legends.

598
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:02,780
Rym: Exactly.

599
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:06,164
Rym: And at the end, it turns it like it's actually legitimately funny.

600
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:11,731
Rym: It surprised me at how funny and simultaneously wholesome it is.

601
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:14,815
Rym: Like what it is is like really wholesome.

602
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:19,340
Rym: And then at the end, they sing a duet together and it's actually pretty touching.

603
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:20,420
Scott: Okay.

604
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,419
Rym: I was just surprised at how good this thing was.

605
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,527
Scott: I got a very Rym thing of the day.

606
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:26,418
Scott: This is ThemeParkBrochures.net.

607
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:28,934
Rym: Oh, but why would I want anything but Cedar Point or...

608
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,820
Scott: They got that on there.

609
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:31,778
Scott: Of course they got that on there.

610
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,404
Scott: So this website has two things, basically.

611
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:36,347
Scott: It's very, it seems like it's early days.

612
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:44,200
Scott: I don't know how long the site has been around, but it doesn't have, it has a lot of content, enough to be interesting, but they're looking for more.

613
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:54,260
Scott: So if you've ever been on vacation, at least in the United States, I don't know about other countries, if you're in a vacation place, like a tourist town and you're in like a hotel, even in New York City, you'll see these.

614
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:59,600
Scott: You go into a hotel and in the front of the hotel, there'll be like this little stand or at a rest stop on the highway.

615
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,263
Rym: Oh my God.

616
00:44:00,564 --> 00:44:03,899
Rym: A highway rest stop or diner off of a freeway.

617
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,519
Scott: Oh yeah.

618
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,840
Scott: It'll be in the foyer of the diner.

619
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:16,420
Scott: It's a little wooden stand and it'll be full of tri-fold brochures that are just advertisements for all the things in the area.

620
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,453
Rym: Like, "Hey, the world's biggest pile of dung is over here.

621
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:21,517
Rym: Two miles that way.

622
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:21,858
Rym: Exit

623
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:23,121
Rym: 44.".

624
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:31,798
Scott: So pretty much every theme park in the United States has a brochure of this nature and distributes it to all the nearby wooden stands, rest stops.

625
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,416
Scott: And the bigger a theme park you are, the wider you distribute your little brochure.

626
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,000
Scott: They also, every theme park, even today with advent of phones, they're needed less, but they still exist as maps.

627
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:49,100
Scott: Even Disney World, especially big complex place like that, but even small places, people need a map.

628
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,620
Scott: They need to know where that roller coaster is, where the water slide is, where the toilet is.

629
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:58,819
Scott: And the maps were typically, I think even still, like these little cute hand-drawn things.

630
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,564
Scott: Little miniature representations.

631
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:02,907
Scott: They're really fun.

632
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:07,380
Scott: They give you that sort of same feeling as like video game map, RPG map.

633
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:10,985
Scott: Which place do you want to go to?

634
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:18,980
Scott: And I think I feel a lot of that same fun if I'm at an amusement park with a map that I feel when I'm playing an RPG or a video game or reading a fantasy novel.

635
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,694
Rym: Yeah, you're looking at the map and you're like, "Ooh, the Mystic Cave is up in the top left of the park.

636
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:25,420
Rym: Let's go over and see what the Mystic Cave

637
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,480
Rym: is.".

638
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,562
Scott: That's right.

639
00:45:26,582 --> 00:45:26,903
Scott: That's right.

640
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:27,525
Scott: Exactly.

641
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:31,440
Scott: You're real disappointed when you see one, you get there, it's closed, stuff like that.

642
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:39,117
Scott: I really do think, so this website obviously is an archive of brochures and maps from theme parks in the United States and perhaps elsewhere.

643
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:40,200
Scott: I don't know if they have any elsewheres.

644
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:44,840
Rym: Over a long period of time- There's definitely some Canada, because I see Canada Wonderland here.

645
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,962
Scott: Okay.

646
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:47,786
Scott: They've got enough to be interesting.

647
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:54,860
Scott: They got old enough to be interesting, but you could probably easily find some in your possession that you could upload to them.

648
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,085
Rym: Oh, I definitely could.

649
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,591
Rym: It is far from complete.

650
00:45:57,651 --> 00:45:59,780
Rym: Cedar Point is pretty underrepresented here.

651
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,689
Scott: Yeah, they have some Cedar Points on them.

652
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,820
Rym: A few, but way fewer than I would have expected.

653
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:08,428
Scott: But yeah, you got to imagine you could get one from every single year for most of these places.

654
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:14,000
Scott: They're updating them somewhat frequently or every time they add a ride or update an attraction, they're changing their map or something.

655
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,420
Rym: That's good stuff.

656
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:23,535
Scott: But yeah, I think this is really useful because A, fun for people who like theme parks, but also B, the maps would be useful.

657
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:26,140
Scott: You could just take one of these maps and play an RPG.

658
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,110
Scott: There is an RPG.

659
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,520
Scott: Isn't there a tabletop RPG that has kids on bikes or something?

660
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,481
Scott: Yeah.

661
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:34,242
Rym: Oh, you know what you could do?

662
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:35,604
Rym: You could make an RPG.

663
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:36,565
Rym: There's the idea.

664
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:39,849
Rym: But the RPG is get one of those brochures.

665
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:48,120
Rym: Everyone has to go to a diner, like you're on a road trip, get a bunch of those brochures, and the game is designed to be run solely from the content in those brochures.

666
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,464
Scott: Something like that.

667
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:51,681
Scott: But yeah, you could just take a map- Aw shit!

668
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:52,848
Rym: Terror on Church Street.

669
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,920
Rym: This is, in fact, the brochure I remember.

670
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,806
Scott: You could take the map from any theme park and just sort of translate it to a fantasy world, right?

671
00:47:00,907 --> 00:47:06,094
Scott: It's like, you know, instead of calling, you know, the something something is a roller coaster, right?

672
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:07,916
Scott: It's like, you know, the Batman roller coaster.

673
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:08,537
Scott: It's like, no, no, no.

674
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,540
Scott: There's actually, that's a Batman over there.

675
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,084
Scott: It's like, you know, what's that?

676
00:47:13,104 --> 00:47:14,205
Scott: Well, that's the roundup.

677
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:15,708
Scott: What's the, what's the roundup?

678
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:23,120
Scott: It's actually, you know, it's not, you know, it's a ride that spins and goes up and down, but you know, just imagine what the roundup would be in fantasy world, right?

679
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:25,612
Scott: And suddenly you've got yourself an RPG map, you know?

680
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:27,340
Scott: So yeah.

681
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,283
Rym: It's good stuff.

682
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,460
Rym: In the meta moment, uh, we're still stuck inside.

683
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:33,220
Rym: Yep.

684
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,105
Rym: That's what I got.

685
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:43,150
Scott: Still slowly- There is gonna be a PAX East Online, which is basically, all the online PAXes, all online conventions are basically world PAXes.

686
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:49,900
Scott: The only thing geographical about the PAX East Online is that the time zone of the schedule will be East-ish.

687
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,940
Scott: Whereas the previous PAX Online has a West and Australian timed schedule.

688
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,386
Scott: But you can watch everything post-PAC.

689
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:59,331
Scott: You don't need to watch them live, right?

690
00:47:59,371 --> 00:48:02,640
Scott: So, and the panel submissions for PAX East Online are up.

691
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,180
Rym: I've literally got that open in a tab because we got to decide what panel or panels we want to do.

692
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:08,342
Scott: Yep.

693
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:09,779
Scott: So that's a, I guess that's a thing.

694
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,900
Rym: I think I want to try to do a new panel or at least something like radically different from what we've done recently.

695
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:15,984
Scott: Sure.

696
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:16,880
Scott: Yeah, we'll do something.

697
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:19,169
Rym: I'm not doing that game economy loop one though.

698
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,117
Rym: I'm still doing primary research.

699
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:21,920
Rym: That's gonna take a while.

700
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:23,862
Scott: Yeah.

701
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:24,704
Scott: Um, yeah, I don't know.

702
00:48:24,724 --> 00:48:30,300
Scott: Is there any other- The Book Club book is the first novel ever written by human beings, The Tale of Genji.

703
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:30,680
Scott: Yep.

704
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,529
Rym: It's starting to get warm enough to where soon I can sit outside and read when I'm idle, which means I'm gonna probably power through the book.

705
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:43,300
Rym: I'll bet- I don't know, I'm thinking about when- I feel like it's sometime toward the end of June I might be done with the book.

706
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:46,359
Rym: If it's warm enough for me to hang out in a park and just read.

707
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:49,088
Scott: Well, I hope so.

708
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:52,240
Scott: I'm making somewhat progress, but I got distracted by some other things lately.

709
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,423
Scott: Anything else going on?

710
00:48:54,443 --> 00:48:54,844
Scott: I don't know.

711
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:59,800
Scott: If you're somehow listening to this, I don't know how it's possible and you don't know who we are, you don't know anything else.

712
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:02,727
Scott: We have an internet presence on every single platform.

713
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:05,253
Scott: that matters basically, that you know of.

714
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:06,135
Scott: All the major ones.

715
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:07,880
Scott: At least all the major English ones.

716
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:17,277
Scott: So come and wherever it is that you like to be on the internet, whatever site it is or app it is that you use, we're there in some fashion.

717
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:18,660
Scott: Come find us.

718
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,724
Scott: A lot of the podcast platforms are adding more features.

719
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:30,057
Scott: Spotify, I think, as I read today, they're adding the ability to link to a specific time in a podcast, which YouTube does for videos.

720
00:49:30,658 --> 00:49:31,800
Scott: We're also on YouTube, by the way.

721
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,819
Rym: Yeah, we're live streaming to YouTube right now.

722
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:38,619
Scott: So yeah, you know, just come find us wherever the place you like to be is.

723
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:39,801
Rym: Yeah.

724
00:49:40,623 --> 00:49:41,705
Scott: Let's get right into it.

725
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:44,310
Rym: So, remote controls.

726
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:48,920
Rym: I don't know how much we have to say, but I think there's something to say here because it's another one of those...

727
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,788
Scott: We're running out of Monday ideas.

728
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:50,980
Scott: Send your Monday ideas to...

729
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:59,577
Rym: But it's another one of those things where they did not exist or were rare when we were young.

730
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,060
Rym: They proliferate...

731
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,929
Scott: The first several televisions I had were not remote controlled.

732
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:11,160
Scott: You had to get up and physically turn a dial on the television in order to set the channel.

733
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,419
Rym: Often multiple dials like switch to UHF.

734
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,273
Scott: We had a UHF, we had two dials, the VHF dial, but the VHF dial had one channel, which was UHF.

735
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:22,000
Scott: And if you switch to that, then the UHF dial would matter.

736
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:25,746
Rym: And then you could go to the high channel, like channel 56 or whatever.

737
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:30,133
Rym: And then we actually had a third thing that we had to control physically.

738
00:50:30,453 --> 00:50:33,478
Rym: What it did is it rotated the antenna on our roof.

739
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:34,580
Rym: Our antenna was directional.

740
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,540
Scott: We just had ears on the television that we would just adjust.

741
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:44,720
Rym: Oh wow, we had a gigantic color roof antenna that was wired to the whole house, and there was a control box that was physical.

742
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,700
Rym: And you could rotate it to the geographic direction you wanted it to point, like the coordinates, and it would slowly tick as it rotated on the roof.

743
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:01,600
Rym: And there were a few channels where we had a little cheat sheet next to it, where if you wanted to watch that channel, you want to rotate it to point at the source, so the quality would be better.

744
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,021
Rym: And channel 9 from Canada, we couldn't see it all, so we pointed it at channel 9.

745
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,508
Scott: We had a roof antenna, but we didn't have to point it.

746
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:12,600
Scott: I think also part of that is because we were in such an area between New York and Connecticut.

747
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,040
Scott: We basically just had all the New York and Connecticut stations were just really strong, so we didn't need to mess around.

748
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,071
Rym: We mostly had to point it if we wanted the central time zone stuff, which we could kind of get.

749
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:24,180
Rym: We also had to point it if we wanted the Canadian stuff.

750
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:26,220
Scott: Anyway, that's not remote control really.

751
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:33,374
Rym: Because it was a thing that even when we had a TV, a color TV, that had a remote control, that 1974 color RCA that you knew and loved.

752
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:44,220
Rym: And even when we had a remote, we still had to get up and go over to the TV anytime we wanted to move that stupid antenna.

753
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:50,540
Rym: So we still had to physically go fuck with the TV on a semi-regular basis, despite having our remote control.

754
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:53,224
Scott: Yup.

755
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,386
Scott: Just anecdotally, right?

756
00:51:54,406 --> 00:52:01,659
Scott: So even at the time when we had all the TVs in the house, all the frequently used living room, bedroom type ones were color and gray.

757
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,006
Scott: They were still CRTs, but they were better, right?

758
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:13,660
Scott: In the kitchen for the longest time in the kitchen, we had the tiny black and white TV with its own little antennas.

759
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:20,020
Scott: Because the only thing that TV ever watched was ABC World News Tonight and Jeopardy.

760
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:23,949
Rym: That black and white TV was If You Want to Watch TV in the Kitchen.

761
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:27,860
Rym: And then later, because you could see it from the kitchen, you couldn't see the real TV from the kitchen.

762
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:34,700
Rym: But then later, that was the TV the Atari 7800 was plugged into, because the NES was plugged into the big TV.

763
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,626
Scott: Anyway, so remote controls weren't exist.

764
00:52:37,646 --> 00:52:40,916
Scott: So when we finally got remote controls, it was like, "Oh yes, I don't have to get it from the

765
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:41,217
Scott: couch.".

766
00:52:41,237 --> 00:52:42,200
Scott: It was such a huge deal.

767
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,639
Scott: I don't think people realize how big a deal that was, right?

768
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:48,880
Rym: It's like you'd be watching something.

769
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,258
Scott: The amount of luxury that you had, right, to be able to just turn the channel without getting up and to go through them quickly, right?

770
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,659
Scott: It's just like, yeah, and you'll adjust the volume.

771
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,463
Rym: It changed how people, like.

772
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:07,700
Rym: it's a simple technology that I don't think you, like you have to understand how much it changed how people interacted with TV.

773
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:13,439
Rym: Which was the primary source of pop culture entertainment for almost everyone in America at the time.

774
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:17,400
Scott: So, channel surfing was not a thing before the remote control.

775
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:26,200
Scott: You would be on a channel and you like, you wouldn't want, because you were lazy and didn't want to change the channel, you would sit through commercials more likely.

776
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,395
Scott: As soon as you had remote control, it's like, "Don't got to sit through that shit anymore.

777
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:29,857
Scott: Click, click,

778
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:30,099
Scott: click.".

779
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:33,064
Rym: I remember advertisers, like.

780
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:42,300
Rym: there was a moderate, short-lived public discourse about how the remote control would end television because people would just change the channel anytime an ad came on.

781
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,540
Scott: We did.

782
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,342
Rym: We did change the channel every time an ad came on.

783
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:59,780
Rym: Somehow TV survived, but also you get the situation where there used to be huge inertia between a show that ended leading an audience into the show that came on next on that channel.

784
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:07,100
Rym: Once the remote came, that effect actually persisted to a significant degree, but it wasn't nearly as powerful.

785
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:08,221
Scott: Nope.

786
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:15,760
Scott: So, remote controls, I think, for consumers at least, started for television, and the way most of them work and still work is with infrared.

787
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:24,060
Scott: There's basically a little infrared light bulb in the remote control, and every button on the remote, you push it and it blinks the infrared light bulb.

788
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,480
Rym: It's a really simple signal.

789
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,140
Scott: Yeah, with a specific pattern for each button, and on the TV, there's basically an infrared sensor, right?

790
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,300
Scott: Sort of like the same one that's in a Game Boy Color on the front, right?

791
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:47,480
Scott: And it detects when infrared light blinks at it in a certain pattern, and then the TV behaves according to whatever, so if it received the blinking pattern, sort of like a Morse code you could think of it as, right?

792
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,989
Scott: For volume up, the TV turns its volume up.

793
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,400
Scott: If it received the signal from volume down, it goes down, right?

794
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:56,600
Scott: The problem was that every TV decided on different signals for the different buttons.

795
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,660
Scott: Different TVs had different buttons on their remotes, right?

796
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,995
Scott: So then you had VCRs getting in the picture, right?

797
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:12,800
Rym: Sometimes you'd have a TV that would detect the wrong signals, like if you had two TVs in your house, one of them would partially fuck with the other TV, but not in a reliable way.

798
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,669
Rym: If they were next to each other, right?

799
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:17,120
Scott: If you had line of sight to both TVs from where you were sitting.

800
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:17,680
Rym: Yep.

801
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:30,860
Rym: We had a giant mirror in our kitchen, or in our dining room/kitchen area, and another giant mirror opposite it in a different room in the living room, and you could basically work the remote from almost anywhere in the house because of that.

802
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:32,583
Scott: Yeah, that'll do it.

803
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:34,310
Scott: I mean, infrared light is just light.

804
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:37,060
Scott: You can't see it because you have stupid shitty human eyeballs.

805
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,271
Scott: If you put on night vision goggles, you can see it.

806
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,680
Scott: It's just a light bulb blinking.

807
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:41,701
Rym: Yeah.

808
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:42,732
Rym: In fact, I remember as a kid...

809
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,527
Scott: We could have used actual light bulbs to do this.

810
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:49,240
Scott: We didn't need to use infrared ones, but infrared ones were just better.

811
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:50,940
Rym: When I was a kid, I learned it was infrared.

812
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,560
Scott: You don't bother people by blinking.

813
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:58,472
Rym: We had this simple thermometer that was like a strip of almost film strip.

814
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:02,780
Rym: You hold it up to your forehead, and it would turn colors, and it was basically like a very simple thermometer.

815
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:08,757
Rym: But if you just held it in front of a remote control, and hit the power button and a bunch of buttons, it would basically show a fever.

816
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:17,260
Rym: So, you could point the remote control at this thing, make it show a fever, then hold it on your head, and then show your parents that you had a fever in school.

817
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:22,140
Rym: That worked exactly zero times because my parents figured out exactly what I was doing.

818
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:24,859
Scott: Well, they can just touch your head and be like, "This makes no

819
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:24,980
Scott: sense.".

820
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,331
Rym: Yeah, they were like, "Eh, let's use the real thermometer.

821
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:27,411
Rym: Huh.

822
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:28,617
Rym: No fever.

823
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:28,697
Rym: Huh.".

824
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,614
Rym: And you have the remote control in your bed for some reason.

825
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:33,920
Rym: That's where it went.

826
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,001
Scott: Okay.

827
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,720
Scott: Yeah, losing the remote became a thing.

828
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:47,860
Scott: But this technology for remote controlling the TV was somewhat actually slowly, but at least from my perspective, applied to other things.

829
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,708
Scott: I have a remote control fan over here.

830
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:56,480
Scott: Remote control lights in your house are still not common.

831
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,460
Rym: Bit by bit, there was a boom of a lot of things started to have their own remote controls that were all proprietary.

832
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,275
Rym: But then bit by bit, there was just too much proliferation.

833
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:07,240
Rym: People didn't care that much.

834
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,847
Scott: I guess it doesn't make sense to have a remote control.

835
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:11,500
Scott: It's like you really need a microwave for the remote control, right?

836
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:16,100
Rym: Only if I could somehow have the microwave go get the food and put it in itself.

837
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,420
Scott: Right.

838
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:25,240
Scott: It's like you could remote control basically any electronic device, but you need a good reason to do that.

839
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,444
Scott: You've got car remote door openers.

840
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:35,100
Scott: Those are not infrared because your car might be far away from where you are and not have line of sight to it.

841
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:43,280
Rym: But the thing about remote controls is that all these early remote controls had zero security whatsoever because it didn't seem like it mattered.

842
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:47,955
Rym: Someone can change the channel on your television, okay?

843
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:49,240
Rym: That's what it's for.

844
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,651
Rym: You can occasionally prank people by changing the channel through their window.

845
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,420
Rym: if you knew what kind of TV they had and you had a remote that would work.

846
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,940
Rym: But garage door openers became a big problem because I remember in the 80s and early 90s, a lot of them used a very small number of codes.

847
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:11,060
Rym: And it was very common for one person to have a garage door opener that would open like three other random garages in the neighborhood.

848
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,040
Scott: Yeah.

849
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:21,440
Scott: If you open up, I guess, I don't know how the newer ones work, but like just any garage door opener or remote car door opener, unlocker thing, you open them up.

850
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,280
Scott: And basically what you'll see is there's going to be a little set of dip switches, right?

851
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:29,209
Scott: And you know, there'll be, I don't know how many, right?

852
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,257
Scott: But you only, if you have like, you got to think, right?

853
00:58:31,477 --> 00:58:32,220
Scott: They're all binary.

854
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:39,859
Scott: So if you got like eight switches, that's like, you know, what, two to the eighth or whatever, eight, I don't forget the binary, two to the eighth or eight squared, I don't know.

855
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:46,057
Scott: My math is bad right now in binary, but you got, there's a lot of possible combinations, right?

856
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:47,867
Rym: So the odds of you conflicting- Don't you just want a factorial?

857
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:49,440
Rym: I guess it depends on the symmetry.

858
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,404
Scott: It's just binary, right?

859
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:55,460
Scott: It's like, if you've got eight, eight bits is how many possible combinations, right?

860
00:58:55,921 --> 00:59:01,560
Rym: Of course, the real problem was they were, you, all these early remote controls used fixed codes.

861
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,400
Rym: They use like, this is the signal that will open this garage door all the time.

862
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:14,840
Scott: The idea was that you would ship them with, you know, a different, you know, you'd key in a different one at the factory on to each one.

863
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,500
Scott: So the, you know, two people buy one from the same hardware store, they won't get the same code.

864
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:25,526
Scott: But I remember the one my grandparents had, because we didn't have a garage, but the one my grandparents had, the actual dip switches were exposed.

865
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:34,920
Scott: So if you could find someone in the neighborhood, you obviously had to remember your little, your dip switch configuration or else you wouldn't be able to open your own garage door.

866
00:59:37,143 --> 00:59:41,040
Scott: But I guess if you had the key, you could get into the garage and re-figure it out, right?

867
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:47,920
Scott: But you could go around the neighborhood and flick the switches and try to open up other people's garage doors if they had the same garage door opener.

868
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:57,580
Rym: I guess it's just interesting that even in these early days, there was proto, like not internet of things, but it was suddenly we have remote access to things to control them.

869
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:01,620
Rym: And nobody put even the barest thought into security at first.

870
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,940
Scott: They put the barest thought, they figured that that would be good enough.

871
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,540
Scott: What are the odds that two people are going to pick the same code and have the same garage door opener in the same place?

872
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:14,360
Rym: Yeah, but what they didn't think about is a nefarious actor who would just, like you could pretty easily try a lot of combinations.

873
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:19,320
Scott: What are the odds that two people have the same garage door opener in the same neighborhood with the same evil, right?

874
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,860
Rym: Yeah, except in my, in practice, like in my own life, it happened constantly everywhere I ever lived due to the density of houses.

875
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:26,780
Scott: Yeah.

876
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:40,200
Scott: Well also people wouldn't, you know, in those days it would have been very much more difficult to say it would be easy to do this now, but to just make a computerized radio that attempts to open every possible garage door opener brand with every possible code.

877
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:44,458
Scott: So you just go up to any garage, they have this actually, the TV be gone, right?

878
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:44,840
Scott: That thing?

879
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:58,660
Scott: It's like you just push it and aim it at a TV in like a bar and it tries to tell it to turn off using every infrared pattern for every major television brand and you wait a while, eventually it'll turn that TV off.

880
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,620
Scott: Sooner or later it'll find the right code to get that TV to turn itself off.

881
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:02,921
Scott: Yup.

882
01:01:03,562 --> 01:01:07,249
Rym: And there's really no way to see, like there's no point in securing something like that.

883
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:12,860
Rym: Like put a piece of tape over it and don't use the remote if you actually care about like the security of controlling that TV.

884
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:13,620
Scott: Right.

885
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,261
Scott: Exactly.

886
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:18,548
Scott: So, you know, garage door opener, it's like you would need like a radio on whatever frequency it is, right?

887
01:01:18,568 --> 01:01:20,150
Scott: Some whatever megahertz, right?

888
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:26,340
Scott: That's broadcasting every possible signal to get garage doors to open in a sequence really fast.

889
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:28,424
Scott: As fast as you can, right?

890
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:30,270
Scott: Because you can't do it super fast.

891
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,653
Scott: You have to do one after the other, right?

892
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:33,980
Scott: Because if you mix them together, well, they just interfere with each other.

893
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,721
Rym: Right.

894
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:43,620
Rym: But I guess the other interesting thing that happened with like remote controls, especially on TVs, is that it opened up a secondary market that previously hadn't existed.

895
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:52,520
Rym: Like for third parties to, one, people would like buy and sell old remotes, like have an extra remote could be useful if you lost yours or you broke it or something.

896
01:01:52,961 --> 01:01:59,460
Rym: But two, people started making generic remote controls, universal remote controls, and configurable remote controls.

897
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,200
Scott: Right.

898
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,831
Scott: Well, because it's like even though the patterns were different on every device, right?

899
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:06,057
Scott: People, A, had two problems they wanted to solve, right?

900
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,147
Scott: Problem one, my remote is lost or broken.

901
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,409
Scott: I can't get the original one.

902
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:13,213
Scott: Maybe it's not even possible to get it anymore.

903
01:02:13,654 --> 01:02:16,020
Scott: I'll just buy this remote that works with any possible TV.

904
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:20,869
Scott: And it has in it programmed all the patterns for all the TVs.

905
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:26,979
Scott: because the person who made this remote collected a bunch of remotes and wrote down all the signals, right?

906
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,324
Rym: It's easy to figure out.

907
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,658
Rym: You hit a button, see what signal comes out, hit another button, see what signal comes out.

908
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:32,120
Rym: Like that's it.

909
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:32,701
Scott: Exactly.

910
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:38,453
Scott: You're like, okay, volume up on the Samsung TV is two and volume down is three.

911
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:41,720
Scott: On the Magnavox TV, up is four and down is five, right?

912
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:50,614
Scott: So you just need to put all that in the memory of one little circuit on your remote and people type in a number.

913
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:54,340
Scott: In the book, you would say type in this number for this TV brand and poof, there you go.

914
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,583
Scott: The remote is now doing what your original remote would do.

915
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:06,870
Scott: But also, people had VCRs and cable boxes back in the day and those had their own remotes.

916
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,994
Scott: You'd have three remotes and it was a pain in the ass.

917
01:03:09,054 --> 01:03:18,790
Scott: But theoretically, if you set everything up right, there was a way to do it where you could have the cable box or usually the VCR remote would be like the best one.

918
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:19,211
Rym: Yep.

919
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:23,830
Rym: The VCR remote was the one that had all the buttons you needed to control the other devices eventually.

920
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:37,610
Scott: So if you wired it up wisely and everything worked together and cleverly, you could make it such to where the VCR remote would, via the VCR, control the other devices.

921
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:46,550
Scott: You would turn the VCR on, the TV and the cable box would then turn on on their own because they were plugged into the VCR or into each other and then into the VCR.

922
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:49,677
Scott: And then you would change channels on the VCR.

923
01:03:49,697 --> 01:03:55,310
Scott: The TV would be stuck on channel 3 but the cable would go into the VCR which would then go to the TV.

924
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:03,230
Scott: And so when you change channels on the VCR, the TV channel would be changing because the VCR is converting it to channel 3.

925
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,276
Scott: And then if you played a movie on the VCR, it's like alright, you're playing a movie now.

926
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:08,321
Scott: Just ignore whatever the cable box is doing.

927
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:12,910
Scott: You could just use that VCR remote for everything if you did it right and almost no one did it right.

928
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:19,126
Rym: Yep, we had our system set up very tightly in my house but we watched a lot of TV and that was very important to us.

929
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,610
Rym: so we spent a lot of time making everything work.

930
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:30,850
Scott: But yeah, so what you'd end up doing is you'd get this universal remote that would instead be able to control all the different devices and switch between them.

931
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:37,130
Scott: You'd push a button on it for VCR and now this one remote is the VCR remote and it's more convenient than having three things on your lap.

932
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:42,530
Scott: You have one thing and you just have to push buttons on it to transform it into the different remotes.

933
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:50,550
Rym: I remember as a kid, in that era, the only people who had a system that was overcomplicated and didn't work were the people who also had a fancy surround system.

934
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:59,570
Scott: Yeah, it's hard to get, people who didn't think about it and didn't understand wouldn't set it up the way it was intended and make things difficult for themselves.

935
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:10,687
Scott: If you knew how it worked and you thought about it, you would somehow use your receiver for your surround system as the central control for your whole everything.

936
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:24,230
Scott: The problem was that if you did that, it meant that every time you watch TV, you're using surround sound and some people, like in my house, you wouldn't always want the surround sound on, it's loud.

937
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:29,200
Scott: In my apartment, I always have it on, but it's not that loud.

938
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,306
Scott: Back in the day, that was loud.

939
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:32,530
Scott: It would wake up the whole house.

940
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,216
Rym: So I just learned something fascinating.

941
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:39,690
Rym: I did not realize this was ever used in consumer technology, but apparently in the early 80s it was common.

942
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:45,466
Rym: A lot of remote controls in that era, when we were growing up, were not IR.

943
01:05:45,486 --> 01:05:46,590
Rym: They were ultrasonic.

944
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,090
Scott: Interesting.

945
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:53,130
Rym: And they were extremely prone to failure and extremely prone to false signals.

946
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:54,269
Scott: Yes.

947
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:55,710
Rym: For all the reasons you can imagine.

948
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,370
Scott: I think it was in fact a few really old TVs that had like a wired remote that was like...

949
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:00,174
Rym: Oh, I had one of those.

950
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:02,990
Rym: My first VCR had a wired remote to the VCR.

951
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:03,977
Scott: Mmm.

952
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,363
Rym: Plug it into a slot and it was a wire.

953
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:07,350
Rym: It was like 10 feet long.

954
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:10,990
Scott: It seems ancient when you think about it, but how is it different from a gamepad?

955
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:11,621
Rym: Yeah.

956
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,677
Rym: Wireless controllers on video game consoles?

957
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:19,050
Rym: Not common and didn't work well for a long time.

958
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:22,327
Scott: The first ones that were really wireless were what?

959
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:22,950
Scott: Like Xbox?

960
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,210
Rym: Well, I mean Atari had a wireless controller.

961
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,165
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, so did NES.

962
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,115
Scott: But it's like they were Garbo, right?

963
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:31,970
Scott: The first ones that were any good were Xbox 360, I want to say.

964
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,770
Rym: Yeah, the first ones that were good, that just worked?

965
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,297
Scott: PS2 wasn't wireless.

966
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:36,759
Scott: I guess PS3 was?

967
01:06:36,779 --> 01:06:36,880
Scott: Right?

968
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:43,027
Scott: I want to say PS3, Xbox 360 was like... and Wii.

969
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:43,530
Scott: Wiimotes.

970
01:06:44,873 --> 01:06:48,070
Scott: Because GameCube remotes were not... well, there was the GameCube Air one.

971
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50,628
Scott: That was one of the first ones also.

972
01:06:51,270 --> 01:07:03,810
Rym: But it's interesting how the change in both controllers becoming wireless and TVs becoming larger and higher resolution changed how people interact with TVs as well when they're playing games.

973
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:17,590
Rym: Because when we were young, even young as late as like the Super Nintendo or the N64 or the PlayStation 1, you'd have to sit really close to your TV to play anything because the cords were not long on those controllers.

974
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:20,150
Scott: You'd also be changing cartridges and stuff.

975
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,789
Rym: Yep, there was no remote control for that.

976
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:29,710
Scott: If you had a wireless NES remote and you wanted to change games, you're getting up to swap the cartridge or the disc on your GameCube even if it wave-birded, right?

977
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:36,886
Scott: So it wasn't the fact of digital games just opening on the menu and changing games like on the Xbox 360 or the PS3, right?

978
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:43,148
Scott: Now the wireless controller made way more sense because you didn't have to get up ever, right?

979
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:43,670
Scott: Basically.

980
01:07:43,930 --> 01:08:02,470
Rym: And now you're at the point where like a Nintendo Switch and its dock, any of the controllers, if they're first party, are also sort of a remote control and you can turn on the Switch from the controller wherever you are and that will, if your TV isn't too ancient, automatically turn on the TV and set it to whatever HDMI input.

981
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,409
Scott: Yeah, if you've got everything configured that way, then sure, it totally works.

982
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:09,390
Rym: Yeah, that should just be automatic on any current setup.

983
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,378
Scott: You know, you might have a setup where you don't want to do that.

984
01:08:12,398 --> 01:08:14,830
Scott: Maybe you've got some other in-between device, something going on.

985
01:08:15,131 --> 01:08:17,750
Scott: But yeah, I think for most people, that's what you would want to do.

986
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:24,569
Rym: The other thing I learned, because we were just talking about how it changed the way people interacted with media because they could change channels, like channel surfing became a thing.

987
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:34,109
Rym: Apparently in 1952, a product was sold that was a wireless remote called the Blaboff in the United States and its sole purpose, it was just a mute button.

988
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:35,674
Rym: And it was marketed.

989
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:40,808
Rym: as any time the ad read happens, the Blaboff will make sure you don't have to hear it.

990
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:51,050
Rym: So there is some very Rym or Scott-like personality has been thinking about how to use this technology for good from the very beginning.

991
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:58,390
Scott: Well, I mean, you've also got to think one of the best things about remote controls is just what they've done for accessibility, right?

992
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:01,278
Scott: There's a famous old TV commercial, the clapper, right?

993
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,310
Scott: And it was always sort of like a joke, like clap on, clap off the clapper.

994
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,974
Scott: But the clapper lets you turn your lights.

995
01:09:07,113 --> 01:09:09,099
Scott: It was basically what you would do with this thing.

996
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,670
Scott: is you plug it into your power outlet and then you would plug your lights into the clapper, right?

997
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,090
Scott: It basically just went into your power outlet between whatever device.

998
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,790
Rym: Really simplistic, this thing, how it works.

999
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,055
Scott: If it hears clapping noises, right?

1000
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:32,310
Scott: Sometimes erroneously, sometimes not sensitive enough, it wasn't perfect, but it would just cut power or allow power to go back on.

1001
01:09:32,911 --> 01:09:35,276
Scott: So you could turn your lights on and off from bed, right?

1002
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:41,270
Scott: Or turn your TV on and off just by clapping, even if it wasn't a remote control TV or usually your lights.

1003
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:48,270
Scott: And what this was, you know, for normal people seems kind of seemed a little bit silly, but you know, it's like, okay, it's not too bad, right?

1004
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:56,030
Scott: It's like I turn the lights on when I entered the bedroom with the switch that's right near the door, I get in bed, then I clap and I turn the lights off because the switch is all the way over there.

1005
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:58,767
Scott: Now I don't have to make a trip in the dark to my bed, right?

1006
01:09:58,807 --> 01:09:59,230
Scott: From the door.

1007
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:09,330
Rym: It illustrates that concept that good user experience design often automatically becomes good or at least acceptable accessibility design.

1008
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:10,190
Scott: Right.

1009
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:17,530
Scott: Well, what if you are a senior person or a person who has a hard time walking or, you know, someone who could trip and fall in the dark and severely hurt themselves, right?

1010
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:25,730
Scott: This silly thing suddenly becomes like this, you know, life saving, changing type device, you know, some, you know, if you have a hard time getting up, right.

1011
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:29,370
Scott: It's like you want to change to control the channel on the TV and it's a dial.

1012
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:34,050
Scott: It's like you're going to, you know, an old an old person who can barely walk like a walker.

1013
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,450
Scott: Imagine them getting up to walk over to the TV, turn a dial, then go sit down again every time.

1014
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,201
Scott: It's like, you know, versus remote control.

1015
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:43,290
Scott: It's like that's that's life saving.

1016
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:52,830
Rym: The clapper also, as an aside, in terms of usability, very pointedly notice that remote controls for lights have never been common or popular for a lot of reasons.

1017
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,110
Rym: The main reason is you would have to carry that remote control with you everywhere.

1018
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,414
Scott: You know, and you probably tried to do.

1019
01:11:00,434 --> 01:11:07,730
Scott: the people have tried this home automation where, like, you have an app on your phone that does it and you wire all the lights in your house and like the same kind of system.

1020
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:13,250
Scott: But those only seem to be popular amongst, you know, like wealthy or very techie type people.

1021
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:18,270
Rym: They also, they do the Internet of shit problem where they're not secure and they cause problems.

1022
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:28,250
Rym: The difference between a remote control and that and like an app on a phone is that remote controls are direct and do not leave the boundaries of your house.

1023
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,874
Rym: They're air gap.

1024
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:30,949
Rym: They're not hackable in any meaningful sense.

1025
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,826
Scott: But as soon as you discussed with the garage door.

1026
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:35,275
Scott: Yeah, true.

1027
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,870
Rym: But that was just extremely poor design there.

1028
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,137
Rym: But like think about a phone app.

1029
01:11:40,499 --> 01:11:42,330
Rym: It is possible there are phone apps.

1030
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:45,556
Rym: Like if you had a phone or a smart device that has an I.R.

1031
01:11:45,777 --> 01:11:51,990
Rym: receiver and sender, there were phone apps for those devices or software that would literally make them be a remote control.

1032
01:11:53,851 --> 01:12:02,570
Rym: And with Bluetooth, another thing is it would be possible to have a phone app that is a remote control, but it directly connects to devices without using some cloud service or the Internet.

1033
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,115
Rym: It's not accessible anywhere else.

1034
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:08,210
Scott: Or even just stays on the LAN in your house and doesn't go to a cloud service.

1035
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:13,650
Rym: But these things tend to always use cloud services because of, well, mostly bad reasons.

1036
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:20,810
Scott: People's LANs are, you know, if you make it work on LAN only, everyone's house network is so messed up.

1037
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,769
Scott: You would have so many customer support issues.

1038
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:27,750
Scott: And then you'd have to help people with networking in their house, like actual networking stuff.

1039
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:29,590
Scott: You would never survive.

1040
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:30,211
Scott: Right.

1041
01:12:30,572 --> 01:12:30,732
Rym: Yeah.

1042
01:12:30,752 --> 01:12:40,950
Rym: But I guess the moral of this is that even something as prosaic and simple as the television remote control, which went any remote control like it came in.

1043
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:52,550
Rym: But even though television went specifically like zoom in on something so specific, it's really important to think about how surprising the changes were that happened around it because of it.

1044
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,590
Rym: Like it changed the way people interact with media.

1045
01:12:55,810 --> 01:13:04,830
Rym: It changed the way people interact with their devices in fairly profound and far reaching ways, despite how relatively simple and obvious all of that seems in retrospect.

1046
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:17,230
Scott: I think with the biggest development that's recent is that the remote controls, which used to have shit tons of buttons on them and sometimes still do, have had way less buttons on them because all of our televisions now have software in them.

1047
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,610
Scott: So there'll be like a fancy user interface on the television screen.

1048
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:25,970
Scott: And so the only buttons you need are like to navigate that interface up, down, left, right, OK, back.

1049
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,730
Rym: That's actually something that bothers me a lot about current TVs.

1050
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:32,050
Rym: The remote controls usually have a million buttons on them.

1051
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:32,514
Scott: Like look at the.

1052
01:13:32,595 --> 01:13:33,830
Scott: look at the Apple TV remote.

1053
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:34,251
Scott: Right.

1054
01:13:34,392 --> 01:13:41,090
Scott: It doesn't have a lot of controls on it because you're at the Apple TV interfaces was taking care of the complexity as opposed to lots of buttons.

1055
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:55,590
Rym: But now you have the situation where the user experience of the TV itself and how it portrays those menus can become a problem, especially now because you have a remote control where the only buttons you're actually using are the arrows and the enter and the back.

1056
01:13:56,051 --> 01:14:04,510
Rym: And yet they still tend to have a lot of other buttons that often aren't that useful because they don't actually do anything for most users, which makes them confusing.

1057
01:14:05,032 --> 01:14:09,570
Rym: And a lot of non-technical people just give up and just have broken AV systems.

1058
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:17,710
Scott: Well, I think, you know, there are some things we've seen that remote control has been added to recently, like thermostats, relatively recent remote control thermostats.

1059
01:14:19,012 --> 01:14:28,710
Scott: And, you know, it's like I think there still is room for other things to have remote control added to them or have remote control complexity increased for a car.

1060
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,493
Scott: Remote control is getting better all the time.

1061
01:14:30,694 --> 01:14:32,317
Scott: Now you got like it turns the heat on.

1062
01:14:32,357 --> 01:14:33,379
Scott: It starts the remote starter.

1063
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:34,723
Scott: Yeah.

1064
01:14:34,863 --> 01:14:35,144
Scott: Yeah.

1065
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:37,853
Scott: You know, you know, we're going to have pretty.

1066
01:14:37,893 --> 01:14:39,297
Scott: I don't think we have self-driving car.

1067
01:14:39,337 --> 01:14:40,300
Scott: We talked about that a lot.

1068
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:50,040
Scott: I think we will have within our lifetimes, maybe next five, 10 years, basically remote valet where you the car parks itself and then comes back.

1069
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:50,681
Scott: Right.

1070
01:14:51,082 --> 01:14:54,028
Scott: It doesn't drive all around town and take it all the way destination.

1071
01:14:54,108 --> 01:14:59,480
Scott: But it's like you can go to a parking lot, pull up to the store, push the park button.

1072
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:01,866
Scott: It can navigate a parking lot and park itself.

1073
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:07,440
Scott: And then when you come out of the store, like on your way to the door, push a button and the car will be there for you at the door.

1074
01:15:08,782 --> 01:15:14,580
Scott: I think we can have that within some reasonable amount of years kind of thing going on.

1075
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:26,160
Scott: But if you can think of things to where adding remote control to them, they currently don't have remote control makes sense and improves people's lives, especially if it helps, you know, accessibility.

1076
01:15:26,461 --> 01:15:26,661
Scott: Right.

1077
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:29,346
Scott: Which remote control has, you know, high potential to do.

1078
01:15:29,366 --> 01:15:32,331
Scott: You could make a real big difference, right?

1079
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:37,040
Scott: Because it's even after decades, it is still has a lot of potential.

1080
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:37,560
Rym: Yep.

1081
01:15:38,904 --> 01:15:39,105
Rym: There.

1082
01:15:39,185 --> 01:15:40,289
Rym: So we could kill the Monday.

1083
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:42,395
Rym: I got Monday ideas set of our way.

1084
01:15:42,415 --> 01:15:44,060
Rym: GeekNights at FrontRowCrew.com.

1085
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,146
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1086
01:15:47,206 --> 01:15:52,160
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1087
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:57,600
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1088
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,527
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1089
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:05,280
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1090
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,628
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1091
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:13,134
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1092
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,200
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1093
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:46,160
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Eiji, Dredd, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Crane Paddock, Old Man Save, Des, Peacock, Mimesnack, JustLikeADudeGuy, Kashyaya, 85, Rebecca Dunn, Revue, MadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harel, Taylor Braun, YouHoldTheKeyToMyHeart, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say they're not.

1094
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:53,200
Rym: We have a good idea for a Monday show, but Scott's gotta finish something first because we're enacting our no shit talk policy.

1095
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:02,520
Rym: You could always flood us with suggestions that we should just do tech news roundups more frequently because I think those are actually more engaging shows.

1096
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,080
Rym: I don't think we really want us to do another like "here's how keyboards work" type of show because there's just YouTube channels that do that kind of crap.

1097
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:48,153
Rym: But anyway, for now, I leave you with... (Singing in Japanese).
