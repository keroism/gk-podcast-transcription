1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,395
Rym: - It's Tuesday, January 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:09,656
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,078
Rym: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,115
Rym: - And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:19,570
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Hades, the video game.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,895
Scott: - Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:30,193
Rym: - So yeah, I'm doing my work, you know, work from home, like you do during COVID, especially if you have the kind of job that me and Scott have.

8
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:39,652
Rym: I'm doing my work, and there's a really important thing I'm working on, like, with some people, like, right then and there, like, finish a thing for a meeting that's about to happen.

9
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:52,197
Rym: And I'm doing some, like, fuckery in Excel, and, well, I'll share in Excel, like, a Google cheat or whatever, but my work PC that I'm remoted into starts to get a little slow, like, wait, what's going on?

10
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:55,738
Rym: Like, it's, like, moving slow, like, I'm trying to put this formula in, it's not working.

11
00:00:55,758 --> 00:01:15,256
Scott: - I was trying to do, I was testing a server, 'cause there was, it was slow, something was making it slow, and I was trying to figure out what was making it slow, and as I'm typing, my typing in the SSH connection is sluggish, and I open up top, and there are no processes using up the CPU or memory, the server seems fine in top.

12
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:20,170
Rym: - Same thing, I literally opened Task Manager, like, what, do I have too many Chrome tabs open, like, what's going on?

13
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,867
Scott: - And then I look at my NAS, my NAS is blinking, I'm like, oh, is it doing something?

14
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:34,934
Scott: So I go to my NAS, and that's quick as the dickens, right, it, like, loads right up immediately, and I check my NAS's activity, and it's, like, yeah, not doing much, just chilling, you know, hard drives, like, how we do, right?

15
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:52,291
Scott: And then I try to do a Google search, and it's slow as balls, and I'm, like, got two different computers, my work computer's on a VPN to work, my regular computer's not, and both of them are kind of slow networky, like, just doing a Google search, so I'm, like, uh...

16
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:58,130
Rym: - But what was weird is, at first, the things I suspected, that I had a local ISP problem.

17
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:58,952
Scott: - Same.

18
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:11,600
Rym: - But then, like, random stuff was 100% fine, like, YouTube was just 100% fine, but random stuff, like, the single sign on for, like, one particular thing was timing out.

19
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:27,550
Rym: Thankfully, because of the nature of my work, I got a pretty early report to figure out what was going on, there was a Verizon ISP outage, and pretty quickly, the world figured out that it was, like, one fiber bundle got cut in Brooklyn, and caused a massive outage in the entire Northeast.

20
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,122
Scott: - Why are these fiber cables so poorly secured?

21
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:37,053
Rym: - Well, there's a lot of ways fiber cables get broken.

22
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,490
Rym: Remember, my job used to be dealing with that kind of crap.

23
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,810
Scott: - Right, and how come there isn't more, you know, redundancy?

24
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,142
Rym: - Uh, there is redundancy, here's the problem.

25
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,070
Scott: - Not enough.

26
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,902
Rym: - When a big, well, there's two things going on here.

27
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,392
Rym: This is where I can talk about my professional opinion.

28
00:02:51,914 --> 00:03:07,350
Rym: On one hand, during COVID, because of just the extra demands on the internet that are not normally there, like, the orders of magnitude more people streaming video constantly, there's a lot more traffic going around than there would be normally at this time.

29
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,194
Rym: - True, true, true.

30
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:24,259
Rym: - Simultaneously, no top two, like, no level one, level two, like, the ISPs that actually run the infrastructure of the internet, there's no reason for them to build out, like, full path redundancy for that level of traffic, because a lot of that traffic will eventually go away.

31
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,510
Rym: So, we're in this situation--.

32
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,613
Scott: - Well, also, think about how much bandwidth is going, like, how much, like, fiber is going to office buildings.

33
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:36,042
Scott: That's basically dark fiber now, right?

34
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:41,702
Rym: - Except in my case, where I remote to my physical desktop sitting in that building, because that is easier.

35
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:47,502
Scott: - Sure, and then it's, other, you know, but you're still, it's still.

36
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:48,747
Scott: bandwidth is going to your home.

37
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:50,090
Scott: that wouldn't be, right?

38
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,478
Scott: The home bandwidth use is, like, way up.

39
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:59,065
Scott: And Verizon isn't, you know, Verizon, Comcast, whoever the home people are, they're not charging more money right now.

40
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,050
Scott: They couldn't get away with it.

41
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,973
Scott: People would riot.

42
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:12,919
Rym: - Yep, but the other thing going on is that when a major link goes down somewhere, like, the internet, like, routing protocols, we've talked about this in ancient episodes of GeekNights, will, like, route around the problem.

43
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,184
Rym: However, that process does take time, and there's a period where routes get weird.

44
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:27,961
Rym: So, like, you might make, you might try to hit the same service twice, and one time it takes one route through the internet, and the next time it takes another radically different route for the internet.

45
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:43,357
Scott: - Yeah, but when that, when it works, right, I'm like, I'm sure there's been plenty of times, actually, like, probably way more times than we know, where something was cut or broken or a router exploded or a data center went on fire or a power outage somewhere.

46
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,604
Rym: - Fun fact, I caused a data center fire once.

47
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:48,152
Scott: - Right, a fiber cable was cut, right?

48
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:55,626
Scott: There were probably tons of instances where those things happened, and you never noticed because the routing worked, and it was, there was another route, and it was fine.

49
00:04:55,646 --> 00:05:08,689
Rym: - The problem was things that transited the Verizon network, which are very common for working and the kinds of things people are doing right now had to get rerouted, like, at this high level, coupled with.

50
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:27,198
Rym: normally the redundancy of the internet is such that when a big link like that goes down, there's plenty of capacity and, like, all the other ways to get to places that it does recover more quickly, but now there was just so much more traffic to reroute, like, elevated traffic, there's less redundancy right now.

51
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:39,582
Rym: The final thing that's going on, and this is a long-term trend, the internet itself is a lot less redundant than it used to be because people generally access a smaller number of services with a higher, like, total usage.

52
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:49,280
Scott: - And even if you think you're using a lot of services, all those services are hosted in fewer data, not every company, like, has its own data center, like, in the 90s or whatever, right?

53
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:58,981
Scott: All the companies in the 90s that had their own data center, right, they just ended up making the data center their business or a part of their business and everyone else went into those data centers.

54
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,461
Rym: - Yeah, but if, like, routes to Amazon go down, most of the internet stops working.

55
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:20,686
Scott: - Right, like, it used to be that, like, every single freaking person in the 90s who was selling books, selling shit online had to get servers into a data center somewhere, and now one of those people, you know, sold so many books, they made their own data center, and now half the world's sites are in that one data center.

56
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:30,123
Rym: - Yep, you know, there's a tweet, I quote it a lot, but, and it's not, it's about this, but it's also about the fact that there aren't a lot of, like, independent websites anymore.

57
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:32,773
Rym: There used to be more websites and I miss them.

58
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:32,813
Rym: -

59
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:53,385
Scott: Yeah, there, I mean, there still are actually quite a lot, it's just you can't really find them because, you know, they don't really show up in Google, right, and a lot of them aren't, they're not, even if you search for what was on them, you, they wouldn't be the top result, and even if they were, it's like, you know, it's like those kinds of sites are not...

60
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,891
Rym: - Like, there was a time when...

61
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,577
Scott: - It's in the Google index somewhere!

62
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:56,617
Scott: -

63
00:06:56,838 --> 00:07:13,998
Rym: Like, that GeekNights forum used to be weirdly prominent in Google searches, partly because that was during the Web 2.0 era, where over time, a lot of that kind of content moved into social media networks and, like, got aggregated very differently, and we just happened to maintain a website that had a lot of content that was independent.

64
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:14,138
Rym: - Like,

65
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:36,340
Scott: you could search, you could maybe some anime only we reviewed or something, and maybe, we'll be in the Google search results somewhere, but not high up, there's gonna be a lot of tweets or Pinterest posts about that anime, or, you know, Anime News Network may have an article about it, or the

66
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:44,867
Rym: official site for it, Wikipedia page for it... - Also, the prevalence of e-commerce, most of the results you'll get will be e-commerce and aggregator sites and, like...

67
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,776
Scott: - Even add the word "review" to get those out of there.

68
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:52,611
Scott: You still won't see a lot of, you know, too many independent websites.

69
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,858
Scott: I guess Anime News Network is sort of an independent website.

70
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:55,480
Rym: - It is.

71
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,670
Rym: - Yeah, but yeah.

72
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,669
Rym: - I tried that, I was looking for a Pazukiki Musume, because not many people reviewed that.

73
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,457
Scott: - No, I don't think so.

74
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:13,456
Rym: - So anyway, there is actually some fascinating news that has been developing and is continuing to develop rapidly.

75
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:18,530
Scott: - This is, is it really, it's sort of a gaming news, sort of, right?

76
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,713
Rym: - It's gaming in two ways.

77
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,720
Rym: It's about a game, and it's about GameStop.

78
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,155
Scott: - Yeah, so this is extremely GeekNights news.

79
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,580
Scott: So here's the deal, right?

80
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:33,207
Scott: GameStop is in the shitter, right?

81
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:38,602
Scott: It's, people are, A, not buying physical games much anymore, right?

82
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,136
Scott: And if they are, they're not buying them at Amazon or Target.com or whatever.

83
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:48,234
Rym: - That also means there's less secondary market for kids to sell games back to GameStop.

84
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:53,210
Scott: - Yep, so that, you know, the kids being able to sell and buy games has gone down.

85
00:08:54,671 --> 00:09:00,875
Scott: But just in general, people are buying digital games, you know, they're not buying physical games, GameStop is in the pooper, right?

86
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,162
Scott: Toys R Us is gone also, completely, right?

87
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:10,067
Scott: Anyway, so GameStop stock, right, stock market is supposed to represent the value of companies, right?

88
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:16,414
Scott: You want to buy companies that are undervalued, where the price of the stock is less than the actual work the company's doing, right?

89
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:22,779
Scott: You know, it's like you buy Apple stock before they make an iPhone, then they make an iPhone, and it goes up, right?

90
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,522
Scott: Common sense.

91
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:23,824
Scott: - Yep.

92
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:29,444
Scott: - And the selling would be the opposite, like, oh, that new iPhone is shit, sell, right?

93
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,953
Scott: Android's gonna kick their ass this quarter, whatever, right?

94
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,397
Rym: - Here's where things get a little weird.

95
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:42,432
Rym: In like olden times, the stock market, like equities is what we're talking about, that's the term for this, buying equity in a company like GameStop.

96
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:49,471
Scott: - Yeah, you technically and actually own part of the company when you buy its stock, but, you know.

97
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:53,786
Rym: - You are a shareholder, but that is, there's two types of stock markets.

98
00:09:54,308 --> 00:10:09,450
Rym: Like, all this is necessary to understand what the hell's going on here, and I'm also going to preface this by saying, despite my day job and everything I know about this stuff, we are not giving advice, we are not lawyers, we are not stock advisors, we are not advising you to do anything in particular at all.

99
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,941
Scott: - There's a lot of laws about this shit, and we're not breaking any of them.

100
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:12,222
Scott: - Nope.

101
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:25,106
Rym: And I also have a lot of extra restrictions on what I say and what I do, so I'm going to be very circumspect about this, but the stock market, the idea is there is a primary market and a secondary market.

102
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:31,349
Rym: Anytime you hear about stock trading, that is the secondary market, because the primary market only exists once.

103
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,457
Rym: That is when a company IPOs.

104
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:37,210
Rym: A company says, we are going to issue parts of ourselves out to the world.

105
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:41,041
Rym: You can buy those shares so that we will have cash.

106
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:49,249
Rym: We will then use that cash to do something, and for giving us that cash, we give you a stake in the company, so you can share those profits.

107
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:56,317
Scott: - It's the only reason the stock market even exists is because you're a company, and you could just use business loans and remain a private company forever.

108
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:58,144
Rym: - A lot of companies do it.

109
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,589
Rym: I highly recommend it.

110
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,354
Rym: It's way better than having shareholders.

111
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:02,518
Scott: - It's a good deal.

112
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:10,824
Scott: I like it, but sometimes if no one wants to give you a loan or you want a pile of money, you can sell shares.

113
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:17,450
Scott: If you sell 49% of your shares, you can just hold the other 51% forever, and no one can make you sell them.

114
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,459
Rym: - Now really, there's three things that those shares do.

115
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:26,178
Rym: Number one, they technically give you a say in how the company is run, but that doesn't matter to you.

116
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:30,292
Scott: - You have to own so many of them to have a say, it won't matter.

117
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,061
Rym: - Your TD Ameritrade proxy vote does not matter.

118
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:34,886
Scott: - No, it doesn't.

119
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,571
Scott: I click on it anyway, though.

120
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:48,910
Rym: - Some companies, but not as many as used to, will give dividends, meaning every quarter, every month, or whatever schedule, they'll pay you your percentage of the company's profits.

121
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,254
Scott: - Dividends are a good deal.

122
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,357
Scott: I like dividends.

123
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,283
Rym: - Dividends are a... -

124
00:11:54,423 --> 00:12:11,522
Scott: If you are a person who is just a normal person and you just want to collect free money, basically what you do is you let evil people, the evil people who are ruining the world, hold part of your money, and all that, you know, you hear like, you know, rich guy becomes billions richer, right?

125
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:16,499
Scott: You will get some tiny fraction of that money just slowly dribbling into your account.

126
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,474
Rym: - Ostensibly, they're paying you for the risk of they might lose your money.

127
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:22,779
Rym: - Sure.

128
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,307
Rym: - There's a few ways to look at it, but here's the key.

129
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,574
Rym: Dividends aren't that common.

130
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:31,387
Rym: A lot of big stocks don't actually pay any dividends anymore.

131
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,033
Rym: It used to be a lot more common.

132
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:40,144
Scott: - Nope, and a lot of them that do pay dividends, they pay out a tiny dividend, like something like 50 cents a share, or that's even, that's kind of big.

133
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:41,691
Rym: - Well, depending on the share price.

134
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:45,261
Rym: Dividends are usually expressed as a percentage of the share price.

135
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:48,953
Scott: - Yeah, five percent would be a very large dividend.

136
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:52,970
Rym: - Yeah, like, I'm very happy to get two or three percent from some of the stocks I own.

137
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,547
Scott: - Right, like, for example, you could buy, I think IBM is something like five percent.

138
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:01,569
Scott: It's usually stocks like that, like cruddy-duddy-fuddy companies that have the big dividend, right?

139
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:14,795
Scott: So, like, you buy some IBM or some AT&T or something like that, and it's like, you'll, yeah, okay, who knows if this style, you know, is IBM on the way out probably, right, whatever, but you'll just be making five percent of your money.

140
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,423
Scott: Better than a savings account by a lot.

141
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:24,674
Rym: - Yep, but also that makes sense, because ostensibly you own a tiny percent of that company, so the company pays you that tiny percent of whatever money it makes.

142
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,879
Rym: Like, that makes sense.

143
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,767
Rym: That, like, is an intrinsic value.

144
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:32,930
Scott: - They should be going to be giving it to the employees who made that money, but that's a story for another time.

145
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,636
Rym: - Well, I mean, we're communists now, so...

146
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:36,101
Scott: - Yes, of course.

147
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,470
Rym: - Well, we're closer to neo-communists, actually.

148
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,880
Rym: I've been reading more about the neo-communist movement in the 70s.

149
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:47,610
Scott: - I'm just saying is that all this stuff is basically under the assumption of, like, all right, we have evil capitalism, now what?

150
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,193
Rym: - Yeah, yeah, we're...

151
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:50,825
Scott: - The obvious, which is destroy this evil capitalism.

152
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:51,710
Scott: so we don't have to do this.

153
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,830
Rym: - Yep, but we're talking about the reality of capitalism as it is today in America.

154
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,711
Rym: - Yes.

155
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,258
Rym: - Don't think we're endorsing any of this.

156
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,125
Scott: - So, all that being said...

157
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,210
Rym: - No, there's one more important part.

158
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,193
Rym: - Then you can do your bit.

159
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:02,454
Scott: - Oh, okay.

160
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:07,675
Rym: - The last important thing is that's one way to make money from the stock market to get dividends paid.

161
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:11,852
Rym: The other thing the stock market provides is a secondary market.

162
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,176
Rym: That is actual stock trading.

163
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:24,129
Rym: I might own some IBM and Scott thinks that that IBM is worth more than what Rym paid for it and might offer to buy it from me for more than I paid IBM for it.

164
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:27,180
Rym: That's what all stock trading is, the secondary market.

165
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:34,708
Rym: Someone owns the stock and someone else decides that it is worth more or less than what that person believes it is worth.

166
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,525
Rym: And if they can agree on a price, they will sell it and move it around.

167
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:54,980
Rym: So the third way people make money on the stock market is by buying a stock, hoping that other people will believe that that stock is more valuable in the future so that they can sell it and make a profit by the difference between what they paid for it and what they sold it for.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:14,137
Rym: The interesting thing about that that leads into what Scott's about to say is that what determines that price is not necessarily the value of the company, because what is the value of the company, especially if a stock does not pay dividends?

169
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:24,249
Scott: - Yeah, I mean, so by all logic, the price of GameStop, what is it worth to someone to be one of the owners of GameStop, right?

170
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,618
Scott: Let's say you had Ellen Musk's money, right?

171
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,702
Scott: Jeff Bezos' money.

172
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:29,770
Scott: You could just buy GameStop, right?

173
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,917
Scott: You could just become the owner of GameStop.

174
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,819
Scott: It's like, how much would you be willing to pay to be the owner of all the GameStops?

175
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,790
Scott: If you own all these little retail stores and all these huge game discs?

176
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,122
Rym: - Divide that by the number of shares, there's a share price.

177
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:47,807
Rym: It's a lot more complicated than that, but it comes down to how much property does that company own?

178
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,132
Rym: Do they own physical things?

179
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,759
Rym: Do they have a vault of gold somewhere?

180
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:59,170
Scott: - Right, because if you did buy all those shares, which you absolutely could at a price, you would then be literally the owner of GameStop.

181
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,650
Scott: You could go to the GameStop employees and boss them around, and you're the boss.

182
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,620
Scott: You could say the CEO is gonna be rimmed.

183
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,528
Rym: - Say a company owns like a strip mall.

184
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:07,890
Rym: Guess what?

185
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,196
Rym: That's your strip mall now.

186
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,730
Scott: - Yeah, you could put whatever stores you want in there.

187
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:25,400
Rym: - Which means there's almost a floor on the stock price of a company in that if a stock price gets low enough, the stock price could get lower than the value of the physical things that company owns, at which point it often makes sense to buy that stock.

188
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:37,306
Scott: - There's an interesting, semi-weird, maybe not perfect dude who recently just bought Radio Shack out of its remains and is selling t-shirts with the Radio Shack logo, because they own it now.

189
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,351
Scott: They can do whatever the hell they want.

190
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:39,457
Scott: Sell Radio Shack t-shirts.

191
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:42,831
Scott: They own the trademark, among all the other property that is included.

192
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:57,837
Scott: - So basically, at its peak, GameStop, during the 2007 holiday season, when people are buying Wii's for the holiday, the Wii just came out, it's holiday time, GameStop is at its highest price ever.

193
00:16:57,897 --> 00:16:58,941
Scott: That makes perfect sense.

194
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:05,684
Scott: That is a stock market working, invisible hand of capitalism as it was supposed to be by the book.

195
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:12,887
Rym: - Yep, went down a little bit, came up again to a similar price in 2013 because of, again, retail forces.

196
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:20,920
Rym: There was a lot of reasons why people are going to GameStops, and then for all the reasons we discussed, there was a decline.

197
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:30,807
Rym: To the point to where, in the year of our lore 2020, I'm sure GameStop's worth about four bucks, because GameStop doesn't do anything for you in the modern world.

198
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:34,260
Scott: - Yeah, GameStop's in the shitter, you know, rightly so.

199
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,585
Rym: - Wasn't even COVID.

200
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,311
Rym: This happened long before COVID.

201
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:47,188
Scott: - Right, and so, being in the shitter, even at four dollars, right, it's so low, like no one's even willing to pay five, like five dollars is a breakfast sandwich.

202
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:57,059
Scott: No one's willing to buy, to trade, someone's sitting there with a breakfast sandwich, right, and, or they could own, be an owner of GameStop.

203
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,032
Rym: - One whole share of GameStop, and Scott's like, "I want to keep my bacon, egg, and

204
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:01,313
Rym: cheese.".

205
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,268
Scott: - And people are saying, "I'm going to keep the breakfast

206
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:04,569
Scott: sandwich.".

207
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,234
Scott: That's how worthless it is.

208
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:12,253
Scott: And yet, there's something you can do, which is selling short, right, so.

209
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:15,568
Rym: - I want to hear you explain this, I think you understand it pretty well now.

210
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:27,039
Scott: - I only have sell short, so, normally, if you owned your game, if you own the share of GameStop, like you already had one, right, you're like, you're like, "Wow, GameStop ain't worth five bucks, I'd rather have a breakfast sandwich.

211
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,989
Scott: that continue to be an owner of GameStop.

212
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:34,468
Scott: I'm going to sell this to someone who will give me five bucks, and I'll go buy a breakfast

213
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:34,869
Scott: sandwich.".

214
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,943
Rym: - Now, let's pretend options and all that other stuff don't exist.

215
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,711
Scott: - Yeah, we don't need to talk about that.

216
00:18:39,731 --> 00:18:49,389
Rym: - You can bet on a stock being more valuable in the future by buying it, but the only way to bet on a stock being less valuable in the future is to sell it if you already have it.

217
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:49,429
Rym: -

218
00:18:50,010 --> 00:19:27,116
Scott: Right, right, so you're sitting there and you're saying, "GameStop, that ain't worth a breakfast sandwich," but you don't own any GameStop, so you can't sell any GameStop if you don't own any, right, that's like, you know, imagine if like, you know, Black Lotus Magic Cards, I remember them being 300 bucks when I was a kid, but if you thought, "They ain't 300, they worth 200," right, I know what I'll do, I'll sell you a Black Lotus for, you know, that I don't even have, right, I'll borrow a Black Lotus from someone else, and I'll say, "Hey, listen, I'm borrowing this Black Lotus from you, but here's a promise, I am required by law to give you another Black Lotus to replace this one that you're giving me.

219
00:19:27,397 --> 00:20:04,173
Scott: You're guaranteed to get one back at some point in the future, it's no skin off your back, you're going to end up with the same Black Lotus you started with, right, I'm just going to borrow this for a sec, right, you go and you sell it for 300 dollars, right, so now you're sitting there with a few hundred dollars, and you wait, because you know it ain't worth 300 dollars, it's going to go down, right, and it goes down to 200, so you buy a Black Lotus for 200, you give that Black Lotus you just bought back to the person you borrowed it from, so they don't care, they started with a Black Lotus, they ended with a Black Lotus, no problem, right, the person that you, you know, sold a Black Lotus to for 300, well, they were, they were a cool, right,

220
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:14,433
Rym: but whatever, I lent Scott my Black Lotus, a year later he gives it back to me, and maybe he pays me a fee, like, oh yeah, here's 10 bucks for the privilege of borrowing your Black Lotus, sure,

221
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,225
Scott: but I made 100 bucks, 90 bucks, depending on the fee, right,

222
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:23,490
Rym: and meanwhile for my side, that 10 bucks doesn't sound like a lot, but what did I risk, I didn't risk anything,

223
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,836
Scott: you had no risk whatsoever, you just let someone borrow your Black Lotus with an absolute guarantee that you would get one back,

224
00:20:30,097 --> 00:21:10,350
Rym: now why doesn't everyone, one, the two things questions people ask about this is, one, doesn't, isn't this evil and corrupting, the answer is kind of no, because it's a good way to inject bad news into the stock market, otherwise there's this idea that everyone could kind of agree to never sell anything and make false valuations go up forever, like, it's a way to say no, that stock is worth too much, and I'm gonna prove it, I'm gonna bet money that it's worth too much, but, right, the other thing that can happen is if the opposite happens, you'll hear people who are learning about stocks talk about this idea of unlimited losses, if I buy a stock for 100 bucks and it goes down to zero, my maximum loss is 100 bucks, if I,

225
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:29,822
Scott: you can't lose, your stock can't go lower than zero, right, if you buy, you know, all the GameStop, it's like, what's the worst that can happen, GameStop goes out of business, the stock is worth zero dollars, and all the money you spent is gone, right, but that's it, you don't lose all the money you didn't spend, you still have, it's perfectly safe, but

226
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:38,856
Rym: I lend Scott my Black Lotus, he sells it for 300 bucks, Black Lotus has become worth a thousand dollars, I'm gonna tell Scott I want my fucking Black Lotus back right now,

227
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:53,831
Scott: and now I have to go and I sold the Black Lotus, I sold Rym's original Black Lotus for 300, he needs one, I promised him, I have to give him one back, they cost a million dollars now, they cost a billion dollars now, they cost a trillion dollars in the,

228
00:21:53,911 --> 00:22:00,132
Rym: in the game, in the Train Game 1817 that we recently reviewed, there might not be any to buy at all,

229
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,784
Scott: yeah, and you have to get, you have to, you have no choice,

230
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:05,606
Rym: you can't not,

231
00:22:06,327 --> 00:23:00,807
Scott: you can't not do it, and so you could lose all your money, like you could short one share of like GameStop, some worthless stock, just one share, and if the price of that stock just skyrockets to the roof, you just lost everything you own, your house, your car, right, so it's like, you know, you need to be able to do this to inject the bad news in the market, but doing it is risking you, even if you do it a tiny bit, you're risking your entire everything, all your dollars, right, garnish future wages, like you're just boned, so people smartly shorted GameStop a lot, because it ain't worth a breakfast sandwich, it's worth less than a breakfast sandwich, it's worth nothing, so everyone shorted it, tried, tried to make it go down even more, which is what you should be doing, common sense, it's the same common sense that makes it go up when it's holiday season and the Wii just came out, pretty

232
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:13,840
Rym: normal thing, but now cue a Reddit board called WallStreetBets, which someone described in a news article I read as what if a bunch of Redditors like found a Bloomberg terminal,

233
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:34,219
Scott: yeah, so these people, A, are nerds, care about GameStop for some reason, and they saw, because it's public information, hey, everyone and their mother is selling short on GameStop, right, smartly so, all right, what if a bunch of us just bought GameStop,

234
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,193
Rym: it's like four bucks, it's cheap, I can buy a lot of shares, even

235
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:56,126
Scott: if you're not wealthy, even if you just got like 100 bucks, you can buy 20 something shares, you know, you could buy some shares, right, let's all start together buying GameStop shares, they're so cheap, and all those people who sold short are gonna get boned,

236
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:56,567
Rym: now,

237
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:56,968
Scott: and

238
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:28,939
Rym: in the old days, like, this isn't real, this is not a pump and dump scheme, but basically it is against the law to manipulate a stock price on purpose to do something, like, I can't put about your fake press out to trick other people into buying a stock so that I just bought so that I can then sell it after they all buy in, but the question that happened here, and you can read these articles to get the specifics, because, like, we're not going to explain everything that happened, if a flash mob buys a stock

239
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:44,308
Scott: and pumps everyone independently, it doesn't seem like you can't identify someone as, like, an instigator, right, it's like a bunch of people all simultaneously and somewhat organized, but somewhat independently just did this thing at the same time, kind

240
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,191
Rym: of as a joke,

241
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:55,768
Scott: kind of real, right, and normally in the past there wouldn't even, you know, because E-Trade type stuff has been around since, like, the late 90s, yeah, you could buy stocks, retail

242
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,896
Rym: investors rarely impact the market.

243
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:10,330
Scott: for a lot of reasons I don't want to get into, there is not even those, like, day trading people, like, well, that's their hobby, right, there's not enough of those people and enough money in those people to, like, move the market, you know what could move the market?

244
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,178
Scott: A pension fund can move the market, right, an

245
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,449
Rym: investment for my hedge fund, right,

246
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:44,516
Scott: it's like those, you know, a mutual fund of some kind, right, those people are, like, have billions and billions of dollars that, like, they could just, like, for example, like, you know, some pension fund in your state could just, like, buy GameStop and it wouldn't even be a big deal because it's such a small time thing, right, so individual people just investing their spare change, right, with E-Trade or TD Ameritrade or any of those things, it was not enough money total to move the needle on any kind of real company,

247
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:45,178
Rym: right,

248
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,663
Scott: but I guess now

249
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:50,494
Rym: there is the combination of the number of internet nerds who did.

250
00:25:50,574 --> 00:26:15,286
Rym: this coupled with the sheer amount of shorting that was happening led to a fascinating situation where, as of right now, when the stock market closed, uh, GameStop is worth, or at least was trading at almost $148 a share, which is more than double what that stock was worth at the peak of GameStop's actual success,

251
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:18,334
Scott: right, now the company isn't doing any better, oh,

252
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:25,353
Rym: not even better or worse, literally nothing changed with GameStop itself,

253
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:29,450
Scott: GameStops are the same shitty store as they were yesterday, they have different owners.

254
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:29,691
Scott: now,

255
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:34,766
Rym: the only thing that happened is the ownership, these redditors decided to do this,

256
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:47,366
Scott: they could, if they hold long enough, they could vote and put in a new board of GameStop eventually if they collectively act in that manner, so that is a thing that could happen,

257
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:51,911
Rym: uh, I think we've drilled on this a little bit long for an episode of GeekNights, it's going to be about something else,

258
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,478
Scott: it's such a fascinating news, it

259
00:26:53,618 --> 00:27:06,672
Rym: is, like, read, I'm going to link to a bunch of different articles that give a lot of different perspectives on this, uh, but again, I cannot stress enough, we are not advising anything, do not, do not do anything, do not take any action based on any words.

260
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:07,174
Rym: we have

261
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:11,088
Scott: said, here's my personal advice based on no skills, this

262
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,442
Rym: is Scott's advice, I am not in any way associated with Scott for this purpose,

263
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,050
Scott: yeah, don't do anything,

264
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,051
Rym: just

265
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:24,853
Scott: live your, just live your life, don't ignore any investment nonsense, no coins, no GameStops, no nothing, just,

266
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:27,541
Rym: especially your fucking coins, I need,

267
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:28,544
Scott: I can't even

268
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,575
Rym: get, like, a used 1080 right now because of your fucking coins,

269
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:36,332
Scott: no gambling, right, no casinos, no stocks, don't touch any of this

270
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:44,174
Rym: bullshit, 50% of the times I gambled in a casino, it was fucking awesome, I still use that pen I bought with the money we won,

271
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,681
Scott: if it's not monopoly money, don't do it,

272
00:27:48,265 --> 00:28:01,656
Rym: so, a real brief other news, well, we'll, we'll talk about this again, probably in the future, because there's more going on, but basically, Microsoft tried to, well, announce they were increasing the price of what, Xbox Gold,

273
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,083
Scott: essentially, you know, try

274
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:32,626
Rym: to convince people to just go all the way and upgrade to buy the Xbox Game Pass, like, Xbox, like, it's one of those things where consoles have, like, Microsoft has the thing and, like, Nintendo has it too, you gotta pay them to be able to use their, like, online network to play games online, with various amounts of, like, benefits to doing so, but separately, they're trying to get into a broader market by selling the Game Pass, so people could, like, play these games on their PCs,

275
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:58,719
Scott: and it's a different service, Xbox Game Pass is sort of in between Google Stadia and Netflix of games, right, it's, like, it's not a bad deal on the, on its face value, but I will tell you, personal experience with Xbox Game Pass, I had a free trial of Xbox Game Pass, I put it on my PC, and I tried to run it, and it didn't fucking work, so I uninstalled that shit, it's trash, don't do it, that's my, that's what I gotta say about it, fuck 'em,

276
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:04,281
Rym: I mean, it's tough, this is the kind of news where I don't have that much insight, partly because,

277
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:05,968
Scott: and this is on a normal Windows 10 PC,

278
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:08,394
Rym: yeah, why wouldn't

279
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,101
Scott: it work, it's a Microsoft thing,

280
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:32,845
Rym: I don't like gaming on a PC or a Switch, like, I haven't owned a, like, mainline console in a long time, yeah, because there's not a lot of value here, but this article talks about it in depth, but basically, Microsoft is doing this, on one hand, they're trying to expand to not just be a console company, like, they seem to have this idea, which we've talked about on GeekNights for over a decade, that, well,

281
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:35,779
Scott: the original idea of the original Xbox, that they didn't follow through,

282
00:29:35,799 --> 00:30:03,624
Rym: yep, that the platform is not Xbox, the platform is Windows, you can use any Windows PC to play these games, if it's powerful enough, or if you don't want to deal with that, buy an Xbox, and it'll be guaranteed to play those games, that was kind of like this long-term idea, however, the PC market would sort of cannibalize the console market, and vice versa, they would sort of compete with each other, and Microsoft makes money in the consoles as competition with other consoles on their own,

283
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:05,168
Scott: so

284
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:21,795
Rym: it's a weird situation, that it's hard to say what Microsoft should do differently, but what everyone agrees on, is that what they did here just pissed everybody off so badly, that they almost immediately announced that they're undoing the entire plan,

285
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:31,763
Scott: yep, I mean, it's sort of wrong to charge, I mean, even Nintendo Online or whatever, right?

286
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:37,590
Rym: I mean, it's tricky, because on one hand, what about when I talk about Adobe software, like, it makes sense to charge a subscription.

287
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:37,951
Rym: No, no,

288
00:30:37,992 --> 00:31:01,186
Scott: no, no, you're not paying, if you were paying for software, that's one thing, right, like, the Xbox Game Pass is fine, right, you're paying for software, right, but the, oh, you have all these games that you bought, but you can't play them online unless you pay for Xbox Live, oh, you bought all these games, but you can't play them online, multiplayer, unless you join, play for PlayStation Network, whatever it's called, right, of course,

289
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:08,876
Rym: that counterpoint there is, unlike PCs, you're not running your own server on your console, so they are providing infrastructure to make this happen,

290
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:13,433
Scott: even if you play, if you buy Overwatch, you don't have to pay for Blizzard,

291
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:25,179
Rym: ah, you got right into it, the counterpoint to that is, if I start an Overwatch server, it's not fucking running on my PC, like the Quake 2 days, Blizzard just provides that, and I'm not paying a monthly fee for Overwatch,

292
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:42,197
Scott: yeah, no, you're not, it's like, any PC game you buy on Steam, it's like, yeah, the multiplayer is like included in the game for free, if they tried to charge you extra, if you bought Civ 6, and they were like, oh yeah, if you want to play Civ 6 multiplayer online, you have to pay us five bucks a month, no one would fucking pay that, they would be like, hell no, that's

293
00:31:42,278 --> 00:32:01,570
Rym: ridiculous, that's why I'm so suspicious of these things, because it really feels like, from my perspective, that paying for these services is basically a way to force people who can't afford or don't have access to a quote "real gaming PC", like, consoles are cheaper, it's a way to monetize the people who have fewer options.

294
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:20,350
Scott: And want to play online, people who want to play online multiplayer, but aren't, you know, or, you know, gonna have a PC, right, for whatever reason, right, uh, anyway, Xbox Game Pass is a good deal, and there's a news here that says it has 18 million subscribers now.

295
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,904
Rym: Yeah, so you can read this article to see all the details.

296
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:23,870
Scott: If you can get it to work.

297
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:42,250
Rym: The funny thing is, there's a nice table on the site, actually, this is The Verge, that shows what the prices are for the Playstation 1, the Xbox 1, the Nintendo 1, and you can sort of think about it, the Nintendo 1 is actually, like, the cheapest one by far.

298
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,631
Scott: Oh yeah.

299
00:32:49,922 --> 00:33:06,418
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, so I think a while back, I made a thing of the day, it was this video that was, like, this rotoscoped-looking animation, this guy, Joel Haver, like, this guy is a contender for Neil Cicieregi in Level of Humor, like, I want to see where he goes, his channel is great,

300
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:22,530
Scott: but, uh, the way he taught, I've never seen this guy before, you linked it to me, I didn't watch the whole video, but I watched enough to see what the deal was, and at least his sort of voice was vaguely Mitch Hedbergian.

301
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:37,237
Rym: Yeah, like, he's kind of, like, awkward and halting, but on purpose for comedic effect, and, like, he's doing live comedy sketches that are not on the level of guaranteed video, but they're in the same ballpark.

302
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:41,430
Scott: I'm just saying, I liked that it wasn't a Yelly YouTube guy.

303
00:33:41,710 --> 00:34:02,106
Rym: Yeah, but he also made these animations that are really funny, like, he made this series of animations about, like, RPGs, and they look like they have a really, like, particular style that I hadn't seen before, and we, Scott and I both try to avoid linking to the same channel, like, too often, because that just feels cheap, but he uploaded something interesting.

304
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:31,230
Rym: He uploaded a video about how he animated all those other videos, and just tells you exactly these tools, this process, this is exactly how to do it, and then the whole second half of the video makes a point that Scott and I make a lot, and he makes it really eloquently about how people might say the kind of process he uses is cheating, like, it's not really rotoscoping, he's using these tools to, like, automate it, and his answer is basically, what the fuck is wrong with you?

305
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,870
Rym: Anything that makes the creative process more accessible is a net benefit to society.

306
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,454
Rym: Are computers cheating?

307
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,263
Rym: Is musical notation cheating?

308
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:49,014
Rym: Like, what is the line between a tool that makes you more effective at expressing your creative ideas versus a tool that lets you cheat at being creative?

309
00:34:49,476 --> 00:34:54,212
Scott: You didn't make your furniture with nothing but a pointy rock and a tree, right?

310
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,598
Scott: You used a power tool as cheating.

311
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:05,650
Rym: But the other thing about this is that the process that he outlines, Scott, you and I could do this, like, literally, with no help from anyone.

312
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,866
Scott: I mean, and the other thing is, like, oh, yeah, you know, people call it cheating.

313
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,315
Scott: I watched enough to see what the process was.

314
00:35:11,796 --> 00:35:12,558
Scott: It's not easy.

315
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,821
Rym: It's still a lot of work.

316
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:22,494
Rym: You got, like, this tool, you got to understand the concept of a keyframe, and you have to have an idea, like, what are you going to animate?

317
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:23,740
Scott: And you have to draw?

318
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Scott: Yeah.

319
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,136
Scott: There's not no drawing, there's just a lot less drawing.

320
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:31,241
Rym: Well, you can just trace over yourself and make it kind of derpy, which he does on purpose for comedic effects.

321
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:34,216
Scott: Right, but it's not, even drawing as well as he does is not trivial.

322
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:34,457
Scott: True.

323
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:49,490
Rym: But, yeah, if you just, if you watch this video, you could literally follow this process and make a video that looks just like what he's uploaded, and that would be a good, like, way to learn how to use things like Adobe Premiere, to be honest.

324
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,571
Scott: Yeah.

325
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:55,993
Rym: I'm also excited that the tool he used, that Ebsyn thing, is just a free tool, like, that someone made.

326
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,237
Scott: There's a lot of stuff like that.

327
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:57,678
Scott: Yeah.

328
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:14,431
Scott: Anyway, so we have done videos in the past featuring people with various disabilities showing people who don't have disabilities and, you know, or don't know what it's like, you know, how they deal with stuff, right?

329
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:19,912
Scott: It's like, you know, if you have this problem, how do you deal with this in everyday life?

330
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:20,958
Scott: It's like, this is how.

331
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:27,202
Scott: And it's, like, fascinating, because if you don't know anyone who has that problem, then you don't know what the solution is.

332
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:36,232
Scott: And this one was one that I definitely didn't know before I watched the video, and the answer was obvious, but still fascinating and interesting.

333
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:46,063
Scott: It's if you're a blind person, you cannot see or cannot see well, you're legally blind, perhaps, and you need to, say, pour a beverage.

334
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:49,673
Scott: What if it's a hot beverage in particular, right?

335
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:55,992
Scott: Missing the cup or, you know, spill overflowing the cup would be particularly hazardous.

336
00:36:57,397 --> 00:37:01,210
Scott: How do you do this without another human being just, like, doing it for you?

337
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:08,435
Scott: There is a way that they do it, because obviously it's 2021 and we've figured that shit out, but what is that way?

338
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:15,398
Scott: Ooh, watch this thing of the day to find out and learn valuable information about people who cannot see.

339
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,830
Rym: It's an elegant solution and a good channel.

340
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,319
Rym: All right, in the meta moment, still can't fucking go anywhere.

341
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:30,507
Rym: I guess I had a, not really a snow day, but a snow hour where I couldn't work because I couldn't access anything.

342
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:30,970
Rym: That was fun.

343
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,727
Rym: Probably gonna start reading The Tale of Hanzo again pretty soon.

344
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,299
Scott: I came close, like, a few times.

345
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:44,793
Rym: I also am almost done reading a non-fiction book that I've been reading.

346
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:52,264
Scott: I was about to, and, like, three comic books came in the mail and that basically was, like, they, like, stuck their way in between me and Hanzo.

347
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:55,455
Rym: Yep, and also tonight, it's a busy day.

348
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:58,833
Rym: We're recording GeekNights, I had to work, and then I'm playing some more Blades in the Dark.

349
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:03,895
Rym: I'm actually playing more RPGs than I have in recent memory during COVID, which has been a pretty good time.

350
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:11,110
Scott: Oh man, I have to eat, there's a women's hockey game on right this second, and then there's a Rangers game at seven, and I have to eat food after this show.

351
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:17,276
Rym: Yep, I'm gonna try to watch the Rangers game while I order Grubhub and get ready to play the Blades in the Dark game that starts in a half hour.

352
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:18,581
Scott: Oh boy.

353
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:29,478
Rym: GeekNights might upload into the feed pretty late tonight, just FYI, and Emily is gonna use the streaming rig right here to stream the film festival because her laptop battery exploded.

354
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:30,722
Scott: Oh no.

355
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:33,831
Rym: And we're building a new workstation for her.

356
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:36,801
Scott: I guess you don't need a laptop, you're not going places.

357
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:37,784
Rym: Yep, exactly.

358
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:42,402
Rym: Also, the kind of work Emily does, she actually needs a more powerful computer than what I have.

359
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:46,357
Rym: i9s actually ain't that expensive compared to i7s.

360
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:51,675
Scott: Yeah, if only you could have waited, you could have gotten, like, a Mac with an M2.

361
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,682
Rym: Yeah, can't wait though, need it now.

362
00:38:53,983 --> 00:39:01,691
Rym: But I'm looking at a 10 core, like, 3.8 gigahertz i9 for the kind of stuff Emily does, that would actually be a significant game.

363
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:07,310
Scott: I don't know, AMD is kind of killing it right now, it's hard to go down the Intel route.

364
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:20,204
Scott: Anyway, so this game came out that is like the talk of the town, probably game of the year, right, 2020 I'm guessing, called Hades from Supergiant Games.

365
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:24,762
Rym: Yeah, there's been buzz since, like, 2018 because I think it had an early access.

366
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:30,650
Scott: Right, so this is the people that made Bastion, which I played and beat, which was that game with the narrator, the action RPG.

367
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:31,752
Scott: Yeah.

368
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:34,240
Scott: And then they made, what were the other two games they made?

369
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,204
Scott: Pyre?

370
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:40,964
Scott: Pyre was the fiery one, and what was the other one, what was it, I forget.

371
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:41,687
Rym: I'm trying to remember.

372
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:43,273
Scott: I have all of them, they came in a bundle.

373
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:43,655
Scott: Yep.

374
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:44,137
Scott: Anyway.

375
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:59,769
Rym: But this one got a lot of buzz, like, way before I played it, partly because the art and the story and the dating sim aspects of it were extremely popular among a group of people who wouldn't necessarily always be down for what is basically an action RPG.

376
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:04,945
Rym: So there was, like, the buzz was coming at me from a lot of sources.

377
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:07,092
Rym: I normally don't get video game buzz from.

378
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,096
Rym: Right,

379
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:36,260
Scott: well I think the thing was, is Bastion was such a huge hit, because that was in, like, the early days of indie games, relatively speaking, right, that was like, you know, it feels like it was around, I didn't look up the year, but it feels like it was around the time of, like, you know, after Braid, I guess, maybe Super Meat Boy One times, right, a long while ago, right, and then Transistor and Pyre came out after that, and it was like, both of those games were sort of sold as from the people who brought you Bastion.

380
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:37,103
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:48,553
Scott: But they weren't as big a hit, and now that I have both those games, because they got them together with Hades and, like, Bundle, I played them, and I can kind of see why, like, I couldn't, I wasn't that interested in playing them further.

382
00:40:48,593 --> 00:41:00,149
Scott: I could still see the super giant sort of artistry in the music and the story and the art, but game-wise, I wasn't interested in playing them really very much at all.

383
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,011
Scott: Yeah, I've

384
00:41:01,031 --> 00:41:15,210
Rym: run into that a lot with games where, even if the story and the art and the music and, like, everything about them is great, if the game is just like, like, a typical action RPG, I tend to get bored pretty quick, like, if the game is too similar to what I've played before.

385
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,562
Scott: Pyre and Transistor were not action RPGs.

386
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:25,490
Rym: They were not, but I'm just saying, generally, a lot of games have great art and story and end up just being simple action RPG or indie platformer.

387
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,111
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:29,225
Scott: Transistor is kind of action RPG, kind of not.

389
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:30,049
Scott: Pyre definitely is not.

390
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,973
Scott: Did we review Transistor?

391
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:36,233
Scott: I've only ever, the only time, no, we definitely, because the only time I played it was a few minutes recently.

392
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:58,177
Scott: But anyway, Hades, on the other hand, right, Hades is basically somebody, instead of trying to be super revolutionary and break new ground, which is what I think you could see them trying to do with Transistor, Pyre, even Bastion, right, sort of, right, trying new things, Hades is like, what's hot now, right?

393
00:41:58,277 --> 00:41:59,620
Scott: What are people into now?

394
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,764
Scott: What do we know works?

395
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:09,850
Scott: Let's write and then incorporate all of the things that we're good at as super giant games.

396
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:18,317
Scott: Story, characters, narration, artwork, animation, music, right, all that good stuff that they do A+ on all of these games, right?

397
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:23,091
Scott: Bring those into the fold, and what do you know, a mega crazy hit game.

398
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:24,255
Scott: So what's Hades all about?

399
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,944
Scott: It's Greek gods, right?

400
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,530
Scott: Great theme, nice and public domain.

401
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,310
Rym: You won't spoil anything, but roughly, you're the son of Hades, and he's keeping you in hell.

402
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,831
Rym: You're like grounded, like you're down in the underworld, you're grounded, you're not allowed to leave.

403
00:42:38,513 --> 00:42:44,210
Rym: Meanwhile, the Olympian gods are all like, yo dawg, we'll help you get out.

404
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,979
Scott: Yeah, you know, all of them, like Zeus is like, what's up?

405
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:50,950
Scott: Artemis is like, hey, come on, let's...

406
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,710
Rym: Artemis is the first one I gave maximum gifts to.

407
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,550
Scott: But they're like, you know, my boy is Dionysus, right?

408
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,589
Rym: Dionysus, I think, is my favorite of the gods, actually.

409
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,014
Scott: Yeah, of course.

410
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:14,685
Scott: Anyway, so all the Greek gods that are not in hell, right, the Mount Olympus ones, are like, yo, come on out, son of Hades, come up to the earth, right?

411
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,956
Scott: Come out to Mount Olympus and chill with us, right?

412
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,001
Scott: It'll be totally sweet.

413
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:21,873
Scott: We're Greek gods, we're bored, and we got nothing better to do.

414
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:25,629
Rym: But they're still Greek gods, so they're all kind of low-key beefing with each other.

415
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,463
Scott: But, you know, but they're also beefing with Hades, like, hey, it'll make Hades so mad if we.

416
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:38,084
Scott: So you're the son of Hades, and you try to leave hell.

417
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:41,113
Scott: And you do this in an action RPG way, right?

418
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:46,374
Scott: You walk and you push buttons to swing your sword or shoot your bow and arrow, you pick a weapon each time, right?

419
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:48,321
Scott: And you try to make your way out.

420
00:43:48,481 --> 00:44:02,070
Scott: And it's a very Slay the Spire style roguelike situation, where every time that you leave, you're sort of following the same general kind of progression of like, okay, this part of hell, then this part, these enemies, then those enemies.

421
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:04,459
Scott: But the rooms are procedurally generated.

422
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,253
Scott: You're choosing which kind of room to go to next, like Slay the Spire.

423
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:12,487
Rym: And some of the bosses you fight change based on story events.

424
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:21,981
Rym: Like, you're fighting this one fury at this one spot for a while, but eventually you get there and there's a different fury, and she says different stuff, and then you learn some things.

425
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:27,016
Scott: And of course, you die, and you go back to fucking hell, because that's what happens when you die.

426
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:34,304
Scott: You just come right out of the pool of blood, there's your dad, you're back, you just die, and you appear in your house, and that actually makes sense, plot-wise.

427
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,897
Rym: I love how Hades, every time, is just like, are you finished yet?

428
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,222
Rym: Like, was that fun?

429
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:45,246
Scott: It's like, if Link dies, like, Link dies, you save and quit, and you're back at Link's house, that doesn't make any fucking sense.

430
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:45,568
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:46,854
Scott: But this makes perfect sense.

432
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:50,531
Scott: It's like, yeah, you die, you're back at your house, perfect for a roguelike, play again.

433
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:55,450
Rym: And everyone, basically everyone knows you're trying to escape, and is kind of with you, except Hades.

434
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:59,585
Rym: So like, like Achilles is there, he's like, "Yo, dawg, I stole another weapon for

435
00:44:59,625 --> 00:44:59,786
Rym: you.".

436
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,739
Scott: Uh, the Minotaur and Theseus are not with you.

437
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:04,441
Rym: No, they are not.

438
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:05,906
Rym: They are not.

439
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:07,231
Scott: They do not want you to escape.

440
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:12,570
Rym: Man, fuck them, 'cause I love how Zagreus is like, "Oh, man, you guys are awesome, I'm a big fan, you wanna

441
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:12,992
Rym: spar?".

442
00:45:13,032 --> 00:45:16,905
Rym: And they're like, "No, we're, uh, we're actually going to kill you, for real, fuck

443
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:17,085
Rym: you.".

444
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:19,532
Scott: Yeah, Achilles is totally with you.

445
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:21,136
Scott: Anyway.

446
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:26,795
Scott: But yeah, you do this over and over in a roguelike fashion, and each time is a different run.

447
00:45:26,816 --> 00:45:33,887
Scott: You're, during your run, you're choosing and getting different abilities from the different gods, so every time you go, it's a new experience.

448
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:37,822
Scott: "Oh, this time I got abilities from Dionysus, this time I got abilities from

449
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:38,745
Scott: Hermes.".

450
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:41,792
Rym: And like Slay the Spire, they're not balanced.

451
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:46,706
Rym: If you get a combo that is OP, awesome, roll with it.

452
00:45:47,028 --> 00:46:01,809
Rym: Like, one time I had the spear, and I got something that made the spear longer, and I got the Artemis thing that makes you do extra crits with it, and I got the thing that makes you hit faster twice, so I could basically just, like, power down a boss to nothing from a distance with the spear, doing nothing but my regular attack.

453
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:03,235
Scott: Yep, yep.

454
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:09,199
Scott: So it's like, every time you play, it's a completely new experience, it doesn't really get old very easily, right?

455
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:10,423
Scott: It's fresh every time.

456
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:17,549
Rym: And the gameplay loop is not the typical action RPG gameplay loop of, "You can spam and take a lot of damage," that you often see out there.

457
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:24,993
Rym: The game, much like Slay the Spire, is a lot about, "Don't take damage, be clever, treat the fight almost like a

458
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:25,515
Rym: puzzle.".

459
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:29,790
Scott: Hit points are the resource that are hard to recover.

460
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:35,894
Scott: You don't just, like, you know, if you take, if you lose half your hit points in a room in the next room, you don't have them back, right?

461
00:46:36,516 --> 00:46:42,494
Scott: So they are a resource that you can sort of spend, but it's, you can refresh them sometimes, but not so easily.

462
00:46:42,515 --> 00:46:50,344
Scott: So yeah, you basically get to make it from the beginning to the end of the game, in one shot, without dying too many times.

463
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:54,740
Rym: But it's interesting how, like, as you play, the game has stateful progression, too.

464
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,309
Rym: Like, you can slowly level yourself up to make the game easier.

465
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:09,199
Scott: Every single time you die and you go back home, you can spend some of the resources you got to sort of permanently upgrade in, like, the magic mirror or whatever, or upgrade the weapons abilities with the hearts and things like that.

466
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,933
Scott: And then that way, future runs become easier and easier as you go, right?

467
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:18,808
Rym: But while those matter a lot, a lot of it is you will get better at the game.

468
00:47:18,888 --> 00:47:28,102
Rym: Like, for that first whole area, even if you never leveled up anything, you'll just get good enough to be able to do the entire thing without ever taking a hit.

469
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,160
Scott: Yeah, the first time I went and played the game, I died in, like, the first area.

470
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,530
Scott: I didn't even get to the first boss, right?

471
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:41,449
Rym: But now, when those big fat guys are coming at you, I'm just like, "Well, behind buff and I'm

472
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:41,690
Rym: good.".

473
00:47:42,272 --> 00:47:48,672
Scott: Yeah, it's like, now after playing 30-something runs, the first area is like Mario 1-1.

474
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:50,939
Scott: There's no way a Goomba could hit me.

475
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,467
Scott: You know, I'm not even that good at the game.

476
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:54,411
Rym: I cannot stress enough.

477
00:47:54,451 --> 00:48:00,176
Rym: the variety of things you can upgrade in the course of a run is the secret sauce, just like in Slay the Spire.

478
00:48:00,217 --> 00:48:09,166
Rym: There are so many different directions of upgrading that will lead to radically interesting and sometimes emergent behaviors.

479
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:13,843
Rym: Like, you'll figure out a degenerate strategy with the spear and a certain kind of thing.

480
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:27,671
Scott: And this is something I want to point out that I've also seen other game developers and designers talking about in, you know, the community, is that how many games out there are, like, giving you items that are, like, plus 10%?

481
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,072
Scott: Whatever.

482
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:34,354
Scott: And it's like, you get that, and now the game is still basically the same after getting it, right?

483
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:36,723
Scott: It doesn't feel rewarding to get something like that.

484
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:49,080
Scott: While there are many items and upgrades in in Hades that are plus x percent, they also all, right, do something significant and noticeable that change the game.

485
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:56,626
Rym: Yep, like, getting any upgrades feels very powerful and radically changes how you interact with, like, the next level.

486
00:48:57,148 --> 00:49:01,183
Scott: Like, every single thing you can choose just changes the way the game is played.

487
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:10,538
Scott: The same way that, like, when you play Super Metroid, like, okay, you know, they're not like, "Hey, Samus, your regular shot is the same, only does 10% more

488
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:10,738
Scott: damage.".

489
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,123
Scott: It's like, they don't do that.

490
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,933
Scott: They do, you have a space jump now, right?

491
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:18,428
Scott: Or, like, the game is completely different once you have a space jump.

492
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,680
Rym: Like, the sword does a bunch of, like, sword stuff.

493
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,422
Rym: The spear?

494
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:22,548
Rym: Totally different game.

495
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,060
Rym: Might as well be a different game to play with the spear.

496
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,282
Rym: The shield?

497
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:28,047
Rym: The fucking gun?

498
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,952
Scott: Yeah, there's a gun.

499
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:30,874
Scott: Just a gun.

500
00:49:31,396 --> 00:49:32,318
Scott: Spoilers gun.

501
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:32,900
Rym: Yeah, spoiler.

502
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,565
Rym: Well, you know why it's not a spoiler?

503
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:40,142
Rym: If you go to map your controls, there's an unbound default key for reload.

504
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:41,546
Rym: That is not explained.

505
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:42,649
Scott: No, it's not.

506
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,693
Rym: Spoilers, there's a gun.

507
00:49:44,555 --> 00:49:50,093
Scott: Yeah, so the other final component of this game, right, is the dating sim part.

508
00:49:50,193 --> 00:50:06,870
Scott: So there, of all the different, you know, things you can collect when you're in a run, some of the things are only good for that run, some of the things you bring back to level yourself up, right, level your weapons up, but there are these alcoholic beverages that you acquire, right?

509
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:08,696
Scott: What are they called again?

510
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,362
Rym: I think, isn't it just an ambrosia?

511
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,350
Scott: Oh, ambrosia, that's what it is.

512
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,238
Scott: Yeah, the, you know, the nectar of the gods.

513
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:24,880
Rym: So anytime you get a favor, like, you know, like, you see the icon of a particular god, and you can accept the favor, or you can give that god a gift, and you can also give gifts to a lot of the non-gods that are just around.

514
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:35,693
Scott: Give them a gift, and, right, but basically anytime you encounter any character in the game that's not you, any NPC, most of the NPCs that talk, at least, gods.

515
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:37,660
Rym: I wish I could give something to that chef.

516
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,346
Scott: Oh, you can't give anything to the chef.

517
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:42,016
Scott: The medusa, the cute medusa head.

518
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:43,402
Rym: Oh, I gave the medusa head a few.

519
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:44,204
Rym: She's super cute.

520
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,588
Scott: I gave the medusa head the most.

521
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:49,259
Scott: The dog, a Cerberus.

522
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,724
Rym: Cerberus got my first gift.

523
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:52,813
Scott: I don't think you can do for the dad.

524
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:54,440
Scott: You can't give it to Hades, I don't think.

525
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,685
Rym: I think you can, actually.

526
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:56,950
Scott: Maybe you can, actually.

527
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,673
Scott: I don't remember.

528
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:07,936
Scott: But basically, even characters you encounter during a run, right, like Sisyphus, you see him during runs, you can, if you have an ambrosia, you can give it to them, and that will increase their favor with you.

529
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:08,840
Scott: They'll like you more.

530
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,547
Rym: This is the dating sim part of the game.

531
00:51:11,608 --> 00:51:26,987
Scott: If they like you more, A, they give you a cool item to use during runs, which is good, and B, that you sort of get cozy with them and they sort of, you sort of unlock plot and things with them, right?

532
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:33,107
Rym: You know, like Artemis told me some things that were interesting once I maxed out my affection with her.

533
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:44,395
Scott: Yeah, it's like whenever I talk to the medusa head, she's like all nervous and I'm always, instead of me saying like, you know, at first, like the first time I talked to the medusa head, it's like, hey, and then she like runs away.

534
00:51:44,495 --> 00:51:49,029
Scott: Now I talk to the medusa head and it's like, hey baby, how's it going?

535
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:53,300
Rym: I gave one to the Fury and that was a fun bit to go down.

536
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,461
Scott: Yep.

537
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:57,168
Rym: But the cool part about it is...

538
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:06,860
Scott: The point is, this mechanic is, even if you've like completely dominated the game, it's like you want to play to get more so you can do this to all the characters.

539
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:16,238
Rym: Yep, that's the loop I found because in a normal action RPG like this, I'd play like I'll run to the end and when I finish the run, I'll often just quit like, okay, that was my run.

540
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,142
Rym: I'm gonna go do something else.

541
00:52:17,523 --> 00:52:25,672
Rym: But then I land back in hell and I really want to go talk to everybody, give a gift to someone, and like see what other plot things I might have uncovered.

542
00:52:26,514 --> 00:52:28,681
Scott: Yeah, and also unlock other, right?

543
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:29,505
Scott: There's still more.

544
00:52:29,545 --> 00:52:31,677
Scott: It's gonna be different even though you've beaten the game.

545
00:52:31,737 --> 00:52:33,448
Scott: If you go on a run again, it's a roguelike.

546
00:52:33,488 --> 00:52:34,615
Scott: You know there's gonna be infinite runs.

547
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:35,320
Scott: It's not a spoiler.

548
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:39,653
Scott: The ending that you'll get, there's like more and more endings.

549
00:52:39,753 --> 00:52:43,064
Scott: So the more times you beat the game, you get more stuff there.

550
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:47,155
Scott: And also, there's just new things to do.

551
00:52:47,536 --> 00:52:52,113
Scott: You haven't run out of things until you've beaten the game many, many, many times, right?

552
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,679
Scott: I only beat it once.

553
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:58,337
Scott: I didn't beat it many, many times, but it still felt like a lot was there left to do.

554
00:52:58,397 --> 00:52:59,120
Scott: if I go back to it.

555
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,820
Rym: Yep, like the plot that you uncover, you start to feel like, oh, I see where this is all going.

556
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:12,043
Rym: All I'm going to say is it is surprisingly complex, and there's a lot going on you can unlock in this game.

557
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,970
Scott: It's a Greek mythology plot, right?

558
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,341
Rym: But I also appreciate how it's not super dialogue heavy.

559
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:25,235
Rym: It's like you'll see an interaction, and like the interactions are just very interesting and pleasant, but they also don't overstay their welcome.

560
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:28,329
Rym: It's not like you're reading just like pages and pages of lore.

561
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,337
Rym: It's like, well, Medusa, you have different conversations.

562
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:34,630
Scott: Yep, I don't read pages and pages of lore, right?

563
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:41,160
Scott: It's basically sort of like the amount of text you'd get in a Zelda game, but only with voice acting instead of, ah!

564
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:48,892
Rym: Yep, and you have fun little bits like I got my Artemis really up, and then I started getting my Ares really up, and the two of them are kind of low-key beefing.

565
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:53,369
Rym: And now that beefing kind of happens in the dialogue I have.

566
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:57,462
Rym: Ares will be like, ah, you've got that stink of her on you again.

567
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:09,209
Rym: Like fun stuff happens, and it's interesting enough to keep you playing the game even when you really should go to bed, even if you would have stopped.

568
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:16,178
Rym: And you can even give a gift to Skelly, the skeleton whose sole purpose is to learn a new weapon when you get it.

569
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:25,311
Scott: Yep, so the only thing I want to say about this game is the only negative is that there's no multiplayer, right?

570
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:30,170
Scott: This is the best of games I've played, of action RPGs I've played, right?

571
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,499
Rym: Oh, if I could play co-op in this game...

572
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,079
Scott: Right, just forget about the roguelike parts of the game, forget about all that stuff.

573
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:49,319
Scott: Just the way the character controls action RPG-wise, right, is better than like any... It's like better than a Zelda, better than a Secret of Mana, better than any...

574
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:52,050
Rym: The frame timing just feels right.

575
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,760
Rym: When you get hit, it's your own goddamn fault.

576
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,343
Rym: Nothing feels cheesy.

577
00:54:57,346 --> 00:55:04,343
Scott: Nope, it's like there isn't another action RPG that controls as perfectly and nicely as this one does.

578
00:55:04,363 --> 00:55:13,964
Scott: I really wish there was a co-op way to play just with an action RPG that controls like this one.

579
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:23,817
Scott: Just take the controls from this game and maybe the art style, the 3/4 review, I guess, and just make another action RPG that's a co-op one.

580
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:26,410
Scott: There's tons of co-op action RPGs out there, but they're all kind of meh.

581
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:36,944
Rym: If I had to articulate it, it's that like hit boxes and what damages you is like the right level, coupled with, like I said earlier, it's almost a puzzle.

582
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:38,130
Rym: It is execution.

583
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,620
Rym: You have to time things and jump around, and it's an action game.

584
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,471
Scott: And you can actually see what's going on, right?

585
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,419
Scott: You can see things and dodge them.

586
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,252
Rym: But you can play this game without ever getting hit.

587
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:54,029
Rym: You can treat it like a puzzle that requires you to execute to solve the puzzle.

588
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,840
Rym: And a lot of action RPGs really fail in that regard.

589
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,134
Scott: And you encounter enemies that you've encountered on previous runs.

590
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:02,123
Scott: You know how those enemies behave, right?

591
00:56:02,143 --> 00:56:09,373
Scott: So for example, there's a room in the lava area that you can get sometimes where there's a bunch of witches that shoot lots and lots of projectiles everywhere, right?

592
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:19,457
Scott: So if you have a deflect ability, that room can be so easy because you deflect all these projectiles and they go right back to where they came from and you beat it in two seconds.

593
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:20,622
Rym: But you know what I started doing?

594
00:56:21,285 --> 00:56:32,003
Rym: I used to focus on upgrades that like complemented my own actual skills in the game, but I realized that what I needed to do is focus on the upgrades that cover for the things I am dog shit at.

595
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:41,512
Scott: Anyway, but the point is if you don't have deflect and you get in that room and it's like a bullet hell situation, right?

596
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:42,937
Scott: And it's like, yeah, it's the same room.

597
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:44,685
Scott: You encountered it two runs ago, right?

598
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:51,609
Scott: You know this room, but because you have a completely different, you know, loadout this time, you didn't get any deflect abilities.

599
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:59,937
Scott: You have to figure out using the abilities that you've got, how are you going to deal with this bullet hell room?

600
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,529
Scott: How are you going to dodge all these things and not get killed?

601
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:03,897
Scott: Because it could be super dangerous.

602
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:09,557
Scott: if you didn't, you could also end up thinking like, hmm, is the bullet hell room coming soon?

603
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:11,443
Scott: Maybe I should take a deflect ability.

604
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:18,046
Scott: But last time I played, I died at the end boss and the deflect ability wasn't that useful on the end boss.

605
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:22,523
Scott: I need some ability to help me with that, you know, and the alternative choice.

606
00:57:22,884 --> 00:57:31,054
Rym: Oh, these group attack cards are really good to get me through like the birds that attack you in the second floor, but they suck against the boss.

607
00:57:31,395 --> 00:57:34,206
Scott: Is the end boss going to be the time boy or is it going to be?

608
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,380
Rym: The problem is if I get a million powers, it's always the bird.

609
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:40,208
Rym: If I don't have any powers, it's always the time boss.

610
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,371
Scott: Sure.

611
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:49,754
Scott: So yeah, so if you like an action RPG, if you like a roguelike, if you just like the story bits, right?

612
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:57,060
Scott: Any one of those things is good enough to be like, yeah, just even if you only like one of those parts, it's enough.

613
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:06,290
Scott: The game is so good at that part that it's worth doing the parts you don't care so much about to extract the pleasure of the part you do.

614
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:11,008
Scott: And if you happen to enjoy all three of those things, this is the greatest game you've ever seen.

615
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:11,470
Rym: Yep.

616
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:16,890
Rym: Like I would almost look to this as an example of a game that was polished to the right degree.

617
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:18,254
Scott: Indeed.

618
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:18,676
Scott: Yes.

619
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:20,803
Scott: Very much the correct amount of polishing.

620
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:26,765
Rym: And if I wasn't playing Blades in the Dark, like imminently, I would probably just play a little bit of Hades before bed.

621
00:58:26,785 --> 00:58:28,972
Scott: I mean, I would.

622
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:34,469
Scott: It's like I beat it and I stopped, but I could just go back to it.

623
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,476
Scott: I've had the urge to go back to it.

624
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:43,221
Scott: And it's just the only reason I haven't is because I'm telling myself, it's like, no, I need to do more than one thing in my life.

625
00:58:43,782 --> 00:58:44,002
Rym: Right.

626
00:58:45,324 --> 00:58:47,447
Scott: So yeah, play that Hades.

627
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:49,029
Scott: The hype is legit.

628
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:56,984
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

629
00:58:57,044 --> 00:59:02,206
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

630
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:07,465

631
00:59:07,686 --> 00:59:10,378
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

632
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:15,136
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

634
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:22,967
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

635
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:26,060
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

636
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:51,180
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Link Iggi, Graham Finch, You Hold the Key to My Heart, Now Go Through the Last Year or So of Podcasts and Make Rym Sing, Clinton Walton, Wren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Review Mad Bull, 30 Far Cowards, Dread, Lily, Tenebrae, Just Like a Dude Guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Sherman von Horl, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

637
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,005
Rym: I gotta congratulate Lack of Cheese.

638
00:59:53,085 --> 01:00:04,982
Rym: We started a play your damn turn, play by mail game of Civilization VI with random leaders like fucking forever ago before like multiple expansions had come out.

639
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:09,760
Rym: The game came to a conclusion and I will just share the way that Lack of Cheese won.

640
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,231
Rym: Despite Lack of Cheese winning, I lost, the game ended, they won.

641
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:22,220
Rym: and I lost on my turn because for reasons, there was only one city left following a religion that would have prevented that victory.

642
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:36,696
Rym: He had frigates off their shores about to take this city and I took it first, thus triggering the end game because I accidentally let my religion get overrun due to a flood of missionaries.

643
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:37,618
Rym: So my hat is off to you.

644
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:38,300
Rym: That was super fun.

645
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,797
Rym: Maybe we'll start up another Civilization VI game with the listener out there.

646
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:43,460
Rym: So stay tuned.

647
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,506
Rym: I post something in the GeekNights Discord about that.

648
01:00:46,028 --> 01:00:50,081
Rym: But for now, I leave you with a little Joel Haver.

649
01:00:50,102 --> 01:00:53,235
Rym: Hey boss, you think this guy behind us is a little suspicious?

650
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:59,020
Media: You mean the one that hit eight stop lights, three cars, two pedestrians, and then drove on the sidewalk for five blocks?

651
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,505
Rym: Yeah, that one.

652
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:01,971
Media: Nah, he's over 40 feet back.

653
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,453
Media: He's fine.

654
01:01:02,594 --> 01:01:03,056
Media: Oh, he is?

655
01:01:03,237 --> 01:01:06,310
Media: As we say in the mob, if you're over 40 feet back, you ain't suspicious.

656
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,355
Rym: We do say that, yeah.

657
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:10,290
Media: This joker on the other hand, a little too close for comfort, huh bud?

658
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:14,446
Scott: Obeying all the traffic laws at a comfortable distance, we got to get out of here.

659
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:28,676
Media: All right, so I know we were just in the car for 20 minutes and I had ample opportunity to tell you this then, but now that we are on a leisurely stroll from the car to the casino in full earshot of everyone, I will disclose to you the secrets.

660
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:33,007
Media: So anyway, the whole operation is run by Tony... Who's there?

661
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:35,713
Media: It must've been my imagination.

662
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:40,708
Media: The whole operation is run by Tony... Did you hear something?

663
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,234
Media: I thought I just heard something.

664
01:01:43,278 --> 01:01:44,462
Media: Must've been my imagination.

665
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:47,831
Media: The whole operation is run by Tony Lazuto.

666
01:01:48,853 --> 01:01:49,716
Rym: Tony Lazuto?

667
01:01:50,277 --> 01:01:51,620
Rym: You're telling me Tony was that?

668
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:54,484
Scott: I swear I saw something.

669
01:01:56,886 --> 01:01:59,089
Media: Tony Lazuto, you're telling me... Did you hear something?

670
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,474
Media: I thought I just heard something.

671
01:02:00,494 --> 01:02:01,422
Scott: My must've been playing tricks on me.

672
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:02,129
Media: Must've been my imagination.

673
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:03,073
Scott: I swear I saw someone.

674
01:02:03,776 --> 01:02:04,659
Media: Tony, what was that?

675
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,964
Media: I thought I just heard something.

676
01:02:05,984 --> 01:02:06,405
Media: Who's out there?

677
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,574
Media: Must've been my imagination.

678
01:02:09,578 --> 01:02:11,927
Media: The whole operation is run by Tony Lazuto.

679
01:02:11,948 --> 01:02:12,369
Rym: Tony Lazuto?
