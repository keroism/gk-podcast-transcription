00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,266
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:10,667
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:14,920
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,222
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:24,281
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about the 1977 anime, Vultus 5.

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,318
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:35,599
Rym: So a few of you pointed out, and I was aware of this when I switched to having that fancy, completely black background behind me recording GeekNights on the livestreams.

8
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:40,540
Rym: I was also using that at work to, like, get rid of the background, and it's nice.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,380
Rym: But you might have noticed, I was a little bit washed out and white.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,220
Rym: The problem I ran into that I had to actually spend some time to figure out and deal with was- Was because it was black, the camera was trying to adjust the exposure?

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:03,160
Rym: Yup, because the camera is a webcam, and it's trying to be clever and not too professional, it tried to do a bunch of too clever crap, and it was a terrible idea.

12
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,618
Rym: But it wasn't just a simple thing of going and like-

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Scott: If you're calculating exposure to choose black, I mean, you could also tell the webcam to, you know, if you had a real camera, you could tell it, hey, when you're calculating exposure, just look in this area of the frame.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,659
Scott: You know, spot, you could do spot metering, center-weighted metering, or you could just do exposure compensation and be like, yeah, minus, you know-

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,582
Rym: Yup, basically,

16
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,224
Scott: because

17
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:29,161
Rym: this webcam doesn't have, like, the controls on a regular ass, like, professional camera- It should

18
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,598
Scott: have, there should be software that comes with it that can let you-.

19
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,119
Rym: So that was the thing, I had to install that Logitech software that I've never used in my life.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,900
Scott: Yup, yup, and there's a little slider you can slide.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:50,260
Rym: Yup, and I slid the slider, and it was amazing, because when I slid the slider by default, it didn't actually change anything, it kept me washed out, but the background got darker.

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:01,260
Rym: Like, it did something weird, because it had some automated logic in it, it was trying to prioritize for "exposure," in quotes, instead of doing the thing I would expect a camera to do.

23
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:06,339
Rym: So I had to turn off, like, all the automation and make it all 100% manual, and then I could fix it.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:24,203
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, even the world's most expensive, best cameras that you can buy, right, are only so smart at figuring out, you know, ah, there's a person there, expose for the person and let the background be- Yup.

25
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:32,500
Scott: That is why you need to, no matter what best automate camera you have, you need to understand photography to some extent.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:51,480
Rym: Yup, but there is this weird danger zone on the lowest end of prosumer and the highest end of consumer, where you'll need those kinds of capabilities, but the interface is still simplified and automated in a way that either you can't access that functionality directly, or it tries to abstract it away.

27
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:58,820
Rym: And even if you know about real cameras, you have to figure out what this slider that has weird labels is actually doing before you can-.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:06,220
Scott: Well, I mean, like, if you want to take a photo of, like, you know, the classic example is, like, there's just snow everywhere, so it's frickin' white everywhere, right?

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:18,600
Scott: And if you just take out a camera and just take pictures, no matter, even the world's best camera or an old iPhone, it doesn't matter, it's gonna make the snow look gray, even if your eyeballs tell you the snow is white, just 'cause that's how it works, right?

30
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:21,219
Rym: It's like taking a picture of fire, good luck.

31
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,401
Scott: Right.

32
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:36,860
Scott: On your iPhone, you're gonna have to, you know, there's, like, you can drag up and down in the camera app, the default one at least, to, you know, there's a little picture of a sun, and you can drag it up and down, and you're gonna have to, you know, probably drag it up to fix your snow and make your snow white, right?

33
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:37,839
Scott: Snow white.

34
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,084
Scott: You know, there's nothing you can do about it.

35
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:47,480
Scott: Even the smartest iPhone can't determine that it's, you know, supposed to- it's not actually a gray wall and that it's snow.

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,760
Scott: Yep.

37
00:03:48,722 --> 00:04:00,720
Rym: So I did sort all that out, and the other problem I was having is that because my microphone arm isn't long enough, because it's the cheapest one, I have to sit really close to my monitor, and the problem is, I have a really fancy monitor.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,851
Rym: So the other thing that was messing this up is, if I have a white tab open in front of my face, it's like a spotlight.

39
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:11,835
Rym: Like, it's so bright.

40
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,660
Rym: But it was all easily fixed, and now I have a pretty good setup, so now I'm good to go.

41
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:35,600
Rym: I was only mildly annoyed that I had to actually install the software, because I generally have this- I know you do this to a degree, but if I buy like a Logitech mouse, or like anything fancy, like a fancy keyboard, and it has some software that you need to use to configure it or set it up, I try to avoid installing that software to my detriment and at all costs.

42
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:43,000
Scott: I do try to avoid installing that software, but more recently, I have had to basically relent, for example.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,441
Rym: Yep.

44
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:44,011
Rym: Between the 8-bit dose.

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Scott: My mouse has LEDs in it, and I need the software to change the color or to disable the LEDs in the mouse.

46
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,371
Rym: Once I install the software, guess what I could do?

47
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,860
Rym: I could turn off the fucking light on my mouse.

48
00:04:59,501 --> 00:04:59,943
Scott: Right.

49
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:04,580
Scott: The cooler on my CPU, the software for that, that will let me turn off those lights.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,602
Rym: There's two softwares.

51
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:13,160
Rym: There's the NZXT one, if you have NZXT stuff, and there's also the like, uh, Asus Armory that controls like, the lights that are on RAM now.

52
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:14,718
Scott: I don't have that.

53
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,660
Scott: Well, Emily's motherboard has lights on it.

54
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,999
Scott: I only needed the- I only needed the NZXT one.

55
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,900
Rym: The RAM that had lights on it was significantly cheaper than identical RAM with no lights.

56
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:33,120
Scott: I could, uh, my motherboard, if my motherboard has lights, I think they're adjusted in the UAFI directly.

57
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,619
Scott: I don't think I have to install Windows software to deal with that.

58
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,040
Scott: Yeah.

59
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,840
Scott: But yeah, that's life.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,380
Rym: So yeah, in the news, there's actually a lot to talk about today, so we might give a few of these things a short shrift.

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,180
Rym: But first off, Wolfwalkers, if you're not aware, like we reviewed it, it is one of the better animated films ever made.

62
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,209
Rym: Like, it is a phenomenal film.

63
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,640
Rym: It's one of the best animated films I've seen in recent memory.

64
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:04,259
Rym: And of course, it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars, well, a bunch of Annie's, and it got nominated- You know, it's not Akira, but it's up there.

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,420
Rym: But, uh, I hate to say this, on one hand, it is significant that it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as it should have been.

66
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:21,160
Rym: But I am confident it will not win it, and that regardless of the relative merits of these two films, I'm pretty sure Soul's gonna get it because it's Disney.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,158
Rym: Regardless.

68
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:27,660
Scott: Because the way the stupid Academy Awards work is they let you vote on things you haven't seen, right?

69
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,360
Scott: And it's just mostly old white guys voting, you know, people who are members of the Academy voting, right?

70
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:44,960
Rym: I'll never forget when Song of the Sea was nominated, and then Big Hero 6, which, not saying Big Hero 6 is a bad movie, but it isn't even in the same, like, remote tier of what Song of the Sea was.

71
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:46,700
Scott: No, not even close.

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:07:00,899
Rym: And when that one unnamed Academy member said the words that they didn't vote for the Chinese movie, and they voted for the Disney Pixar, whatever, whatever Disney Pixar thing comes out is what a lot of these Academy members vote for without even watching them.

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,191
Scott: Yeah, and not even what the nomination process is, right?

74
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,960
Scott: And it's, like, not shitting on Shaun of the Sheep.

75
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,839
Scott: Yeah, it's probably a fine movie.

76
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,872
Scott: The people who worked on that probably worked very hard and probably made something.

77
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,260
Scott: I've obviously never seen it and probably won't ever see it.

78
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,738
Rym: But I doubt I would watch it and say, "Wow, that blows Wolfwalkers out of the

79
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:20,019
Rym: water.".

80
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,920
Scott: Right, I'm sure children would watch it and enjoy it, and it's probably, you know, very well done and such, but is it Oscar-worthy?

81
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:38,560
Rym: Yeah, because whatever the Oscar ostensibly is, do experts agree that of all the films in this category in this whole year, this one was the best of them?

82
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,596
Rym: There might be a year where all the movies are shit, and best feature is a garbage movie.

83
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,560
Rym: Like, that could happen.

84
00:07:44,181 --> 00:08:08,480
Scott: But, right, ideally speaking, if you made good awards and not shitty ones, and you were going to use the same sort of nomination and then award process, because there are other processes you could use that look nothing like that, but that's, you know, the process that most of these awards have come to, you should look at every category and basically, like, every single nomination should be a hard choice, right?

85
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,174
Scott: And if something obviously, like, is like, "No, no way that could win,".

86
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,160
Scott: why is it, it shouldn't even be nominated?

87
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,371
Scott: I think they have a thing where, like, they have to nominate, like, a certain number.

88
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,880
Scott: Like, you know, it's always five, I think, right?

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,513
Scott: It already seems like it's five, at least.

90
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:23,260
Scott: I'm probably wrong.

91
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:36,008
Scott: But it's like, you should, it shouldn't, if you're going to use a nominate and then award process, if there are only, like, two things that, like, could win, you should only give out two nominations, right?

92
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,837
Scott: You shouldn't be like, "Well, we have to nominate five just because arbitrary

93
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:40,139
Scott: number.".

94
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:47,420
Scott: Well, I could argue that- If there are ten things and it's a tough choice between all ten, you should have ten nominations, right?

95
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,354
Rym: Well, the other thing, I think we even talked about this at GeekNights.

96
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,160
Rym: that would be interesting.

97
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:56,040
Rym: One, you gotta find a way to make the Academy Awards, at least, like, force these people to watch the movies.

98
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:06,700
Rym: Like, they should all have to take a test, like, at some point to prove that they saw the movie, and if they fail that test on any movie that they had a say in the vote for, all their votes get discounted.

99
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:11,008
Scott: I think they should just do it- Like, name one character from Wolfwalkers.

100
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,580
Rym: If you can't do that, your animated feature vote doesn't count.

101
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,566
Scott: I think it should just be done, you know, if I was in control, right?

102
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:26,780
Scott: What I would do is I would get together, right, this audience, right, of a diverse audience representing, like, the general populace.

103
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,340
Scott: People who know about movies, people who don't, people of all sorts of colors, shapes, sizes, ages, right?

104
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,060
Rym: Like, nominate the Academy every year.

105
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,056
Scott: And I would pay them money, right?

106
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:37,639
Scott: You get paid.

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,539
Scott: 'Cause we're gonna make you watch a lot of movies, that's time, you should get money for that, right?

108
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:46,840
Scott: And the Oscars bring in a ton of money, so they have money to pay these people, right?

109
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:52,700
Scott: And what you should do is you should randomly assign the people to a category, right?

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,460
Scott: So, you might randomly get assigned to a category you're familiar with, or one you're unfamiliar with.

111
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,320
Scott: You should get a nice mix of people who are familiar and unfamiliar.

112
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:10,860
Scott: And then, you sit the people down, and we can go by something, we can't make them watch, say, for example, in a category, every animated feature film from the whole year.

113
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,980
Scott: That would be impossible, right?

114
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:18,940
Scott: But we can obviously pick based on some other factor, like maybe gross, right?

115
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:24,560
Scott: The top ten grossing ones to even qualify to get watched or something from anywhere in the world, right, you know?

116
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:39,239
Scott: And then, we would say, "Okay, you're gonna have to sit here over the course of two, three days, maybe, and watch all these movies, and you're just gonna fill out little survey cards after each movie, and then at the end, a final survey

117
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,539
Scott: card.".

118
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:44,800
Scott: And that will, you know, will then use that to determine who won.

119
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,499
Scott: And that's, you know, something like that.

120
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:55,698
Rym: But I guess, Wolfwalkers honestly, like for real, deserves this Oscar, and I am so confident that Soul's gonna get it instead, even though, like, I watched Soul.

121
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,660
Rym: It's a fantastic movie.

122
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:11,820
Scott: I don't think that, I mean, I also agree that the probability is in Soul's favor, knowing how the Oscars work, but I am not giving Wolfwalkers a 0% chance, because there is Apple money behind it, right?

123
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,430
Rym: Ah, yeah, that is true.

124
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,900
Rym: Yeah, it's not 0%.

125
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,538
Scott: I'm not saying it's, you know, it's not 0%, but I'm saying it's less than...

126
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,540
Rym: I'm just saying, I am in a pessimistic mood.

127
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,628
Scott: I'm thinking like 80/20, 80/20 for Soul?

128
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,500
Rym: Just because of the fact that the exact same thing happened with Tom Moore's previous movie?

129
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,761
Scott: Of course.

130
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,365
Scott: Alright, so, other anime news.

131
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:39,600
Scott: If you don't know, Discotek has been saving the US anime world for the past however long they've been doing it.

132
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:48,220
Scott: And they love, lately, what they've been doing is sort of, you know, Apple-esque sort of keynotes where, you know, they're not at a convention.

133
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,220
Scott: They're just dropping, like, big piles of licensed news all at once, right, in these tweet threads.

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,960
Scott: And the last time they did one, we reported it on the news, and we're doing it again.

135
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,670
Scott: So, good marketing job, Discotek.

136
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,200
Scott: So, what did Discotek drop on us this time?

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,820
Scott: Number one, they licensed brother, dear brother, they're gonna make boullés.

138
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:13,071
Rym: You don't have to like this show, but this show is very important.

139
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:16,480
Rym: This is one of those shows, I think we've reviewed it on GeekNights in an ancient time.

140
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,180
Scott: The manga for brother, dear brother is made by the same person who made the manga for Rosa Versailles.

141
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:33,140
Scott: It's legendary in many ways, it is not up everyone's alley, but, you know, if you're a Rosa Versailles liker like I am, you know, it's like I've known about brother, dear brother.

142
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:35,120
Rym: I watched it all.

143
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,580
Scott: And I've always kinda wanted to see the deal, but I never did, but maybe now's the chance, maybe, you know, it's 'cause it's coming.

144
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,880
Scott: I'm not gonna buy boullés, obviously.

145
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,800
Rym: It's one of those shows where you may like it, may not like it, just like Evangelion.

146
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:58,580
Rym: I respect that some people, like, people don't necessarily like Evangelion, but it is important to anime and animation in ways that unless you see it, you might not realize.

147
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,460
Rym: Brother, dear brother inspired a lot of anime that came long after, and the echoes of this show still reverberate today.

148
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:17,240
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, they said that the license period is unusually short, so that means that they're basically gonna release boullés and then their license might expire pretty much immediately.

149
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,960
Scott: So you have to buy those, you know, I wouldn't buy boullés, but you're gonna have to jump on this while you can, right?

150
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:32,360
Scott: Other news, a show that doesn't seem old but actually is ancient and also legendary, Sergeant Frog, they licensed that.

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:44,700
Scott: They're gonna release all 358 episodes in successive SD boullés, 'cause you can fit a lot of episodes on an SD boullé, and the show wasn't in HD to begin with.

152
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,487
Scott: That is 2.7 Sailor Moons.

153
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:48,801
Scott: Right?

154
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:54,253
Scott: So, Sergeant Frog is just, you know, a legendary kids parody comedy show.

155
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,660
Scott: You know, it's been around a super long time.

156
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,008
Rym: I've seen, like, a smattering of random episodes.

157
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,040
Rym: It's funny, it's not something I would necessarily seek out and watch all of.

158
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,171
Scott: But I think it's just a significant show, whether you care about it or not, right?

159
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,399
Scott: So to release all of it in English is something.

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,320
Rym: It's funny, you know, one thing that is significant to that show in terms of, like, anime fandom, especially in America, but also in Japan, is that the closers were notable for having dances that people would emulate.

161
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,858
Scott: Some other small shows, they got Kashimashi something, I don't know what that is.

162
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:33,774
Scott: They're releasing Nyanbo, which is basically a cat version of Cardbo, Cardbo from Yotsuba, right?

163
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:36,280
Scott: It has this, like, a little CG anime, Nyanbo.

164
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,639
Rym: Oh, Magical Girl Ore.

165
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,512
Scott: Magical Ore, right?

166
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,780
Scott: Some other stuff, right?

167
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:58,800
Scott: The big news, which we talked about last time, how they couldn't find the original masters for Project Eiko, so they were using, like, this magical restoring device that would basically, you know, do the best job it could with the best laser disc sources they had available.

168
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:15,339
Scott: What happened is Robert Woodhead, if you don't know Robert Woodhead, Robert Woodhead is a legend in the US anime industry, created Anime Ego, which I'm pretty sure is gone now, but Anime Ego was basically making the best legal anime releases back in the 2000s, 90s even, right?

169
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,019
Scott: Very legendary, important person.

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,772
Scott: Robert Woodhead went to some film vault somewhere, and apparently there was just, like, the way it was organized.

171
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:31,760
Scott: there, like, the catalog or something was messed up, I don't know, a misspelling or a miscategorization?

172
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:41,640
Scott: And Robert Woodhead knew how to find the Project Eiko masters that were definitely in that vault and were just, you know, not labeled or placed properly for some reason.

173
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:53,840
Rym: Which means the Project Eiko re-release will now be from the original 35mm print instead of that very clever previous solution, which was pulling the raw data off of the laser discs and doing the best they could.

174
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,560
Scott: Yep, so we're looking forward to this Project Eiko release here.

175
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,960
Rym: Project Eiko was the third anime I ever saw.

176
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:04,780
Scott: Maybe when it comes out, GeekNights' Time.

177
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,206
Rym: I think it still holds up.

178
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,980
Rym: I have not seen it in, like, a decade, I'm pretty sure.

179
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,260
Scott: I haven't seen it in forever.

180
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:14,300
Rym: I am confident it will be just as funny to me now as it was when I was in fourth grade.

181
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,679
Scott: We need Eiko to go outside and find whoever's car alarm keeps going off.

182
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,260
Scott: Of course, Eiko could just probably throw the car into the river and then we'd be fine, right?

183
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,020
Rym: The fact that as a kid I didn't get that it was a comedy and I kind of just treated it as a superhero movie.

184
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:29,240
Scott: Hmm.

185
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,739
Scott: Alright, other news.

186
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,460
Scott: So, everybody knows about, you know, you think about, like, legendary anime, you know, directors.

187
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,878
Scott: We got our Satoshi Kans, you got your Miyazakis, obviously, right?

188
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,540
Scott: All those people.

189
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:49,860
Scott: There was a person that is not often mentioned, right, who was named Yasuo Otsuka.

190
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,440
Scott: And Yasuo Otsuka wasn't, like, a director, it was like an animation director, right?

191
00:16:55,062 --> 00:17:00,060
Scott: But Yasuo Otsuka was sort of like even the before times, right?

192
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,000
Scott: You know, he was like, you know, the mentor to the Miyazakis and the Isao Takahata's of the world, right?

193
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:13,200
Rym: He joined Toei when it had a different name in 1956.

194
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,619
Scott: Right, so he was like, you know, he gets to Toei and it's like, you know, Miyazaki's working on Horace, Prince of Sun.

195
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,440
Scott: And it's like a young guy when Otsuka is already the old guy there, right?

196
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:29,840
Scott: He worked on a lot of Lupin movies, you know, Future Boy Conan, right?

197
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,380
Scott: All these, like, super old, you know, much older anime and then retired at some point.

198
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,070
Scott: But yeah, the news is that he passed away at the age of 89.

199
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,280
Scott: I'll take 89.

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,804
Scott: I can't complain about that.

201
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:53,620
Scott: But still a sad news, you know, such a legendary figure in the anime industry who does not get the deserved attention, right?

202
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,059
Scott: Not being a, you know, primary director of super popular things that people know about today, right?

203
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,540
Scott: But super important.

204
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,500
Scott: The same way that, like, you know, Ip Man, who supposedly taught Bruce Lee, right, didn't get the attention, right?

205
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,579
Scott: Bruce Lee got all the attention until more recently.

206
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,019
Scott: People are like, oh, Ip Man, because someone made a good Ip Man movie, right?

207
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:18,739
Scott: This is sort of that kind of deal.

208
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:26,940
Rym: So instead of news, I've actually got three Geek Bytes because I've been watching a lot of animation lately, and there's a lot of really good stuff out there.

209
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:31,559
Rym: I'll go brief on these because I'm pretty sure we'll review all three of these on GeekNights at some point.

210
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Rym: But first, I know I mentioned this, I've seen an entire arc now of The Great Pretender, a recent anime.

211
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,680
Scott: It's on the Netflix.

212
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,439
Rym: It's on the Netflix.

213
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:44,540
Rym: It's got Cowboy Bebop vibes, like, for real.

214
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:51,160
Scott: The live-action Cowboy Bebop from Netflix has finished filming, supposedly, for a season.

215
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,740
Rym: It's also got some big Lupin vibes.

216
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,140
Rym: And what I'll say about it is that it is one of the better anime I've seen in a long time.

217
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:04,760
Rym: You know that feeling when you're watching a show and you kind of like it, you watch a few episodes, you pause, maybe finish it later.

218
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,520
Rym: But you know when you watch a show and an episode ends and all you think is, I just want to watch the next episode.

219
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:12,720
Rym: This show is that.

220
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:22,240
Rym: This is the kind of show where if we were still running RIT anime, we would have shown the first four episodes and would have probably done the marathon the following weekend.

221
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,560
Scott: If we were running an anime club, though, today, how would it work getting Netflix permissions to screen things?

222
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,346
Rym: You know what we should do?

223
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,940
Rym: We should ask the RIT anime club.

224
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,047
Rym: I got a lot of contacts there.

225
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:33,893
Rym: Let's see how they do it.

226
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,719
Rym: I'm curious what they do.

227
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,959
Scott: Yeah, I'm curious what the deal is now.

228
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,180
Rym: I mean, we definitely flew fast and loose.

229
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:47,600
Rym: One of our favorite techniques was to send a letter to the anime studio or the company that had the rights who we knew would probably say no.

230
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,794
Rym: And we'd basically say, "Hey, we're going to show this on this date in our club.

231
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:52,778
Rym: Let us know if that's not

232
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:53,120
Rym: cool.".

233
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,138
Rym: And either they wouldn't respond or the letter would come after we had already shown it.

234
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,960
Scott: Yeah, and they're not going to, you know, you're basically betting.

235
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,200
Scott: Like if they came after you with a lawyer, it's like the court would obviously see that you were doing this not in good faith.

236
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,233
Rym: Yep, and if the court came after me, I would say, "This is a club and a college.

237
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,377
Rym: I hereby resign from the

238
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:12,638
Rym: club.".

239
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,720
Scott: Yes, I'm not legally responsible for the thing.

240
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,525
Rym: Yeah, guess what, anime kids?

241
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:23,500
Rym: Now that it's been 20 years, I can spill the sausage on how we actually ran the RIT anime club.

242
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,019
Scott: Yeah, it's like the school is the one who's going to have to pay, not me.

243
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,478
Scott: I guess they could academically kick you out of the school, right?

244
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:36,954
Rym: I was just the facilities coordinator.

245
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,680
Rym: I had no idea what the librarian was doing.

246
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:48,940
Rym: But The Great Pretender is real good, and it is apparent how good it is from the first episode.

247
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:55,060
Rym: I promise you, if you watch one episode of this, you're probably going to be into it.

248
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,089
Scott: What are they pretending?

249
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:58,708
Rym: They're con men.

250
00:20:58,929 --> 00:20:59,552
Rym: It's The Sting.

251
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,320
Rym: This is a con artist show.

252
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:08,994
Rym: The show starts following a small-time con artist in Japan who gets conned himself by a bigger con artist.

253
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,420
Rym: And it just escalates and escalates and escalates.

254
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,740
Scott: And then learns from the master con artist.

255
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:29,699
Rym: This show goes from "I am pretending to be the water inspector to try to trick you into buying a filter," to "breaking bad with even bigger stakes within a couple

256
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:29,880
Rym: episodes.".

257
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Scott: I am pretending to be the Prime Minister and getting away with it.

258
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:43,780
Rym: Episode two, they're running a scam prop plane racing company in Singapore, and it is just going off the charts.

259
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,260
Rym: The show is great.

260
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,578
Scott: What else did you watch?

261
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,525
Rym: So we watched a movie, a recent movie.

262
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,054
Rym: This is a Chinese animated film from 2019, The Legend of Hei.

263
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,240
Rym: We watched it, I think, with G-Kids and the Children's International Film Festival.

264
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,080
Rym: I don't know how to watch it otherwise, because that's done now.

265
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,426
Scott: There's an official trailer.

266
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,860
Scott: That's a nice movie poster with a cute little kitty.

267
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,309
Rym: This movie is about that kitty.

268
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,314
Rym: It is beautiful.

269
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,760
Rym: The characters are great.

270
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,486
Rym: The dub, good enough.

271
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:18,639
Rym: It's a pretty good dub, because the subtitle version wasn't available, at least when we watched it.

272
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,388
Rym: I highly recommend this movie.

273
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,760
Rym: I think it is specifically up Scott's alley.

274
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,014
Rym: I have very little bad to say about this movie.

275
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:29,040
Rym: I enjoyed it to the end.

276
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,824
Rym: The ending was good.

277
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:30,468
Rym: The plot was good.

278
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:31,454
Rym: The characters were great.

279
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:32,440
Rym: It moved quick.

280
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:36,760
Rym: It had a lot of anime tropes that were good, but it also did its own thing.

281
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,120
Rym: It's very clearly a Chinese movie, informed by Chinese sensibilities, Chinese animation.

282
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:47,240
Rym: You should watch it, and I'd like to say a lot more about it that I think we should save for a review.

283
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:49,747
Rym: This is a must-see movie.

284
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,720
Rym: If you like animated movies, there's no reason not to watch this movie.

285
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:10,780
Scott: It does appear that on the New York International Children's Film Festival.org website, nicff.org, you can still buy and watch movies from the festival this year, because it was online.

286
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:14,797
Rym: I think what expired for us is we bought access to the festival itself.

287
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:15,560
Rym: We watched all the shorts.

288
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:21,460
Scott: You can get an encore pass for $60, an all-access pass for $100.

289
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,123
Scott: Take your time.

290
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,558
Scott: Watch the whole slate whenever you want with an all-access pass valid through March 21st.

291
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:34,319
Scott: So if you buy it for $100, you've got three or four days, basically, depending on where you live and when you hear this, or maybe zero days.

292
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,716
Scott: Maybe I'll have to watch The Legend of Hey real soon.

293
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,240
Rym: I think you will specifically like many parts of this movie.

294
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:48,480
Scott: I guess Sunday would be the end, but yeah, it looks like you still have time.

295
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,320
Scott: That's the point.

296
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,220
Rym: And third, I watched Raya and the Last Dragon, the new Disney movie.

297
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:56,519
Scott: Oh, okay.

298
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:00,031
Rym: It is, honestly, pretty fantastic.

299
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:02,340
Rym: There's a lot to recommend this movie.

300
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,820
Rym: I think the things that I would want to say about it are that one, it's got a really cool dragon character design.

301
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,680
Rym: Who is featured prominently.

302
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Rym: Two, mostly female cast, like it's mostly women.

303
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:17,820
Rym: There aren't like main dudes in this movie, which I think is a good step for Disney.

304
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,980
Rym: And three, it's just beautiful.

305
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:24,516
Rym: I want to watch this on the big screen once.

306
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:31,100
Rym: that's safe to do, because I don't think our little shitty 1080p failing television really did this movie justice.

307
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:42,120
Scott: It is actually sort of eh, because the TV we have, the 1080p TV we have, it's 50 something, maybe it's 50 inch, I guess, I don't know.

308
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,112
Scott: But it's plenty good, right?

309
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:45,300
Scott: There's nothing wrong with it.

310
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,800
Rym: Not like mine that is actually failing bit by bit.

311
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:55,220
Scott: But I bought a 4K monitor, so 4K content is still quite rare.

312
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:03,478
Scott: But occasionally, there's like a YouTube video that's 4K, and it's like, wow, is it nice to watch it in 4K.

313
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Rym: I got these 4K monitors a while ago, and you came over, and you saw how long ago this was, and I had Auto Chess open before GeekNights, because I was finishing a match.

314
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,720
Scott: Why does your Auto Chess look so good?

315
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,478
Rym: Yeah, you were like, and I was like, Scott, it's 4K.

316
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:31,260
Scott: But it's like, yeah, I'm still not going to get a 4K TV, though, until that one breaks, or until lots and lots of content is 4K, and not just the occasional YouTube video, or Netflix.

317
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:39,313
Rym: But this movie is good, I like this movie a lot, not just because, if you know me at all, you know how into dragons I am, but I like that.

318
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:45,340
Rym: dragons featured prominently, and didn't just die at the end of the movie, like usually happens with dragon stuff.

319
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:55,519
Rym: But the ending is good, and I like what they did with it, and I'm being obtuse on purpose, because obviously, let's go see this movie, I'm not going to spoil it for you.

320
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:11,080
Rym: But the other thing I'll say about it is that I saw a lot of people online complaining that the dragon was too cutesy, too feminine, or too My Little Pony looking, and I would say that the dragon character design is what makes this movie great instead of just good.

321
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:15,379
Rym: This is a My Little Pony looking character design, and I am here for this.

322
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,459
Scott: Anyone who makes that kind of complaint is just telling it on themselves.

323
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,980
Rym: Yep, yep, yep, those are the literal words I was about to say, and you preempted me.

324
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:28,520
Scott: Come on, let me know what kind of person you are once you say something like that.

325
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:49,920
Rym: Yep, but the last thing I'll say is that the character, the dragon, when she comes onto the scene, like appears in the movie, you know that archetype character like Eda in The Owl House, or Ryoko in Tenchi Muyo, like someone who is ancient and powerful, and she's kind of dangerous, but she's also kind of a disaster and a fuck-up.

326
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,660
Rym: Like, that archetype of character is one of my favorite tropes, and the dragon in this movie is that.

327
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,160
Rym: The dragon is kind of like the fuck-up dragon, and it's good.

328
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,960
Scott: How would it be if you made a story where there's like four of those characters?

329
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:07,913
Rym: That's Tenchi Muyo.

330
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:10,485
Scott: Is it?

331
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,299
Scott: I thought there's only a couple, anyway.

332
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,340
Rym: I mean, I guess Owl House, there's only one, like Eda, like it's the character who is that, and everyone else around her.

333
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,689
Scott: I guess El Hazzard, aren't there.

334
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:19,837
Scott: like the several...

335
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,840
Rym: You know what, the three priestesses are all kind of like that.

336
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,496
Scott: That's right, the three priestesses in El Hazzard, but there's sort of like one character?

337
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:27,280
Scott: I don't know, anyway.

338
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,939
Rym: Also, the teacher, it's not like the female version, but he's the male equivalent of that.

339
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,925
Rym: What does that say?

340
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:39,240
Rym: He's like the late 30s kind of a fuck-up, but actually does the right thing.

341
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:47,800
Rym: Out of that whole space of flawed disaster characters who do the right thing in the end, but are actually kind of evil sometimes, too.

342
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,420
Rym: There's something going on that I like about that kind of character.

343
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,059
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

344
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,510
Rym: Scott called dibs on this thing of the day, so I'll let him go second.

345
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:02,664
Rym: I did.

346
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:07,450
Rym: I was hoping he'd forget, like I had it open in a tab, because it's so good.

347
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,239
Rym: So I had to bring the most powerful thing I could bring, and the best I got is... You know the game Among Us?

348
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,470
Rym: There's an imposter.

349
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,090
Scott: It's pretty popular.

350
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,888
Rym: Go Google, I'm not going to explain what Among Us is.

351
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:25,950
Rym: Another channel I've done before, TwoSet Violin, those two cool violin dudes who talk about violins and like violin playing.

352
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,237
Rym: They did a video.

353
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,750
Rym: This is so perfect.

354
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:38,050
Rym: They made their own version of Among Us that can only be played by classical string musicians.

355
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,661
Rym: They got a bunch of musicians together.

356
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,009
Rym: They're going to play a piece.

357
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,148
Rym: Four of the people in this group, or two depends, like they have a bunch of different modes.

358
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:54,750
Rym: they tried, have the same sheet music, except there are specific sections in red that are wrong.

359
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:59,150
Rym: They have to play the wrong parts and not get caught.

360
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,315
Scott: Okay, okay.

361
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,968
Rym: But everyone else can be like, "Nope, I'm calling a meeting.

362
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,835
Rym: I heard Joey Jojo.

363
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:07,959
Rym: I think they played a flat...".

364
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,359
Scott: But maybe you just fucked up.

365
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:16,440
Rym: If you just fuck up, think about it, Among Us, if you just fuck up, you're going to get voted off the island anyway.

366
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,802
Scott: Exactly.

367
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,380
Scott: So if you get to the end of the piece and there are still imposters alive, then they win?

368
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,691
Rym: Yeah, so this video is 30 minutes long.

369
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,400
Rym: They made up good rules.

370
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:27,825
Rym: Watch the video to see.

371
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:33,680
Rym: They made the rules sufficient to make this work for real, and that is legitimately impressive.

372
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,619
Rym: Most of the time when someone says, "Oh, let's make Among Us but fa, like fubar, like make my own rules, it's always

373
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:41,040
Rym: garbage."

374
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:41,964
Rym: Or, "It's just a

375
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,286
Rym: joke.".

376
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,280
Rym: They did this for real, and I'm very impressed by that.

377
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,347
Scott: It sounds fun.

378
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:49,780
Scott: Something for musicians to do because they can't hold any concerts.

379
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,891
Scott: Did you know that Met Opera laid a bunch of people off?

380
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,597
Scott: I think some large percentage, I heard as high as 40% of people just left New York City, 10% retired.

381
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,740
Scott: They're basically threatening if they come back to negotiate.

382
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:11,460
Scott: I think I was reading, if they come back to negotiate, they're going to offer them partial money.

383
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,299
Scott: They don't even want to go back because then they'll have a shit deal.

384
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,640
Scott: It's like they're better off just holding out.

385
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,992
Rym: The New Republic Library, this is a total aside, they have a kit.

386
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:23,040
Rym: If you have a library card, you can just go get it.

387
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,526
Rym: Anyone in New York can get this.

388
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:40,660
Rym: The kit is if you are a performer or musician of some kind, and you need hardware to be able to stream yourself and create from your house, they'll give you a fancy keyboard, a bunch of recording equipment, lights, cameras, everything in a kit.

389
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:44,860
Scott: What does that have to do with the people at the Met Opera being screwed out of money?

390
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:54,000
Rym: Because the rationale for this kit is that a lot of creators in New York City have left New York City or otherwise can't create.

391
00:30:55,762 --> 00:31:07,040
Rym: There's a situation around New York's going to be struggling to find even backup musicians or studio musicians, people to fill in all the creative gaps that currently were previously filled.

392
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,704
Scott: I think that's an incentive to stay.

393
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:20,620
Scott: If you can hold out through the end and people don't come back so quickly, you can then demand higher wages at the point where it's like, "Who else are you going to

394
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,700
Scott: get?".

395
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,859
Scott: All the other people who play this instrument have left town.

396
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,648
Scott: Who are you going to find to play an oboe in five minutes?

397
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:26,813
Scott: It's me.

398
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:28,620
Scott: I'm the only oboe in town now.

399
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:38,880
Rym: Currently, the whole reason a lot of things are in New York is because you can literally say, "I need extremely long, detailed set of skills," and there are like 10 people who can do that for you.

400
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,277
Scott: I need someone who can play an oboe at a master level and weighs less than this amount because the stage is shoddy.

401
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,580
Rym: Suspended from the sky, and they have to be able to play DDR because we're making a movie.

402
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,139
Scott: Yeah, and they have to speak this language, and they have to learn this piece or already know it.

403
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,829
Scott: It's like, "Okay, we found two candidates.

404
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:01,332
Scott: You want to do whole

405
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:01,794
Scott: auditions?".

406
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,020
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

407
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:08,343
Scott: Oh, I do.

408
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:08,786
Scott: I forgot.

409
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,900
Scott: I was going meta moment land there.

410
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:18,679
Scott: This thing of the day, it's from that website, The Hard Times, which is basically the onion of video game nerdery.

411
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:22,599
Scott: I think we've used it for things of the day before.

412
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:31,760
Scott: But this particular article is that case where parody approaches reality, but you can't tell the difference between parody and reality.

413
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,203
Scott: It's usually a bad thing.

414
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:39,796
Scott: Someone's making a satirical parody about something awful in the world, and it's like, "No, actually, that's real,".

415
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:41,880
Scott: and you'll get not the onion.

416
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,395
Rym: Or the joke is just the headline, and the article isn't actually funny.

417
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:48,640
Rym: It's just to support the joke.

418
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:55,740
Scott: Right, so this article here, a parody article, supposedly, is about one of my favorite scenes in anime.

419
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:10,380
Scott: It's actually a scene that happens in many anime, the scene where they're just showing an empty street or terrain in Japan somewhere, usually including homes, trees, power lines, very frequent.

420
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:15,480
Scott: And you're hearing the noises of the cicadas as they sound in Japan.

421
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:24,020
Scott: If you're watching an anime, what this scene is supposed to tell you is A, we're filling up time in the episode.

422
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:29,780
Scott: B, we're pacing the episode with some environmental storytelling.

423
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,069
Scott: And C, it's summer and it's hot.

424
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:36,059
Scott: We're letting you know what the weather is and the time of year is.

425
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:50,200
Scott: The only one I've seen where it has even further meanings are in Lain, because the power lines in Lain have an additional meaning, and those are a bigger focus in the visual aspect of the scene.

426
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:58,220
Scott: And in Evangelion, because in Evangelion, I don't know how many people watch Evangelion and don't realize this, it's always summer.

427
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:00,864
Scott: Winter has been destroyed.

428
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:02,889
Scott: No one's having any babies.

429
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,299
Scott: It's a semi-apocalyptic situation that they are stuck in.

430
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,105
Scott: No humans are being born.

431
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,935
Scott: It's super hot everywhere on Earth.

432
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,159
Scott: Is there even precipitation?

433
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,560
Rym: The end of summer is an endless summer, and there is nothing coming after that.

434
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:25,935
Scott: Right, so that's why there's always cicadas in Evangelion, reminding you it's still hot.

435
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:28,460
Scott: The hotness has not stopped.

436
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,755
Scott: And then the scenes of characters wiping sweat off all the time because it's so hot out and drinking beers.

437
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:35,859
Scott: It's hot.

438
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:36,239
Scott: Anyway.

439
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,388
Scott: So here, the article that they made is what?

440
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,040
Scott: Top 10 power lines and cicada noises?

441
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,580
Rym: Static shots of power lines with cicada noises.

442
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,748
Scott: Right, so it's like, for them, they're like, "Ah, it's a joke.

443
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,933
Scott: Lots of anime have this

444
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:53,254
Scott: scene.".

445
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:55,260
Scott: But for me, it's like, sincere.

446
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,083
Scott: It's like, I love those.

447
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:00,313
Scott: I love static shots of power lines and cicada noises.

448
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,840
Scott: Those are a good, somewhat good top 10.

449
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,719
Rym: I have very little disagreement with this list.

450
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,039
Scott: There's a few of the shows I've never heard of.

451
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,947
Rym: But the commentary is real.

452
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,039
Rym: Like, there's a real commentary on each one of these.

453
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:16,307
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you read an Onion article.

454
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:18,172
Scott: Usually, not the Onion article.

455
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:20,738
Scott: It's like, you're reading a true story and you're like, "This should be on the

456
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:21,059
Scott: Onion.".

457
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,205
Scott: This is, I'm reading something on an Onion equivalent.

458
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:28,171
Scott: They're writing it as a joke, but I take it completely at face value.

459
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,414
Scott: I'm like, "Yeah.

460
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,137
Scott: Power lines and cicada noises.

461
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:31,798
Scott: That's my jam.

462
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:32,339
Scott: Pick me

463
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:32,519
Scott: up.".

464
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,175
Rym: Now to see a top 10 "I haven't yet shown you my full

465
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:36,517
Rym: power.".

466
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,438
Scott: I would agree with that also.

467
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:43,512
Scott: I love "I haven't yet shown you my full

468
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:43,793
Scott: power.".

469
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,348
Rym: In the meantime, we can't go anywhere, but our panels can.

470
00:35:48,428 --> 00:36:02,880
Rym: So if you missed the Judge Anime by its Cover panel that we did for the Crunchyroll Expo, well, basically because we couldn't redistribute that on our YouTube channel, almost the exact same panel is going to be at Zenk icon online this weekend.

471
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,380
Scott: Okay, sure.

472
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:13,340
Rym: Because it's basically, we did 45 minutes of talking about how to judge anime by its cover, and then we only actually talked about shows in the very end.

473
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,279
Rym: And I went back and actually looked at how we judged those shows.

474
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,150
Rym: Gibiade wasn't as good as we hoped it would be.

475
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,459
Rym: But otherwise, we were pretty spot on as far as I could see.

476
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:35,780
Scott: Otherwise... Oh, so the Book Club book after a year plus, who knows how long, is still The Tale of Genji, the first novel ever written by humans.

477
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,280
Scott: And the human who wrote it is Murasaki Shikibu.

478
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,500
Scott: I read a significant portion of the next chapter that I was reading last night where progress is being made.

479
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,500
Rym: I did not read more since we did a show on Monday, but I'm continuing at a steady pace.

480
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,875
Scott: I am getting close to 10% complete.

481
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,115
Rym: Alright, maybe 10% is a good point.

482
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:02,739
Rym: 10-12% is a good point for us to do a little brief chat in the moment.

483
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,658
Scott: Are we going to just do 10 episodes instead of one?

484
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,694
Scott: I feel like we can just do one episode when we're done reading 100% like we usually do.

485
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:16,172
Scott: But yeah, if you want to read along with us, you can.

486
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:19,220
Scott: Or, you know, wait and we'll do an episode.

487
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:32,560
Scott: And then, I promise after that, I'm going to at least... I can't help what Rym picks for Book Clubs, but I will make a concerted... You know, after this incident of the Book Club that went on too long and a pandemic, right?

488
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,213
Scott: I'm going to basically be like, "Well, a pandemic can happen at any time,

489
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,097
Scott: again.".

490
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,580
Scott: So therefore, we're going to do more rapid book clubbing, at least I hope, afterwards.

491
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,280
Rym: The key is I can get outside, I can sit in a park and read a book, and that really accelerates my book reading.

492
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:49,820
Scott: Or a beach, hopefully.

493
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,040
Rym: Oh my god, I just want to lay on a beach all day reading books.

494
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,062
Scott: Yep.

495
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,520
Scott: Well, anyway.

496
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,041
Rym: Alright, so, Vultus 5 is an anime from 1977.

497
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:09,920
Scott: So this anime was made, basically, you know, there was a whole bunch of robot shows made back in the day, right?

498
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,060
Scott: And a lot of them were made by the same company.

499
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:19,060
Scott: They would make one, it would end, you know, for the kids, right?

500
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,140
Scott: And then they would come and they'd make another one for the kids again, right?

501
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,000
Scott: So, you know, there was a lot of studios involved.

502
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:33,414
Scott: If you look at Wikipedia, it's like, "Studios, Tohoku Shinsha Nippon Sunrise Toei

503
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:33,835
Scott: Company.".

504
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,320
Scott: It was on TV Asahi, it was the broadcasting company.

505
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,760
Scott: And it's created by Saburo Yatsude.

506
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,739
Scott: Saburo Yatsude is not a person.

507
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:58,715
Scott: It was basically a made-up name that they would put as the creator of several things, indicating that basically the same team of people was basically creating the show, but they didn't actually put an actual creator's name on it.

508
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:03,980
Scott: the way that, you know, Leiji Matsumoto is a real person or Kiyo Hayamezaki is a real person.

509
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:07,340
Scott: And there were several such shows made by the same people.

510
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Scott: The one you're probably most familiar with is Voltron/Beast King Go Lion, right?

511
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,419
Scott: Which we can do a show about someday if we haven't already.

512
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,610
Scott: Voltron came out in 1980, early '80s, right?

513
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Scott: So this preceded Voltron by quite a few years, for four years maybe.

514
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:37,000
Scott: But you cannot help but compare the two shows because there are so many similarities, but enough differences that are significant and worth discussing, right?

515
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,620
Scott: So it's a show, there's 40 episodes, it is made to sell toys to children.

516
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,920
Rym: Yup, Judy, you cannot escape that fact.

517
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:53,239
Rym: In literally every episode, The Volt is Five, it'll form, or if it doesn't form, there's a reason why it didn't form.

518
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:55,559
Rym: And then it's gonna basically spin tops.

519
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:06,220
Scott: It'll use all of its special attacks, which are advertising the features of the toy, it will use the same special moves, right, or get new special moves.

520
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:13,980
Scott: There's, you know, stock animation sequences of it transforming or doing special attacks that are repeated every episode.

521
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,100
Scott: Sometimes more than once per episode will have to combine.

522
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:32,420
Scott: You know, it's basically showing kids all the different ways they can play with this toy, The Volt is Five, which is five vehicles, right, formed that you can combine into a robot in kind of a not great way.

523
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,300
Scott: You know, it's like I think at this point in time, like they probably still weren't great at making the combining toys, right?

524
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:44,700
Scott: This predates like the Transformers Devastator, it predates Voltron obviously, right?

525
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:49,019
Rym: A mask which had the most complex transforming toys.

526
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,200
Scott: It predates Matt Cross Valkyries, right?

527
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,220
Scott: So it's the way in which the toy functions and thus the way it appears in the show is very inelegant, right?

528
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,439
Scott: It's like the legs and the waist are just like one big U-shaped boat thing.

529
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,320
Rym: They go to great pains to show you like, "No, this makes sense," when like the cockpit of the main guy will like rotate twice.

530
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,879
Scott: Yeah, the feet are like come off and combine into a vehicle and then separate and just stick on the bottom as the two feet.

531
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,320
Scott: Like the ninja girl's job is to pilot the feet.

532
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:27,120
Scott: The two arms are vehicles and the rest of it is just one vehicle.

533
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,940
Scott: The head and torso is all one vehicle.

534
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,360
Scott: So it's not very elegant.

535
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:33,312
Scott: It's kind of cool, right?

536
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:35,440
Scott: It's called the Volt is Five.

537
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,660
Scott: I think that might have been just some, they tried to use English.

538
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:44,040
Scott: and it's just the Volt's Five, like Volt as in electricity because it's powered by electromagnetism.

539
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,040
Rym: Yup, the translation of the name is Super Electromagnetic Machine, Volt's Five.

540
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,739
Scott: Right, Volt is Five.

541
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,540
Scott: And it's called Volt is Five because it has five pilots just like Voltron.

542
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,520
Scott: It even has, slash go lion, this main white dude, right?

543
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,200
Scott: There's big dude.

544
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,900
Scott: There's jerky dude in blue.

545
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,420
Scott: It's even the same colors, right?

546
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,720
Scott: Main dude is red.

547
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,740
Scott: Yeah, little kid, right?

548
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,180
Scott: And there's the lady.

549
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:11,220
Scott: Little kid is in green and then girl, right?

550
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,701
Scott: It's from 1970.

551
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:19,540
Scott: The sexism and other problems of 1970s Japanese kid show cannot be overlooked.

552
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,178
Rym: They're there.

553
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,499
Scott: They are there in full force.

554
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:25,839
Scott: And that's what the show is.

555
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:28,040
Scott: It's monster of the week, right?

556
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,260
Scott: How do they, they form a team to fight an alien invading force that sends evil beast knights, right?

557
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,040
Scott: In Voltron, it was Robeasts, I guess, that came in those awesome coffins that would land.

558
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:45,140
Scott: Here, the bad guys basically are just building beast knights and sending them to fight.

559
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,658
Scott: Monster of the week.

560
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:52,740
Scott: And Volt's Five wins every week somehow, unless it's a two-parter or something.

561
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:55,840
Scott: And then that's the show.

562
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,914
Scott: I don't know what happens at the end because I'm only 17 episodes in.

563
00:42:59,105 --> 00:42:59,719
Scott: I'm seven.

564
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:05,640
Rym: And I guess what I, I don't think we want to explain the plot and the characters to you.

565
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,799
Scott: I explained the plot just now.

566
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,800
Rym: But there's like the nuances, like each character has their deal.

567
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:17,840
Rym: Like the jerky guy on the team is an American cowboy who uses a whip.

568
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,080
Rym: And he's a jerk, but then he becomes less of a jerk.

569
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,680
Scott: I don't know if he's Japanese and he spent time in the US or if he's actually American.

570
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,380
Rym: Wasn't super clear, actually.

571
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,489
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

572
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:29,973
Scott: It doesn't matter.

573
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,540
Rym: Well, his mom blew herself up to kill those wolves.

574
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,777
Scott: That's true.

575
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,300
Rym: But the impressions I had were that, one, I want to get back to this after we talk about more impressions.

576
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:50,920
Rym: The meta plot is shockingly more complex than it possibly even, like, they did not need to have that much backstory in the show.

577
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,619
Rym: Or that much consistency.

578
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:59,760
Rym: Like early parts of the show, because I do know some things that happened toward the end of the show, just from knowledge of the show.

579
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,620
Rym: The meta plot is way more complex than you'd realize.

580
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,360
Rym: And every episode reveals little bits of it.

581
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,919
Rym: Like early on, like these beast nights come down.

582
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:20,960
Rym: But then you learn, I want to say in like episode three or four, that the evil aliens put brains of people, of their own people, into these things.

583
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:25,770
Rym: And that is not a piece of information to forget.

584
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,859
Rym: That actually seems to matter a lot as the plot goes on.

585
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Scott: Yeah, so I think that's the two significant things about this show that make it stand out from your typical fight monsters every week.

586
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,980
Scott: Because I actually think in a lot of ways this show is, despite being older and having a crappier toy...

587
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,140
Rym: Oh, it's better than later Monster of the Week shows.

588
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,780
Scott: Yeah, is more advanced even than Go Lion and other shows.

589
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:55,820
Scott: And for these reasons, number one, you know, Voltron takes place in like this future, you know, like empty planet basically.

590
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,468
Scott: This bad guy's attacking.

591
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:59,560
Scott: It's literally just Monster of the Week.

592
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,140
Rym: It's a lot like Thundercats, or even Eman to a degree.

593
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:07,539
Scott: Thundercats has more of a plot that goes on, right?

594
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,460
Rym: Yeah, but very little of that is revealed episode by episode.

595
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:14,420
Scott: I remember you didn't see the beginning of Thundercats.

596
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:18,375
Rym: After the beginning, a lot of the later shows were refined.

597
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,560
Rym: They'd have the beginning episodes.

598
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,940
Scott: Thundercats has the pattern of plot episodes and non-plot episodes, right?

599
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,034
Rym: Voltron has almost no plot episodes.

600
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,100
Scott: Voltron has almost no plot episodes.

601
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,158
Scott: In Volt is Five, every episode I've seen is a plot episode.

602
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,080
Scott: There is not just a Monster of the Week, but something significant happens in every episode.

603
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,240
Scott: Sometimes the significant thing is simply character development, but it's not little character development.

604
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,600
Scott: It'll be like big development for one character, right?

605
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:55,900
Scott: In some episodes, it will be like, okay, it was just Monster of the Week, but there was a significant danger.

606
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,632
Scott: Like they were not even, they were like getting really ruined.

607
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,479
Scott: Like the base got messed up.

608
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,080
Rym: Well like episode two, the base almost collapses.

609
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:10,580
Rym: Their mom, I guess spoilers, fucking gets into a fighter jet and kamikazes the beast to buy them time.

610
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,267
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

611
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:13,920
Scott: Some episodes, characters die.

612
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,396
Scott: And it's like, yeah, Voltron, there's like one guy who dies.

613
00:46:16,496 --> 00:46:16,960
Scott: Spoilers.

614
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,044
Scott: But then that's kind of it.

615
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:21,740
Scott: Here, someone died and someone else died.

616
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,000
Scott: It's like significant primary characters are getting the axe, right?

617
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,239
Scott: Like shit goes down in Volt's Five on a frequent basis.

618
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:36,340
Scott: And it's like, there is like stuff that like messes with you all the time.

619
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,860
Scott: Like, whoa, this show is really going hardcore.

620
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,727
Scott: There was one episode, right?

621
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,380
Scott: And is the second significant thing.

622
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,926
Scott: I'll tie it in here, right?

623
00:46:45,228 --> 00:46:53,760
Scott: Is that this show actually takes place on an earth, a theoretical future earth that looks a lot like not really that far future an earth.

624
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,700
Scott: But like the earth actually matters.

625
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,760
Scott: There was a whole episode that was political where like the UN equivalent gets together and they can't agree.

626
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,880
Scott: And then the diplomats all get endangered, right?

627
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,019
Scott: And Voltus has to come and save them.

628
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,473
Scott: And then they all agree to like actually ally against the aliens.

629
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:21,620
Rym: And in the beginning, it's like there's a lot of science fiction and environmental storytelling and like world building.

630
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,320
Rym: Like the global militaries are aligned differently from the current like real world.

631
00:47:26,664 --> 00:47:27,979
Rym: And they all try to fight these things.

632
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:31,245
Scott: It's like, is it deep?

633
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:35,640
Scott: No, but for a selling kids toys show, it's deep, right?

634
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,519
Scott: Well, it's deeper than you might realize.

635
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,792
Scott: It's like if you went to a kiddie pool, right?

636
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:42,900
Scott: And it's like, yes, this is a kiddie pool.

637
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:44,608
Scott: This is not the real pool.

638
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:45,693
Scott: It's not the deep end.

639
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:46,900
Scott: It's a kiddie pool.

640
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,311
Scott: But you get in and suddenly a kiddie pool usually is like what?

641
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,720
Scott: Not even a foot deep usually, right?

642
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:55,740
Scott: Imagine if the kiddie pool you stepped in and you were up to your waist.

643
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:56,985
Scott: Like that's surprising.

644
00:47:57,547 --> 00:48:00,620
Scott: Like, you know, you don't expect a kiddie pool to be that deep.

645
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,519
Rym: What I know about the actual show, because I had had the plot described to me before I watched it.

646
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,120
Rym: But what was described to me is like way later plot.

647
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:12,360
Rym: The home planet of these aliens matters a lot.

648
00:48:13,202 --> 00:48:14,049
Scott: Oh, yes, it does.

649
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:14,492
Scott: There is.

650
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:15,600
Scott: there is basically.

651
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,190
Rym: How did Dr.

652
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,520
Rym: Go know that they were coming?

653
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,640
Rym: That is like a whole fucking thing.

654
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:32,620
Scott: Three of the people in there in the robot, the three are basically sons of these two scientists, one of whom is that mom who mentioned doing kamikaze.

655
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,225
Scott: And the other one is Dr.

656
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:37,620
Scott: Go, who you never see in the show, at least not at the start.

657
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:41,640
Scott: And you know that he knew the aliens were coming.

658
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:46,680
Scott: And therefore he built volts five to defend the earth from the aliens he knew were coming.

659
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,760
Scott: And then he went off into space.

660
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:52,740
Scott: And you got to assume he went to meet the aliens out there in space.

661
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,506
Scott: And then stuff happens in episodes.

662
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:01,018
Scott: I saw recently that show that the aliens at least know Dr.

663
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:01,680
Scott: Go exists.

664
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:05,378
Scott: And nobody looks like and something is up.

665
00:49:05,498 --> 00:49:05,740
Scott: Right.

666
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,119
Scott: And it's like Voltron doesn't have anything like that.

667
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:09,065
Scott: I don't know.

668
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,420
Rym: And in a lot of ways, it's the biggest takeaway.

669
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:14,780
Rym: Watch that for even if you don't want to watch a stupid kid show like this.

670
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,000
Rym: Watch the first episode and then go rewatch the first episode of Evangelion.

671
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,878
Rym: They're honestly almost the same thing.

672
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Rym: Like the base they're defending is nerve to a T. Like the way they defended the dynamic of like all the people.

673
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,242
Scott: It's also.

674
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,835
Scott: I think the difference is the base is clearly a toy.

675
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:38,800
Scott: Nerve is not a toy.

676
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,184
Rym: I mean, yeah, but it's still like.

677
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:45,320
Rym: those scenes are very similar to the scenes when nerve headquarters is under attack.

678
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:46,862
Rym: The Dr.

679
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:52,439
Rym: Go big gendo vibes in terms of the militaries of the world all trying to fight this new menace and they can't.

680
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,000
Rym: And then they turn to that scientist who had a secret project going all along.

681
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,438
Rym: There are so many parallels.

682
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:06,659
Rym: Evangelion was 100% riffing on like the setup of this show and shows like it.

683
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,264
Scott: Yep.

684
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:13,620
Scott: The last thing I got to say about the show is that, you know, it is significantly hardcore.

685
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:20,880
Rym: When Voltus 5 kills a beast knight, like that is a brutal scene with that sword.

686
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:21,922
Scott: Right.

687
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:25,940
Scott: Voltus 5 takes out a sword just like to cut the bad guy as like it's finishing blow.

688
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:29,320
Scott: You know that when the sword comes out, like the bad guys get the beast knights going down.

689
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:37,300
Scott: Voltus 5, when he does the V attack with the sword, hits the beast knight in its shoulder or whatever its shoulder.

690
00:50:37,822 --> 00:50:41,220
Rym: We learned later these beast knights have sentient brains implanted into them.

691
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,282
Scott: Right.

692
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:45,140
Scott: These beast knights also come in, they're really fun and creative.

693
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
Scott: The lots of different shapes and sizes.

694
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,220
Scott: The episode I just watched, the beast knight was a flying triceratops.

695
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,138
Scott: Voltus eventually eclipses its wings and it becomes a regular triceratops.

696
00:50:57,062 --> 00:51:01,620
Scott: But there's like, they're always an interesting shape and size and they always like animate them.

697
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,640
Scott: Like there's the stock footage of the combinations, but the battles are not stock footage.

698
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,767
Scott: They're not great animation.

699
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:08,231
Scott: It's 1970s TV animation.

700
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,420
Scott: But they're like real fights.

701
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,700
Scott: But yeah, they're animating kind of in a pro wrestling kind of fashion.

702
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,101
Scott: Right.

703
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,200
Scott: You know, the pro wrestling vibe in the battles.

704
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:28,460
Scott: But yeah, Voltus will take its sword, hit the enemy in its shoulder equivalent, slice down at an angle to near its groin, navel area, twist the sword around.

705
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,940
Scott: And they show this to you like a visceral highlight.

706
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,420
Scott: They highlight the twisting of the sword like it's just a mat.

707
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:46,423
Scott: You imagine like a sword twisting in your guts like, oh, and then we'll pull the sword back up and out the other shoulder, making a V shaped cut because it's Voltus five Roman numeral V. Right.

708
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,540
Scott: And it's like the V, the sword V attack or whatever.

709
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,840
Scott: And then the enemy will explode like it just got fist of the North Star.

710
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,593
Scott: And this happens every episode.

711
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:55,420
Scott: It is brutal.

712
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:59,740
Scott: But not just that brutality, but like characters are getting shot.

713
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,440
Scott: They're like times where like, you know, that the enemies will be like stabbing.

714
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:09,360
Scott: And you'll see like the enemies, like stabs, like come into the cockpit and almost hit the pilots.

715
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,839
Rym: Or remember, there's the sword wielding demon knight that has that sword, the special magic sword.

716
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:19,740
Rym: And the one dude has to train to learn how to fight the sword.

717
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:21,171
Rym: And that training is him.

718
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:21,819
Rym: get it like that.

719
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:29,940
Rym: He, the amount of physical injury that is animated on him in that episode is very surprising.

720
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:35,119
Scott: Now the one, the one in Congress, there's a lot of incongruous things because it's a kid's show.

721
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:42,380
Scott: But the biggest one for me is that the start of the show, not a spoiler, the bad guys invade and they destroy the shit out of earth.

722
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,750
Scott: Like they wreck it.

723
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,960
Scott: It's like what is even left on earth, right?

724
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,620
Scott: And then in another episode, it's like the kid goes to a model boat sailing contest in Tokyo.

725
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:59,560
Scott: And it's like, you're having model boat sailing contest, Tokyo still exists?

726
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:01,099
Scott: I'm pretty sure it got destroyed.

727
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,039
Rym: Well, I mean, the kids were still going to school in Evangelion for some reason.

728
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,680
Scott: Maybe, but they were going like the nerve school in the protected area, right?

729
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,900
Scott: Not in the city, you know, not in Tokyo.

730
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:15,960
Scott: Anyway, but then, uh, fricking Tokyo gets destroyed, right?

731
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,440
Scott: And it's like, okay, well now Tokyo is destroyed.

732
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,980
Scott: It's like, no, then it's back to normal.

733
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,460
Scott: They don't seem to like keep like that world is destroyed thing.

734
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:27,060
Scott: The way that like space battleship Yamato is like, yeah, the world is destroyed.

735
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:33,300
Rym: Part of the way that seems to fit in is that they, the aliens show up and are fucking up earth and ready to rock.

736
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:37,280
Rym: But then when Volt is five, the Evangelion appears, they back off.

737
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,160
Rym: They're like, oh shit, there's, there's a danger and actually dangerous thing here.

738
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:42,779
Rym: We can't just take over.

739
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:48,940
Rym: And they sort of like retreat to their sanctum to deal with that threat before they resume the invasion.

740
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,478
Scott: Right now, the final thing that really makes me like the show quite a bit is that, you know, when you watch a kid's show, right?

741
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:59,900
Scott: It's like, why don't the bad guys just do this?

742
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,680
Scott: Why don't the bad guys just do that?

743
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:09,880
Rym: It's like, I was watching an episode and I thought, wow, the way the show is structured, if they just sent two beast knights at one time, like they're fucked.

744
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,288
Rym: It's over.

745
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:10,739
Rym: Game over.

746
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,100
Rym: That's, this is a kid's show.

747
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,900
Rym: They should just send two beast knights, literally the next episode.

748
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,839
Rym: They send two beast knights and they almost win because of that.

749
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:18,980
Scott: Exactly.

750
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,718
Scott: That's what it's like.

751
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,700
Scott: The bad guys in this show are not fools, right?

752
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,120
Rym: They are actually not Skeletor fucking up over and over and over again.

753
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,799
Rym: Imagine if Skeletor was like, well, that didn't work.

754
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,739
Rym: Let's try a different plan.

755
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,280
Scott: They're not failing from incompetence, right?

756
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:43,020
Scott: They're failing, you know, due to simply, you know, volt is five and the Falcon team Falcons, the base, right?

757
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:53,460
Scott: Like going all out and using, you know, the ingenuity and strength and whatever of humanity, um, to like come through the impossible odds.

758
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:53,800
Rym: Right.

759
00:54:54,381 --> 00:54:55,840
Scott: The bad guys are not fools.

760
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,660
Scott: Like they're constantly, they're like, what if we could just stop voltage five from combining?

761
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,520
Scott: It would be five separate shitty vehicles.

762
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:02,598
Scott: They do it.

763
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:02,889
Rym: Yup.

764
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:03,400
Scott: Right.

765
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,897
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

766
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,140
Rym: The kid's off on his own.

767
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,017
Rym: They, they send a beast knight literally just to murder the kid.

768
00:55:08,923 --> 00:55:09,999
Scott: Like, they're like, Ooh, what?

769
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,080
Scott: They're like, Oh, why did that one vehicle leave the base to go on its own?

770
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,476
Scott: Let's go get it.

771
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:15,780
Scott: It's separated.

772
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:16,658
Scott: Let's go, go, go.

773
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:17,000
Scott: Right.

774
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,000
Scott: The, the bad guys are not fools.

775
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:20,640
Scott: They go all out.

776
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:29,960
Scott: They do not hold back in trying to destroy volt as five, you know, and volt is five, you know, comes really close to losing compared to other big robots I've seen.

777
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:33,779
Scott: And it only wins by like the skin of its teeth.

778
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:38,540
Rym: Uh, obviously like in one episode, like actually breaks through that shield.

779
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:48,799
Rym: You know, that scene in Ava near the very end where an angel busts into the room and it's like, like Misato's looking up at it and they, everyone just freezes and it's, it's about to do its thing.

780
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,140
Rym: One of the beasts kind of does the same thing to the base and they barely survive.

781
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:56,080
Rym: And it's, it's, it's a pretty good scene.

782
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:59,999
Rym: They animate that beast, like beating the shit out of the base too.

783
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:07,200
Scott: So, uh, and like the base like got messed up, like they had to, they couldn't get out from one scene I watched recently.

784
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:07,897
Scott: You didn't see this.

785
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:13,459
Scott: The, they couldn't open the gates to get the, you know, to fly the voltage vehicles out of the, I saw that one.

786
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,379
Rym: I think that happens in an episode I saw.

787
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:16,740
Scott: Oh, okay.

788
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,459
Rym: And then they're like, shoot missiles at it and they blow up the gate.

789
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:20,240
Scott: Exactly.

790
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,659
Scott: They shot, they just blew up the front of the base and flew out.

791
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:28,039
Scott: And then later, uh, the front of the base is like still blown up.

792
00:56:29,241 --> 00:56:33,280
Rym: Or also like one episode I was thinking, why do they even have all these defenses?

793
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:35,780
Rym: They just animate these defenses of getting destroyed by the beast.

794
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,079
Rym: Every episode, the next episode, they had a stronger missile that actually like gave the beast pause.

795
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:42,399
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,507
Scott: And they have like the tops.

797
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:45,540
Scott: at first, the tops kind of are garbage.

798
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,000
Scott: I'm like, well, I just pull out the sword right away.

799
00:56:47,401 --> 00:56:49,539
Scott: Sometimes they do just pull out the sword right away.

800
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:51,919
Scott: Sometimes they do just combine right away.

801
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,629
Scott: Sometimes sometimes they don't even need to combine.

802
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:55,372
Scott: the other items work.

803
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,740
Rym: They spin a different thing, not the top.

804
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,319
Rym: They spin like some projectile that the beast shot at them.

805
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,220
Scott: Right.

806
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:08,140
Scott: It's like, they're getting creative and not just doing the same stuff every time in the battle portions.

807
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:13,280
Scott: Um, cause usually, you know, this kind of show, you just want to see the other parts and fast forward the battle.

808
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,259
Scott: Cause the battle is the same boring thing every time.

809
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,759
Scott: Um, so yeah, volt is five has a lot going on.

810
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:25,798
Scott: I think, you know, I'm not going to say I recommend it cause it is a kid's show to sell you a toy.

811
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,900
Rym: I would watch this before I would watch go lion.

812
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:30,019
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,020
Scott: I mean, this is a show so far from what I seen.

814
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:37,940
Scott: If you're gonna watch a show to sell kids toys, why not this one?

815
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:38,518
Scott: Right.

816
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,739
Scott: And you're not going to watch such a show.

817
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:42,338
Scott: Don't watch any of them.

818
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:53,680
Rym: But if you're an anime fan at all, like if you actually like think about and care about anime specifically, watch one episode of this and watch the first episode of Evangelion again and do a compare and contrast.

819
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,817
Rym: Like, trust me.

820
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:55,939
Scott: Or watch it.

821
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,260
Scott: Watch it.

822
00:57:56,421 --> 00:57:58,292
Scott: Go one episode of go lion also random one.

823
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,018
Scott: Cause there are a lot of them are more similar to each other.

824
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:05,680
Rym: But this show, like if you skip, like I thought like I watched seven episodes.

825
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,480
Rym: I was like, I should skip ahead and watch like a random episode from like a few later.

826
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:10,439
Rym: so I could like have more to talk about on the show.

827
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:13,740
Rym: I skipped a few episodes ahead and I have no fucking idea what's going on anymore.

828
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:14,850
Scott: Yeah.

829
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,920
Scott: Like I said, the status, there is no like solid status quo.

830
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,378
Scott: It's like they keep changing it.

831
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,740
Scott: And that, you know, under normal, more normal circumstances of this kind of show wouldn't have kept watching.

832
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,180
Scott: But, uh, this one I did.

833
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:33,160
Rym: So the fact that we both kept watching and didn't just watch the minimum four and then do this show is telling.

834
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:33,600
Scott: Right.

835
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:33,793
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:34,920
Scott: So it's on crunchy roll.

837
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:36,317
Scott: Uh, you can just go watch it.

838
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,360
Scott: Um, and that's that volt is volts five.

839
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,616
Scott: However you want to pronounce it.

840
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,599
Scott: Um, Chodenji machine volts five.

841
00:58:49,653 --> 00:58:51,790
