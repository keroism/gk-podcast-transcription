1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,584
Rym: It's Thursday, May 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:10,066
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:15,360
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,726
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,100
Rym: Tonight we're talking about learning languages.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,217
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:22,900
Rym: Oh shit, do you have an opening bid?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,692
Rym: Uh... I guess I did.

9
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:27,580
Rym: I got one.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,944
Scott: One second.

11
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:28,838
Scott: Let me remember it.

12
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,540
Rym: I had it.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,651
Rym: Right, you said you had one.

14
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:32,398
Rym: You said it.

15
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,199
Rym: Why was it?

16
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,840
Rym: If you forgot it, I can start with something.

17
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:39,559
Rym: I feel like I should leave this in the show this time.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,580
Rym: This fumbling.

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,499
Scott: What the fuck was the opening bid?

20
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:44,880
Rym: Can I talk about my Rym light in more detail?

21
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:46,478
Rym: No.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,379
Rym: I could set the Rym light to make it look like there's just a fireworks show going on behind me.

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,700
Rym: You got nothing?

24
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,059
Scott: I forget my opening bid.

25
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,780
Rym: That feels very, like, near the end of COVID lockdown feels.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,940
Scott: Oh, I thought of a different opening bid.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Rym: Alright, I'm just assuming that's the first one that you originally thought of.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,565
Scott: It's not.

29
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,880
Scott: It's definitely a different one.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,747
Rym: Alright, go for it.

31
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:11,558
Rym: I stuck a marker in.

32
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:12,758
Scott: Alright.

33
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:17,839
Rym: Did you forget this one too?

34
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:18,801
Scott: No.

35
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,520
Scott: I'm just figuring out how to start it off contextually.

36
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,710
Scott: So way back in the day...

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,405
Rym: Wait, which day?

38
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:26,251
Rym: There were a lot of days.

39
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,360
Rym: There were the college days.

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,080
Scott: It's actually a long time ago, but it feels like less of a long time ago, but it's actually quite long ago.

41
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,520
Scott: There was a store in Manhattan called Broadway Panhandler.

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,440
Scott: It was a store where you would buy kitchen stuff, right?

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,660
Scott: Panhandler, get it, lol?

44
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:49,820
Scott: And, you know, the chef's knife that I have in my kitchen, I bought at that store.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,788
Scott: That's how long I've had it.

46
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,120
Scott: I was living in Beacon at the time.

47
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:55,400
Scott: I just went down there, like, after work to buy, you know, kitchen stuff.

48
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:57,838
Scott: That store has been closed a long time.

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,699
Scott: But I would also go there to get my knife sharpened, you know?

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,578
Rym: Yeah, like you do.

51
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,560
Scott: There were knife experts there, and it cost, like, a few bucks.

52
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,339
Rym: It cost a few bucks, and it's not hard to sharpen a knife, but it takes an amount of time, and it costs so little to just get someone else to do it.

53
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,508
Scott: Sure.

54
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:22,340
Scott: The last time I needed my knife sharpened... You know, basically, it's one of those things, like, I don't get it done as often as I should, especially in the COVID times, right?

55
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:30,260
Scott: It was already needed to be sharpened, and then, you know... I brought one to the place that's right near Rym, the Saito Trading Company.

56
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,024
Rym: Oh, yeah!

57
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:35,540
Rym: We're actually, we're planning to head down there and get a bunch of our knives sharpened, and also, there's a new knife we want.

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,780
Scott: No, they did okay, you know, but it wasn't like, oh my god, the knife is, like, slicing paper, like, magically, right?

59
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,959
Scott: So, I've always wanted to be able to sharpen a knife, you know, with the whetstone, like they do on YouTube, and, you know, they're, like, it becomes ridiculously sharp.

60
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:57,759
Scott: But also, you know, it's like I'm so worried, like, oh, it takes such skill, it's like you're gonna, you know, mess up the knife or whatever.

61
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:02,060
Scott: But, yeah, I just was, like, you know what, I'll just do it, right?

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:13,700
Scott: I'll buy the, I'm watching YouTube videos, I bought the cheapest, well, not the cheapest, but, you know, a relatively inexpensive, highly rated one, you know, little whetstone set.

63
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,419
Scott: I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, the instructions that came with the set even said to watch YouTube videos.

64
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:20,640
Rym: That's the future!

65
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:31,320
Scott: You know, and, you know, it turned out okay, knives are sharper, you know, but they're not, like, you know, ridiculously sharp like they are in the videos.

66
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:37,280
Scott: So, I guess I have to practice more, but, you know, I'll try it again in some months from now, right?

67
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,192
Scott: But I guess, do I recommend it?

68
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,540
Scott: Eh, maybe.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,220
Rym: I mean, it's one of those things, like, when we shifted from using cartridge razors to safety razors, Well, that's a different situation entirely.

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,620
Rym: Because shaving with those was both easier and it saved me, like, I stopped counting after it had saved me several thousand dollars.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,140
Scott: It's not, it's not only, it saves you a lot of money and it's better.

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Scott: This is not saving you that much money.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
Rym: And not better unless you get good at it.

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,018
Scott: It's only better if you get really good at it.

75
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:19,476
Rym: It's funny because we were literally having the same conversation, but because they're downstairs from us, the barrier to just, like, walking over there with a knife and being like, "Here's a $1.50, please sharpen

76
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:19,677
Rym: this.".

77
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,119
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

78
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,419
Rym: Like, I could just walk, I could walk down there in the middle of cooking if I needed to.

79
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,638
Scott: I wouldn't do that.

80
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,439
Rym: If I was desperate, my knife was just a, I don't know, just a steak.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:44,180
Scott: But yeah, you know, I think if you don't care about your knife, like, losing more material, you know, because I, you know, the whetstone sharpening, you're getting it A, sharper, and B, you're losing less knife material.

82
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:59,400
Scott: But if you just use, like, the electric sharpeners or those other various kinds of sharpening devices that aren't whetstones, like, they'll still make your knife sharp, you'll just lose more material, and they won't be as sharp as, like, the perfect whetstone sharpening.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,939
Scott: But who, does that matter to you?

84
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,880
Rym: Yeah, the thing I definitely always want to be able to do is hone correctly, because that'll at least keep a knife, like, working pretty well.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,220
Scott: If you hone every time you use it.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Scott: But honing is completely unrelated.

87
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,167
Rym: Exactly, but you gotta do both.

88
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,998
Rym: You gotta sharpen them occasionally, and you also gotta hone them.

89
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:15,940
Scott: Sometimes you don't need to hone.

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,799
Rym: True, like, don't hone a serrated knife.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,640
Scott: Well, yeah, but usually it's the knives with softer steel need honing because the tip will, you know, bend around, right?

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:36,460
Scott: But if a knife is made with really hard steel, and you don't need to hone it because the burr isn't, like, moving, it's so hard, it's not going anywhere.

93
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,660
Rym: This, uh, weirdly gave me a specifically and strong memory.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Rym: When I was in high school, me and Ken had to make a video about, uh, like, Macbeth.

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,314
Rym: And, uh, we're gonna make this video.

96
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,280
Rym: It's part of a class project.

97
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:58,360
Rym: We needed swords to fight with, and we were, you know, we're both nerds who have real swords, and of course we're not gonna use our real swords, because they're, you know, they're "real" swords.

98
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,992
Rym: And also, we'll just die.

99
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:00,980
Rym: Like, that'll be a problem.

100
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,260
Rym: So, we're not gonna choreograph something good.

101
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Rym: So, we went to a Home Depot, and we bought two bars of, like, cheap, mild steel, and just put hafts on 'em, and used those.

102
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,566
Rym: Just, like, imagine a sword.

103
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,780
Rym: that was not, it was just a piece of metal that was flat on all sides.

104
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:18,700
Scott: Okay.

105
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,063
Rym: That's the extent of that.

106
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:30,677
Rym: I had that weird, long piece of metal with a hilt on it for some reason for years, and every now and then, I'd find it again, or someone would find it again and be like, "What the fuck is

107
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:30,918
Rym: this?".

108
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:33,790
Rym: That's the extent of my anecdote.

109
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,220
Rym: So, let's get into the news.

110
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,225
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff going on.

111
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:43,185
Rym: Obviously, some things we're gonna save for, like, a Monday or a Tuesday episode of GeekNights, but I do want to talk about this one.

112
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:48,440
Rym: There's a situation going on with the COVID vaccines that you might have seen some talk about, but didn't really understand.

113
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,400
Rym: Basically, the vaccines were made by private companies, even though that's a problem, so they have patents on these vaccines.

114
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:02,100
Rym: So, no one else can make these vaccines without licensing that.

115
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,720
Scott: Or getting sued.

116
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,380
Scott: Or being in a country where that law can't touch them and just do it anyway.

117
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,230
Rym: And a huge percentage of the world does not have ready access to the vaccine.

118
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,080
Rym: Even countries like Germany and Europe don't have, like, full access yet.

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,682
Rym: The U.S.

120
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:22,400
Rym: is, for other reasons we've talked about, way ahead on deploying.

121
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:23,883
Scott: They can't make their own.

122
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:31,080
Scott: Private companies in those countries, if they make their own, might get sued for violating the intellectual property rights.

123
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,886
Scott: So, they just have to buy some from us.

124
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:39,013
Scott: The same way that so many countries just buy weapons from us.

125
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,136
Scott: They're not making missiles.

126
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,360
Scott: They buy our missiles and we sell them to them.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Rym: So, it was a moderately big deal in that it was good, but I also want to make it clear that it's not nearly good enough.

128
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,944
Rym: But it was good that the U.S.

129
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:57,139
Rym: actually said, "We supported waiving the intellectual property rights at least until COVID is under

130
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,440
Rym: control.".

131
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Scott: Like, little baby steps.

132
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,274
Scott: By whose definition of "under control," right?

133
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:01,879
Scott: But that's another...

134
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,820
Rym: Yeah, but probably this would be a multi-year thing, like the way it was looking.

135
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,092
Scott: It would still be good.

136
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,600
Rym: The stock on the vaccine companies plummeted on that news.

137
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,912
Scott: Well, okay, so it depends, right?

138
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,738
Scott: A, yes, it did go down, right?

139
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,739
Rym: Yeah, I was going to talk about how then it went back up.

140
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,623
Scott: Well, it's not even that it went back up.

141
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,205
Scott: It's like, yeah, it went down.

142
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:36,480
Scott: But if you zoom out on the graph to Pfizer over past five years, ten years, the amount it went down was basically insignificant.

143
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:45,060
Scott: It did cause it to go down, but the amount it went down, not really making the Pfizer shareholders worry.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,131
Rym: But there were drops of like 12-13% for some of these companies.

145
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:02,920
Rym: So, those stocks rebounded significantly after what happened now, where Germany has come out saying they do not support waiving these intellectual property rights.

146
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,559
Scott: I guess Germany just hates themselves?

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:14,420
Rym: Angela Merkel weighed in saying basically that it would create "severe complications" for the production of vaccines, which, that's ridiculous.

148
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,720
Rym: The complication causing us to not have vaccines is that these companies are private in the first place.

149
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,406
Rym: Capitalism should have nothing to do with basic medical technology.

150
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:32,020
Rym: The fact that governments aren't funding this solely for the benefit of humanity is egregious and is arguably just straight up violence.

151
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:39,860
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I've been saying the same thing for a while since I learned it from someone else, which is that, like, do you believe in democracy?

152
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,586
Scott: If you don't, well then, don't worry about this conversation, right?

153
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:48,260
Scott: But if you believe in democracy that people collectively should decide how our society operates, right?

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,300
Scott: Then whatever mechanism you have for your democracy, A, should be actually democratic, not like what most countries have.

155
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,119
Scott: Ours especially.

156
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,899
Rym: Ours especially right now.

157
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,583
Scott: Yes, especially.

158
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:09,080
Scott: But B, that that democratically elected institution, whatever form it takes, must be the most powerful organization there is.

159
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:22,900
Scott: There's no other organization of any form or shape or size in the society must be able to challenge the power of the democratically elected organization because otherwise you don't have democracy anymore, right?

160
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:32,880
Scott: It's like we elected this government, even if you had the best elections that were so fairly and properly conducted, you elect this government that accurately represents the will of the people.

161
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:52,660
Scott: If there's some private company that, like, not even necessarily is in total more powerful than the whole government, but has any sort of leverage against the government whatsoever, then that means that the will of the people is at least partially overrun or at odds with some other non-democratic power.

162
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:53,378
Rym: Case in point.

163
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,080
Scott: That means you don't have democracy.

164
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:13,620
Scott: So therefore, any organization, including, say, a farmer's school company in this case, that has enough power to sort of, you know, change or move the government and, you know, compete with the will of the people cannot be allowed to exist if you believe in democracy.

165
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:22,060
Rym: There is an incident that happened in the United States where literally a rich dude bailed out the US federal government.

166
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,019
Scott: Like, that happened once.

167
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,527
Scott: That also includes an individual person.

168
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:32,300
Scott: If an individual person is so powerful that they can, you know, affect the government.

169
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,603
Rym: Well, it's like in Blades in the Dark.

170
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,345
Rym: There are factions.

171
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:39,460
Rym: Like, there's a faction, like the Bluecoats or the Grinders that all have their different deals and they have different tiers.

172
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,439
Rym: There's one faction that's just one fucking dude.

173
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:43,721
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:48,872
Scott: And there's also things like it doesn't even have to be private organizations, right?

175
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,117
Scott: The NYPD is strong enough.

176
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,340
Scott: It's a public organization.

177
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:52,798
Scott: Yeah.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,625
Scott: But it is strong enough to basically oppose.

179
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,729
Scott: It's not democratically elected directly.

180
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:04,000
Scott: You know, they're like employees, yet they're powerful enough to influence the mayor more than the voters are.

181
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,680
Rym: Can you imagine how radically different in a positive way New York City would be if we elected the cops?

182
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:11,937
Scott: Sure.

183
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,305
Rym: And took away their guns, of course.

184
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,458
Rym: But if they were elected by the people of their boroughs.

185
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,540
Scott: Yes.

186
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:27,800
Scott: If you believe in democracy, there cannot be any organization of any kind that is more powerful in any way than the democratically elected organization.

187
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:29,458
Scott: The end.

188
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:40,657
Rym: So in some other news, YouTube's TikTok clone shorts, it's actually been around for a while, but it wasn't really available in the US, is out.

189
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:41,298
Rym: You can do it.

190
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,260
Rym: Scott made one already.

191
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,320
Scott: Yeah.

192
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,563
Scott: So there was YouTube short.

193
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:45,965
Scott: Basically, you know, it's like TikTok.

194
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,328
Scott: I'm actually kind of like.

195
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,772
Scott: the thing with TikTok is the app itself.

196
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:54,020
Scott: I'm not liking the user interface or anything and I don't like the owners of it.

197
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Rym: I don't like the sense, the nature of the censorship on that platform.

198
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,903
Scott: Exactly.

199
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:02,180
Scott: However, and I won't install it on any of my devices.

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,219
Rym: Oh, I would not install TikTok on my phone.

201
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:05,849
Scott: But I will visit the website.

202
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,600
Scott: The website is, you know, I can just visit the website.

203
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:12,100
Rym: Usually I watch TikToks that people have exported and put up on YouTube, to be honest.

204
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,547
Scott: That is also the most of what I do as well.

205
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,740
Scott: But I have visited the website a couple of times or seen embeds and such.

206
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:26,120
Scott: But I do greatly enjoy the content on TikTok, the community of people who are making content there and the things they are making.

207
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,320
Scott: There's really good stuff going on there.

208
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,226
Rym: Well, just like Vine.

209
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,374
Rym: Vine was like...

210
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,392
Scott: TikTok is like Vine plus plus.

211
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,000
Scott: It's like another level.

212
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,107
Rym: Vine was such a creative explosion and a sea change.

213
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:47,280
Rym: And also Vine was a place where black creators in particular really exploded and like made a movement of art.

214
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:48,904
Scott: Sure.

215
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:55,420
Scott: One of my favorite TikTok things I've seen actually is there's a guy who is a actual dermatologist.

216
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,151
Scott: And he does, he has a TikTok where he basically does all kinds of different things.

217
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,300
Scott: Like he'll watch people, you know, do skincare stuff.

218
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,547
Scott: And he'll be like, "Right.

219
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:05,030
Scott: Wrong.

220
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,573
Scott: Don't do that.

221
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:05,634
Rym: Do

222
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:06,177
Rym: this.".

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:16,740
Scott: And then he also will like, he'll do reactions to like people popping giant zits or scraping gross stuff off their face, which is always weird.

224
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,108
Scott: I know we have some friends that enjoy that stuff a lot.

225
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,858
Scott: For me, I sort of mix enjoy it.

226
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,399
Scott: A part of me...

227
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,403
Rym: I got the same feeling.

228
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:28,340
Rym: It's like on one hand, I'm fascinated and I like to see strange, even terrifying things.

229
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,840
Rym: But on the other hand, enjoy is not a word I would use to describe that feeling.

230
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,521
Scott: Exactly.

231
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:34,827
Scott: It's like eating a food.

232
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:35,873
Scott: It's like sweet and sour.

233
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,340
Scott: Well, I guess sweet and sour just tastes good.

234
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,440
Rym: Well, you know, it's like when I got my vaccine, I had the side effects for a day.

235
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,295
Rym: Like I wouldn't say I enjoyed it, but I appreciated how unique that experience was.

236
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,380
Scott: Appreciate, but do not necessarily enjoy.

237
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:57,019
Scott: I'm simultaneously feeling satisfaction, like the same satisfaction you get when you watch a power washing video while also feeling like gross.

238
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,170
Scott: Like I just saw some gross.

239
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,640
Scott: And it's like they mix that together at the same time.

240
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,980
Rym: But part of it is I've definitely I've seen enough terrifying, gross, frightening things.

241
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,745
Scott: You don't need to watch any well in real life to where.

242
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:18,260
Rym: if it's not present in the room with me, it's very hard to push me over the line anyway.

243
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,987
Scott: But yeah, I enjoy TikTok content.

244
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,998
Scott: So I was excited at the prospect of YouTube shorts because I'm OK.

245
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,392
Scott: I'm more OK with YouTube than TikTok as a thing.

246
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,160
Rym: That more there is a load bearing word.

247
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,122
Rym: I'm glad you stuck that in.

248
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,787
Scott: It's a very low bearing more.

249
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:35,900
Scott: And so YouTube shorts is basically just TikTok, except it makes a YouTube video when you're done.

250
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,233
Scott: It's been out in India for a while.

251
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,360
Scott: It's I think it's big there.

252
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,726
Rym: Well, it's big there because TikTok is banned there.

253
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:43,109
Scott: Oh, interesting.

254
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,260
Scott: And then they were they brought it in like in beta to the US a little bit.

255
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,143
Scott: But now it's.

256
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,206
Scott: now it's everyone.

257
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,210
Scott: It's still beta.

258
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,120
Scott: But for everyone, I think you can now just make YouTube shorts.

259
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:00,480
Scott: So in terms of watching, I still think TikTok has the ones to watch, but I'm not going to make TikTok because I'm not going to install the app.

260
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,349
Scott: So I made a YouTube short.

261
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,158
Scott: Let's see if I can come up with any more.

262
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:04,540
Rym: Yeah.

263
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:09,539
Rym: Young Rym, like I said in the forum, would have said on this show, I'm going to make one a week no matter how bad it is.

264
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,440
Rym: Aged Wiser Rym is just going to say you might see me make a TikTok short at some point.

265
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,555
Scott: Yeah, it's like I got to think of something that fits in 15 seconds.

266
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:18,299
Scott: It's like it's not easy.

267
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,860
Rym: Oh, so I actually went back because I knew TikTok was banned in India, but I didn't know the full story.

268
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,788
Rym: It's because of that border clash between India and China.

269
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,840
Rym: India banned a whole swath of basically any apps that were owned by certain Chinese companies.

270
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:33,009
Scott: OK.

271
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,359
Rym: That's what's going on there.

272
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,300
Scott: And Google stepped in and beat Facebook to the race there to grab the dropped baton or whatever.

273
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:52,840
Rym: I feel like if you're going to make YouTube shorts, like if the short videos are going to explode in a big way, like beyond what's happened with TikTok, focus on a niche that is underserved.

274
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,320
Rym: I want to see indie RPG shorts.

275
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,066
Scott: I do think that that is the.

276
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:03,480
Scott: if you look at the people on TikTok who are successful is they find a niche and stick to it.

277
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,400
Scott: And that's how they're able to make so much content is doing the same thing over and over.

278
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,540
Scott: If you try to do variety, it's like like us, you run out of ideas.

279
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:16,319
Scott: You need one idea that's popular and just keep doing it like the less sausage YouTube channel.

280
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:17,025
Scott: Yeah.

281
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,339
Scott: Hydraulic press YouTube channel.

282
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:18,923
Scott: What can I?

283
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,579
Rym: what can what do I do so frequently?

284
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,988
Scott: Lawyer doesn't need new ideas.

285
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,954
Scott: He just needs new locks.

286
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:23,519
Scott: Right.

287
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:24,762
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:29,140
Rym: I guess the best I could do is I could try to do something with my me failing at Overwatch.

289
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,209
Rym: I'll figure something out.

290
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:31,040
Rym: I'll make something.

291
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,222
Scott: Exactly.

292
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:38,500
Rym: Anyway, in some other news, Twitter actually has done a couple of things recently.

293
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,233
Rym: They added a tip jar, which is there's.

294
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,700
Rym: there's some stuff going on with that.

295
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,386
Rym: We'll see how it plays.

296
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:45,820
Scott: I mean, adding a tip jar on Twitter.

297
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,480
Scott: It's like people are talking about it, but it's like you can already just put your coffee link, you know, coffee link or your your Patreon link in your profile.

298
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,764
Scott: It's like what's what's now.

299
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:58,340
Scott: it's like some people can get this tip jar like officially lit up in the Twitter interface.

300
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,223
Scott: It's not very different.

301
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:04,060
Rym: Pretty sure they're doing it this way because it's a trial balloon for even more features related to this down the road.

302
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,520
Scott: Some people like their cash app IDs up there.

303
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,840
Rym: Remember, Twitter was talking about having the option to have some of your tweets or an alternate channel that are subscriber only that cost them money.

304
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,480
Rym: Like you have to pay to subscribe.

305
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,444
Scott: That'd be OK.

306
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,860
Scott: You know, you have a Patreon integration.

307
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,857
Rym: I'd be 100 percent OK with that, because Twitter's biggest problem.

308
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,499
Scott: You're going to see more tweets from me than other people see.

309
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,520
Rym: Because Twitter's biggest problem is that it doesn't charge the users or the creators.

310
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,520
Rym: It makes money with ads and bullshit.

311
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,300
Rym: Come up with a better monetization model.

312
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,780
Rym: I'm always in favor of models that involve having the people pay for the thing they use.

313
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,858
Scott: Yeah, I am.

314
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,400
Scott: But I read a thing today written by a guy who works for Google on ads and he's like, why I'm OK working on ads.

315
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,418
Scott: And obviously I disagreed with most of it.

316
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:56,400
Scott: But the one thing he said is like, look, you know, if you don't have ads, then a lot of this content is like has no way to pay for it.

317
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,258
Scott: And it won't exist.

318
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,780
Scott: And would you rather have, you know, look at how much of a problem it is that, you know, the real news is behind a paywall and no one sees it.

319
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,339
Scott: And the fake news is just out there.

320
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:09,395
Rym: But the problem there is not ads and no ads.

321
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:10,520
Rym: The problem there is capitalism.

322
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,360
Rym: You can't make money doing anything.

323
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:13,342
Scott: Right.

324
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,220
Scott: If you didn't have the ads, the fake news wouldn't be there at all, which is, I think, good.

325
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,999
Scott: But also no one would get the real news.

326
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:19,712
Rym: Right.

327
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:25,933
Rym: But also the ads to a degree are just shifting who you're stealing the money from?

328
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,420
Rym: because the advertisers are in many cases getting ripped off.

329
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,427
Rym: Anyway, we've talked about that a lot.

330
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,620
Rym: So this isn't like earth shattering news.

331
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,288
Rym: Twitter did something else that I always.

332
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,720
Rym: it amazed me why people were so mad about this for so long.

333
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,699
Rym: Maybe just because I follow a lot of artists who were like oddly persnickety about it.

334
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,080
Rym: Twitter had a cropping algorithm that would just crop images.

335
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,799
Rym: If you post an image, it'll crop it.

336
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,180
Rym: So it fits on your phone app, whatever you're looking at Twitter where you couldn't control the crop.

337
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,561
Rym: Yeah.

338
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,540
Rym: But if you click out an image, you see the whole image anyway.

339
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:56,739
Scott: Sure.

340
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
Rym: If I see an image on Twitter, I'm going to click.

341
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,780
Scott: The crop was sometimes unfortunate.

342
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,040
Rym: Well, so the problem with the crop algorithm was that it tried to be too clever.

343
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:08,780
Rym: It ended up doing some like very obviously racist things.

344
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:10,520
Scott: It also did that, yes.

345
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,139
Rym: And it did some unfortunate things.

346
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:16,880
Rym: They probably could have gotten away with just having it always crop the top half of the image and just let people deal.

347
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,979
Rym: That would probably work better.

348
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:19,315
Scott: I don't know.

349
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,679
Rym: But apparently they got rid of it.

350
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Rym: But also I'm seeing a lot of people freaking out that they still see the cropping.

351
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,799
Rym: And I think a lot of people...

352
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
Scott: They only got rid of it on the mobile app.

353
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:39,920
Scott: If you're using desktop app or tweet deck or something else, you're not going to see, you're going to still get in whatever cropping you've got based on whatever app you're using.

354
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,440
Scott: Because, you know, I'm pretty sure the cropping is happening locally.

355
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:47,359
Scott: And this is a great time to say if Twitter is, you know, an OK place to be.

356
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,046
Scott: I'm on Twitter.

357
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:48,838
Scott: I use Twitter a lot.

358
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,840
Scott: Do not use the default Twitter website.

359
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,939
Scott: Do not use the default Twitter app.

360
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,279
Scott: Just uninstall that shit.

361
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,760
Scott: Go and get some third party Twitter app.

362
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Scott: I mean, tweet deck is owned by Twitter, but it might as well be a third party app, at least still for now.

363
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,387
Scott: Who knows?

364
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:03,959
Scott: It might change.

365
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:06,940
Scott: You know, on your iPhone, you can get Tweetbot.

366
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,900
Scott: It's a very, very cheap subscription.

367
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:11,940
Scott: It's like you're using Twitter that much.

368
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,591
Scott: It's like this is cheaper than anything.

369
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,660
Scott: It's so inexpensive.

370
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:24,200
Scott: And if you get it, you will see only tweets from people you follow in reverse chronological order and no ads and no bullshit.

371
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,800
Scott: And you can block and mute people.

372
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,113
Rym: Well, you're going to see bullshit.

373
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:27,640
Rym: It is Twitter.

374
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,159
Rym: I mean, sure, sure.

375
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,820
Scott: But the point is, do not use the official Twitter apps ever.

376
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,540
Scott: The website, the real app, do not use them.

377
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,180
Scott: They're garbage.

378
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:42,300
Scott: All the bad things you hate about Twitter, a lot of it is because you're using those apps.

379
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,156
Scott: Do not use them.

380
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:45,059
Scott: Use the third party.

381
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:51,600
Rym: In a minor news, I don't put a lot of stock in these things because they're a lot like the Academy Awards.

382
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,600
Rym: The Michelin stars are arbitrary.

383
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,640
Rym: They definitely have a European centric focus.

384
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,877
Rym: There's a lot of problems with them.

385
00:21:58,622 --> 00:22:04,360
Scott: If you don't know, my feeling on them was if a place has them, it's probably really tasty frickin food, probably.

386
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,219
Rym: But a place not having it does not mean it's not great food.

387
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,753
Scott: Not at all.

388
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:09,080
Scott: Right.

389
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,180
Scott: It's like but, you know, I'm not good.

390
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,741
Scott: I'd ever.

391
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:19,720
Scott: it was mostly a thing to like, you know, it ended up because it started as like, you know, literally a travel guide.

392
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,280
Scott: Like you're traveling somewhere.

393
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,760
Scott: There's no Google Maps, you know, will help you figure out which restaurants to go to.

394
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,220
Rym: Remember traveling when there is no way to know the deal of any restaurant in advance.

395
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,381
Scott: Right.

396
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:35,500
Scott: You know, like those placemats at the diner would tell you about all the places in town.

397
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:36,365
Rym: Yeah.

398
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:37,179
Rym: Hole to nowhere.

399
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:38,897
Rym: Yellow pages.

400
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,174
Scott: AAA would help you.

401
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:41,439
Scott: Right.

402
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,299
Scott: Travel agents, you know, they tell you what was going on in places.

403
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:46,540
Scott: And that's why it existed.

404
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,780
Scott: But it ended up becoming this thing where, you know, no one's using it as a travel guide anymore.

405
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:53,062
Scott: Right.

406
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:55,418
Scott: Instead, it became a target for restaurants to hit.

407
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,739
Scott: You know, the what's the what's the principle called?

408
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:03,040
Scott: Which I can think of a measure ceases to become a measure.

409
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:04,454
Scott: It becomes a right.

410
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:04,979
Rym: Yeah.

411
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,301
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:05,483
Rym: I don't.

413
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,620
Rym: I find whatever that is on the tip of my tongue.

414
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:08,685
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:09,860
Rym: But also that.

416
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:10,561
Rym: Yeah.

417
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:17,900
Rym: So a restaurant will try to cater itself to the taste of the people who judge this to try to get on the list instead of necessarily catering to.

418
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:22,300
Rym: I'm not saying what would be good, but what could be good, but does not cater to them.

419
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,872
Rym: The same thing happened with wine.

420
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:24,800
Rym: Wine over time.

421
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:34,740
Rym: High end wine has catered to the kinds of people who are rich enough to afford high end wine and write about high end wine, thus causing a feedback loop that caused high end wine to get more like that.

422
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,520
Scott: Superhero comics catered to the nerds who bought ten variant covers.

423
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,880
Rym: But there's a paragraph in this article that points out one of the biggest reasons why I'm not a big fan of the Michelin stars.

424
00:23:46,200 --> 00:24:01,619
Rym: Quote, "With the exception of Jeju Noodle Bar, no ramen or ramyun spot has earned a star in the city, nor is any barbecue spot, pizzeria, food truck, taco stand, modern Vietnamese fare, or scores of other culinary styles New York is famous

425
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:01,800
Rym: for.".

426
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,078
Scott: Note, zero taco places.

427
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:04,239
Scott: No.

428
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,881
Scott: Well, well, well.

429
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:12,740
Rym: With the exception of Casa Enrique, the city's starred Mexican restaurants are chic and expensive.

430
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,983
Rym: This is why I'm bringing this up.

431
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:21,420
Rym: Years and years and years ago when we lived here, a little tiny Mexican place opened up that was a spinoff of a French place, like same kitchen.

432
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:21,941
Rym: They were cool.

433
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:27,020
Rym: people called Casa Enrique, and it was just really good Mexican food, like really good Mexican food.

434
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,602
Rym: And it was cheap.

435
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:39,040
Rym: Like not cheap by like a real scale, but for New York scale, like for as good as this food was, it cost as much as like a normal restaurant in a normal non New York city place.

436
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,840
Scott: Normal night out prices.

437
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,282
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:45,020
Rym: So it got a Michelin star years ago.

439
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,859
Scott: Just one, not, not all three.

440
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,201
Rym: Yup.

441
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:50,520
Scott: And there's also the half star, the bib gourmand half star.

442
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:51,723
Rym: Yup.

443
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,336
Rym: But Casa Enrique has maintained, they got the Michelin star again.

444
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,099
Rym: They keep getting it.

445
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,393
Rym: But the cool thing is they never raise their prices or change their menu.

446
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:00,920
Rym: They just keep doing what they're doing.

447
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:05,959
Rym: The only thing that changed is I haven't eaten there since, because I can't get in.

448
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,927
Rym: There is like a multi-hour wait.

449
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:10,471
Rym: They won't take reservations.

450
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,960
Rym: A few weeks ago, they started doing delivery.

451
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,314
Scott: Oh baby.

452
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,940
Rym: I ordered some tacos, and not only did they do delivery, they deliver so fast, like 25 minutes your tacos arrive.

453
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:26,640
Rym: And they're the same Michelin star Casa Enrique tacos.

454
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,570
Scott: Now Casa Enrique is, I'd say, it's fantastic.

455
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,517
Scott: I love to eat their delicious food, right?

456
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,580
Scott: Great, great restaurant.

457
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,740
Rym: It's not my favorite Mexican food, but it's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.

458
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:39,720
Scott: Exactly.

459
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,530
Scott: I would, like I'm not even joking, right?

460
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:45,580
Scott: Obviously the Cafe Maya in Fishkill, New York.

461
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:48,097
Rym: Yucatan Mexican food.

462
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:48,419
Scott: Oh my god.

463
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,644
Scott: I would rather eat that.

464
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,008
Scott: It's that dessert.

465
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:54,840
Scott: If Casa Enrique is one star, then Cafe Maya is two star.

466
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Scott: And also in Manhattan, there's Tacos Numero Uno.

467
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,935
Rym: Oh yeah.

468
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,824
Scott: Tacos Numero Uno?

469
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,971
Scott: I don't want to say, it's not a full restaurant.

470
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,660
Scott: It's more of like a walk-in, grab-and-go kind of place.

471
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,280
Scott: It's almost like a truck that's inside, but it's a little more than that, right?

472
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,000
Scott: It's like, you know, but it's just like a takeout, quick-eaty place.

473
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:24,300
Scott: But the taco there specifically, right, is better than like the taco basically anywhere.

474
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:31,060
Scott: It's like, I don't know, I don't think you could make a taco better than the taco at Tacos Numero Uno.

475
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,151
Scott: And I've heard Mexican people agree, right?

476
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:40,480
Scott: And that has no Michelin stars that I'm aware of.

477
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,391
Scott: It doesn't even have half stars, as far as I know.

478
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,659
Scott: So there you go.

479
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Scott: But anyway, things of the day!

480
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:03,299
Rym: So this is a Twitter thread, but it points out something that we've talked about before on GeekNights, but this shows that this problem is more widespread and more current than you might think.

481
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,460
Rym: Colorization APIs and colorization libraries, especially leveraging machine learning, are getting more and more popular lately.

482
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:20,660
Rym: Ostensibly, they can take an old photo that's either black and white, or use one of those pre-full color processes where there's some color information that you can use.

483
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,019
Scott: Well, because you can always remove the color information, make it black and white again, and then colorize it.

484
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,532
Scott: Exactly.

485
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,482
Scott: If necessary.

486
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:38,196
Scott: But you can always just also use the existing weak, crappy, low-quality color information to help you make guesses about and move colors into a larger gamut.

487
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,185
Rym: Coupled with having knowledge of the time and place the photo was taken, and maybe having other sources of data, there's a lot of ways to approach this problem.

488
00:27:46,727 --> 00:28:00,479
Rym: But it's important because, and we have a lot of studies to show this, black and white photos tend to make people feel like the past was further away and more alien and different than it really was and is.

489
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:01,735
Rym: That's true.

490
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,802
Rym: They're alienating.

491
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:16,780
Rym: I remember when I was a kid, I saw a photo from World War II in color instead of in black and white, and it blew my kid mind because it just looked like a normal place with normal people doing, well, sadly, normal things.

492
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:22,540
Rym: And it really made it real how, as many as things change, a lot of things don't change.

493
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:31,080
Rym: But this also gets into the problem where a lot of Europeans, a lot of white supremacists have false ideas about the past.

494
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,169
Rym: Like, they think that Roman buildings were white marble and austere.

495
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:39,640
Rym: Like, no, they were painted with the most garish colors humans have ever conceived.

496
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,800
Scott: And the paint wore out because it was shitty.

497
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:43,322
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:28:43,864 --> 00:28:48,820
Rym: So the problem now is that these colorization libraries are getting very popular.

499
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:58,522
Rym: So this person, this thing of the day, is they took some photos from 1909 and 1915.

500
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:03,660
Rym: And they were color photos, accurate, good color photos, early color photos.

501
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:05,223
Rym: They removed the color.

502
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:18,520
Rym: Then they ran these through some of the most popular colorization libraries and machine learning networks that are out there, ones that a lot of historians use, where these photos get circulated widely using these APIs.

503
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,229
Rym: And you showed the colors, like, what they look like.

504
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,120
Rym: And they look like the old-timey color photos you expect.

505
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:32,677
Rym: But then you look at the actual real photos and they look literally nothing like what that API did.

506
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,280
Rym: Like, not even close.

507
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,400
Rym: The real photos are so vibrant and the colors are so stark and the people look so different.

508
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,122
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:49,960
Scott: And a lot, you know, that's the thing is, you know, as much as people have digital cameras these days, right?

510
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,075
Scott: It's like, you know, and we talk about things like vinyl records being poopy, which is true.

511
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,439
Scott: They're just garbage.

512
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,299
Rym: They have way more noise than even, like, a CD.

513
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:00,743
Scott: Right.

514
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:04,460
Scott: Analog film, you know, depending on a lot of circumstances.

515
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:11,700
Scott: But the quality of analog film is actually still, to this day, ridiculous resolution.

516
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:16,149
Scott: You know, it's like not until, like, 4K even.

517
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:27,340
Scott: It's like, even 1080p, it's like you're better off watching a, you know, 35mm film, as long as it's in good shape and your projector is good, than watching, you know, a 1080p, you know, boot ray.

518
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,180
Rym: But, like, you look at the black and white...

519
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,856
Scott: And even a 70mm film, it's like, get out, right?

520
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:33,238
Scott: It's like...

521
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:41,900
Rym: But, like, you look at this photo of these three village girls in black and white, and it just looks super old-timey and almost depressing.

522
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,320
Rym: You look at what the API did, and it just looks really, like, sad and washed out and sort of still old-timey.

523
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,599
Rym: The actual photo, they're wearing amazing dresses, and it is not a sad photo at all.

524
00:30:56,081 --> 00:31:09,400
Rym: So, be wary of the sources of colorized, I'm making quote motions, images from the past, if you don't know the process they used, because they often will be lying to you and setting subtle biases in how you interpret history.

525
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,079
Rym: So, what do you got?

526
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,843
Scott: I got something real fun.

527
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:20,639
Scott: So, there was a movie in the 80s, movies like as old as we are, called Ninjas in the Dragon's Den, right?

528
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:25,600
Scott: It's, you know, some old, one of those silly 80s martial arts movies, the kind of anime hell of a situation.

529
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,079
Rym: Oh my god, those ninja costumes.

530
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,499
Scott: Right, this is the most stereotyped ninja thing you'll ever see.

531
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:40,900
Scott: And basically, at the beginning, the movie opens up with a three-minute sequence, and that's, like, where the credits play.

532
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,719
Scott: Sort of like how a James Bond movie opens up with a credit thing, right?

533
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:48,479
Scott: And it's this song, it's a great song, you'll love it.

534
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:58,200
Scott: It's very of the period, and the three-minute sequence of the ninjas doing their ninja thing, it's like, do you even need to see the rest of this movie?

535
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,640
Scott: I don't know, but this is a really fun way to spend three minutes with some ninjas, if you've never seen this movie or the opening to it.

536
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:13,420
Scott: It is well worth your three minutes to have some fun 80s, you know, ninja action.

537
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:22,740
Rym: I, uh, I remember seeing the movie, oh god, three ninjas in the theater, because I was one of those kids who was into ninjas.

538
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:25,311
Scott: Did I see that in the theater or at home?

539
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:26,940
Scott: I don't know which one I saw either.

540
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:31,540
Rym: Not only did we see three ninjas in the theater, but we saw three ninjas kick back in the theater, I want to say.

541
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,480
Scott: You know what I definitely 100% saw in the theater was, uh, what's the one with Chuck Norris and the kid?

542
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:38,759
Rym: Oh, Sidekick!

543
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:39,999
Scott: That one.

544
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:41,579
Scott: That movie- I saw that in the theater.

545
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,351
Rym: I, that movie messed with my kid brain.

546
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:46,360
Rym: I wasn't sure if Chuck Norris was real or not.

547
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,540
Scott: I don't remember anything about it other than that it was a movie with Chuck Norris and a kid.

548
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,220
Rym: It was a kid who was bullied and he had this imaginary friend, Chuck Norris, who would, like, help him.

549
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,477
Scott: But then he made that, like- I did not know that's what it was about.

550
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,460
Rym: But then he, like- I've seen it.

551
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,271
Rym: Chuck Norris ends up being real and, like, actually fights with him.

552
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,600
Rym: Like, I don't, that is all I remember.

553
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,599
Scott: Okay, I remember less than that.

554
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,260
Rym: Also, Chuck Norris is a bad person in real life, just in case anyone doesn't know.

555
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:11,559
Scott: Yes, Chuck Norris is bad.

556
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:12,455
Scott: Very bad.

557
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:21,580
Rym: But, uh, after we watched Three Ninjas, my brother and I put on the blindfold, or the, the headbands, 'cause the theater gave every kid who showed up a Three Ninjas headband.

558
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,518
Rym: It was a long time ago.

559
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:22,707
Scott: Whoa.

560
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,680
Rym: And, uh, we put them over our eyes, like blindfolds, and ran blindly into the parking lot for training.

561
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,320
Rym: And I ran straight into a parking sign.

562
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:32,539
Scott: Good.

563
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:37,540
Rym: I, uh, I had, it looked like someone had punched me in the face.

564
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:46,640
Rym: So I come home from this movie, and my dad is just like, you're gonna have to explain what happened to you when your mom asks you, 'cause I am not involved in this situation.

565
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:55,960
Scott: Yeah, that just reminds me of how sad I was as a kid, that on TV there would be commercials occasionally talking about, you know, special promotions like that, right?

566
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:56,738
Scott: Yup.

567
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,480
Scott: And how literally never was, not even one time, were any of those actually happening in a place near me that I went.

568
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,920
Rym: Wow, they were like always near me for some reason.

569
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:07,740
Rym: Like Lakeside bucket mall.

570
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,300
Scott: It would be like, oh, go to, go to, go to this store.

571
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,780
Scott: There's a special limit, you know, like, uh, cup or whatever.

572
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,719
Scott: And I'd go to the store, and they wouldn't, like, no, we don't have that.

573
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,480
Scott: You know, it'd be like, you know, oh, if you go see this movie on this day, you'll get a toy.

574
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,978
Scott: Nope, no toys there.

575
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,159
Scott: I think what was going on is- None of those things.

576
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,399
Rym: We, like, we weren't rich.

577
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,060
Rym: We lived, uh, we didn't live in the gray part, like the gray neighborhood.

578
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,819
Rym: But, if we drove far enough, there was a fancy mall, fancy relative to the mall we would go to.

579
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,998
Scott: There's a mall right next to my house.

580
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:42,219
Rym: Yeah, for whatever reason, the fancy mall in the nice suburbs that we drive out to all the time instead of the crappy mall near us.

581
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,839
Rym: Every single movie promotion was there.

582
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,139
Rym: Like, every tchotchke you would possibly want would be there on opening night.

583
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,159
Scott: The only ones we got occasionally were, like, the ones that would, like, come in in the newspaper.

584
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,440
Scott: 'Cause we'd always buy newspapers.

585
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:56,379
Scott: We'd get those kinds of things.

586
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,380
Scott: I think there was one time there was, like, the thing was it was, like, a McDonald's vinyl record in the newspaper, I think I remember.

587
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,599
Scott: I don't, I gotta look that up.

588
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:09,100
Rym: Well, there was a, I mean, the McDonald's vinyl was part of that ad campaign where you had to memorize the song.

589
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:12,078
Scott: I don't remember anything about it.

590
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,439
Scott: Other than what I just said.

591
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,820
Rym: Okay, interesting.

592
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:22,059
Rym: I tried memorizing that song, and I would perform it on command for other adults because the adults all thought it was funny.

593
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:23,906
Rym: Okay.

594
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:29,920
Rym: And the contest was, if you got the vinyl, it had the real song, and then it had someone attempting to sing the song.

595
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:35,420
Rym: And if the person attempting to sing the song and the vinyl you got succeeded, you won some cash prize.

596
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,400
Rym: And, of course, nobody actually won that thing, but.

597
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:40,660
Scott: I don't know why I remember this so specifically.

598
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,740
Scott: There's an article here that says what happened to the winner of McDonald's 1 million Flexidisc contest.

599
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,100
Rym: Yeah, I don't know, 'cause there were two contests.

600
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:50,640
Scott: In 1989, a 13-year-old boy in Galax, Virginia thought he'd won.

601
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:54,480
Scott: His family suddenly had money, but with it, more problems.

602
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,999
Scott: That's right.

603
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,979
Rym: Interesting, yeah.

604
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:56,438
Rym: More problems.

605
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:57,840
Scott: Well.

606
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,519
Rym: Otherwise, metamoment.

607
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:01,540
Rym: We're still locked inside.

608
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,379
Rym: Like, I just got my second shot less than a week ago.

609
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,013
Rym: Stay tuned.

610
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:06,940
Scott: I got mine maybe a week.

611
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,679
Scott: I guess a week and a day ago, I guess?

612
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,067
Rym: Yep.

613
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,140
Rym: Give me another week, and I'm not gonna change much in my life.

614
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,719
Rym: Like, things are still not great out there.

615
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,500
Scott: Well, you know, if it was warm, I would go outside more.

616
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,240
Rym: I mean, if it's warm enough, I'm going outside more.

617
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,319
Scott: It's a little cold.

618
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,894
Rym: A little cold?

619
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Rym: This is like hiking weekend.

620
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:25,639
Scott: And it's gonna rain for like a week.

621
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,959
Rym: It's not gonna rain much on Sunday.

622
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:29,938
Scott: It's cold.

623
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:31,302
Scott: It's like 60.

624
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:31,780
Scott: It's fine.

625
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:32,799
Scott: It's cold.

626
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,679
Rym: How did you get so old so fast?

627
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,840
Scott: You know, the Earth, it kept going around the sun.

628
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,359
Scott: It couldn't stop.

629
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:43,820
Rym: So let's just get right into it, because I'm hungry.

630
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,380
Rym: It's Thursday.

631
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,898
Scott: It's the lounge.

632
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:45,919
Scott: No metamoment action?

633
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,438
Scott: I don't know.

634
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:48,000
Rym: All our stuff's on the internet.

635
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Rym: Our Discord's rocking.

636
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,053
Rym: You should join it.

637
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,140
Scott: The book club book is The Tale of Genji.

638
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,939
Rym: The Tale of Genji?

639
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,060
Rym: I'm reading it slowly.

640
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,818
Scott: Genji is not a ninja.

641
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:03,698
Rym: Yeah, let's just get into it.

642
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:07,100
Rym: So, in America, you know, we're Americans.

643
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:17,560
Rym: We're gonna talk about this from an English-speaking American perspective, because this is a country where white people born here don't really need to speak any other languages to get by, usually.

644
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:33,934
Scott: Thanks to the imperialism of the UK primarily, but also the United States, English has imposed, much like the US dollar, English as a language has imposed its will upon the rest of the world, which is a privilege and benefit of us.

645
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:36,700
Scott: that was not our fault, but we benefit from it greatly.

646
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Rym: Hey, at least we displace French as the lingua franca.

647
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,100
Scott: That's sure.

648
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,140
Scott: Yeah, that's funny.

649
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,036
Scott: The lingua franca is not English.

650
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,119
Scott: Yeah, I never thought about that before.

651
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:56,420
Scott: But yeah, I can go to most countries, and as long as I'm in heavily populated areas, especially, if I go to any airport, you know, things will be written in English.

652
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,280
Scott: There'll be people who speak English around.

653
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,270
Scott: You know, you can get through life, even if you travel frequently, with only English.

654
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,720
Rym: Talk about my day job.

655
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:32,600
Rym: I've spent a decade flying around the world doing business, like, everywhere, in places where very few people speak English, and I've made it out just fine with, like, let's see, some high school French, a little, I can read Turkish phonetically, and I know a few basic words that are useful for, like, ordering things, and I know a bunch of random Japanese nouns and verbs thanks to anime.

656
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,937
Rym: Like, that's about the extent of it.

657
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:42,860
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I learned, you know, because I'm a Jew in Hebrew school, they taught us, it was really annoying to me that they would teach us to read Hebrew, right?

658
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,559
Scott: So, I can, I guess I've forgotten some portion of it, because I haven't,

659
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:52,608
Rym: well, like, how to read it phonetically, like, read it, like, you can look at the alphabet, and you can say the word out loud,

660
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,396
Scott: perfectly, with perfect pronunciation, and someone says, "What does that word

661
00:38:59,437 --> 00:38:59,539
Scott: mean?".

662
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,579
Scott: Like, I have no fucking idea.

663
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:00,915
Scott: Yup.

664
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:06,920
Rym: That was useful to me in Turkey, because I had to drive there, and I had to, like, do a lot of crap completely on my own.

665
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:18,000
Rym: So, while I didn't know Turkish, I could say any word I could see perfectly, and that was super useful asking for directions.

666
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,159
Rym: Like, that actually saved me many times.

667
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,625
Scott: Mm-hmm.

668
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:29,280
Scott: And then, for Spanish, so, in middle school, for all of middle school, they made us take a second language.

669
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,080
Scott: You could choose Spanish, French, basically.

670
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
Rym: That's something that came, like, while we were kids.

671
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:49,657
Rym: Like, America wasn't big on learning other languages, generally, but there was a revolution where in the late '70s, early '80s, there started to be this idea that every kid in America should at least learn, while they're in, like, K-12 education, one other language, and some schools started to require it.

672
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,120
Scott: So, the choices were Spanish and French.

673
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,038
Scott: I chose Spanish.

674
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,219
Rym: Oh, that's all you had?

675
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,660
Rym: I went to a fancier school, I guess.

676
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,860
Scott: Well, in high school, there were more choices.

677
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:03,960
Rym: Yeah, our default choices, like the normal ones, were French, Spanish, German, and Italian.

678
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,879
Rym: Those are, like, the four, but there was one Latin class, there was one Japanese class, and there was one Russian class.

679
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,720
Scott: Yup, so yes, in high school, it was pretty much what you described, but in middle school, you had two choices.

680
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,900
Scott: So, in middle school, I took three years of Spanish, right?

681
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,371
Scott: And then, in high school, you know, they kept telling you, like, "Oh, man, you want to succeed in life?

682
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,059
Scott: You want a college to accept you?

683
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,500
Scott: You better take four years of foreign language, right?

684
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,035
Scott: Otherwise, you know, your college just won't accept

685
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:29,155
Scott: you.".

686
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,930
Rym: I did not take the full four years.

687
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:33,840
Rym: I stopped taking French my senior year.

688
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,257
Scott: And then they said, "In order to graduate, you need two

689
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:36,520
Scott: years.".

690
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:37,840
Scott: And I was like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute.

691
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:54,278
Scott: You're saying you give me the high school diploma with only two years, but, you know, you're really encouraging the four, but you've got all these other classes available in this school that I can take, computer classes, you know, all kinds of fun stuff, and I basically can choose to do those instead of

692
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:54,520
Scott: these.".

693
00:40:54,902 --> 00:41:06,098
Scott: So I did the minimum two years of Spanish in high school, and as a result, my Spanish is actually, you know, it's like, there are some verbs I know how to conjugate, but I've, you know, forgotten some.

694
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:14,053
Scott: And then, but it's like, I can read, like, even today, you know, that second year of high school was 1998, right?

695
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:26,299
Scott: So it's been a long time since I studied any Spanish or spoke it at all, and I couldn't really hold a conversation if someone was, you know, with a fluent person who was speaking at their normal speed.

696
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:32,891
Scott: But I can read, like, the signs on the subway that are in Spanish, like 80% of what's on the sign.

697
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,620
Scott: You know, it's mostly vocabulary.

698
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:40,199
Scott: Like, I don't know what that word means, you know, but I understand the sentence structure and enough words that I get the idea.

699
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,930
Scott: So that's, you know, surprising.

700
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,635
Scott: It was actually surprising to me that, like, I still know as much Spanish as I do, right?

701
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,580
Scott: Considering how little effort I put into it, other than five years of classes that I had to take.

702
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:03,760
Rym: I think what helps is that just living in a diverse city, we encounter Spanish a lot, so there's a lot of signs in Spanish.

703
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:20,880
Rym: Like, you sort of just, like, you gotta know a lot of basic words if you're gonna live in New York and not just be that guy, so... But French, like, doesn't really come up in my life at all, 'cause I ended up picking French because in my school, the basic ones were offered at multiple times, so it was pretty easy to schedule.

704
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,440
Rym: I wanted to take Japanese, 'cause I was a mega wee starting in elementary school.

705
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,960
Rym: Japanese was during band, and I wasn't gonna give up music.

706
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:30,753
Rym: So then I was like, "Oh, I'll do

707
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:31,117
Rym: Russian.".

708
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,860
Rym: Russian was during all the advanced math classes, so I couldn't do Russian.

709
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,286
Rym: Basically, all the interesting languages I wanted to take were during a class.

710
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,960
Rym: I wanted to take more, so I had to pick one of the default four.

711
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,659
Rym: I picked French semi-randomly.

712
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:48,518
Rym: I didn't have any particular rationale behind it, I just picked it.

713
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:52,259
Scott: I picked Spanish just aesthetically, you know.

714
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:58,340
Scott: And also the fact that I thought it would be more likely that I'd go to, like, you know, Mexico than it would be.

715
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:03,480
Rym: I lived on the border of Canada, and we would go into Canada and head out toward Montreal.

716
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,360
Scott: That's true, you were closer to Canada.

717
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,620
Scott: I mean, I was also closer to Canada than I was to Mexico.

718
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,340
Rym: But where I grew up, a lot of things in the grocery store would be in English and French instead of English and Spanish.

719
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,120
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't that close.

720
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,480
Rym: So I picked French, and it was an okay time, but I only took a few years of it.

721
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,200
Rym: My senior year, I just bailed on it, 'cause I was done with high school.

722
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:29,178
Rym: But then RIT was like, "Oh, it didn't take four years of language for the IT

723
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:29,620
Rym: program.".

724
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:32,860
Rym: I had to get a minimum number of language credits to get my degree.

725
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,580
Scott: Oh, computer science did not have that.

726
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,806
Rym: RIT had that.

727
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,175
Rym: I had to take some language classes.

728
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:37,980
Rym: You know what I did?

729
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:41,597
Rym: I signed up for, like, intermediate French II.

730
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:51,300
Rym: Like, I just picked French classes that looked like they were below what I could speak so they'd be easy, and tried to just basically take French again to get the credits.

731
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:52,605
Rym: And it totally worked.

732
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:56,220
Rym: I skipped the entirety of those French classes and passed all the exams.

733
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,413
Scott: Sounds good.

734
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,264
Scott: It worked out.

735
00:43:58,325 --> 00:43:58,950
Rym: I graduated.

736
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,120
Rym: You can't take my diploma away.

737
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,201
Scott: Yeah.

738
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:11,892
Scott: So I put, you know, like with most things later in life, right, not just learning languages but other hobbies, right, it's like, you know, there are some where it's like, "I thought I would start 'em, but you didn't really," right?

739
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:12,576
Scott: It's like, "I bought a

740
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:13,179
Scott: harmonica.".

741
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:14,189
Scott: No, right?

742
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,059
Scott: It's like, I didn't practice.

743
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:16,169
Rym: I kept practicing.

744
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:17,359
Rym: I'm pretty good at that harmonica now.

745
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,586
Scott: Yeah, it's annoying.

746
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,640
Scott: I didn't have the discipline to stick with it, right?

747
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,880
Scott: So, like, I think I tried for, like, maybe, like, a week to, like, to read Japanese.

748
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:29,140
Scott: You know, I could read the katakanas for, like, a little bit.

749
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,171
Rym: Oh, remember, I learned Hangul, like, fully.

750
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,460
Rym: Like, I could read Hangul phonetically, and I learned basic Korean.

751
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:34,996
Rym: Can you read it now?

752
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,190
Rym: No, I forgot it all, 'cause I never used it.

753
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:38,719
Rym: This is way before K-pop.

754
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,815
Scott: Right, so it's like, you know, my, I never put the effort in, I didn't have the discipline, and then it, so I failed a couple times, and I said, "All right, I give up,".

755
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:49,702
Scott: and now it's like, "I should learn,".

756
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:54,179
Scott: but it's like, "No, I already know I don't have the discipline, so why

757
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:54,419
Scott: start?".

758
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,970
Rym: So I had something change for me in that.

759
00:44:57,351 --> 00:45:06,840
Rym: part of the reason why I'd forget this stuff was that I just don't use it in my daily life unless I might go out of my way to use it, and I am not the kind of person who has a hammer and goes around looking for nails.

760
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:10,300
Scott: Mm-hmm, exactly, exactly.

761
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:16,024
Rym: But I did, I decided, 'cause Emily's been doing Duolingo just to, like, pick up a lot of basic Spanish, and it's worked out really well.

762
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:19,900
Rym: Like, read Spanish and understand it pretty well, like, it worked out.

763
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,920
Rym: It was very low effort, and it provided that constant context, you know, just poke at it for ten minutes once a day.

764
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:29,780
Rym: So I started doing it for French, and I learned something fascinating.

765
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:39,260
Rym: I weirdly have a, like, extremely strong understanding of French grammar and structure and diction and pronunciation still.

766
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:42,149
Rym: All I'd lost was the vocabulary.

767
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,640
Rym: I didn't know any fucking words anymore at all.

768
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,172
Rym: I remembered a lot of, like, verbs, but that was it.

769
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,440
Rym: Like, nouns for anything were just gone from my brain.

770
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,070
Scott: It's actually not, I haven't thought of that before, right?

771
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:02,260
Scott: 'Cause, like, the languages that I think would be useful to me that I want to learn, right, are, like, you know, Japanese, Korean, right?

772
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,540
Scott: You know, like, these languages where I can then access, you know, media, right, without subtitles.

773
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:08,082
Scott: Well, like,

774
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:21,560
Rym: I was even learning hiragana just 'cause that made it easy to be able to do things like read straight signs when we were traveling in Japan, and I knew it for a while, but then we didn't go back to Japan for a long time, and I literally forgot most of it because I don't need it in my daily life.

775
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:32,010
Scott: Right, but it's like now, it's like thanks to literally just within this recording this podcast, it's like, you know, I already know enough Spanish to read signs on the subway.

776
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,850
Scott: if I just put, I could probably, you know, become maybe even fluent in Spanish if I tried, right?

777
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:50,840
Scott: You know, considering that I have, like, a head start of some amount, you know, maybe that would work out better if I did that instead of trying to learn something that not only, I don't, I know nothing and has a different alphabet.

778
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,622
Rym: Yup.

779
00:46:51,642 --> 00:47:02,808
Rym: Now, but the way I learn languages, 'cause I realize, like, doing Duolingo, like, it's very, like, immersion, like, it gives you a sentence and makes you translate it without telling you anything, but with, like, multiple choice, like, it does that kind of stuff.

780
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,180
Rym: I'm not gonna, like, turn this into a Duolingo ad or anything.

781
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:15,284
Rym: But I think I would not have liked that application at all if it weren't for the fact that I already know the, a good deal of how French works.

782
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:25,380
Rym: So the only thing I'm learning is relearning the vocabulary and relearning stuff like which words are feminine and masculine and all that gendered nonsense.

783
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:35,845
Rym: But, like, I don't, like, 'cause when I learn languages, I would, like, rather read about grammar for a year before I say even one sentence.

784
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:40,260
Rym: Like, I like to learn structure and rules first before I start learning content.

785
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:45,260
Scott: I mean, I don't really, you know, I don't know which way is the best way.

786
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,809
Rym: Oh, I don't think that's the best way.

787
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,480
Rym: I think that's just how I have engaged.

788
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,800
Scott: No, I mean, for me, I don't know what the best way for me to learn is either, right?

789
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,204
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like.

790
00:47:53,244 --> 00:48:05,720
Scott: how much, you know, I've consumed so much media in various languages with subtitles and I pick up words, you know, and I eventually learn what they mean, but I still can't speak or read those languages at all, right?

791
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,780
Scott: Even though it's been many, many years of consuming piles and piles of media for some of them, right?

792
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,020
Rym: That's kind of why I'm doing this app thing 'cause it just, it forces me to see the language and engage with it a tiny bit every single day.

793
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,820
Scott: It seems like it's working.

794
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:21,580
Scott: I did pirate those Rosetta apps way back in the beacon days.

795
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,110
Scott: They were not great.

796
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:24,257
Rym: I also pirated them.

797
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,248
Scott: They did not work.

798
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,060
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't pay for them.

799
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,800
Scott: They charged so much money for those, but yeah, they didn't really work for me at all and I wasn't able to stick with those either.

800
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,079
Scott: I didn't have the discipline, so it didn't work.

801
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,810
Rym: Yup.

802
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:49,539
Rym: So, I'm gonna keep this up and see if I have rudimentary French again by the time we go to France 'cause I actually haven't been to Paris in, God, it's been a long time now and I wanna actually go there on a vacation instead of for work.

803
00:48:50,580 --> 00:49:02,080
Scott: Maybe, yeah, maybe I should try the, you know, it's like to become fluent in Spanish from where I am should be theoretically less work than from nothing in some other language, right?

804
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,368
Scott: Yeah.

805
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:12,720
Scott: And although I'm not interested in Spanish media, you know, it's like maybe, like there are plenty of Spanish-speaking people all around here.

806
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:16,200
Rym: It's just generally useful, especially in a cosmopolitan city.

807
00:49:16,602 --> 00:49:20,780
Scott: It would be actually very useful if I could just actually engage in a conversation.

808
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,860
Rym: What's funny though is so, you know, I used to spend a lot of time in Turkey to the point that I was like earnestly trying to learn Turkish.

809
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:48,718
Rym: Like I was studying the language, I had a bunch of grammar books, I would like try to use it when I was there, but literally every single person I used any Turkish words with, like I'm not even exaggerating, 100% of the people, if they spoke English at all, they would tell me, they would literally just be like, "Why are you speaking Turkish?

810
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:49,480
Rym: Don't learn our language.

811
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,208
Rym: No one else on earth speaks it.

812
00:49:51,228 --> 00:49:51,751
Rym: There's no point.

813
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:52,274
Rym: You're wasting your

814
00:49:52,294 --> 00:49:52,455
Rym: time.".

815
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:56,449
Rym: They were like oddly insistent, like, "No, don't bother.

816
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,160
Rym: Like this language, I love my language, but no one speaks it outside of Turkey.

817
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,877
Rym: Unless you move here, you will never use it in your

818
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:02,058
Rym: life.".

819
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:06,619
Rym: And they were like specifically earnestly insistent about that.

820
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:10,200
Rym: It's also a neat language.

821
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,779
Scott: Their perspective was like, you know, that, you know, their perspective is like, man, you know, learning English for them, right?

822
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,239
Rym: Like opens up the world.

823
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:19,041
Scott: Right.

824
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:21,249
Scott: It opens up doors for them, right?

825
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,320
Scott: Whereas knowing only Turkish, they sort of feel trapped.

826
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,880
Scott: So it's sort of like, why would you want to learn Turkish?

827
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:33,700
Scott: It's like being able to access this tiny, it's like this little tiny box that, you know, even from their perspective of being Turkish people, right?

828
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:40,620
Scott: You know, but other people are like, yes, please learn our, you know, we want people to learn our language.

829
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,893
Scott: We want to spread our culture and share with you, right?

830
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:45,720
Scott: It's just different attitudes and different places.

831
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,165
Rym: So yeah, we'll see.

832
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:53,400
Rym: I'm going to give this like a year and see how far my French gets along and decide what to do from there.

833
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:58,400
Rym: I was vaguely thinking if I wanted to learn a language more deeply, I was honestly thinking about German.

834
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,680
Rym: Because in terms of places I might end up, long term.

835
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,439
Scott: The board game business?

836
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:13,600
Rym: Well, not so much the board, like the board games would be a bonus, but more in terms of like what country generally is closer to like the political ideals I have as a structure.

837
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,658
Scott: When you learn Dutch then?

838
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:16,454
Rym: Ah, yeah, that would work too.

839
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:17,817
Rym: Finnish?

840
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,457
Scott: Say something like that?

841
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:23,727
Rym: German seems like it would be generally useful.

842
00:51:23,787 --> 00:51:27,720
Rym: Also, I do, in the course of my work, I encounter a lot of German speaking people.

843
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:31,018
Rym: I also have a bunch of engineering teams in Frankfurt right now.

844
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:36,500
Rym: So I would actually like have an excuse to use that language because I do enter.

845
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,540
Rym: There are people I would like to interact with more who do not have like, they're not fluent in English, they're fluent in German.

846
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,380
Rym: They interact with me in English because I'm the product manager, but like I don't speak German.

847
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,460
Rym: So I would earnestly like to be able to engage with them more directly.

848
00:51:52,080 --> 00:52:01,180
Rym: But that would be a much, just using a language, like planning to use the language for that purpose is a much bigger commitment than learning French for like a trip I'm going to take to France.

849
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:09,960
Scott: Yeah, at my work they actually, there were so many frequent requests coming, you know, they were like at the front desk or at other places in the company, right?

850
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:18,498
Scott: They'd like get a contract from like a French songwriter or something and they'd, they'd send a message out, like broadcast like, "Is there anyone in the office who speaks, who's fluent in

851
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:18,678
Scott: X?".

852
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:20,848
Scott: It happened frequently enough.

853
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,260
Scott: They created a company-wide directory.

854
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,700
Scott: So you could find the people who are fluent in X. We

855
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:45,140
Rym: have a similar directory and you can also, in all of our internal systems, if your name has a spelling that uses characters, diacritics or anything that would be different in different contexts, you can actually input your name for all those different contexts and it'll show up appropriately depending on what language is being used.

856
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:46,379
Scott: That's good.

857
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:47,120
Rym: It's really neat.

858
00:52:47,980 --> 00:53:03,780
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, if anyone out there is, you know, I definitely, you know, believe that even if you are, have the benefit of, you know, already knowing English because you were born in a place that speaks English or, you know, that learning another language is very valuable.

859
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,759
Scott: You know, don't, don't do as I do.

860
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:07,719
Scott: Do as I say.

861
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,780
Scott: Don't do as I don't does, right?

862
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:14,600
Scott: You know, learning more languages is, you know, just awesome.

863
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:21,300
Scott: It helps you and it's, you know, it, I would, if someone who knows more than one language, I have respect for them, right?

864
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,700
Scott: It's like, you know, you can, you know, it's just, uh, it's just all around positive.

865
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Scott: You know, it would be nice if the whole world spoke one language and everyone could communicate easily.

866
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:37,220
Scott: Uh, but that also is, you know, language also affects how people think.

867
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,340
Scott: So that would make people all think the same way as well.

868
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:40,880
Scott: And that's not.

869
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:43,040
Rym: Ah, so that's something I think about a lot.

870
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,760
Scott: And it would also, it also do, you know, erase a lot of cultures, which is even less great.

871
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,860
Rym: Well, so are you familiar with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?

872
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:56,419
Scott: No, but I'm pretty sure I can guess what it is.

873
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:11,500
Rym: Uh, it's the idea that the set of languages you speak best and use the most in your own head materially affect your worldview and cognition and how you approach and interact with things.

874
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:12,738
Scott: I believe it.

875
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:18,000
Rym: And there's a lot of debate on how strong it is and how much, like, there's some, there's evidence for it.

876
00:54:18,343 --> 00:54:19,559
Rym: There's weak evidence against it.

877
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,640
Rym: There's, it's a whole, but the culture books, those sci-fi books are based on it.

878
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:31,719
Rym: A big part of the culture is the idea that the machines make up a new language and over time get all humans to speak it.

879
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:40,380
Rym: But that language is subtly designed to reduce aggression and increase curiosity and things like that.

880
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:48,460
Rym: That is like a fascinating field we are in no way competent to speak to beyond maybe the next couple minutes.

881
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,380
Scott: Right.

882
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:59,760
Scott: An observation I have made, you know, especially in our forum, but just around the internet as well, are people who will argue about something, whatever the something is, and they'll make some semantic argument, right?

883
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,500
Scott: And then they'll be like, aha, these words mean X, therefore this thing about reality.

884
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:07,540
Scott: And it's like, I think people have a heart.

885
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:14,820
Scott: I'm always intentionally forcing myself to sort of separate and be like, you know, the way the world works.

886
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:15,583
Scott: Right.

887
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:18,760
Scott: Has nothing to do with the words that we've invented.

888
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,060
Scott: Right.

889
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:29,180
Scott: We, you know, even things like, you know, we say we talk about like physics and chemistry, like these two separate things, you know, conceptually, it's like, you know, in order to understand them, we need that framework.

890
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,580
Scott: But it's like, there's no actual separation.

891
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,893
Scott: The universe is the universe.

892
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,719
Scott: Atoms are atoms.

893
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:35,245
Scott: Yeah.

894
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:35,580
Scott: Right.

895
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:39,260
Scott: You know, why are you thinking about those things separately?

896
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:42,620
Rym: It's like, it's like, well, that's why I'm such a big fan.

897
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,723
Rym: And we do this in our talks all the time of.

898
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:58,180
Rym: if we're going to make a like very focused or semantic based argument, we'll at least set the agree on the definitions of the things we're going to use for the debate in advance and agree that those definitions are not universal.

899
00:55:58,281 --> 00:56:00,860
Rym: They're just for the purpose of this particular thought experiment.

900
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:04,599
Scott: But if you speak a different language, you have different words available to you.

901
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,040
Scott: Right.

902
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:12,400
Scott: Maybe that maybe the some theoretical language has a word for something and that word encompasses some parts of physics and some parts of chemistry.

903
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:18,660
Scott: But it's still anyone who speaks that language would clearly understand that word, whatever it is, its own thing.

904
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,040
Scott: It's like they could teach a class in school on that thing.

905
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:30,760
Rym: That's one of the reasons why Latin is used for a lot of like scientific terms, because since it's not a like actively spoken language, it's not going to evolve significantly.

906
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:42,720
Rym: So its meaning will remain relatively constant and untouched by culture or at least less touched by culture because it's still touched by the culture of the person who chose a particular Latin word or Latin sounding word.

907
00:56:43,760 --> 00:57:00,240
Rym: But another idea in that space is some languages have concepts like when you use a noun or a verb like verbs, verbs that imply something happened have varying degrees of how much truth there is to it.

908
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Rym: Like there are languages that if I say I went to the store, I could use a different word than went.

909
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,225
Rym: That means I went to the store.

910
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:08,710
Rym: I am saying 100 percent.

911
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,600
Rym: this is literal truth versus I went to the store.

912
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,024
Rym: But I'm not like.

913
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:14,832
Rym: I'm not saying this as a literal truth.

914
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:16,639
Rym: English has nothing like that.

915
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:20,200
Scott: And then you got languages with gendered pronouns.

916
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,110
Rym: I'm so like not jazzed about it.

917
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:27,080
Rym: I forgot how much I hate the gendering in French.

918
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:28,506
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:32,040
Scott: There's so much stuff like that going on, you know, all all the different aspects.

920
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,381
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:34,340
Scott: And the way they are thinking.

922
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:38,860
Rym: That's the word I'll use for computer.

923
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:39,701
Scott: Right.

924
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:56,760
Scott: And, you know, I think that learning more languages and, you know, getting those, you know, especially if you can go above two languages, you can start to sort of erase those sort of controls on your brain to some extent, maybe, you know, but just it's a good thing.

925
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:57,922
Scott: So you're not.

926
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:08,640
Scott: And also, from what I've read, I'm not 100 percent sure on this, but I've read it in several places that the idea that like, oh, kids can just pick up languages and it's hard for adults.

927
00:58:09,182 --> 00:58:10,639
Scott: I've read that that's actually just a myth.

928
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,041
Rym: It's yeah.

929
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,060
Rym: If you're immersed, you start to pick it up like that's going to happen.

930
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,022
Scott: It's you don't.

931
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:18,229
Scott: if you it doesn't matter if you have enough life.

932
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:18,711
Scott: Don't worry.

933
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:21,480
Scott: I mean, if you're so old, you don't have that much life left to live.

934
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,285
Scott: Maybe, you know, I guess.

935
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:26,816
Rym: Do you want to spend your baby to do a little lessons a day instead of one?

936
00:58:27,919 --> 00:58:28,160
Scott: Right.

937
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,042
Scott: Or faster.

938
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:30,282
Scott: Yeah.

939
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:34,709
Scott: But, you know, even at my age, it's like hopefully I have enough life left to live.

940
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,352
Scott: learning on the language.

941
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,195
Scott: It could still be valuable to you.

942
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:41,460
Scott: Don't write it off just because you didn't start early.

943
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:43,826
Rym: All right.

944
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:45,459
Rym: See you next week.

945
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:49,447
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

946
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:54,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

947
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,880
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

948
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,827
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

949
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:07,560
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

951
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,430
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

952
00:59:15,631 --> 00:59:18,520
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

953
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:40,840
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this particular episode of GeekNights are And a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

954
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:47,137
Rym: We talked a little bit about the harmonicas that we both bought and Scott decided to not learn.

955
00:59:47,197 --> 00:59:48,180
Rym: and I decided to learn.

956
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,680
Rym: So I just pulled mine out and I'm just going to play my harmonica really briefly.

957
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,660
Rym: And that's all you're going to get at the end of this episode.
