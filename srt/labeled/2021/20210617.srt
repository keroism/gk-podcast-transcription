1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,648
Rym: It's Thursday, June 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:10,010
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:13,620
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,205
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:19,620
Rym: Tonight we are talking about hotels and motels.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,556
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:34,200
Rym: So PAX Online is coming up in July, but it didn't actually give us that much time to record and upload a panel for that.

8
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:41,560
Scott: The panel acceptance and the due date to submit the panel were very close to each other.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,816
Scott: I think it's like, did you expect us to have this panel prepared before you accepted it?

10
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:46,700
Scott: or like, well, I don't know.

11
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:56,300
Rym: Well, I've realized that most people who do panels for online anythings just get a bunch of people in a zoom, start recording, go for an hour, stop recording.

12
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,195
Rym: And that's what they upload.

13
00:00:58,946 --> 00:00:59,860
Scott: Well, that's not what we're going to do.

14
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:06,340
Scott: Not only is that not what we do, but they specifically asked for people to not do that and to do more.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:06,821
Scott: Yep.

16
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:08,819
Rym: So we actually had to do a lot more.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,660
Rym: And since we still couldn't get together in person yet to get that going, we had to come up with a moderately complex pipeline for me to play Atari games.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,806
Rym: But it seems like it worked.

19
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,080
Rym: But that's why we skipped the show on Tuesday.

20
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,327
Scott: We might be able to get together soon.

21
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,840
Scott: The numbers, at least in New York, are actually down now for real.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,260
Scott: Not like before where it looked like they were down, but now they're really down.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,320
Rym: I am confident the next video the two of us make that is not just this live stream will record it in person.

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,419
Rym: So stay tuned on that.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Rym: But yeah, so we skipped Tuesday, the Tuesday GeekNights to record the panel.

26
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,120
Rym: So I'd have time to edit it because I got to upload that thing like this weekend.

27
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,059
Rym: And that's a shame.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:58,340
Rym: The one time we skip a Tuesday episode as opposed to the other episodes of GeekNights happens to be when not only does Nintendo do their direct, but they announced like fucking everything.

29
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,003
Scott: Mm hmm.

30
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:01,720
Scott: It was a big time Nintendo Direct.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,699
Scott: Well, it was E3, I guess, but who cares about that?

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:20,740
Scott: But yeah, regardless, the Nintendo Direct had all kinds of big time announcements, only one of which was one that was anticipated, which is some more information about Breath of the Wild 2, or at least the sequel to Breath of the Wild.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,520
Rym: There's definitely a midnight Twilight Princess connection with that music and that color.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,925
Scott: Maybe.

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:27,659
Scott: Who knows?

36
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:39,800
Scott: But also the news that everyone thought was going to be right, that all the game journalist places were like, oh, they're going to announce a new updated switch, like a switch plus or a 4K switch or something like that.

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,059
Rym: I know that I was not predicting that because I did not think that's what they were going to do.

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,839
Scott: Well, and then they did not do that.

39
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:51,759
Scott: And then every single I saw two at least two articles that were like, of course, Nintendo wasn't going to say that at E3.

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,685
Scott: Here's why.

41
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,200
Rym: And it's like, oh, yeah, sure.

42
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,654
Scott: You can publish the same journalistic outfit that said they were going to.

43
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,580
Scott: I did not going to bother to go dig up and see.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,420
Scott: But maybe there's a good chance you were.

45
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,500
Rym: I mean, it's much like whenever we can't come up with the show topic, I go delete a show we already did.

46
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:10,559
Rym: And then magically, oh, hey, it turns out we never talked about hotels.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,542
Rym: There's an episode.

48
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,440
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, they could have just done the put up something that was like we were wrong.

49
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:25,700
Rym: Yeah, we do a whole show years ago that was like things we were wrong about, like predictions we made that were just fucking wrong.

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,285
Scott: We could do that.

51
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,196
Scott: We could do that show every day.

52
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,166
Rym: Yeah, we're.

53
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:29,680
Rym: we're wrong moderately often.

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,979
Rym: You know, we're not wrong about often is judging anime by its cover, which we haven't done in a while.

55
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,580
Scott: We're wrong about it more than zero times.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,480
Rym: Yeah, we were definitely wrong about that arm whatever show X arm.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,260
Rym: That show was not what I thought it was going to be anyway.

58
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,260
Scott: I don't remember.

59
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,062
Rym: Yeah.

60
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:53,200
Rym: Anyway, there is there is one bit of news that we think is worth talking about today from that Nintendo announcement.

61
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,764
Rym: Because it was not.

62
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,440
Scott: well, it's not from that Nintendo announcement.

63
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,021
Scott: It was from.

64
00:03:56,542 --> 00:04:03,620
Scott: it was from today, the day after the Nintendo announcement, they announced is going to be a Pokemon MOBA called Pokemon Unite.

65
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:09,680
Scott: And basically the way it's going to work, at least, you know, on paper, it seems interesting.

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,087
Scott: But then again, there was like there were.

67
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,940
Scott: there have been games in the past, like what was a Pokemon Conquest, right?

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Rym: Pokemon Conquest cross Nobunaga's Ambition, Final Fantasy, was called Pokemon Conquest, I forget because it was terrible.

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,860
Scott: Regardless, it was a game that on paper seemed great, but in reality was not.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
Scott: So this game seems similar to me.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,578
Scott: It's give me the same vibes.

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,442
Scott: Pokemon Unite.

73
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:34,200
Scott: It's a MOBA where you have you control a Pokemon, which makes perfect sense for a MOBA, right?

74
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,659
Scott: You start the match at level one.

75
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,191
Rym: You evolve as the match goes on, making a level shit up during.

76
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,840
Scott: Pokemon have four special abilities already.

77
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,140
Scott: So do MOBA characters.

78
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,940
Scott: It's like you can't find a better perfect match than that.

79
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,142
Scott: Right.

80
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:56,740
Scott: And the on paper, the way the game is going to work is that you go around killing environment, you know, stuff and jungling, as the MOBA people call it, right?

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,420
Scott: Fighting AI controlled enemies and also fighting the opponent Pokemon.

82
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:04,200
Scott: And every time you get a kill, you get some points.

83
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:23,760
Scott: And then the interesting part that I really like on paper, again, I had to emphasize that so much, is that in order to actually, you know, cash the points in to make them count, you have to go deep into enemy territory, survive, and I guess touch the equivalent of like a basketball hoop to dunk them in.

84
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,161
Scott: Right.

85
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,780
Scott: It's like, and then they count.

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,280
Scott: And I like, I really like that aspect of go deep into enemy territory because I always felt like when playing, I guess Dota is the one I played more.

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,420
Scott: I didn't really play League of Legends.

88
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,160
Scott: Maybe I did half a tutorial or something.

89
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,860
Rym: Yeah, we did play here for like four hours total.

90
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,380
Scott: Yeah, I played Dota 2, I guess the most, which is a handful of times.

91
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,700
Rym: I think I played more auto chess than I played any MOBA.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,759
Scott: I definitely played more auto chess than any MOBA.

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,999
Rym: Well, talk about a flash in the pan there.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:04,920
Scott: If you go, I would, I was always disappointed in that I would play Dota 2 and often I would be able to get all the way through to the enemy territory, like right up next to what's called the ancient, right?

95
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,319
Scott: The thing you're trying to destroy, the main goal of the game, right?

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,358
Scott: Destroy the thing.

97
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,399
Scott: And I'll be right up next to it.

98
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,080
Scott: And there would be no enemies there except for the little weak AI ones.

99
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,920
Scott: And there was basically no reward for doing that.

100
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:33,680
Rym: Like I'm damn early in the game and I'm already damaging football and I were on offense and you've got the ball and I'm not eligible receiver and I just run all the way to the enemy end zone and hang out there.

101
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:38,480
Scott: I am not rewarded for that, but there is no ball in like I'm damaging it.

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,300
Rym: Like I, you know, I felt I always start kicking the goalposts or attack the ref.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,057
Rym: I don't know.

104
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,180
Scott: No, but it's like there is no having the ball in a MOBA.

105
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,220
Scott: It's like the goal is to just get yourself to destroy the right.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,859
Scott: You are, everyone's a ball basically.

107
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:53,337
Scott: Right.

108
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:54,739
Scott: Or a partial one.

109
00:06:55,181 --> 00:07:02,000
Scott: And I felt like it was like, if you go over there and just start attacking it, it's like you pretty much just die and are ineffectual and it even heals and stuff.

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Scott: It's like, or, you know, you, you do so little damage to it.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,780
Scott: It doesn't matter.

112
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,040
Scott: I felt like that wasn't cool.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,760
Scott: So this actually, I like it, at least on paper that you can go deep in enemy territory is rewarding.

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,480
Rym: There's a lot of ways a game like this could go wrong.

115
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,980
Rym: Oh, so many ways until we know the details.

116
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,528
Rym: The idea of the idea of Pokemon MMO is a very good idea, but execution is literally all that matters.

117
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:35,000
Rym: because for example, Pokemon go was good at a lot of things, but in terms of a game that had mechanics, not much going on.

118
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,020
Scott: It was not.

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,296
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:44,680
Scott: So this is going to be free, at least for some amount of play, which is good because we can all try it.

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:55,440
Rym: But it's a red flag in some ways because games that start free often either have microtransactions or are like bottom tier shovelware and they're free.

122
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,260
Scott: So that is all that is true.

123
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:03,120
Scott: If you consider all video games and Nintendo's history of free games, doesn't follow that path.

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:13,380
Scott: Nintendo's history of free to play games is ones like the Mario Kart or the Mario World, you know, where it's like, okay, it's free to play, but then you're not really playing the full game.

125
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Scott: But then you pay 10 bucks.

126
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:15,800
Scott: It's like, all right, now you have everything.

127
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:22,700
Scott: The only exception to that might be that Animal Crossing mobile game, which was microtransaction-y collecty bits.

128
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:28,860
Scott: But yeah, the game's going to be free on Switch and then mobile, right?

129
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,320
Rym: So it's mobile is intriguing.

130
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:45,360
Scott: Yeah, I don't know that there has been a game that's on Switch and mobile yet, and I assume you'll be able to play against each other, but also suggest that the controls of the game will be very simplified if you're not playing with mouse and keyboard on a PC or whatever.

131
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,839
Rym: So, yeah, we'll see how that goes then.

132
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,920
Rym: That's why I'm hesitant.

133
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:50,780
Scott: It's still very interesting.

134
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,800
Rym: You know, there's a lot going on here.

135
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,220
Rym: And probably by the next time we do a Tuesday show, there'll be a lot more information.

136
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,399
Rym: We can talk about this in more depth.

137
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,599
Scott: I don't think we'll have more information till it comes out.

138
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:00,294
Rym: I don't know.

139
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,168
Rym: I see there's already a little more people have talked about.

140
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,460
Rym: the Pokémon will be grouped into four classes, like Attacker, Speedster, Support all around there.

141
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,600
Scott: Yeah, that was in the main announcement.

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:09,948
Scott: Yep.

143
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:11,840
Rym: So there's a decent amount of info already.

144
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,259
Scott: That's not more.

145
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,240
Rym: That wasn't it.

146
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,119
Rym: That was added to the article I was looking at.

147
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:20,580
Rym: I guess this article is probably being written while this was happening.

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,319
Rym: Anyway, in some other news, there were a bunch of big Supreme Court decisions in the U.S.

149
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:27,580
Rym: today.

150
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,940
Scott: Because like this court session, I just want to make a small comment here because it's Thursday.

151
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,679
Rym: Oh, you got some thoughts about the Supreme Court?

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,340
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, no.

153
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,380
Scott: I got some thoughts about government in general.

154
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:39,160
Scott: All right, all right.

155
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:44,880
Scott: So even government representatives, right, good or bad, are still laborers, right?

156
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Scott: They got to have some time off, you know, in vacation days, PTO, paternal, you know, maternal leaves, all those things.

157
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,140
Scott: Obviously, they deserve just like any other laborer, right?

158
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,659
Scott: You know, making legislating his work, you know, executiving his work.

159
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:58,077
Rym: Yep.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,520
Rym: Especially when you get out of national politics, like a state senator does not get paid much.

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,020
Scott: Right, exactly.

162
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,500
Scott: So, yeah, they should have some time off.

163
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,160
Scott: But for example, right in New York, the legislative session just ended.

164
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,900
Scott: They had like up until there's like a clock ticking.

165
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,219
Scott: And once the time runs out, it's like, that's it.

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,077
Scott: No more laws.

167
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,359
Scott: Try again next time.

168
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:21,660
Scott: Right.

169
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:22,162
Scott: It's like.

170
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,940
Scott: and here we have the Supreme Court of the United States.

171
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,376
Scott: Same thing.

172
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,219
Scott: They had a session.

173
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:34,180
Scott: It's coming to an end, which is why we're getting all these, you know, they're getting all their work out and then they're going to be done until next time.

174
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,620
Scott: And it's like, fucking excuse me, like any of these cases.

175
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:46,980
Scott: It's like, yeah, your individual people don't have to work 24/7, 365, even if your job is super important, like Supreme Court justice.

176
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,500
Scott: But those government institutions need to be open all the fucking time.

177
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,980
Scott: If something happens, the court's got to be ready to make a ruling.

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,020
Scott: If something happens in the middle of the summer, we might need fucking laws.

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,058
Rym: There was also something.

180
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,700
Scott: We shouldn't have any session nonsense.

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,519
Scott: What year is it?

182
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,820
Scott: 18 something where you have to travel all the way from one state to Congress to to be in session and then go back to your own state in a horse and carriage.

183
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,180
Scott: It's like always in session.

184
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,140
Scott: None of these first Congress, second Congress, third Congress.

185
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,579
Scott: It's time to end that shit.

186
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,345
Scott: There's always.

187
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,719
Scott: Congress is always on.

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,695
Scott: So if you're not there, call in your vote, whatever.

189
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,160
Rym: Most of our members of Congress are have spent more time in horse and buggies than they have in cars.

190
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:32,619
Scott: That's true.

191
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:37,000
Scott: But I'm just saying in general, all of these very important government institutions.

192
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,780
Scott: Right.

193
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:38,878
Scott: No more closing.

194
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,560
Scott: It's 2021.

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,580
Rym: So I want to preface this by saying that the Roman Empire may perhaps have been far from an ideal form of government.

196
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,360
Rym: There may have been problems with Rome.

197
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,460
Scott: I'm talking about the specific subject of having sessions.

198
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:10,380
Rym: But at different at some at several points in Roman history, there was this concept that the more powerful a political role was, the more restrictions there were on that person's ability to live their life and do whatever they want.

199
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,160
Rym: Why good.

200
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:26,140
Rym: The idea being, on one hand, if you seek power, it should arguably be made more and more uncomfortable the more power you have so that no one would want that power for necessarily the wrong reasons.

201
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:30,480
Rym: Now, someone might be willing to endure discomfort to have great power anyway.

202
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:32,480
Rym: But there is this concept.

203
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,276
Rym: Imagine if Congress and the presidency were set up such like the president's.

204
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:38,140
Rym: he kind of is this way.

205
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:43,980
Rym: But imagine if Congress, the National Congress, if you're in it, you have to go live in a dorm like your whole family.

206
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,220
Scott: I mean, I mean, we've talked about that before, but like that's even beyond what I'm saying.

207
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:48,542
Scott: Right.

208
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,280
Scott: All I'm saying here is we don't need to have sessions.

209
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:52,864
Scott: Right.

210
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:55,080
Scott: It's just Congress is open every day.

211
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,100
Scott: If you if there's a new law to be proposed today, today, systemic and structural problem here.

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,860
Rym: The problem is members of the House get reelected every two years.

213
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,799
Rym: So they need a lot of time to go campaign.

214
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:08,227
Scott: No, no, no.

215
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,195
Scott: You don't have time for.

216
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:09,800
Scott: no, no, no.

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,508
Scott: You're working.

218
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:11,499
Scott: You have a job.

219
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:12,188
Scott: Right.

220
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:12,880
Scott: No campaigning.

221
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:13,967
Scott: It's not allowed.

222
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,540
Scott: You can campaign from wherever you are.

223
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,901
Scott: Right.

224
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:16,583
Scott: You know.

225
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:22,700
Rym: But they're also structurally expected to spend time in their districts talking to their own people.

226
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:23,963
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:24,385
Scott: You can go.

228
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,398
Scott: You don't have to physically be in Congress for legislating to be on.

229
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,305
Rym: Oh, no.

230
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,298
Rym: Now we get back into the work.

231
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,640
Scott: You know, my work is still working.

232
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,423
Scott: No one's there.

233
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:33,791
Rym: So it's not.

234
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,520
Scott: it's not like we're shutting this thing down.

235
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:36,886
Scott: We can still do.

236
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,440
Scott: the company is still operating.

237
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,880
Rym: You realize that part of this is now a partisan issue.

238
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:49,020
Rym: The Republicans specifically do not want it to be do not want anyone to be able to be in congressional sessions or vote remotely because they want things.

239
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,100
Scott: That's that's a separate issue.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Scott: I'm saying is like, you know, everyone in your whole company goes on vacation.

241
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:54,643
Scott: Right.

242
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,100
Scott: It's like the company doesn't stop operating.

243
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:57,604
Scott: Right.

244
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,220
Scott: It's still doing its business.

245
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,087
Scott: You know, it's like there's.

246
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,820
Scott: no you know, my company doesn't work in sessions.

247
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,182
Scott: Right.

248
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,920
Scott: Even if we get the whole week of like Christmas to New Year's off.

249
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,683
Scott: But you know what?

250
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,240
Scott: We can get new customers during that time, even though everyone is off.

251
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:11,985
Scott: Right.

252
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,380
Scott: It's like we're still operating.

253
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,259
Scott: So even if no one's there because everyone's campaigning or doing other stuff.

254
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:17,923
Scott: Right.

255
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,200
Rym: It's like you realize they are shouldn't be closed.

256
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,380
Rym: In many cases, the like what's going on when they're not in session are things like aides are working on how to draft a particular law.

257
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,340
Scott: Right.

258
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,840
Scott: But I'm like if there was a law that they were like, you know, oh, we couldn't vote on the law in time.

259
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,337
Rym: It's like, oh, no, that's never happened.

260
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,919
Rym: That never actually happens.

261
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,260
Rym: That is only an excuse.

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,520
Rym: The reality is they didn't want to pass that law.

263
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,507
Rym: That's the only reason.

264
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:42,829
Scott: Yes.

265
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,200
Scott: I'm saying remove the excuse.

266
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:44,623
Scott: Right.

267
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:47,080
Scott: It's like, no, you've got all the time to talk about the excuse.

268
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:51,320
Rym: The only thing that actually needs to change is removing the filibuster, make them piss their pants.

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,400
Scott: I'm talking about even in but even in New York State, there's no filibuster in the New York State Assembly.

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,900
Rym: Because the reality is they'd never run out of time.

271
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,600
Rym: There's always a provision to extend the session.

272
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:08,200
Rym: The only reason the session ever ends with with a deadline preventing the passage of a bill is a bill that they were not going to pass anyway.

273
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:08,702
Scott: Right.

274
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,679
Scott: But I'm saying is they don't.

275
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,100
Scott: Why do you even have this time that you're extending?

276
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,520
Scott: Just do away with that entirely.

277
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,799
Scott: There is no end of the session.

278
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,700
Scott: It's like you're in session from the moment you're elected until the moment someone else is elected.

279
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Rym: So anyway, in terms of there is the good Supreme Court decision that did come down is the Supreme Court has yet again shut down challenges to Obamacare.

280
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,160
Scott: This wasn't really like a decision in a case.

281
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,777
Scott: It wasn't one of those ones where they won't hear it.

282
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:35,780
Scott: So therefore.

283
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,900
Rym: No, no, they concluded that the plaintiffs trying to undo the law did not have standing at all.

284
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,660
Rym: So they once again did not rule on the material like complaints.

285
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,479
Scott: But that's usually how it goes.

286
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:00,240
Rym: But in this case, it's interesting because pretty much every lawsuit to try to overturn Obamacare was always introduced by Republicans and was clearly entered in bad faith because they never made a real argument.

287
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,130
Rym: They always made really fiddly procedural arguments.

288
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,980
Rym: that every time the Supreme Court said, nah, that doesn't make sense.

289
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,200
Scott: You've got to wonder who would have standing like who has standing a private insurance company?

290
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,098
Scott: Would they have standing?

291
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,320
Rym: Arguably not, because a private company does not have a right to do business.

292
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:16,781
Scott: Sure.

293
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:24,260
Rym: So it's like who even who could even have said, yeah, you know what, nobody, because every one of those lawsuits was complete horseshit.

294
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,341
Scott: Yeah.

295
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:29,020
Scott: I mean, while those lawsuits were horseshit, that's another thing that's always bothered me.

296
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:34,260
Scott: Is like the idea that you have to have standing or be wronged to bring a case.

297
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,920
Scott: It's like if I'm bringing a case against an individual person because I want damages, then it obviously makes sense to have standing.

298
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,201
Scott: Right.

299
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:49,680
Rym: It's like if you didn't hurt me, why am I so actually that what you're about to argue against is the only reason Obamacare still exists, because the one of the deepest traditions of American.

300
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:49,940
Rym: Yes.

301
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:59,980
Rym: And even to a point, British common law is the idea that you cannot sue someone if you if there is not either redress or harm of some kind.

302
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:00,942
Scott: Yeah.

303
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:06,960
Scott: But I feel like, you know, while it would be harmful to Obamacare in this case, right.

304
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:18,680
Scott: If I see that the government has passed a law and I believe that law is unconstitutional and we've decided to that courts have the ability to rule things unconstitutional, which is something you can debate.

305
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Scott: Which I'm not going to get into here.

306
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,281
Scott: Right.

307
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,800
Scott: So, you know, some people might argue that maybe that was wrong.

308
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,377
Scott: They don't shouldn't be able to do that.

309
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,184
Scott: But if you're going to say that they can do that, then I should be able to.

310
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:42,900
Scott: just any person who is a citizen or is subject to that law should be able, even if they have not been harmed and don't don't seek any way that should just be able to go to court and say, listen, you pass this.

311
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
Scott: I think that law is unconstitutional.

312
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,769
Scott: And I want to argue that it is.

313
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,400
Scott: it doesn't affect me in any way.

314
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,500
Scott: Other than that, I'm subject to that law because I'm a citizen of this country.

315
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,341
Scott: Right.

316
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,740
Scott: I don't need to have that's all the standing you need for for that particular thing.

317
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,180
Rym: Well, we can argue that maybe suing a person, I'm just constitutional challenges should be different.

318
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:06,100
Rym: And in many cases, you could get standing in that case if you could show that that law could have material.

319
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,293
Rym: There's there's a whole complicated.

320
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:07,860
Rym: I'm not a lawyer.

321
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,081
Scott: Right.

322
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:11,199
Scott: But I'm saying even if the law had nothing like nothing the fuck to do with me.

323
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:11,743
Scott: Right.

324
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,039
Scott: It's like all that matters is I'm a citizen in the end.

325
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,384
Scott: Right.

326
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,380
Scott: Therefore, it's a law.

327
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,018
Scott: That's all I need.

328
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,070
Rym: So a consequence clearly not the case, a consequence of that would probably be not.

329
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:28,040
Rym: jobs would be filing lawsuits constantly and sovereign citizens would be a much bigger problem than they are today.

330
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,261
Scott: That's true.

331
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:40,580
Rym: So in this case, it's actually more interesting because the lawsuit was saying that Obamacare was technically a tax and therefore it's unconstitutional.

332
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,760
Rym: It included a tax, but it didn't follow.

333
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,359
Scott: Congress has the power to tax, though.

334
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,999
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to get into why this was.

335
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,120
Rym: It's because they passed it in reconciliation.

336
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,660
Rym: Remember that the Democrats pulled ridiculous shenanigans to pass Obamacare.

337
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:01,660
Rym: So those shenanigans are part of why these lawsuits all came up, because no Republicans would back it and they had to get around the filibuster.

338
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:06,220
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why, like the voting rights law can't do the same shenanigans.

339
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:19,460
Rym: But anyway, so in this case, Congress got around that problem in twenty seventeen by changing the tax if that you would pay if you didn't have insurance to zero dollars.

340
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,279
Rym: So the lawsuit was saying it's tax.

341
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,620
Rym: The Supreme Court ruled a tax of zero dollars is immaterial.

342
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:28,847
Rym: It doesn't make sense.

343
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:29,491
Rym: It's not.

344
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:30,940
Rym: you can't sue if you don't have standing.

345
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,800
Rym: In this case, it's you can't sue about nothing.

346
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:35,366
Rym: Mm hmm.

347
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:36,880
Rym: You can't sue someone in bad faith.

348
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,118
Rym: You can't sue someone for literally nothing.

349
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,880
Rym: So at this point, Obamacare has probably survived.

350
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,440
Rym: And that's good because Obamacare is saving a lot of lives.

351
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,039
Scott: But it's not good enough.

352
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,501
Rym: Nope.

353
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,740
Rym: We need universal health care and the filibuster, et cetera, communism.

354
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,120
Rym: But anyway, the ruling that was what about the bad, the bad ruling, the bad ruling, probably the worst ruling.

355
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,619
Rym: So I'm going to super summarize this.

356
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:19,180
Rym: Basically, the Philadelphia wanted to exclude one foster care organization from the organizations that it works with and supports to get orphans into foster homes or children who are taken away from abusive parents into foster homes.

357
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,900
Scott: So so the state of Philadelphia gets has some children, right?

358
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,140
Scott: Children that have, you know, been, you know, for whatever reason, lost their been orphaned somehow.

359
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,426
Rym: Whatever they want to.

360
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,579
Rym: They want to put this child in a foster home.

361
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:34,500
Scott: And the state doesn't have a state place to put the city, right?

362
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,125
Rym: Philadelphia.

363
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,100
Scott: So the city doesn't have a city orphanage, right?

364
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,880
Scott: They have other foster organizations they work with to bring the children to.

365
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:58,400
Rym: So because there is a Catholic organization that they work with, could work with, but that organization will not in any way allow a non-straight family to adopt a kid.

366
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,520
Rym: They exclude anyone who is gay.

367
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:01,996
Scott: OK.

368
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,800
Rym: Like, full stop, it is just blatantly discriminatory.

369
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,660
Rym: They get away with this because they're a religious organization.

370
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:17,440
Rym: Philadelphia said, well, you're welcome to keep existing under your First Amendment rights, but we will not work with you because that is discriminatory.

371
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Rym: The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Philadelphia cannot refuse to work with them on the basis of that discrimination because that discrimination is a protected religious right.

372
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:30,720
Scott: Well, that's just 100 percent wrong.

373
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,001
Rym: Yep.

374
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:34,740
Rym: It was a unanimous decision because America is terrible.

375
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,840
Rym: I don't know what to say about it.

376
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,020
Scott: So in that case, you're basically saying that the let me just take that to its extreme.

377
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:44,619
Rym: Oh, the extreme is actually exactly what the Republicans are shooting for here.

378
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:53,040
Scott: Well, OK, so the extreme is that I create the Scott's Satanist orphanage and it's like Philadelphia.

379
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,780
Scott: I have created an orphanage and I am following all the standards for, you know, an orphanage.

380
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:59,043
Scott: Right.

381
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,300
Scott: It's like I'm taking care of the children.

382
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,358
Scott: Well, right, et cetera, et cetera.

383
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,200
Scott: In my Satanist pagan orphanage, you because I exist, you must send children to me.

384
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:10,619
Scott: You have no choice.

385
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:12,699
Scott: You just know you can't discriminate against me.

386
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,321
Scott: You have to.

387
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:22,560
Scott: The government is now forced to do business with this organization because I have created it and there is no way to discriminate against my organization because the Supreme Court said so.

388
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,219
Scott: So now I can set up businesses.

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,342
Scott: Right.

390
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,720
Scott: That and the government must do business with me.

391
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,565
Scott: No bidding needed.

392
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:31,160
Scott: I just had to be within have no other reason.

393
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:39,540
Scott: Legitimate reason, you know, that I guess, you know, discrimination is a legitimate reason, obviously, morally, but not legally, according to the Supreme Court today.

394
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:43,720
Scott: So well, the real force the government to send me children.

395
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:52,760
Rym: We do have no choice or Church of Satan type things to fight this because the real end game here is a long term, like decade long strategy.

396
00:22:53,281 --> 00:23:09,878
Rym: You've probably seen a lot of news about this recently where Republicans are increasingly using the First Amendment and religious freedom to ensure that closely held, terrible, violent racist beliefs can be protected under the First Amendment so that organizations that are ostensibly religious

397
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:10,579
Scott: can basically

398
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,400
Rym: do whatever the fuck they want.

399
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:20,940
Rym: And that is how conservatives are going to try to get around anti-discrimination laws, that if we ever get rid of the filibuster, we can start passing more frequently.

400
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:25,700
Rym: And it's another fundamental flaw of America that I don't know how we fix.

401
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,420
Rym: This is a terrible ruling.

402
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:35,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean, my interpretation, right, if I was the judge would be like, look, you know, freedom of speech, it's the First Amendment.

403
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:37,280
Scott: You can go around saying.

404
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,441
Rym: No, no, no.

405
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:43,300
Rym: Remember, the First Amendment also specifically includes freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of all these other things.

406
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,818
Rym: Speech was not the issue here.

407
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:53,960
Scott: Yes, freedom of religion, meaning you are free to light your menorah and read your Bible and, you know, practice your religion.

408
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:54,760
Scott: Right.

409
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,664
Scott: But in this case, right, not.

410
00:23:56,744 --> 00:24:04,360
Scott: choosing to, you know, giving children to a foster home is not a religious practice that you are free to do.

411
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,740
Scott: It is something that you are choosing.

412
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,680
Rym: I would go one step further.

413
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Rym: The real solution to this is there shouldn't be as such thing as a religious organization.

414
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,947
Rym: Any church should be.

415
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,720
Rym: it should just have to be a nonprofit or a for profit.

416
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:17,790
Rym: They could be for profit.

417
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,699
Rym: I'm totally fine with that.

418
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,520
Rym: Just regulated like any other company.

419
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,620
Rym: No exception.

420
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,561
Scott: I mean, I never.

421
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:38,200
Scott: I also never understood that if we have separation of church and state, then, you know, the fact that religious organizations have any special difference between it from any other organization, I would say the government should also not be allowed to work with any religious organization for any purpose.

422
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,760
Scott: Yeah, because that's not separation of church and state.

423
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,180
Rym: And it would be fair if they just said we will not work with any religious group.

424
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,925
Rym: Full stop.

425
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:45,999
Scott: Yeah, period.

426
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,919
Scott: I wonder if Philadelphia did that.

427
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,600
Scott: You know, they might have a shortage of places to send orphans.

428
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,320
Rym: That's a big problem here.

429
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,221
Rym: Yeah.

430
00:24:56,582 --> 00:25:00,760
Scott: Well, part of this is because the book would they get away, but would they get away with it if they did that?

431
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:04,780
Scott: They decided only secular places.

432
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:14,700
Rym: The Catholic Church is so big and runs so many different charities and things that this ruling is dangerous, dangerous for a lot of reasons, because a lot of places don't have other organizations local they could work with.

433
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:26,040
Scott: But it's like, you know, in this case, right, Philadelphia is saying we're going to allow children to go to like, you know, the Jewish orphanage, the Muslim orphanage, you know, the other Christian orphanage, the Protestant one, but not that Catholic one.

434
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:26,582
Scott: Right.

435
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:30,980
Scott: And I think that's just, you know, there is, I guess, a legal argument for that being right.

436
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:36,880
Scott: But if Philadelphia just said no religious orphanages, that might fly, maybe.

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,284
Scott: I don't know.

438
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:37,770
Scott: Not a lawyer.

439
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:38,520
Scott: I'm just guessing.

440
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,420
Rym: Yeah.

441
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:53,160
Rym: Basically, this law, this ruling is going to make it a lot easier for private organizations to cite that they have a religious or spiritual or personal belief and then refuse clients and discriminate openly and get around every anti-discrimination law.

442
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,000
Rym: This is a big slippery slope.

443
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:56,202
Scott: Right.

444
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:59,200
Scott: Until the government gets his shit together, if that ever happens.

445
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,561
Scott: Right.

446
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:05,600
Scott: I think the thing that we can do is like I was in my Satan orphanage example is to weaponize the reverse.

447
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:06,808
Scott: Right.

448
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:07,553
Scott: Come up with.

449
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,319
Scott: it's been successful.

450
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,717
Rym: The church of Satan that that is successfully forced.

451
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,185
Scott: It has other issues.

452
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,139
Scott: The actual organization church of Satan.

453
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,620
Rym: Well, there's a good satanic church and there's the kind of fucked up one.

454
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,360
Rym: I forget which one is which every time.

455
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,579
Scott: But regardless, you just come up with things you can do that are good.

456
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:28,442
Scott: Right.

457
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:32,680
Scott: That are and may decide that those are your religious beliefs.

458
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:33,389
Scott: Right.

459
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,998
Scott: Good things.

460
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,319
Scott: The trans rights of human rights.

461
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,440
Rym: That's my religious belief.

462
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,000
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,243
Scott: And be like, you know, that's.

464
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:49,280
Scott: and then when they come to get you, you can cite these cases and be like, no, you know, it's like we give our orphan kids.

465
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:56,300
Scott: We only give them to two families with at least, you know, with one non straight, you know, parent or whatever.

466
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:56,561
Scott: Right.

467
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,393
Scott: And it's like you have to give us children.

468
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,960
Rym: I'd say if the Catholic Church is hiring someone for a job in the church, they can't require that person be Catholic.

469
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,428
Rym: That would be discriminatory.

470
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,799
Rym: I would say that's how it should go.

471
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,299
Scott: You could you know, why would you want to work there?

472
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,043
Rym: Yeah.

473
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,300
Rym: Well, I mean, why do you want to work there?

474
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,300
Rym: A lot of people have jobs because they need to eat because capitalism has destroyed the world.

475
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:18,262
Scott: Right.

476
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:23,060
Rym: Anyway, the only the fundamental problem is still we have to undo the filibuster.

477
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,080
Rym: So I'm curious, one, do any of you listening to this live in West Virginia?

478
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,963
Rym: I'm just curious.

479
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,919
Rym: I would not be surprised if we have zero listeners in West Virginia.

480
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,119
Scott: Is there people in West Virginia?

481
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
Rym: It's the whitest state in America.

482
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,902
Rym: Like, it's terrifying.

483
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:44,779
Rym: But, too, if you do live in West Virginia, call Joe Manchin every goddamn day because you are literally the only people on earth who he will listen to.

484
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:48,659
Rym: And you and you have undue influence over the world right now.

485
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,960
Rym: So if you live there, call that motherfucker every goddamn day.

486
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,837
Scott: Pretend to live there?

487
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,500
Rym: No, they actually verify that pretty well.

488
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:06,840
Rym: And a lot of politicians will use data showing that people who are not their constituents are calling them as an excuse to pointedly ignore and say that, oh, my constituents are with me.

489
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,837
Rym: These people are all fake.

490
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:15,700
Scott: We can maybe find a way to impersonate and convince you because you're just calling on a phone number.

491
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,081
Scott: Right.

492
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:19,800
Scott: You know, we somehow convinced them that we're actually the constituents.

493
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,258
Rym: I called what's his name upstate because I bought my cell phones in the area code and shoot him out a while ago.

494
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,640
Rym: Anyway, last little bit of news.

495
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,500
Rym: I don't know if you noticed, but Batman was trending nationally on Twitter.

496
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:40,540
Rym: And what I love about this is that it was one of those situations where I saw people reacting to something but didn't see the thing.

497
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,140
Scott: But based on the reaction, I saw the reactions well before I saw the thing.

498
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,080
Rym: But the reactions I saw at first confused me more and actually drove me to where I wanted to know what the real deal was.

499
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,178
Rym: It's pretty easy to figure out.

500
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,424
Rym: Basically, experience.

501
00:28:55,966 --> 00:29:00,880
Rym: DC has a policy saying that heroes cannot perform cuddlingus.

502
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,698
Rym: Only villains can.

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,540
Rym: Like kind of literally you can read this article.

504
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:15,860
Rym: I don't know what else to say about that, except there is only one part of Batman that is exposed in his entire goddamn costume.

505
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,600
Rym: I feel like that's for a reason.

506
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,135
Rym: And I feel like DC is wrong here.

507
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:29,119
Scott: Yeah, if you want to know more about superheroes and sexuality, there's a Twitter account called I don't know if we talked about this on the show, the Claremont Run.

508
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:37,400
Scott: So pretty much the the X-Men comics that you care about are is the Claremont Run, which is, you know, Dark Phoenix Saga, right?

509
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,759
Scott: All those those those X-Men comics, right?

510
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,700
Scott: Mostly written by Claremont, right?

511
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,479
Scott: John Claremont, who is a very cool person.

512
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:50,880
Scott: And there's someone in Canada who's basically working at like a university and got a grant or whatever.

513
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:56,820
Scott: And their whole thing is studying the Claremont Run, like deep, deep diving.

514
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:00,600
Scott: And every single day in the morning, they post a Twitter thread.

515
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,600
Scott: They also have videos on their YouTube channel like that.

516
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,860
Scott: Like they're just nonstop like they never run out of things to say about it.

517
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:17,520
Scott: And of course, since it's X-Men, there is a lot of commentary about sexuality and, you know, people wearing underwear outside the rest of their clothes.

518
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:26,560
Scott: And so if you read that right, you'll have a very good understanding of, you know, angles on pretty much every other.

519
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:30,199
Scott: Character who wears underwear on the outside of their clothes, like Batman and Superman.

520
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:37,880
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

521
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,880
Rym: So I try not to reuse channels because, you know, that's the thing.

522
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,900
Rym: Like, I like Scott, we could just do lock picking Laura like every goddamn week forever or tech mode or any one of those channels.

523
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,959
Rym: But Joel Haver is a gentleman and he has made like some fantastic YouTube content.

524
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:00,660
Rym: Remember that animation of the adventure guy going off, like that kind of thing.

525
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,560
Rym: But this video, it's topical to our show topic tonight.

526
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,860
Rym: It is entitled Dad's Checking Into Their Hotel Room.

527
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,880
Rym: Not only do I find this hilarious, but when I saw this video, me and Emily were sitting on the couch.

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,559
Rym: We were like watching it before we watched our real show.

529
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,840
Rym: And when they get to the point of looking at the paintings, Emily just looks at me and starts laughing.

530
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,080
Rym: And she's like, this is you and Scott.

531
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,539
Rym: Every time we check into a fucking hotel.

532
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,007
Rym: Every time.

533
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:26,237
Rym: Maybe it kind of is.

534
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,943
Rym: This is us.

535
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,240
Rym: This say, look at this painting over here.

536
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,210
Rym: Oh, look at that.

537
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:33,979
Rym: This is a museum.

538
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,880
Rym: Hey, it's a pool in this building.

539
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:36,664
Rym: Hey, yo.

540
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:38,560
Scott: Some of it's us.

541
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,287
Scott: Some of it's not.

542
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,299
Rym: Yeah, some of it's not us.

543
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,840
Rym: It's definitely it's adjacent to how we how we interact with hotels.

544
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,707
Scott: Oh, okay.

545
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,100
Scott: I mean, I found I realized that I sent you my link for the thing of the day, but it wasn't there.

546
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,216
Scott: So here, here and here it is.

547
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,960
Scott: OK, so somebody who is this person ZZainhip on GitHub has made something really amazing.

548
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,541
Scott: Right.

549
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:07,620
Scott: So when it comes to old computers, right, we can generally emulate them.

550
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,840
Scott: And, you know, the interface for them is keyboard, maybe mouse.

551
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:11,183
Scott: Right.

552
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:13,160
Scott: So you can get a mount monitor.

553
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:18,180
Scott: And even though you don't have a CRT, you can get a pretty close approximation of old computer.

554
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:18,864
Scott: Right.

555
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,980
Scott: Or old, old game console.

556
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,903
Scott: You emulate that.

557
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:26,460
Scott: you can get a pretty close approximation of old game console by emulating it.

558
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:26,740
Scott: Right.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,782
Scott: Yeah.

560
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:38,140
Scott: If you want to emulate old smartphone, you can't really, you know, get a great approximation unless you do it on the smartphone.

561
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:38,862
Scott: Right.

562
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:43,360
Scott: It's like and specifically, you know, let's say you want to do it.

563
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:44,471
Scott: It's only 10.

564
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:45,280
Scott: You know, how old is it?

565
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,109
Scott: Fourteen years old.

566
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,880
Scott: The first iPhone.

567
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,221
Scott: Right.

568
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:57,800
Scott: If you want to experience iPhone one or, you know, the first iPhone 3G as it was in 2008 or whatever, it's without actually getting one of those phones.

569
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,018
Scott: That's hard to do.

570
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:05,260
Scott: There's no way I know to downgrade a phone once it's been and a lot of them got updated to newer iOS versions over time.

571
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:14,660
Scott: And even if you emulate it, you you're not emulating it on a full touch screen device like, you know, it's not very.

572
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:17,040
Scott: So this person did something really amazing.

573
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:19,659
Scott: They created an iPhone app.

574
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,300
Scott: You can't buy in the app store.

575
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,660
Scott: You would need to like, you know, use the typical shenanigans to get it onto your phone.

576
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:29,200
Scott: But it's an iPhone app written in Swift.

577
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,001
Scott: Right.

578
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:31,184
Scott: So it's really.

579
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:37,960
Scott: if you look at the source code, the open source source code for this app, you can learn a lot about programming for the iPhone.

580
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:44,456
Scott: And it's basically you open this app and the app is the old iPhone.

581
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:53,013
Scott: So it's like you're going to be if you installed this on your phone, you'd be sitting there looking at iOS 14, 15, whatever.

582
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,960
Scott: you open the app and suddenly you're looking at iOS one.

583
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,380
Scott: And all the apps in there mostly work.

584
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,860
Scott: And it's very close to pixel perfect compared to the original iPhones.

585
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:09,460
Scott: It's really quite astonishing what they managed to accomplish here.

586
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Scott: So I'm liking this.

587
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:23,840
Scott: Like, you know, I think that would actually be a really cool is like if instead of like opening VirtualBox and then running Windows 95, if you just literally had Windows 95.exe and you double clicked on it and you ran it full screen.

588
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:24,991
Scott: And there you go.

589
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,000
Scott: It's Windows 95.

590
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Scott: That's not an emulator.

591
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,099
Scott: It's just an app.

592
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,907
Scott: Right.

593
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:31,560
Scott: So that's what this is.

594
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,659
Scott: It's pretty awesome, actually.

595
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,862
Scott: And I like that.

596
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:41,158
Scott: it's preserving something that has a higher chance, I think, of being lost because who was thinking about preserving that?

597
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,219
Scott: because it doesn't feel that old.

598
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:50,380
Scott: But actually it is in bad need of preserving because how many iPhone ones and three G's are out there that are still working and not too many.

599
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:51,141
Rym: Yeah.

600
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:59,300
Rym: And especially imagine 30, 40, 50 years ago, this will be important for researchers and historians, this kind of information, just like with video game preservation.

601
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:09,960
Scott: Also, I didn't realize, like, you know, you tend to have this like Windows 95 is like this UI and this experience that's like really baked in to, you know, in my life or whatever.

602
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,561
Scott: Right.

603
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:17,720
Scott: And the minds of people who used it that I had an iPhone three G, but then I upped only for two years, then had iPhone four and then had iPhone five.

604
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,381
Scott: Right.

605
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:28,620
Scott: And so I didn't stick, you know, but so it wasn't like baked into my life experience, this old UI that, you know, was completely different from what we have now with its.

606
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,219
Scott: You know, what, what did they call it?

607
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,464
Scott: The what's the word for it?

608
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:36,360
Scott: where you make stuff that looks like real materials, the air sets.

609
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,139
Scott: No, I said word.

610
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:41,429
Rym: I'm not sure what.

611
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,259
Scott: No, what the hell is that word?

612
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:44,245
Rym: I'm not sure.

613
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:46,020
Scott: Someone someone out there is yelling the word.

614
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:52,440
Scott: You know, it's when you when you design like you're making an app and you make like what it looks like wood, even though it's software.

615
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:52,985
Scott: Right.

616
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:54,017
Scott: You know, that kind of thing.

617
00:35:55,722 --> 00:36:00,140
Scott: But anyway, that's what iPhone one, you know, iPhone three G, that's the UI they had.

618
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,481
Scott: Right.

619
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:03,480
Scott: And I didn't realize, like, how I had forgotten it.

620
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,900
Rym: And as soon as I saw it, I was like, whoa, I realized I was thinking back because my first smartphone was actually a Palm device.

621
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:18,380
Rym: I cannot remember what anything looked like in that entire UI, except the integrated chat stream.

622
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Rym: The one good thing that Palm had, where my communications with a person across all the apps would be in one stream.

623
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,680
Scott: Oh, skeuomorphic, skeuomorphic design.

624
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:29,814
Rym: OK, OK, OK.

625
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:30,259
Scott: Yeah.

626
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Rym: Anyway, anyway, in the moment, we're going to be live at PAX East online twenty twenty one with a brand new panel.

627
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,339
Rym: That wallet is the same topic.

628
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,020
Scott: Is it actually brand new, though?

629
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,600
Rym: Well, it's a totally different new slide deck with new talking points.

630
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,360
Rym: And it is also a completely different set of Atari games.

631
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,120
Rym: So back in twenty sixteen, we did a panel and we did this in a few counts.

632
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,680
Rym: It was pretty popular called Atari Game Design, where we talk about Atari Game Design a little bit.

633
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,459
Rym: We did a thing and then we just play multiplayer Atari games and go deep into their crap.

634
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,757
Scott: We did this one time, I think.

635
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,639
Rym: No, we did it three times.

636
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,500
Scott: I remember doing it zero.

637
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:13,580
Scott: It feels like it's like, let's do this panel again.

638
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:14,119
Scott: And I'm like, what?

639
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:21,060
Rym: I think the difference is because I do the producer work for GeekNights, like I manage our appearances, schedule and all that.

640
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:24,180
Rym: So I have a little local database of every panel we've ever done.

641
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,592
Rym: And also I get the stats like this is one of the panels we uploaded to YouTube in twenty sixteen.

642
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:31,320
Rym: that gets consistently watched to this day a lot.

643
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Rym: It was also one of the few panels we did that filled the room every time we did it.

644
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:48,199
Rym: So there was a big energy in the room that we often don't get now because very few panels that are giving something away fill up at pretty much any convention anymore, giving away something or announcing some AAA property.

645
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,200
Rym: But anyway, this version of the panel talks about a different area of the game design.

646
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:04,980
Rym: And we focus on single player games and especially the demake or degraded version of arcade games that were ported to the twenty six hundred.

647
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,960
Rym: So this will never have been seen before.

648
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,680
Rym: It's like 90 percent new content.

649
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,445
Rym: It'll be at one forty five p.m.

650
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:16,140
Rym: Eastern Time on Saturday, July 17th in the PAX to Twitch stream.

651
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:18,300
Rym: And we'll be hanging out in the PAX discord.

652
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,780
Rym: If you have any questions, discord, discord.

653
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,800
Scott: Oh, it's going to be on Twitch.

654
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,300
Rym: OK, we'll be on Twitch, but I will find the Twitch chat and the discord chat.

655
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:28,540
Rym: And I assume there's a YouTube stream that maybe I'll hang out in.

656
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:28,901
Rym: We'll see.

657
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:32,357
Scott: I'm up in other meta, right?

658
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,625
Scott: Other conventions.

659
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,460
Scott: so far, we don't know if and when they're happening.

660
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:37,908
Scott: Right.

661
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:38,419
Scott: For sure.

662
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:47,000
Scott: But I just want to reiterate that we are having a policy here at GeekNights of if a convention is safe to have.

663
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,180
Scott: Obviously, we want to go to a convention, right?

664
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
Scott: I haven't been to a convention in forever.

665
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,596
Scott: I want to go to a convention and play board games all day.

666
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:53,059
Scott: real bad.

667
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,860
Scott: But if a convention is going to require masks.

668
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:57,605
Scott: All right.

669
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,180
Scott: I'm not saying that's a bad idea.

670
00:38:59,461 --> 00:38:59,642
Scott: Right.

671
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:03,640
Scott: It's like obviously masks are good and you have safety precautions.

672
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:04,703
Rym: Right.

673
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:08,180
Scott: But if you know the analogy, I just keep going back to.

674
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:11,240
Scott: Is someone so confident that plane is safe?

675
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,800
Scott: Why are they telling me that I have to wear a parachute at all times?

676
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,860
Scott: It's like I just won't get on that plane.

677
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,280
Scott: It's like maybe you want to get on that plane.

678
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:20,245
Scott: OK, right.

679
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,580
Scott: The parachute is going to help you increase safety.

680
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:23,147
Scott: Right.

681
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:23,899
Scott: I'm sure.

682
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:28,199
Scott: But if you tell me the plane is safe, you're so confident in it.

683
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:30,900
Scott: Why are you making everyone wear a parachute at all times?

684
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:32,800
Scott: Is it really safe to get on that plane?

685
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:34,419
Scott: I've lost confidence now.

686
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:44,400
Scott: So if you tell me the convention is safe, but you're having limited attendance and you're having masks required, then any social rules inside of the convention.

687
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:45,542
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:52,741
Scott: It's like, well, maybe you're not so confident or maybe a someone's forcing those restrictions on you against your will, in which case, OK, you got to do what you got to do.

689
00:39:53,463 --> 00:40:03,880
Scott: But B, if you don't think it's safe enough to hold the convention at the normal capacity with no restrictions, you know, as before, then clearly there is a danger.

690
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,168
Scott: And I'm just not going to.

691
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:11,920
Scott: I'm going to choose not to go to that convention, which means there's going to be a time period clearly where people are going.

692
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,720
Scott: People who run conventions need money like Otakot is happening.

693
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:18,600
Rym: It's a mask required, limited capacity, socially distance event.

694
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:20,238
Rym: That sounds like a nightmare.

695
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:21,362
Scott: Right.

696
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:21,543
Scott: Yep.

697
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:34,280
Scott: So from now for the next month's year, who knows how long there is going to be a period where conventions are happening, but that they have various restrictions that, you know, limit attendance, require masks, do other sorts of things.

698
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,300
Scott: We're not going to those conventions.

699
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:41,743
Scott: We're going to go to conventions in person again when they are as they were in twenty nineteen.

700
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:44,680
Scott: Just as many people as the fire marshal allows.

701
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:46,720
Scott: No masks, no nonsense.

702
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:49,139
Scott: You just come as normal by a badge and show up.

703
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,421
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:52,040
Scott: Then you'll see us at physical cons again.

705
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,720
Scott: Until then, online cons only.

706
00:40:55,322 --> 00:41:00,365
Scott: If they stop having the online cons in favor of the limited in-person ones, we're just not going to be at cons.

707
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:05,996
Rym: Or maybe we'll do that time to do the thing that I'm not going to actually say out loud because then we might shit talk it.

708
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,507
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

709
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:11,420
Rym: I'm thinking about that thing a lot, but I like it like seriously.

710
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,182
Scott: So, yeah.

711
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:15,820
Scott: So, you know, this, you know, just letting our policy be known in advance.

712
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:17,760
Scott: I don't see us changing our minds on this.

713
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:23,386
Scott: So if you're wondering if we're going to be at a convention or not, just refer to this statement.

714
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:25,037
Rym: If the convention has a mask policy.

715
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:31,879
Scott: If you hear an announcement of a convention happening, just look at what they announce and you'll figure out if we're going to be there or not.

716
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,261
Scott: Yep.

717
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,260
Rym: Otherwise, check us out on the Internet.

718
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,959
Rym: The Book Club book is the tale of Genji.

719
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:37,800
Rym: I stopped making progress.

720
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,487
Scott: I read a couple more.

721
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:39,280
Scott: I read a couple more chapters.

722
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,280
Rym: I got to catch up then because I did not read it for the past week because I've been busy.

723
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:44,380
Scott: I read a really hella long chapter.

724
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,500
Rym: I'm confident by the end of July we'll probably do this Book Club book.

725
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,141
Scott: We'll see.

726
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:56,878
Scott: I still have maybe like I think there were 50 something chapters and I may be around 10, maybe 20 percent.

727
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,510
Rym: I'll hedge.

728
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,500
Rym: August, definitely.

729
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:01,206
Scott: We'll see.

730
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:02,900
Rym: We don't make it by August, what the fuck?

731
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,121
Scott: We'll see.

732
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:11,020
Rym: So a thing that we do a lot and I've been doing even more.

733
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,020
Rym: I mean, obviously, COVID made this weird.

734
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,759
Rym: We're just not going to talk about COVID times in this.

735
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,320
Rym: But in my life, I have stayed in a terrifying number and variety of hotels and motels.

736
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,120
Rym: They have been a huge part of my life as a kid growing up, as an adult, in business, going to conventions.

737
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,880
Rym: The kind of work I do means that I do a lot of business traveling.

738
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:35,960
Rym: So I end up staying in a lot of hotels of varying quality all around the world.

739
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Rym: And somehow we've never talked about this.

740
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,920
Rym: We've always talked about everything else around travel, but not the hotels themselves.

741
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,320
Scott: Yeah, so I mean, hotels are actually really fascinating.

742
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,920
Scott: I don't I am not an expert on the history of hotels.

743
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:55,760
Scott: So if someone is and wants to research it, or maybe I'll research it on my own later, please correct me on everything I'm about to say, because it's probably wrong.

744
00:42:56,621 --> 00:43:04,639
Scott: But the way that I've interpreted the history of hotels is that in the olden times, you'd have the inn, the taverns, like D&D or whatever, right?

745
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:06,260
Scott: Slayer, right?

746
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,760
Scott: You know, because traveling was traveling was very difficult, right?

747
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:19,400
Scott: And so how many people were really in your town who didn't live there, you know, that weren't staying with someone they knew in the town, right?

748
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:19,821
Scott: Yep.

749
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:24,647
Rym: You know, in the old days, you'd stop, any traveler would have to stop in a lot of towns along the way.

750
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,260
Scott: They had to stop in a lot of towns.

751
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,720
Scott: You know, if you're going really far, you know, you can't make it that far in one day.

752
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,378
Scott: You pretty much just stop every town, right?

753
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,680
Scott: You're going to maybe make it one town in one day.

754
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:34,916
Scott: Who knows how far apart they are?

755
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,559
Scott: You might even have to like camp between towns, right?

756
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,202
Scott: Yeah.

757
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:42,402
Scott: So, you know, they'd just be renting a few rooms above the tavern would be enough for that.

758
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,778
Rym: I know there was a lot of common room stuff where people could.

759
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:52,380
Rym: basically a lot of small towns would have a tavern that would just sort of stay open or a town hall that would just be open to travelers at night.

760
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,880
Scott: I'm curious about what hotels were like in a place like Rome, like a big city, right?

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,150
Scott: People travel to Rome.

762
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,360
Scott: where, you know, what would they stay in?

763
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:04,320
Rym: So from what I know, shockingly close to a modern hotel in surprising ways.

764
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,440
Scott: That's unsurprising, actually.

765
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:06,924
Scott: Yeah.

766
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:07,456
Scott: Just, you know.

767
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Rym: Well, because humans are the same humans now that they were then like they had the same ideas and a lot of the same needs.

768
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:24,703
Scott: Now, I know from movies, which obviously movies aren't, you know, nonfiction most of the time, but, you know, they're generally representing the world as it is for the people at the time.

769
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:32,620
Scott: And I know from watching a lot of movies, especially from the early 20th century and from just common sense, that traveling even then was still difficult.

770
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,180
Scott: Right.

771
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:43,538
Scott: You know, the airplanes didn't come about quite so that early, especially not commercial jets, not until a little bit later, you know, mid later 20th century, where they even accessible to a lot of people.

772
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:47,220
Scott: So, you know, you're going by boats, cars, right?

773
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,519
Scott: So you weren't traveling that far at once.

774
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:56,759
Scott: And if you did travel somewhere like, let's see, once you get up on a boat, it's like you're staying there a while.

775
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,669
Scott: You're not just turning around for a quick trip to London in three days and getting on another boat home.

776
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:03,460
Scott: Right.

777
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,180
Scott: You'll spend, you know, weeks on the boat.

778
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Scott: You're spending weeks in Europe.

779
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:11,200
Scott: So a hotel was a place that someone would be like could be living for quite a while.

780
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,998
Scott: You know, you could be like living there.

781
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:14,390
Scott: Right.

782
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,280
Scott: And you watch old movies.

783
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:25,707
Rym: A lot of really rich people will just they might have a house somewhere or multiple homes, but they will like a lot of fancy hotels will have floors that a rich person just lives in.

784
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:26,739
Rym: Yeah.

785
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,340
Scott: People still let people live in hotels.

786
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,002
Scott: Absolutely.

787
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:33,742
Scott: All around the world there, you know, people are in that situation, but for different reasons.

788
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:42,260
Scott: But yeah, you know, back in the olden days, a hotel was like a place that like a rich person, you know, would live in for quite a period.

789
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,081
Scott: Right.

790
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,631
Scott: You know, during while they were traveling and the hotel had all kinds of services.

791
00:45:47,651 --> 00:45:48,039
Scott: Right.

792
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,800
Scott: To, you know, cater to this person who is, you know, living there.

793
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,780
Scott: You watch a movie, you know, like Grand Budapest Hotel is like those.

794
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,803
Scott: That was a thing.

795
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:57,587
Scott: You know, like think

796
00:45:57,627 --> 00:46:11,858
Rym: about the imagine a world before Internet and smartphones and video games and you're traveling and you like stay in some town for a week for some trade convention, got to like be able to receive mail, got to be able to like get calls forwarded to you.

797
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:15,460
Rym: There's a lot of stuff you needed to just be like, how are you going to get entertained?

798
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,758
Rym: Just go out every night.

799
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,574
Scott: Yeah, so you like we were book.

800
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:21,740
Scott: club book was once Rebecca.

801
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:22,203
Scott: Right.

802
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:25,139
Scott: That book begins with them in a hotel that they're living in.

803
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:25,685
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:26,759
Scott: That's the whole setup.

805
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:33,260
Scott: But yet you can see that like the vestiges of that hotel sort of thing.

806
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:34,122
Scott: Right.

807
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:41,011
Scott: That that, you know, dynamic of place that a person lives for somewhat, maybe a long period.

808
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:41,579
Scott: Right.

809
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,619
Scott: Represented even in just like a tiny holiday in on the highway somewhere on I-95.

810
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:48,680
Scott: Right.

811
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:52,094
Scott: You know, there's a concierge who is there to, you know, this.

812
00:46:52,476 --> 00:47:05,357
Scott: the desk can still provide all kinds of services to the people living there, even though they're probably there for one night and then they're on their way, you know, like laundry and, you know, oh, you don't have a toothbrush or just all kinds of things like.

813
00:47:05,377 --> 00:47:09,093
Scott: they're providing all these services to you because they're.

814
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,880
Scott: it's the same hospitality business.

815
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,520
Scott: There's a restaurant, there's room service.

816
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,569
Scott: They can bring food to you.

817
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:14,879
Scott: Just add you push a button.

818
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:27,150
Rym: Of course, a lot of this got changed, especially in America, by the sort of destruction of the middle class, the same reason why there's cheap, crappy plane tickets and far too expensive, ludicrous plane tickets and nothing in between.

819
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:36,020
Rym: hotels went the same route in that most people would stay in whatever hotel was cheapest and didn't care at all about the accommodations or the amenities.

820
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:51,440
Rym: And especially with the advent of smartphones and tablets and wireless Internet, suddenly one of the primary revenue sources of hotels in America selling people pay per view and movies and pornography disappeared overnight.

821
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,615
Rym: Everyone just had their own.

822
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,526
Scott: Mm hmm.

823
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:57,299
Scott: You know, they have Wi-Fi, but you can't be getting away selling the Wi-Fi.

824
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:04,842
Rym: They tried to sell the Wi-Fi, but it's like, no, it has to be selling the Wi-Fi works for a brief period where people didn't have high bandwidth on their smartphones and tethering yet.

825
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,300
Scott: Yep, that's true.

826
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:09,937
Rym: I paid for Wi-Fi many times out of desperation in the old days.

827
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:17,004
Rym: I remember PAX West 2008, the hotel we stayed in gave us free Wi-Fi and that was kind of a big deal.

828
00:48:18,115 --> 00:48:18,579
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

829
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,339
Rym: Now, you know, that was the biggest deal.

830
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:22,826
Scott: Yeah, sure.

831
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:24,680
Scott: After that, right.

832
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,080
Scott: Once cars became a thing, you had the motel.

833
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:31,520
Rym: I've stayed until I spent way more time in motels than hotels.

834
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:35,282
Rym: And also I had a weird interest in the history of motels, so I kind of know a lot about it.

835
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:36,320
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:47,378
Scott: And then I think the final major category, there's plenty of other categories at the hostel, the hostel, the serviced apartment is something I've appreciated more as I get older, and the Airbnb.

837
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:50,079
Scott: Yes, the Airbnb is a new one.

838
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,997
Scott: And then to the bed and breakfast, I think would be the final category.

839
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,941
Rym: Bed and breakfast always seem fun, but I rarely have the reason or time to do that kind of thing.

840
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:06,980
Scott: I always feel like the bed and breakfast is the thing you do because you're visiting a place that isn't really like a tourist destination, right?

841
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,120
Scott: It's like they don't have a hotel or a motel there.

842
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,620
Scott: No one's going on vacation there.

843
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,788
Scott: It's not a city.

844
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,440
Scott: The population isn't high.

845
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:18,280
Scott: But you don't know anyone there because it's like a wildernessy place, maybe.

846
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,540
Scott: And someone runs a bed and breakfast because they have an extra room.

847
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,248
Scott: And, you know, it's like where I've stayed at.

848
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:30,819
Rym: that kind of place is like if you're going somewhere for the primary purpose of outdoor sporting, like wilderness hiking, and that's just the place you're staying for a few days.

849
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:41,783
Rym: Or if there's an event like a wedding at a small town out somewhere and you need like that's basically where you stay for a couple extra days just to have a retreat around that event.

850
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,778
Rym: But other than the event, you don't know anyone there.

851
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,041
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:53,819
Scott: So I mean, I think when I think about bed and breakfast lately, you know, I think about, you know, Millerton, New York, where we go on the Harlem Valley Rail Ride, which will hopefully return.

853
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:56,280
Scott: We'll see, you know, the restrictions are gone.

854
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:58,539
Scott: They said restrictions are gone by July 1st.

855
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,359
Scott: They would have it.

856
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,579
Rym: Talk about an outdoor event that has a lot of fresh air around you.

857
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,722
Scott: Sure enough.

858
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:07,860
Scott: But that's a town that, you know, it has some people, right?

859
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,560
Scott: There's reasons to go to that town.

860
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:14,683
Scott: Some people have reasons to go to that town, but I don't think they have a hotel in the town.

861
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:16,000
Scott: I think it's going to be a little far away.

862
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,321
Scott: Right.

863
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:17,920
Scott: I've never seen one on the Main Street.

864
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,221
Rym: Yeah.

865
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:20,309
Rym: People seem to drive from far away.

866
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,491
Rym: or do we do have a camp in that baseball field the night before?

867
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:23,858
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,777
Scott: I haven't seen a motel.

869
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,340
Scott: We camp on the baseball field.

870
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:31,240
Scott: But I think if you're going to stay like on that Main Street, there must be a bed and breakfast near there somewhere.

871
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,568
Rym: There's got to be.

872
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:33,940
Scott: I feel like there has to be one.

873
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,541
Rym: Yeah.

874
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:45,460
Rym: There's also a big industry, especially in the New York area, that does not apply to a lot of places where a lot of people like to head upstate and go to a bed and breakfast for a weekend to do a little retreat and just be out of the city.

875
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:51,905
Scott: There are, I think, I have seen some bed and breakfast that like cater to a specific interest.

876
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:56,885
Rym: You know, like there's one in Beacon that's like birdwatcher focus, like you're a birdwatcher.

877
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:59,340
Rym: You come upstate, you can stay in this bed and breakfast.

878
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,940
Rym: It's not in Beacon, it's like right near Beacon.

879
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,963
Rym: And this bed and breakfast has like bird, like the only people staying there will be birders, probably.

880
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:12,100
Rym: And there's oh, man, I've never seen a bed and breakfast like the gamer gamer's bed and breakfast.

881
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:15,454
Scott: I was about to say my job might probably already.

882
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:16,720
Scott: it probably already exists.

883
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,060
Scott: If it's probably a D&D, there's probably a D&D bread and breakfast out there.

884
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,644
Rym: He's got it.

885
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,160
Rym: He's got to call it the table toppers in.

886
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,680
Rym: You put it within an hour of New York City, upstate somewhere.

887
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,778
Scott: Yeah, let's do it.

888
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,262
Scott: Let's do it.

889
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,840
Rym: OK, kind of really want to talk anyway.

890
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:41,047
Rym: So motels, until it's interesting, because, you know, we were not a wealthy family growing up, so we rarely stayed in hotels like when I was a kid, like we were not in hotels often.

891
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:42,380
Rym: We would be in hotels.

892
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,979
Scott: The only time we went to hotels like specific fancy vacations, like a once a year thing, like a Disney World, maybe.

893
00:51:49,220 --> 00:52:01,720
Scott: Yeah, like a Cedar Point, even when like when we went to other vacation spots that weren't Disney World, we were usually in like service department that had kitchen kind of place or motel on the road.

894
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,429
Scott: Or, you know, even if it was like technically a hotel, like a quality in or something on the road, it's like that's not.

895
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,900
Scott: you know, that might as well be a motel.

896
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:09,688
Scott: Yeah, it's it's.

897
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,739
Scott: it's on an I-95 exit.

898
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:19,219
Rym: Like in the old days, there was a much more distinct line, like motels were characterized by such things as you park outside the door to your room.

899
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:23,120
Rym: There aren't common areas generally, there aren't hallways.

900
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:30,520
Scott: Your architecture of a motel is distinct, even if there are currently hotels that serve the same purpose that motels used to sell.

901
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:38,640
Rym: Like you're you roll in usually on a road trip, you spend the night, you get up early, you get the fuck out of town as a place to sleep and nothing else.

902
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,700
Rym: Maybe you stay there a day to do local attractions and then you continue there.

903
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:57,120
Rym: There are very American phenomenon like they exist in other places, but like they really what most people think of as a motel arose in the late 20s and then especially like kind of had a renaissance and exploded in the 50s in America.

904
00:52:57,982 --> 00:52:59,859
Scott: They're still around, there's still plenty of them.

905
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,397
Scott: A lot of them are the same motels from the 50s.

906
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:09,839
Scott: Yeah, I think it's because, you know, in America you have this sort of, you know, not only the driving, other places clearly have cars, right?

907
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,140
Scott: But the long distance driving in America.

908
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:20,680
Rym: Oh, all are a lot of our vacations as kids, if they weren't like just go to Cedar Point and stay at the hotel breakers, which is actually a moderately fancy hotel.

909
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,204
Rym: I'm so I to this day, I'm surprised my parents could afford that vacation every year in retrospect.

910
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:28,099
Rym: But because I love I'm thinking about going there post-Covid.

911
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,411
Rym: That shit ain't cheap.

912
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:30,240
Rym: Good God.

913
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,497
Rym: That is an expensive hotel.

914
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,152
Scott: Anyway, we were in Australia.

915
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:33,880
Scott: We were in Australia.

916
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,262
Scott: We did.

917
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:36,980
Scott: There was basically a motel we stayed at near the Penguin Place.

918
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,784
Rym: Oh, yeah.

919
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:40,360
Rym: That motel was like made out of cinder blocks, basically.

920
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:42,420
Scott: But that was clearly a motel.

921
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:43,339
Scott: It wasn't the hotel.

922
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:43,741
Scott: Yep.

923
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,620
Scott: But generally what I'd say is we actually hit all three in Australia.

924
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,685
Scott: We started in hotel.

925
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:52,040
Scott: We went to motel and we came back to service department.

926
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:02,619
Rym: We also did something I'd never done in my life until that trip was get to a town without a pre-booked hotel and just like wander into a random hotel, go to the front desk and be like, hey, got any rooms today?

927
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,640
Scott: And it's funny because I knew it was well, I think we called them on our way there.

928
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:07,918
Rym: We called one on the way there.

929
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:08,908
Rym: They were booked up.

930
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:09,980
Rym: Then we called another one.

931
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,508
Rym: They were booked up.

932
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:11,159
Rym: We're like, all right.

933
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,940
Rym: Then we got to town and every hotel was booked up.

934
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,240
Rym: We told that story on GeekNights.

935
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:25,189
Rym: But the way I'd characterize the difference today is that hotels have amenities and motels don't like that's kind of hotels have.

936
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:28,723
Rym: motels have some they have a different set of amenities.

937
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:37,000
Rym: They'll have like this bare minimum set of amenities, like a motel will have an ice machine somewhere you can refill your cooler with.

938
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,460
Scott: Yes, it usually will.

939
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:38,760
Scott: Yes.

940
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:53,062
Rym: But I spent most of my childhood going to motels because we a lot of our vacations were road trip to somewhere like we're driving to Florida or we're driving to Alabama, like let's go stop in a motel every night along the way, do the local shit and then move on.

941
00:54:54,707 --> 00:55:05,262
Rym: But when I became an adult, I started saying mostly in hotels because most of the travel I do is either vacation, work, travel or Scott and I are going to a convention.

942
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:12,000
Scott: Well, I think it's most of the travel is we're going we're in a city already and we're going to a different city.

943
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,860
Scott: It's like there is and we get to the other city with a plane or a bus.

944
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:17,102
Scott: Right.

945
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,880
Scott: We're not stopping along the way.

946
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,754
Scott: We someone else is transporting us.

947
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:21,460
Rym: when I'm on my way.

948
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:26,404
Rym: When I was on my way to Otakon, my goal was to get to Otakon as fast as possible to do Otakon.

949
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:27,858
Rym: I don't give a shit about what's in the way.

950
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:32,660
Scott: It's like even going to Australia, like the farthest I can possibly go.

951
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,760
Scott: It's like, well, I take a train to an airport or a bus to an airport or whatever.

952
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:38,070
Scott: I get on a plane.

953
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:39,220
Scott: It takes me all the way to California.

954
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:40,065
Scott: Another plane takes.

955
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:43,161
Rym: the plane was arguably a motel because I slept on it a couple of times.

956
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:46,100
Scott: Arguably, the plane is the motel provides all kinds of services.

957
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:46,421
Scott: Right.

958
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:50,440
Scott: And it's like get off the plane and then a car takes me to the city.

959
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,926
Scott: It's like I'm all right.

960
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:52,308
Scott: There is no.

961
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,900
Scott: there's no point at which I need any motel biz.

962
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,920
Scott: It's like I'm in city and then I'm in city.

963
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:03,424
Scott: So, you know, there isn't that sort of road trip thing going on required, you know, since the 90s, I guess.

964
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:08,189
Rym: So I guess I want to make a clear separation in our conversation between the business travel.

965
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:09,439
Rym: I'll talk about that at the end, because that's.

966
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,184
Scott: Oh, I forgot the.

967
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:12,300
Scott: I forgot the sort of like resort hotel.

968
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:16,200
Rym: Oh, I kind of just lumped that into hotel in my brain.

969
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,049
Scott: Yeah, but there's a little.

970
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:17,960
Scott: there's a little bit different.

971
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,680
Scott: I'll talk about that, because I was in one somewhat recent.

972
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,162
Rym: Oh, yeah.

973
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:21,364
Rym: Yeah.

974
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,480
Rym: That trip you guys did because I went to a tropical.

975
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:23,701
Scott: Yeah.

976
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:27,346
Scott: I just went to a tropical island because I was like, I want to go way back when I went to Costa Rica.

977
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:34,041
Rym: We stayed in one of those places for several days before we went up to do the like the real trip or actually did stuff other than just stay at a resort.

978
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:49,040
Rym: But yeah, so most of the hotels that Scott and I stay in these days are literally we are at a convention and we just need a hotel, not a motel, has to be a hotel that is as close to the convention as possible.

979
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:56,860
Rym: That's pretty much my only requirement is as close to the convention as possible and is not horrifying, but horrifying.

980
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,920
Scott: Almost none of them are and not just ridiculously expensive.

981
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:05,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean, like even a run of the mill Marriott is like, OK, fine, whatever.

982
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:13,182
Rym: Yeah, but like, I don't want to pay like if there's a hotel that's closer to the convention, but it's five hundred bucks a night now, I'll stay a few blocks away in that.

983
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:14,379
Scott: You're not going to stay at the Four Seasons.

984
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:16,860
Rym: No, I need like two and a packs.

985
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,826
Scott: Someone else's money.

986
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:19,379
Rym: I need like two and a half seasons tops.

987
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,555
Scott: Two and a half seasons.

988
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:23,260
Rym: You know, it's funny.

989
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:32,460
Rym: I didn't quite recognize the material differences between a three star, four star and five star hotel until I started doing business travel.

990
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:33,520
Rym: Like that's something I ignored.

991
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:35,100
Rym: But they're kind of specific.

992
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,499
Rym: The differences I've realized.

993
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:37,322
Scott: Yeah.

994
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:45,840
Scott: So the one time I experienced I guess the first time I experienced the five star hotel, I was the first job I had after college.

995
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:46,262
Scott: Right.

996
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:47,690
Scott: There was this weird.

997
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:49,340
Scott: I don't know what it was.

998
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,639
Scott: I don't remember what it was for.

999
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:59,900
Scott: But basically my boss's boss was having a staycation in the Mandarin Oriental in Manhattan, even though the dude lived in Connecticut and worked in Manhattan.

1000
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,138
Scott: And they had decided there was going to be some sort of like, you know, it was our.

1001
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,840
Scott: our team was very small.

1002
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:10,080
Scott: It was like five, six people.

1003
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:10,582
Scott: Right.

1004
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:19,160
Scott: But they had decided for some reason, I forget that it was going to be like a little party get together in the bar restaurant area of the hotel.

1005
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,258
Scott: So I had to go there.

1006
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:34,708
Scott: So and when I went there, all I really remember about going there is that usually, you know, when someone's trying to be hospitable, right, like extra hospitable, like, oh, good sir.

1007
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:35,339
Scott: Is that right?

1008
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:41,080
Scott: It can usually come off as like, you know, corny, trying too hard.

1009
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:45,364
Scott: You know, it's like it's like when you go into a retail store and it makes me uncomfortable.

1010
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:47,860
Rym: And I think they're also uncomfortable.

1011
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:48,803
Scott: Exactly.

1012
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:51,440
Scott: Like you go into a retail store and someone's like, oh, can I help you?

1013
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:52,940
Scott: Like that sort of feeling, right?

1014
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,879
Scott: Like they're trying to cater to you.

1015
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,280
Rym: Someone told you to say those words to me and you'll get fired if you don't say them.

1016
00:58:58,422 --> 00:58:59,398
Rym: I don't want you to help me.

1017
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:02,340
Rym: I'm going to give you an out because I also do not want your help.

1018
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,886
Rym: I'm fine.

1019
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:03,860
Rym: It's a hardware store.

1020
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,751
Rym: I'm looking at hammers.

1021
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,259
Rym: They're right there.

1022
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:11,288
Scott: And all I remember is that at the when I went to the five star hotel, right, just for dinner.

1023
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:11,920
Scott: Right.

1024
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,699
Scott: The they were still doing that.

1025
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,400
Scott: You know, what were they doing?

1026
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,580
Scott: Same hospitable stuff.

1027
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:18,674
Scott: How can I help you, sir?

1028
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:19,059
Scott: Right.

1029
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:25,942
Scott: But the manner in which they did it right, whatever hospitality they get in, it's slippery.

1030
00:59:26,023 --> 00:59:30,019
Rym: I'm the kind of person where, like someone tries to take my bags like a bell hop and I'm like, fuck you.

1031
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,140
Rym: Don't stay away from my bags.

1032
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:31,748
Rym: I don't know you.

1033
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:32,418
Rym: That's my purse.

1034
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,639
Scott: Whatever hospitality training that they had.

1035
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:36,242
Scott: Right.

1036
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:40,980
Scott: Is somehow they have some something psychological about it.

1037
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,760
Scott: Someone must somebody out there must be an expert on this hospitality science.

1038
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:45,183
Scott: Right.

1039
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,598
Scott: Where they're able to, you know.

1040
00:59:48,405 --> 00:59:49,719
Scott: Oh, good, sir, can I help you?

1041
00:59:50,060 --> 01:00:00,971
Scott: Right, like offer you services, cater to you, try to rub your feet and, you know, kiss your ass and everything without making you feel like it's out of place or awkward or unwanted.

1042
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:01,093
Scott: Right.

1043
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,039
Scott: It's just like it's like magic.

1044
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:04,586
Scott: It's too nice.

1045
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,880
Scott: It's like no one deserves to be treated this nicely.

1046
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:10,300
Scott: And you're not feeling uncomfortable because it's, you know, intrusive.

1047
01:00:10,681 --> 01:00:13,660
Scott: You're feeling uncomfortable because no one deserves this level.

1048
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:16,240
Scott: No human should be doing this to any other human.

1049
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:16,845
Scott: Right.

1050
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,500
Scott: Providing this level of niceness.

1051
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:19,718
Scott: This is too nice.

1052
01:00:21,162 --> 01:00:25,520
Scott: And that's why it cost five hundred dollars at least, you know.

1053
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:32,019
Rym: I think the best like the best hotel because business travel is this whole different ballgame, especially with the industry I'm in.

1054
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,280
Rym: So I pretty much put up in five star hotels all the time.

1055
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:41,880
Rym: The best one I've ever stayed in like that type of travel was this Marriott in Singapore.

1056
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,180
Rym: That's kind of downtown.

1057
01:00:43,742 --> 01:00:45,839
Rym: That's the one where there was the Pinkie Pie Lambo.

1058
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,679
Rym: The Lamborghini painted to look like Pinkie Pie with a big Pinkie Pie on one side and Rainbow Dash on the other side.

1059
01:00:52,221 --> 01:01:04,779
Rym: And it was the fanciest car parked at that hotel, because, you know, fancy hotels will do a thing where the richest person's car that happens to be there will usually be put out front to kind of show off like that person gets to show off their car.

1060
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:07,218
Rym: That was the car that was parked in front of this J.W.

1061
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,242
Rym: Mary out there.

1062
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:13,481
Rym: But I could literally not afford to stay in this hotel in my normal life.

1063
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:16,700
Rym: I could only stay here if someone else paid for me to stay there.

1064
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:23,359
Rym: The level of like amenities and service and that, just like you described, it's like oily and it gets in under your skin.

1065
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,560
Rym: Next thing you know, they're doing all these things for you without you even asking.

1066
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,363
Rym: You don't even notice.

1067
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:31,607
Rym: Like I get up, I left my suit to be pressed because I had meetings the next day.

1068
01:01:31,628 --> 01:01:32,460
Rym: I walked.

1069
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,531
Rym: I don't have my suit on.

1070
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,280
Rym: I just had my shirt on.

1071
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,083
Rym: I walked downstairs.

1072
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,168
Rym: I go to the breakfast.

1073
01:01:36,308 --> 01:01:43,019
Rym: that's free and someone just comes to my table without asking and just puts my suit next to me.

1074
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:44,159
Rym: On a little hanger.

1075
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,460
Rym: Ready, pressed and ready for me to put on to go about my day.

1076
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,020
Rym: And in the pocket of that suit, there was one little candy in the pocket.

1077
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,240
Rym: It's ridiculous.

1078
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:01,260
Rym: But yeah, when I'm not doing business travel, I that is not worth that money like ever.

1079
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,881
Scott: No, when I like even if I was mega rich, I would I wouldn't keep enough money to do that.

1080
01:02:06,942 --> 01:02:10,280
Scott: But also, yeah, I wouldn't spend the money on that.

1081
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,641
Scott: But the difference is when I'm basically should that those hotels basically shouldn't exist.

1082
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:23,940
Rym: The big difference is a business traveler is like there to do work all day and is like ostensibly needs to be efficient.

1083
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:28,100
Rym: And the idea is like I don't have time to think about how do I get my laundry done?

1084
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,040
Rym: Like I got to work like nine to six every day while I'm in this town.

1085
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,043
Rym: I don't have free time.

1086
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:37,484
Rym: So the hotel amenities are like I need an office to go do work in.

1087
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:38,380
Rym: I need to print shit out.

1088
01:02:38,561 --> 01:02:41,260
Rym: I need to like rent a conference room, like have a meeting.

1089
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,382
Rym: My laundry just got to be done because I'm flying out in a couple of days to go somewhere else.

1090
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:49,039
Rym: But when I go to a convention, I don't need shit.

1091
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,065
Rym: I don't need anything.

1092
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:51,699
Rym: The hotel is a bed to sleep in.

1093
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,518
Rym: Maybe it's a place to play a role playing game.

1094
01:02:56,041 --> 01:03:09,180
Rym: Like the only thing I really need out of a hotel when I travel with Scott and Emily and we do our noble stuff is a bed to sleep in and hopefully a bathroom, a bathroom and a lobby that is suitable to play games and get some snacks at night and maybe.

1095
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:10,964
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

1096
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:16,240
Rym: I do find common spaces a lot in hotels at conventions, but not in non conventions.

1097
01:03:17,283 --> 01:03:17,424
Scott: No.

1098
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,680
Scott: So the final was the resort hotel.

1099
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:20,001
Scott: Right.

1100
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:26,840
Scott: So the resort hotel, what's special, what sets it apart, I think is services wise, usually not too different from regular hotel.

1101
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:27,322
Scott: Right.

1102
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:32,060
Scott: Is that it's joined at the hip with some sort of destination.

1103
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:32,565
Scott: Right.

1104
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:33,960
Scott: Like a Disney World hotel.

1105
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,800
Scott: I'm not talking about the ones just in Orlando.

1106
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,920
Scott: I'm talking about the ones that are at Disney World.

1107
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:38,542
Scott: Right.

1108
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:43,200
Scott: It's like it's part of the hotel becomes part of your destination.

1109
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:44,200
Rym: It's not just a place.

1110
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,923
Rym: I've been to Disney World as a kid where you stay outside and like drive in or take a shuttle in every day.

1111
01:03:47,963 --> 01:03:52,179
Rym: But when you're in the resort itself, it's like the outside world doesn't exist.

1112
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:52,962
Scott: It's right.

1113
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,680
Scott: Or like the beach, you know, the beach resort hotel.

1114
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:59,220
Scott: It's like, yeah, you are coming to Tropical Island.

1115
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:00,024
Scott: Right.

1116
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:01,760
Scott: And it's like the Tropical Island has many beaches.

1117
01:04:02,102 --> 01:04:04,740
Scott: But this part of the beach belongs to that hotel.

1118
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,680
Scott: You are going to that hotel's beach.

1119
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,520
Scott: Not only is the hotel the place you are staying, it's also the beach you are enjoying.

1120
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:11,841
Scott: Right.

1121
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,740
Scott: You are going to enjoy the thing the hotel has.

1122
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,300
Scott: It is both your reason for being there and the place that you are staying while you are there at the same time.

1123
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:28,380
Rym: Like for me, it was the hotel breakers, which was the resort hotel that Cedar Point was built next to later.

1124
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:33,540
Rym: So it is like the hotel is basically inside the park and has its own private beach.

1125
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,880
Rym: Like it's it's heavily integrated with the experience of I'm going to Cedar Point.

1126
01:04:39,381 --> 01:04:39,602
Scott: Yep.

1127
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:43,140
Scott: So it's like we would go to the, I was on the Tropical Island, we went to the hotel.

1128
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,160
Rym: Apparently, John Philip Sousa would frequent that hotel.

1129
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,078
Rym: I didn't realize that.

1130
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:47,343
Scott: OK.

1131
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:50,120
Scott: And then we, you know, we'd wake up in the morning.

1132
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:50,642
Scott: Right.

1133
01:04:50,843 --> 01:05:00,080
Scott: And we would go outside and just, you know, the hotel, we would go right to the beach that was part of the hotel and sit in the beach chairs that were owned by the hotel and swim in the water.

1134
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,199
Scott: The only other people in the water in that area were hotel guests.

1135
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:09,849
Rym: But those experiences, like it's different from the the rich person business travel I described where the amenities are focused around.

1136
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:19,420
Rym: like these tasks, the amenities at these resort hotels are more like make you forget the outside world exists and like don't bother you with the details.

1137
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:26,380
Rym: So like you'll be on the beach and some places you can like wave and a person will just walk over and you'd be like, yeah, could I get some orange juice?

1138
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,779
Scott: And they could have done that.

1139
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,507
Scott: We could have done that.

1140
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:29,780
Scott: It was a bar on the beach.

1141
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,139
Rym: They'll just come back with some orange juice.

1142
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:32,780
Rym: They won't charge you any money.

1143
01:05:32,922 --> 01:05:33,838
Rym: They know who you are.

1144
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:35,079
Rym: They'll just add it to your bill.

1145
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:36,901
Scott: Yeah.

1146
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:47,100
Scott: Also, the usually the resort hotels, if they do not have something directly as part of themselves, they are heavily integrated with the tourism industry in the area.

1147
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,700
Scott: So, for example, we went snorkeling one day.

1148
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,084
Scott: Right.

1149
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,500
Scott: How did we go snorkeling?

1150
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:58,460
Scott: Well, when I arrived at the hotel, after we dumped our stuff in the room, I went to the concierge and I was like, I want to look at the list of stuff to do.

1151
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:00,159
Scott: And I was like, I want to do that, that and that.

1152
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,369
Scott: And they're like, OK, come back to the.

1153
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,208
Scott: you know, I didn't have to call the snorkeling place.

1154
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:05,615
Scott: Right.

1155
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:09,862
Scott: I didn't have to all I didn't have to pay, give them a credit, you know, any kind of thing.

1156
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,520
Scott: I just said, those are the things you want to do on these days.

1157
01:06:12,942 --> 01:06:15,420
Scott: And I just wrote down so I wouldn't forget which days it was.

1158
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:20,040
Scott: And then on like some day, I guess Thursday, I'm just going to say random day.

1159
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,311
Scott: 8 a.m.

1160
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:22,000
Scott: or whatever.

1161
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,218
Scott: I walked out of our room.

1162
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,520
Scott: I went to the front of the hotel and the bus came and took us to the snorkeling.

1163
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:28,801
Scott: Yeah.

1164
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:32,782
Scott: And it knew that we were supposed to go there and knew that we had signed up for that.

1165
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:34,939
Scott: We went snorkeling and then it took us back.

1166
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:35,321
Rym: Yep.

1167
01:06:35,502 --> 01:06:38,379
Scott: You know, you know what of the very much like that, too.

1168
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,500
Rym: All the ski resort hotels are just like that.

1169
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,780
Rym: Like you go to the hotel and literally they'll just be like you check into the hotel.

1170
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,540
Scott: They give you lift tickets with your room key up like they give you all the shit.

1171
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,578
Rym: And they're like the first shuttle to this resort, like this mountain will be at 8 a.m.

1172
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,144
Rym: over there.

1173
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:56,919
Rym: Like everything's just arranged to get you to the slopes.

1174
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,520
Scott: The integration is really, you know, and it's a way.

1175
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,669
Scott: And why do they do this?

1176
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:03,840
Scott: Well, A, it's nice.

1177
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,720
Scott: It's convenient, but it takes more money out of you.

1178
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:07,281
Scott: Right.

1179
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,454
Scott: Yes, because I could go as easy as possible to get more.

1180
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:11,397
Scott: to take my

1181
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:25,442
Rym: example if that snorkeling example, if you were if I was somewhere like in Costa Rica at a resort, I could go online, look at all the snorkeling companies in the area, figure out which one was the best value, call them, try to get an appointment or I could just say, hotel, take care of this.

1182
01:07:25,764 --> 01:07:28,721
Rym: Of course, the hotel is going to give me the most expensive one and take a car.

1183
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:31,820
Scott: Well, no, not the most expensive one, but the one that they have a deal with.

1184
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,062
Scott: Right.

1185
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,280
Scott: The hotel is probably going to get a cut of my snorkel.

1186
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:35,447
Rym: That's the important thing.

1187
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:37,700
Rym: It's probably not going to be the cheapest.

1188
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,640
Scott: Probably a referral fees, you know, going in on there.

1189
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,540
Rym: It would probably be cheaper if you arranged it all yourself.

1190
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,040
Rym: But the whole point of a vacation is to not have to deal with that crap and all.

1191
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:54,760
Rym: But also they have an ulterior motive of the more they reduce that friction, the more you might spend if you wouldn't otherwise.

1192
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,820
Rym: Kind of like when I quit that job where I was really easy to go.

1193
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,840
Scott: So maybe, you know, I was so easy to go snorkeling.

1194
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:05,620
Scott: Maybe when I get back from snorkeling, I walk past the concierge and I'm like, hey, can I go parasailing tomorrow?

1195
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:06,668
Rym: OK, yeah.

1196
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:07,619
Scott: Like, hey, what do you want to go?

1197
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:08,899
Scott: One, two, three.

1198
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,620
Rym: They like they might suggest something you didn't even think you wanted to do.

1199
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,259
Rym: And they're like, yeah, I could do that.

1200
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,480
Scott: And they'll almost all have to go to work.

1201
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,450
Scott: I'm on vacation.

1202
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,118
Rym: Take my money.

1203
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:23,520
Rym: They will almost always these resort hotels not tell you what something costs unless you ask.

1204
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:33,419
Rym: I have noticed that, you know, kind of like how a restaurant, the fanciest restaurants often just won't have prices in their menu.

1205
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:34,680
Rym: One, that's a danger sign.

1206
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,307
Rym: Get the fuck out.

1207
01:08:35,346 --> 01:08:36,279
Rym: You're in deep shit now.

1208
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:37,883
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1209
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:41,819
Rym: But to like fancy restaurants that have prices.

1210
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:49,100
Rym: Notice when a server like if you go to a TGI Fridays or like a normal restaurant, they'll they'll be like, oh, yeah, our special today is blah.

1211
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,160
Rym: It's forty nine dollars or twelve dollars or eight dollars.

1212
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:59,120
Rym: But if you go to these fancy places and resort hotels do this for everything, they'll tell you what the appetizers are and what the specials are.

1213
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,460
Rym: And they will not mention the prices at all unless you ask specifically.

1214
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:03,421
Scott: Yeah.

1215
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:08,754
Scott: Also, the the next level of resort hotel is the one where, like, the rooms are somehow integrated.

1216
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:09,200
Scott: Right.

1217
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:16,694
Scott: So like the like your room is literally on the beach and like has a hot tub and you walk right out onto the sand to where now you're.

1218
01:09:16,734 --> 01:09:18,080
Scott: the room is your destination.

1219
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,080
Scott: You're like, I want to go vacation to that room.

1220
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:21,319
Scott: Look how amazing that room is.

1221
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,479
Rym: So I was your vacation.

1222
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:35,136
Rym: I was thinking about this years ago when we went whenever I did that trip to Costa Rica because it's actually really cheap to rent like a whole giant house on the beach with like private hot tub and everything like way cheap.

1223
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:38,457
Rym: Of course, a lot of tropical places are like that.

1224
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:41,260
Rym: Loki thought about doing a party at a place like that.

1225
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,337
Rym: I just never followed up because as a pain in the ass to coordinate the logistics of.

1226
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:50,040
Scott: Yeah, hotels and travel are really fascinating, I guess.

1227
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,680
Scott: Well, let's end on the Airbnb, because that's the new development.

1228
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:53,341
Scott: Right.

1229
01:09:53,402 --> 01:10:02,261
Scott: It's like, you know, so I'm not a fan of Airbnb specifically, you know, not only because it's, you know, the lot of problems with it, it's almost as bad as Uber, but not quite.

1230
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:17,000
Scott: But my number one gripe with Airbnb is that at least in the United States is that there's a set of regulations around hotels that are all mostly, you know, regardless of how well they're enforced and or whatnot, you know, they're mostly good with intent.

1231
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:17,561
Scott: Right.

1232
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:29,240
Scott: Hotels have to have certain fire safety requirements and they have to some of those services that they provide or services that, you know, are, like I said, are vestiges of the old times or they just do it because it makes them money.

1233
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:37,340
Rym: But some of them, they're required to provide and sometimes it comes down to the capacity of the local infrastructure or community to take out a bunch of visitors.

1234
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,280
Rym: Like there's a lot of stuff going on there.

1235
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:48,179
Scott: The hotel has to have an elevator and be ADA compliant and it has to, you know, there's just certain things that hotel, an official real hotel must do.

1236
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:49,062
Scott: Right.

1237
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:55,822
Scott: And Airbnb is basically much like Uber taxis, avoid all the laws about what taxis have to do.

1238
01:10:55,843 --> 01:11:00,662
Scott: Airbnb is just someone renting their house or apartment out for a very short period of time.

1239
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:05,480
Scott: And there was none of those regulations are applying to that place.

1240
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:18,400
Rym: Never mind the fact that a huge number of things on Airbnb are being like straight up illegally rented out because they are buildings that for local laws, in many cases, cannot be used as hotels because that's a big problem in big cities.

1241
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:26,340
Scott: Yeah, you can have a place that is like not suitable for habitation and definitely not suitable for temporary habitation.

1242
01:11:26,763 --> 01:11:29,320
Scott: And yet someone gets rented out on Airbnb and make some money.

1243
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:29,722
Scott: Right.

1244
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:33,680
Scott: And it's like that's, you know, not cool that someone should be allowed to do that.

1245
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,142
Scott: Right.

1246
01:11:34,342 --> 01:11:41,880
Scott: If you're going to if you're going to have a shelter and charge people money to stay in it, that shelter should have to meet certain requirements.

1247
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:43,542
Scott: Right.

1248
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:55,260
Scott: But that being said, the fundamental concept of you are the renter or owner of a space that you are not in need of and someone else needs a shelter.

1249
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,318
Scott: I do think you should be able to come to an arrangement as long as a shelter is suitable.

1250
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,800
Rym: A good example, because we just I just booked one, is a beach house.

1251
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,741
Rym: Like if someone owns a beach house, like they just own it, it's their private beach house.

1252
01:12:09,183 --> 01:12:14,015
Rym: Makes sense that there should be a framework to allow that person to rent it out to other people when they're not using it.

1253
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,424
Scott: Yeah, that's only.

1254
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,200
Scott: that's just efficient use of resources.

1255
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:23,823
Scott: You know, so that part of it is it's just the details, right, that I don't like Airbnb specifically.

1256
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:29,524
Scott: The concept, though, the core of shelter is unused, someone else wants to use it.

1257
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:30,519
Scott: We can arrange that.

1258
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,142
Scott: That is good.

1259
01:12:31,363 --> 01:12:44,379
Rym: Well, all all we really need is some some regulations around this, because the main problem with Airbnb is specifically in cities where on the properties that are unused, that are being rented out, rented out would be used.

1260
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:48,960
Rym: They are purposefully made unused to then be sold for a profit via Airbnb.

1261
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:50,103
Scott: Exactly.

1262
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:55,400
Scott: If you look at like you could say you could look at an apartment in New York City and the rent on that apartment could be like three thousand dollars.

1263
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,340
Scott: You know, holy shit, that's a big rent, right, for like a two bedroom or some shit.

1264
01:12:59,400 --> 01:12:59,923
Scott: But guess what?

1265
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:04,542
Scott: An Airbnb will make three thousand dollars at five hundred a night in six days.

1266
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:12,859
Scott: That rent of three thousand dollars would be for 30 days, five times, five times as much revenue from Airbnb being instead of renting.

1267
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:13,541
Rym: Yeah.

1268
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:18,180
Rym: I mean, look, my rent, this apartment, I pay well over a hundred dollars a night.

1269
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,444
Rym: If this were a hotel, I'm paying over a hundred bucks a night, like well over to live here.

1270
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,056
Scott: Whoa.

1271
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:23,185
Scott: Yeah.

1272
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:24,640
Rym: So stay in the chief apartment.

1273
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,008
Scott: I'm paying.

1274
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:26,700
Scott: We're paying.

1275
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:27,830
Scott: I don't know if we're paying.

1276
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:28,499
Scott: I got to figure that.

1277
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,100
Scott: Oh, no, because it's times two.

1278
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,743
Scott: It's two people.

1279
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:31,427
Rym: Yeah, maybe.

1280
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,342
Scott: Anyway.

1281
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:34,523
Scott: Yeah.

1282
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,800
Rym: But anyway, you know what a hotel costs in this neighborhood?

1283
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,799
Rym: Like four hundred bucks a night.

1284
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:41,243
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1285
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:47,600
Rym: So I could like literally just get another apartment.

1286
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:50,140
Rym: Rent this one out on Airbnb like a hotel.

1287
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,059
Rym: I would make so much profit that I could pay for both apartments with that.

1288
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,939
Scott: Well, judging by my math.

1289
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,422
Scott: Right.

1290
01:13:56,443 --> 01:13:57,220
Scott: Four hundred and nine.

1291
01:13:57,441 --> 01:13:59,220
Scott: Well, you will use your more conservative number.

1292
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,115
Scott: Four hundred a night.

1293
01:14:00,156 --> 01:14:00,340
Scott: Right.

1294
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:00,841
Scott: Yeah.

1295
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:03,180
Scott: Instead of the one hundred a night that you are paying.

1296
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:03,704
Scott: Right.

1297
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:05,680
Scott: So that comes out to four.

1298
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,880
Scott: So you could actually buy Airbnb being one apartment.

1299
01:14:09,303 --> 01:14:11,040
Scott: You could then use the money you get.

1300
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,960
Scott: You had to pay one fourth of that to pay for the rent.

1301
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,034
Rym: I could get three more apartments.

1302
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:16,283
Rym: You could.

1303
01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:21,739
Scott: you could get three more apartments or get three more and rent two of them out on Airbnb.

1304
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,260
Scott: But it's like and the end run of this.

1305
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,540
Scott: If you just live in an apartment three times as nice as the one that you're up.

1306
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:37,680
Rym: Or more likely, I am now a slumlord and I am just siphoning money out of the economy and people in the world into myself and providing nothing.

1307
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:38,802
Scott: Yes.

1308
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:50,860
Scott: So I think, you know, there should definitely be some sort of regulation that if you are, you know, hoteling something that is an apartment that the price needs to be per night, the rent divided by the day thirty thirty.

1309
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,160
Rym: Yeah.

1310
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:52,729
Rym: Well, I mean, there's a lot of the thing.

1311
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:54,397
Rym: is we just need regulation?

1312
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:54,940
Rym: that's sensible.

1313
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:57,234
Rym: But that's impossible in America for all the reasons.

1314
01:14:57,274 --> 01:14:58,260
Rym: we've talked about a lot.

1315
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,960
Rym: Get back to that West Virginia thing and your mansion.

1316
01:15:01,861 --> 01:15:03,690
Scott: Yeah.

1317
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,780
Scott: Hotels are hotels are kind of cool.

1318
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:06,946
Scott: There's a lot of problems.

1319
01:15:06,966 --> 01:15:09,200
Scott: There's a lot of interesting things going on.

1320
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,769
Rym: And I tell some anecdotes.

1321
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:13,938
Rym: We've already gone on really long on this episode and I'm hungry, so I kind of want to wrap it up.

1322
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:14,946
Scott: All right.

1323
01:15:14,986 --> 01:15:15,879
Scott: First, that's why.

1324
01:15:16,081 --> 01:15:16,406
Scott: Yeah.

1325
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:16,956
Rym: Damn it.

1326
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:29,020
Rym: I it's weird how much I miss hotels, because usually when I go into a hotel, that is because I'm about to also be at a gaming convention.

1327
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:30,624
Scott: Yeah, sure.

1328
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,540
Rym: Either a gaming convention or a party or a vacation.

1329
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,505
Scott: And I didn't even talk about like hotels also being in the business of renting out ballrooms and stuff.

1330
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:41,960
Scott: There's a side business catering and whatnot.

1331
01:15:42,564 --> 01:15:44,040
Rym: So maybe you got some Thursday shows here.

1332
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:45,800
Rym: But anyway, we've made enough of a show and I'm done.

1333
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:53,400
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1334
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,724
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1335
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:03,939
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1336
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:11,640
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1337
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1338
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,399
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1339
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,600
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1340
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:49,759
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Lingkiji, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Quinton Walton, Just Like a Dude Guy, Kashyaya, 85, Program, Threat, Open Speed, Undertake, Law, Adoption, Pierce, Absorb, Rebecca Dunn, Review, Badbull, 34, Cowards, Ryan, Parent, Sam Erickson, Shervin, Mountharl, Taylor Braun, You Hold the Key to My Heart and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1341
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,299
Rym: So yeah, we started the stream.

1342
01:16:51,420 --> 01:17:05,464
Rym: There wasn't audio at the beginning because the audio profiles for what track is written to for stuff in OBS for various reasons is a global setting, or at least in the version of OBS that I've got running.

1343
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:08,040
Rym: And I had to rejigger everything to record that panel.

1344
01:17:08,882 --> 01:17:11,179
Rym: And it was actually annoying to set that back.

1345
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:22,240
Rym: So at some point after COVID starts winding down and Scott comes into the studio once or twice, I think it's time to actually rebuild the GeekNights pipeline from scratch.

1346
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:40,059
Rym: So for all of you Patreon patrons, I'm going to actually post some diagrams and things in the coming month or two of how I reworked that, what the old pipeline was, what the new one is going to be, why I'm changing certain things, like basically give you a guide of what the pipeline looks like to record a show like this.

1347
01:17:41,021 --> 01:17:41,825
Rym: I got to do it anyway.

1348
01:17:41,885 --> 01:17:45,957
Rym: Like I have to write all that stuff up and document it and make the diagrams to even do it.

1349
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:49,077
Rym: So I might as well share it with you instead of just deleting them like I normally do.

1350
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:55,665
Rym: The last time we did a big pipeline redirection and change was right at the beginning of quarantine.

1351
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:56,980
Rym: But even then, I kind of hacked it together.

1352
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,800
Rym: The last one before that was 2017.

1353
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,475
Rym: But anyway, for now, tonight, I leave you with...

1354
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,780
Scott: Then let our polluting powers combine!

1355
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:12,700
Scott: Super radiation!

1356
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,016
Scott: Depoletation!

1357
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:16,534
