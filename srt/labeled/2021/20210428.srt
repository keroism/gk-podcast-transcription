1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,768
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:09,969
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:13,420
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,725
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,000
Rym: Tonight we are reviewing the anime, The Great Pretender.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,878
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,474
Rym: So, uh, the other night, you know, we did a GeekNights and didn't really feel like cooking.

8
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,260
Rym: and GeekNights took us a little- we went long.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,093
Scott: Like it- I usually don't cook if there's a GeekNights, right?

10
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,480
Scott: I cook on the nights so there's no GeekNights.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,711
Rym: But, uh, the show went a little long so it was a little later and we didn't really feel like cooking.

12
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,818
Rym: so we were like, "Why don't we just order a

13
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:37,179
Rym: pizza?".

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,560
Rym: So, we dicked around for like a half hour, ordered a pizza, uh, assuming, you know, it'll be here in about an hour, I can live with that and go about our business.

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,440
Scott: And it was- it was delayed, I'm guessing.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,479
Rym: Uh, so, an hour goes by and I think, "Alright, the pizza should be here

17
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:50,640
Rym: soon.".

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,853
Rym: Then another 25 minutes goes by and I think,

19
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:55,254
Rym: "Ha!"

20
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:56,880
Rym: and I go to the Grubhub website.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,913
Scott: You didn't- one hour I call.

22
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:05,075
Rym: I'm like, you know- If I call it one hour it- The pizza place we order from usually says 60 to 70 minutes.

23
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:05,880
Rym: It takes them a while.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,277
Rym: It happens.

25
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:11,000
Rym: So, uh, and I'm not, like, I'm not gonna, like, I'm not gonna, like, pressure them or be weird about it.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,980
Scott: No, no, no, I'm just, like, my- just the other day we actually- there's a place, the Arepa place, we can get brunch from there.

27
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:17,189
Scott: Ooh.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,540
Scott: But it- you can't order the brunch until, like, 11 or 12 and then it takes a while, right?

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,220
Scott: So, uh, it's kind of annoying, like, you can't- you can wake up and order from the diner immediately and get pancakes right away or bagels right away.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,190
Scott: But you can't get Arepa brunch right away.

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,999
Scott: It has to be, like, an early afternoon dinner.

32
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:36,853
Scott: So, even knowing that, I was, like, okay, I'm fine with that, right?

33
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:38,600
Scott: We'll just, you know, we woke up late.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,148
Scott: I'm, like, okay, we'll wake up late.

35
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,039
Scott: Let's just order the Arepa brunch and wait an hour.

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,420
Scott: And I, you know, I ordered it and then, like, an hour later it still wasn't there.

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,653
Scott: So, I'm, like, I called them and my call was just, like, hey, I ordered this an hour ago.

38
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:53,040
Scott: I just want to check and see, make sure you're all good.

39
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:54,910
Scott: And they're, like, yeah, we're all good.

40
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,320
Scott: And then 10, 15 minutes later it showed up.

41
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,728
Scott: All right.

42
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:02,592
Rym: So, at this point- It's about 9 o'clock at night because, you know, we ordered a little late.

43
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:03,113
Rym: So, whatever.

44
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,120
Rym: That's not that late a dinner for a New Yorker.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,900
Rym: But it's getting there.

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,158
Scott: You can order a pizza at 9 and it will show up.

47
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,540
Rym: And I roll over to my computer and I just open, like, I come back to it and I open the tab where I ordered it and GrubHub has that little status.

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,636
Rym: And it says, "Your order has been

49
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:18,100
Rym: canceled.".

50
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:19,459
Scott: Uh-oh.

51
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,511
Rym: The pizza place just had a problem and shut down.

52
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,919
Rym: It wasn't making pizzas.

53
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,507
Rym: I happen to have my phone on.

54
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:30,340
Rym: Do Not Disturb because I didn't want it to be buzzing during gig nights and I didn't uncheck that.

55
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:34,120
Rym: Usually I'm sitting at my computer fucking around and I would have noticed.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,865
Rym: So, this comedy of errors happens.

57
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:38,353
Rym: Now it's, like, 9.20.

58
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:39,216
Rym: I'm so hungry.

59
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,440
Rym: I feel like I'm going to pass out.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Rym: We don't have anything to cook and it's too late to order most of the kinds of food we would order.

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,249
Scott: You can order another pizza.

62
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,339
Scott: It'll just take another while.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,970
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of the pizza places during COVID, they stopped taking orders around 9.30.

64
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,394
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

65
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:53,920
Scott: I didn't hear about that.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,428
Rym: That's just in our neighborhood for some reason.

67
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,756
Rym: Not all of them, but the shitty places.

68
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,460
Rym: we'll deliver later.

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,820
Rym: So, I sorted by, like, what will get us food quickest and I skipped past all the fast food crap.

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,800
Rym: And you know what was right there saying 30 minutes we'll have your food?

71
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,580
Scott: Chinese food?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,938
Rym: La Casa Enrique.

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,000
Rym: Oh, okay.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,320
Rym: A Michelin star place that we can't go to because there's always, like, a multi-hour wait and they won't take reservations.

75
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,230
Rym: They have delivery now.

76
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:17,600
Rym: So, we ordered some tacos.

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,060
Scott: How much did it cost?

78
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:20,948
Rym: It cost, like, $14.

79
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,917
Rym: So, about $7 a taco.

80
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:23,700
Rym: So, it was pricey.

81
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,084
Rym: But you know what?

82
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,740
Rym: Those tacos showed up in, like, 25 minutes and saved me.

83
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,042
Scott: Yeah, all right.

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,100
Scott: Yeah, there was also the time I ordered bagel and accidentally didn't click delivery and it was pickup.

85
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,500
Scott: And I realized way later I had to leave the house and go pick up the bagels in an emergency.

86
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:46,260
Scott: And there was also a time where bagels didn't show up and I had to go to the place because when I called them on the phone, it went to their voicemail box.

87
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:50,278
Rym: There was also the time at PAX where I was skeptical, but you were like, "Let's order delivery

88
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:50,660
Rym: breakfast."

89
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:52,760
Rym: And it showed up and it was fine.

90
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:54,080
Scott: Of course.

91
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,120
Rym: I just didn't expect that to work outside of New York City, let alone in, like, the weird convention center part of a town.

92
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,281
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,360
Scott: So, today I want to get my second shoddy.

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,740
Rym: Oh, mine's this weekend.

95
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,686
Scott: Yeah, I did this morning.

96
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,740
Scott: And since the weather is so nice, it could be warmer.

97
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,086
Scott: It could be warmer, but it's warm enough.

98
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:14,969
Scott: It's warm enough.

99
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:19,019
Scott: I had to wear a light jacket on the way there because it was still early.

100
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,420
Scott: But on the way back, I just put that light jacket in the Citi Bike basket, right?

101
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,744
Rym: Ah, the Citi Bike.

102
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,410
Rym: I just re-signed up for Citi Bike.

103
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,060
Rym: I had it for a while, way back when I first started.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,084
Scott: Well, let's talk about this, right?

105
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:35,617
Scott: So, Citi Bike is still, you know, just fine.

106
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:36,680
Scott: There was no issue with that.

107
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:40,500
Scott: The issue was that I have Citi Bike for free from my work.

108
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:47,959
Scott: They give me a code, and I go to the website with the code, and it renews my annual subscription for zero dollars, right?

109
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:48,380
Scott: With the code.

110
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,819
Rym: Not bad.

111
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,460
Scott: I suppose if I gave the code out and it was used too much, they would be trouble, but no one's done that.

112
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:02,100
Scott: So, I checked the website, and I haven't used it in a long time, obviously, but I renewed it in August 2020.

113
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,169
Scott: So, it should still be active.

114
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,559
Scott: It's an annual dealie.

115
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,238
Scott: Makes sense.

116
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:13,300
Scott: So, I go out there, and I, you know, first, before I even get to the dock, I'm opening the Citi Bike app, because I haven't opened it in a while.

117
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,865
Rym: Oh, yeah, and it's gone.

118
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,640
Rym: You've got to have, like, the Lyft app or whatever.

119
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,647
Scott: So, well, there is a Citi Bike app, but yeah, you're exactly right.

120
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:32,859
Scott: I had to make, like, you know, all I wanted to do was find, because I assumed I was just going to use my key, get the bike, and go, but before I left, I wanted to know where the closest dock, Citi Bike dock to my dock tour was.

121
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:34,825
Scott: So, I knew where I was going.

122
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:37,980
Scott: Was I going to go on 53rd, you know, which street I was going to go down.

123
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:45,775
Scott: And I had to make the Lyft account, and then I had to do all this stuff, and I'm standing next to the Citi Bike dock doing all this shit on the phone.

124
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,280
Scott: I didn't realize I had to do with the accounts, right?

125
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:56,579
Scott: But eventually it worked, and then I go to, you know, put my key in, and it goes, like, red light, and I'm like, "What the

126
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:56,820
Scott: fuck?".

127
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,158
Scott: And I get a text message that's like, "You don't have a payment method attached to your

128
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:00,420
Scott: account.".

129
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,118
Scott: And I'm like, "My account is fully paid annual paid

130
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:03,299
Scott: nonsense.".

131
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:08,800
Rym: Ah, yeah, annual accounts require a payment method now, partly because of the e-bikes.

132
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,985
Scott: Well, that's true, but I had Apple Pay.

133
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:19,080
Scott: When I did all that account stuff in advance, I did Apple Pay, so it had a payment information, and my Apple Pay information.

134
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,059
Scott: So, eventually, I'm just like, "Well, I have to go get, I can't just stay here and figure this out," right?

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Scott: So, I used the app to try to unlock the bike, which, you know, I used the QR code, where you take a picture of the QR code on the bike, and it unlocked.

136
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:41,640
Scott: It totally worked, and then when I got to there, the end of the ride, it fucking charged me money, because my annual account was not somehow transferred.

137
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:53,060
Scott: So, while I'm waiting at the doctor in the 15-minute waiting period after getting the shot, I send an email to City Bike, and I'm like, "I have an annual thing, you just charged me money, and I'm probably gonna get charged money on the way home.

138
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:58,318
Scott: I want that money back, and I want you to reinstate the annualness of my

139
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:58,720
Scott: account.".

140
00:06:58,822 --> 00:06:59,299
Scott: That's a pain.

141
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,327
Scott: Yeah, sort that shit out.

142
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,900
Scott: And then, of course, I paid money for a City Bike ride home.

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,789
Scott: What was interesting, though, yeah, the e-bikes, almost every City Bike.

144
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:14,180
Scott: I saw, actually, whether other people were riding it or whether it was in a dock, were the e-variety.

145
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Rym: I'd say about half of the bikes on the dock outside of our apartment are e-bikes on any given day.

146
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,792
Scott: I think I saw very few people riding the non-e ones.

147
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,860
Scott: I'm like the only person on a non-e one.

148
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,680
Rym: Reporting, like articles talking about City Bike, like local New York City stuff, talking about how most people exclusively use the e-bikes and don't want to have the regular bike.

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,760
Scott: Sure, why not, but I didn't want to pay.

150
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Rym: Yeah, even if you have an annual plan, you still gotta pay per minute if you have an e-bike.

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,999
Scott: Yeah, if the e-one didn't cost anything extra, I would probably just be like, "Okay, I'll take whatever's

152
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:46,160
Scott: there.".

153
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:52,060
Scott: On the way home, right, when I went back to get the bike that I left, it wasn't there.

154
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,566
Scott: The dock had only e-bikes.

155
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,860
Scott: I had to walk to a different Manhattan dock to find a non-e bike.

156
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:04,740
Scott: But yeah, I still had to pay because the freaking thing didn't recognize my account, so they better fix that shit.

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,051
Rym: Yeah, it's funny because I was like, "Oh, I should re-sign up for City Bike,".

158
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,199
Rym: because I know they changed all the crap, so I signed up for it again.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:21,460
Rym: And despite the fact that I closed my old account completely in 2014, so I made a new account because I tried to log into my old account and it clearly didn't work.

160
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,570
Rym: I wondered if I could re-sign up, so I just made a brand new account.

161
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:25,520
Rym: And it just seemed normal.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,259
Rym: And then a couple days later, I got an email that was like, "Oh yeah, we found your old account and we linked them

163
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:30,380
Rym: up.".

164
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,198
Rym: And all my old shit is now in there.

165
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:37,513
Scott: Yeah, when I tried to do it, it's like, "Do you have an

166
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:37,794
Scott: account?".

167
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:39,940
Scott: I said, "I already have an account," because I thought I did.

168
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,619
Scott: I didn't realize this whole Lyft account thing was happening, so I said, "Yes, I already have an

169
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:43,860
Scott: account.".

170
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,858
Scott: And I typed in my email address and they emailed me and were like, "No, you don't have an

171
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:47,120
Scott: account.".

172
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,986
Scott: I'm like, "Okay, fine.

173
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:48,771
Scott: Make a new

174
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,113
Scott: account.".

175
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,120
Scott: And I made a new account.

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,660
Scott: And then when I finished making a new account, it was like, "Here's your ride history," because it was the same email address.

177
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,400
Rym: It's funny because then I can see June 3rd, 2014, the last time I used a City Bike, and I canceled it then because it wasn't useful at the time anymore.

178
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,360
Rym: Mostly because most of our friends didn't have it, so anytime we were out in a group and City Bike would be the easy way to get to Kips Bay or something, only a few of us had it.

179
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,040
Rym: So I ended up walking with all the slow people anyway, so I canceled it.

180
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,190
Scott: I mean, obviously I have it because it's free for me.

181
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,239
Scott: Theoretically, it's supposed to be.

182
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:24,660
Scott: Because I use it when I want to bike somewhere and don't want to bring my actual bike and worry about it getting stolen.

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,535
Rym: But also, since then, it expanded into a lot of Queens and a lot of places.

184
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,600
Rym: You know where I use it mostly?

185
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,000
Rym: Bike down to Vernon Jackson, go to a restaurant, bike to the E-Train once I ride the subway again, that kind of thing.

186
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,322
Rym: So, yeah.

187
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,471
Rym: You'll see how we do after our shots.

188
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:43,700
Rym: I'll be curious to see if you have any second shot side effects.

189
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:48,009
Scott: The first shot, my left arm hurt.

190
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:51,520
Scott: The second shot, at least so far, it's been how many hours now?

191
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:53,462
Scott: Six hours?

192
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:57,172
Scott: I feel better than I did after the first shot.

193
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:58,495
Scott: My arm doesn't even bother me.

194
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,520
Scott: I feel completely normal in every way.

195
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,239
Rym: I'm getting Moderna, so we'll see how that goes.

196
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,017
Scott: I got the other one.

197
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,020
Rym: Pfizer seems like it's better for the person getting the shot in terms of things like side effects, but it's really hard to distribute.

198
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,560
Rym: Moderna is a more practical vaccine for the public.

199
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,240
Scott: The best vaccine is the one that you can get.

200
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:18,831
Rym: Right now, that is 100% true.

201
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,267
Scott: The vaccine that you can get and get quickly is the best one.

202
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:32,160
Scott: Don't go sitting there and being like holding out for one or the other or not going to canceling an appointment because you don't like which one they have there.

203
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,265
Scott: Do not do.

204
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,920
Scott: Just get whatever fucking appointment you can get.

205
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,710
Rym: The thing is, there's a million appointments in New York City now.

206
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,620
Rym: You can walk into a bunch of places.

207
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:44,660
Scott: Wherever it is that you are, whatever the situation is, if you don't have one yet, get one as soon as you can.

208
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,907
Scott: And whichever one they have, that's just take it.

209
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,793
Scott: Don't worry about which kind it is.

210
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:50,580
Scott: That's the best one is the one you can get.

211
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,419
Rym: So let's get into some anime, animation news, etc.

212
00:10:55,861 --> 00:11:02,760
Rym: There is huge news that happened right after we did like a Wednesday episode and we ended up not doing another Wednesday episode until now.

213
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,219
Rym: We had to remember if we had talked about this, I don't think we did.

214
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,219
Scott: No, I don't think we did.

215
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,460
Rym: Yeah, the whole Macross, Robotech, Harmony Gold thing appears to be resolved.

216
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:18,672
Scott: I don't know about permanently resolved.

217
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,059
Scott: It is resolved for now.

218
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:28,640
Rym: Such that Robotech can be released and continue to do its thing, but the real Macross can also be released.

219
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,830
Scott: Well, you could have already watched.

220
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:32,097
Scott: The real Macross is on Amazon.

221
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:32,540
Scott: You could watch it.

222
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:37,560
Scott: But there were issues with some other Macross things.

223
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:44,400
Rym: Think of it more as like the Macross universe, I'm making quote marks here, versus the Robotech universe.

224
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,966
Scott: Okay, so if you don't know, this is a long saga.

225
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:56,640
Scott: I'm sure most anime nerds know that there were these three shows in Japan, three different anime that only had barely anything to do with each other.

226
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Scott: Well, not zero to do with each other, but not that much.

227
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:08,040
Scott: There was Macross, legendary, amazing robot show, which was Super Dimension Fortress Macross.

228
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:15,500
Scott: Then there was the Southern Cross show, and Southern Cross was actually called Super Dimension Century Southern Cross.

229
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,500
Scott: So there was some relation with the Super Dimension thing, but the shows had nothing to do with each other.

230
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,560
Scott: They were like different characters, different plots.

231
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,040
Rym: There wasn't a protoculture.

232
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,071
Scott: Right, they were just completely unrelated stories, characters.

233
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,400
Scott: They both involved mechs, I guess, right?

234
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,680
Scott: Southern Cross is not really that great.

235
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,880
Rym: I've actually never seen it, full disclosure.

236
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:39,178
Scott: You don't need to see it.

237
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,473
Rym: Good.

238
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:49,198
Scott: And then there was another show called Genesis Climber Mospita, which I've never seen, but I heard is at least better than Southern Cross.

239
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:50,120
Scott: I don't know, right?

240
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,156
Scott: But it's a show with motorcycles and stuff, and I guess it has some merits.

241
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,400
Scott: It might be worth seeing, I don't know.

242
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,040
Scott: But the point is, none of those two other shows are Macross, which is a legendary A+ show.

243
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,960
Scott: So someone wanted to bring those shows to the United States, which they recognized that those shows were amazing, especially Macross mostly.

244
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:17,200
Scott: In order to do so, they mangled it, rewrote it, edited it, combined it to get more episodes.

245
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,851
Scott: They combined all three shows together into a thing called Robotech.

246
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,578
Scott: It was basically a travesty.

247
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:24,611
Scott: But it did expose the U.S.

248
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,240
Scott: audience to Macross at least.

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,800
Rym: It was extremely popular in America and in Europe.

250
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,969
Scott: There were some positive side effects, and there were arguments to be made.

251
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:44,520
Scott: it was necessary at the time, but overall there is no reason for it to exist now, and it's not as good as just watching the three original shows separately in their original form.

252
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,160
Scott: So, over time, various things happened, but the big deal was this intellectual property thing.

253
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,037
Scott: Because Macross, mostly the main, you know, the first show, was made by Studio Neue.

254
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,220
Scott: I don't know how to pronounce it properly.

255
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,145
Scott: N-E-U-E.

256
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:00,813
Scott: Yeah, Neue.

257
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:01,299
Scott: I don't know.

258
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:01,800
Rym: I've heard Neue.

259
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,256
Scott: And there was also involvement with another Japanese company, Big West.

260
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:08,720
Scott: It's like an advertising company.

261
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,920
Scott: And another company, which is a company you actually know.

262
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,598
Scott: Harmony Gold?

263
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:15,689
Scott: No, not Harmony Gold.

264
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:17,200
Scott: Tatsunoko Productions.

265
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,096
Rym: Yes, yes, yes.

266
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,140
Scott: So, those three companies in Japan basically got together to make Macross.

267
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:40,890
Scott: Tatsunoko, on its own, without consulting Big West or Studio Neue, licensed Macross and other stuff to this company in the U.S Harmony Gold, which is like this very strange company.

268
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:43,097
Scott: It's like such a Hollywood story.

269
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:46,571
Scott: It's like a real estate company, but they also do some Hollywood stuff.

270
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,440
Scott: They actually made like a movie recently.

271
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,420
Scott: It's like a rich dude, but he's not like billionaire rich, but he's still mega real estate Hollywood rich.

272
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,268
Scott: You know, it's like a family-run business, right?

273
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:02,800
Scott: And somehow they got this deal, and there were several lawsuits.

274
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:17,240
Scott: And when the lawsuits, you know, also involved things like Transformers, because obviously, you know, in the Transformers G1, you had what's-his-name, Firebird, whatever, the guy who's basically the same exact robot as a Valkyrie.

275
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,245
Scott: And there were lawsuits about that.

276
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:27,120
Scott: And they decided, I guess, and after all these lawsuits, that Harmony Gold still had like the rights to like this limited set of character and designs.

277
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:32,198
Rym: We'll link to an article, because it's actually not only is it shockingly complex, but also...

278
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:33,198
Scott: Very complex.

279
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,480
Rym: We also like don't know the full details of what happened, because a lot of this was still resolved behind closed doors.

280
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,939
Scott: I don't think anyone knows.

281
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,797
Rym: But basically, the gist of it was Harmony Gold tried to renew the Macross trademark with Tatsunoko in like the late 90s.

282
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,510
Rym: Big West sued, saying that it and not Tatsunoko had rights to that.

283
00:15:52,633 --> 00:16:00,140
Rym: Later, like a decade later or five or six years later, Japanese courts ruled that Tatsunoko had the rights to Macross, including sequel rights.

284
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:07,260
Rym: But there was some complication that Big West owned the franchise, which included the 41 original designs.

285
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:18,944
Rym: So it was basically fighting over the ownership mostly of merchandising and like the right to the franchise and brand of this stuff, as opposed to the individual show.

286
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:29,373
Rym: Like imagine if one company had like Scott had the rights to Mickey Mouse as a property for merchandising, but I had the rights to the first 20 things that had Mickey Mouse in it.

287
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,760
Rym: But then some other company owned the rest of Mickey Mouse.

288
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,879
Rym: It's one of those situations.

289
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:34,322
Scott: Right.

290
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:39,680
Scott: And then you've got a TV show that has Mickey Mouse and Goofy, who's owned by a different person in it.

291
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,000
Rym: And then Scott licensed some of the toy stuff to the US, but then I licensed my own stuff to the US.

292
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,429
Scott: And that show that has all these different things in.

293
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:52,560
Scott: it is called FUBAR, and someone else owns the trademark to FUBAR.

294
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,444
Scott: The title, right?

295
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:55,987
Scott: It's like Robotech is its own.

296
00:16:56,228 --> 00:17:02,120
Scott: You could own the rights to Robotech conceivably, that trademark, and not own the rights to like the Valkyrie robot.

297
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,879
Scott: So what does this actually mean?

298
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:11,117
Scott: So basically what it's meant is that for the longest time, Macross stuff, which is really what we want.

299
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,380
Scott: We want Macross stuff, right?

300
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,848
Scott: Everywhere for everybody who was a fan of Macross and has been hard to get right.

301
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,500
Scott: Hard to produce, hard to distribute, because there's just been legal kerfuffles involved.

302
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,329
Scott: If anyone tried to do it right, you tried to license it.

303
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:29,780
Scott: You'd have to fight with all these people and get, you just don't want to touch it with a hundred foot pole.

304
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:42,220
Scott: So for the most part, there has been very limited distribution of any Macross related thing outside of Japan, you know, for a very long time.

305
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,800
Scott: We've had like the Macross box set that I bought for a fortune.

306
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,825
Rym: I remember that.

307
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,780
Rym: I remember how excited we all were about that at RIT.

308
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,607
Scott: And you could, you could watch Macross, I think on Amazon prime video.

309
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,832
Scott: And it's like, that's pretty much it, right?

310
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,620
Scott: It's like, you can't, none of this stuff is, is very limited availability.

311
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:10,340
Scott: So what we wanted, what nerds wanted is for basically harmony gold to just lose everything, you know, get this big West garbage out of here, right?

312
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,687
Scott: Just studio new, right?

313
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:16,740
Scott: So, you know, you know, the original, the people who really should just have it, she should just own everything, right?

314
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,485
Scott: They, they made it, they should own everything.

315
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,551
Scott: Let them do whatever they're going to do.

316
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,075
Scott: Combine everything together.

317
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:22,517
Scott: All good.

318
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:23,720
Scott: And Robotech and Dynafire.

319
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:25,544
Scott: That's not what happened.

320
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:33,600
Scott: What's happened is since the lawsuits has ended, basically they just keep renewing agreements with harmony gold, right?

321
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,797
Rym: Big West and studio new, I have acknowledged that harmony gold has a legitimate license to Macross.

322
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:40,880
Rym: Like it is legitimate.

323
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,233
Rym: Harmony gold, I think can release the Robotech movie in Japan.

324
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:50,060
Rym: now, I guess there's an upcoming Robotech movie that we haven't talked about yet.

325
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:50,981
Scott: Yup.

326
00:18:51,422 --> 00:19:03,500
Scott: So yeah, so what's happened is now after these like renewals that sort of just sort of kept a sort of steady state for a while, all the parties involved got together and just made some sort of agreement that we only know part of.

327
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,845
Scott: And it's a good news, bad news, right?

328
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:10,072
Scott: The good news is that now the doors are unlocked.

329
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:14,280
Scott: All these people are going to cooperate with each other under some contract terms.

330
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,380
Scott: And as long as those terms aren't broken, they won't sue each other again.

331
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,600
Rym: They will allow for the immediate international distribution of quote most Macross television, sequels and films.

332
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,560
Scott: Right.

333
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:33,456
Scott: So all the Macross stuff that we haven't been able to get is now just going to be let out, hopefully over time, you know, they've already made websites and stuff for some things.

334
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,220
Scott: We're going to get Macross stuff.

335
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:45,660
Rym: Big West and Harmony Gold have also agreed formally to, quote, cooperate on international distribution of any future Macross and Robotech projects post 2021.

336
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:45,820
Scott: Right.

337
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,329
Scott: So the bad news is that the bad companies are still in, they still got their hand in the pot, right?

338
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,256
Scott: We were thinking we would just wait for their rights to expire, right?

339
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,498
Scott: Why are you doing this, right?

340
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,840
Scott: Just get them out of there.

341
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:03,040
Scott: But, you know, so good news, bad news, but still huge news either way.

342
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:04,221
Rym: Yep.

343
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07,204
Rym: So in some other news, that's also pretty big.

344
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:21,459
Rym: WarnerMedia, basically Adult Swim, HBO Max animation, like a whole bunch of crap is basically all going to be under one division now with one person as the programming head for it.

345
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:34,100
Rym: Basically, you can read this article, but it's going to basically make a large, powerful and well-funded studio and distribution network to make adult animation.

346
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,971
Scott: Yeah, because, you know, previously you had situations with like Cartoon Network Studios, Adult Swim, you had all these like different divisions, right?

347
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:47,260
Scott: Which like little animation companies producing each one was producing like different stuff, right?

348
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,592
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, if you looked at like just Cartoon Network, right?

349
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:54,500
Scott: The Powerpuff Girls or whatever, I don't even know what cartoons they got now.

350
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,523
Scott: If you go back to how old I am, right?

351
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:01,608
Scott: You know, your Powerpuff Girls and your Dexter's Labs were made over here, right?

352
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:09,038
Scott: And then your, what was on Adult Swim back in the day, your Sea Labs, I guess, and all your Birdmans, right?

353
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,140
Scott: Those were made over there.

354
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,160
Scott: The Space Ghosts were made over there.

355
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,120
Rym: Now remember, this includes the entity, you know, people were talking about HBO Max because they picked up the Adventure Time stuff.

356
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:34,340
Rym: They are the most credible place for Venture Brothers to land if it continues, like, so the person they put in charge of it also, she, I don't know a lot about Susana Makos, but from looking at her pedigree here, she seems like the right person too.

357
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,880
Rym: Because she was overseeing things like Bob's Burgers, Bordertown, stuff that seems to be pretty popular.

358
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,719
Scott: So an industry person who knows.

359
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,800
Rym: Someone who seems to know the deal with like adult animation, adult meaning for adults, not adult as in porn.

360
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:51,002
Scott: Right.

361
00:21:51,602 --> 00:22:04,019
Scott: So yeah, so all of these, you know, tiny places now that we're all animating separately are now at least combined, if not physically, all under one company in one place with one organization, right?

362
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:04,480
Scott: One boss.

363
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:13,300
Scott: So there'll be reorganization, realignment, and I guess it's, you know, again, good news, bad news, right?

364
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:20,960
Rym: On one hand, these consolidations are going to lead to the world where Disney literally owns everything down the road, which is a problem.

365
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:31,740
Rym: But in the short term, this will mean there's some legitimate serious competition for what Netflix is doing with adult oriented animation, which is good.

366
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,280
Rym: So in the short term, I think we'll have more funding for good animation and more diversity in animation that's not purely aimed at kids.

367
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:42,033
Scott: I don't know if you have diversity when you have consolidation, right?

368
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,060
Scott: I think diversity will actually be lacking.

369
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,320
Scott: What I think you'll have more of is just like power and quality of, you know, of unified vision.

370
00:22:50,340 --> 00:23:05,520
Rym: That's why the short term part of that was a load bearing part of that statement, because what this means is now there's an entity with similar amounts of funding and power and a variety of different intellectual properties to compete with the other places where that exists today.

371
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:10,279
Rym: Netflix is not going to just dominate the space as they seem to be trying to do for some time.

372
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,395
Scott: Yeah, but having many small companies is where the diversity would have been.

373
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:15,500
Scott: Yeah, there's less of them.

374
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:27,640
Rym: Now, remember WarnerMedia also like back in 2019, they had already done a bigger organization that included Elation, Crunchyroll, Rooster Teeth, VRV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Boomerang.

375
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:29,546
Scott: Yep.

376
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:31,520
Scott: So all those things, all those things are also part of this.

377
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,760
Scott: Yep.

378
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:42,580
Rym: So the long term trend is still not great, but I think in the short term, I feel like HBO Max might have a slight edge in terms of what type of animation they'll be able to make compared to what Netflix is doing.

379
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:52,220
Scott: I'm definitely right now, if you look at what HBO Max is doing, including the recent announcement on animation related, that there will be some NHL games on HBO Max.

380
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:57,971
Scott: I could definitely see, like, you know, plus you got the Adventure Times on there, all this other stuff, I could definitely see.

381
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:02,840
Scott: once I'm done watching stuff on Netflix, I'm probably going to switch to HBO Max next.

382
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,480
Rym: Watch out though, Castlevania is going to drop imminently.

383
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Scott: Yeah, I said when I finish watching stuff on Netflix.

384
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,720
Rym: How long do I keep watching stuff on Netflix?

385
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:11,120
Scott: I don't keep watching stuff.

386
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,979
Rym: There's going to be more Dragon Prince, like a lot more.

387
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:17,369
Scott: Yeah, you know, I can always switch back once I finish watching stuff.

388
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,932
Scott: I don't like to have more than one at a time.

389
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,940
Scott: Pick one, watch everything you can on that one, pay for one at a time.

390
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:24,740
Scott: And it's sort of just, you know, why pay for two months?

391
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,804
Rym: I pay for a few, but not that many.

392
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:33,920
Rym: But the thing, one thing I've noticed is that some people complain that, oh, now it's just like the TV days where I have to pay like some crazy amount for cable to get everything.

393
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,257
Rym: Despite paying for like three different services, it's still way cheaper than what cable costs.

394
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:39,880
Rym: Like, good lord.

395
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:47,779
Scott: To add, to get cable service and not just like the basic cable that has almost no channels, but the real cable service that has, you know, HBO, for example.

396
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:48,140
Scott: Right.

397
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:50,404
Scott: And hockey, for example.

398
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:50,685
Scott: Right.

399
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:53,873
Scott: Would cost like 50 to $100 a month.

400
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:54,915
Scott: What's Netflix cost?

401
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:55,617
Scott: 20 something?

402
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:56,298
Scott: I don't know.

403
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:56,920
Scott: Right.

404
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,629
Scott: And it's like, okay, so I can do like three Netflixes.

405
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,440
Scott: I can do, I can do Netflix, HBO Max and Hulu.

406
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,250
Scott: And there were the best plans and still be paying less than cable.

407
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:06,992
Scott: Right.

408
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:09,980
Scott: Or Apple TV Plus or whatever the hell, you know, whichever one you want.

409
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,868
Rym: Right now we're rocking the Disney Plus, the Netflix and the C roll.

410
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:13,530
Scott: Oh, D plus.

411
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,292
Scott: That's the other one.

412
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:14,633
Scott: Yeah.

413
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:16,780
Scott: But I'm just doing, I got Netflix and C roll right now.

414
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,718
Scott: And I'll, the Netflix is the, is the, is the, uh, the shuffle slot.

415
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,140
Rym: Yep.

416
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,587
Rym: So in some other news, uh, really brief, just go check this out.

417
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,010
Rym: So cells at work.

418
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:28,672
Rym: Okay.

419
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:30,075
Rym: Manga, anime, like.

420
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,120
Scott: I think we've watched a few, I watched a few episodes.

421
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,226
Scott: I respect it, but I just, you know, I just don't feel like watching the whole thing.

422
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:35,547
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:42,460
Rym: It didn't drag me in, like say decadence of the great pretender did where I wanted to watch it all the way to the end and like actively tried to watch it all the way to the end.

424
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,246
Rym: But, uh, they did something kind of cool.

425
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,311
Rym: They made a little like after chapter.

426
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:51,160
Rym: that's basically about the coronavirus vaccine and how it works.

427
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:57,435
Rym: And the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan has basically released this to the world for free.

428
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,819
Scott: Okay, cool.

429
00:25:59,099 --> 00:25:59,260
Rym: Yeah.

430
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:00,762
Rym: It's a neat little thing.

431
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:04,772
Scott: I wish they would get their own vaccination situation in order, right?

432
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,740
Scott: They seem to, there's a lot of issues going on over in Japan.

433
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,169
Rym: Over in Japan, over in the entire world, except the United States.

434
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:14,680
Rym: Yes, but Japan has fucked it up nearly the most.

435
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,980
Rym: We're also the ones with the most vaccines due to, well, basically billionaires and bad stuff that we have no control over.

436
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:22,121
Scott: Yes.

437
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:28,000
Scott: We, you know, it's like, yeah, our country is, is all these vaccines because it's evil and I happen to live here.

438
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,588
Scott: I would rather it not be evil, but I am here.

439
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:31,330
Scott: So what am I going to do?

440
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:31,953
Scott: Not get back?

441
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,377
Scott: No, I'm going to take right shots.

442
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:40,777
Scott: I think Japan's COVID situation has the added problem of the Olympic situation, right?

443
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:41,520
Scott: Which no one else.

444
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:47,758
Scott: And there's a lot of hypocrisies surrounding, you know, both of those things in combination.

445
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:48,440
Rym: That is true.

446
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:58,520
Rym: So getting back to Netflix, Netflix is going to be streaming the Sailor Moon eternal anime films like soon.

447
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:58,840
Scott: Right.

448
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,542
Scott: So what, right.

449
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:06,900
Scott: So what happened here, if you don't realize these aren't like standalone movies for the Sailor Moon anniversary, they did Sailor Moon Crystal, remember?

450
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,584
Scott: And there were some seasons of Sailor Moon Crystal.

451
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:17,720
Scott: So in lieu of a final season of Sailor Moon Crystal, they instead made two movies that are the final season of Sailor Moon Crystal.

452
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:19,984
Scott: So those two movies will be on Netflix.

453
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:21,327
Rym: Yep.

454
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:28,700
Scott: I don't know if I care about them that much because honestly, if you haven't seen all of Sailor Moon Crystal, there's no point because those two movies are the final season.

455
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,103
Rym: But also Sailor Moon Crystal.

456
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:40,040
Rym: I remember when we reviewed it, when it came out and it was awful, mostly because they released it with like, not just like not quite finished animation, but like just missing animation.

457
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,306
Rym: Like characters wouldn't have faces.

458
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:45,896
Scott: Well, usually that's like, you know, the TV, that happens a lot with anime.

459
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,280
Scott: The TV release is busted.

460
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,047
Scott: It was just particularly egregious.

461
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:52,000
Rym: I feel like they really rushed it to get something out like around the anniversary.

462
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,234
Scott: Well, I think because unlike other anime, the Sailor Moon anniversary was like, it's now, this is the anniversary.

463
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:57,755
Scott: It's happening.

464
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:58,598
Scott: You need to do it now.

465
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,320
Scott: So then they rushed it.

466
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,861
Scott: Yep.

467
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:05,557
Rym: But even when they fixed it, I honestly don't find it to be that compelling.

468
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:06,440
Rym: It just feels almost...

469
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,614
Scott: I'll just watch Old Sailor Moon.

470
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:08,140
Scott: I don't need to watch.

471
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:16,260
Rym: Like Old Sailor Moon honestly just feels like it has a lot more heart and life, even though it deviates significantly from the manga and Crystal is truer to the manga.

472
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,539
Rym: And honestly, the manga is great because it's more like Marvel space bullshit than it is like what you expect it to be.

473
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:25,304
Rym: But I don't know.

474
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:30,380
Rym: There's just, it's, the show just feels really sterile and bland compared to the original cartoon.

475
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:33,527
Rym: Anyway.

476
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,740
Scott: It's still going to be on Netflix.

477
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,680
Rym: I know we've been talking about Adventure Time, like the next episode of the four post Adventure Time things on HBO Max.

478
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:50,920
Rym: We had assumed and the whole world had assumed, like all the press, not just us, that the Peppermint Butler goes to wizard school was going to be coming next.

479
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:52,859
Scott: The one that I want to see the most.

480
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,380
Rym: Yep.

481
00:28:53,461 --> 00:29:01,020
Rym: And out of nowhere, the one we thought was the last one, Finn and Jake Together Again, that's actually coming next and it's coming on May 20th.

482
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:10,620
Rym: And so many people had misunderstood the order that it looks like people involved in the project actually had to issue some sort of statement.

483
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,200
Rym: They basically said the order we typed the names in that release had no bearing on the order they were going to be released.

484
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,316
Rym: And there was definitely a read between the lines of, "Seriously, you're

485
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:21,697
Rym: nerds.".

486
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:22,662
Scott: Yeah.

487
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:25,600
Scott: Well, the first two were in that order, first of all.

488
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,099
Scott: And second of all, they said that I think the order they're being aired is the order we delivered them in.

489
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:35,220
Scott: Which I guess, okay, does that mean you did it, you delivered them in that order on purpose?

490
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:41,579
Scott: Or that, you know, they're all, you made them all individually, so you didn't really care which one.

491
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,000
Rym: I feel like they will be individual and stand alone, which will be fine.

492
00:29:45,361 --> 00:29:47,847
Scott: So far the two we've seen are stand alone.

493
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:52,800
Scott: You could watch them in either order and you could have fooled anybody saying the second one came out first.

494
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Rym: I feel like nerds will debate the correct viewing order forever, but I always go by the order in any media.

495
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,840
Scott: There's no correct viewing order because they're unrelated to each other and they're not even in the same part of the timeline.

496
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,103
Scott: It's like, it doesn't matter.

497
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:10,220
Scott: As long as you watch them after you watch the entire TV series, it doesn't matter.

498
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:16,099
Rym: But I usually go with whatever order something was actually released to the public in is generally where you're going to watch it in.

499
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,284
Scott: Sure, it's not a big deal.

500
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:23,360
Scott: Just see the whole TV series first, then watch these, at least so far the first two in any order, and you're good.

501
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:27,139
Scott: Let's not do a GeekNights episode, though, until...

502
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:28,398
Rym: Until we've seen the last two.

503
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,000
Scott: We don't want to do four episodes and four things.

504
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,320
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

505
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:40,787
Rym: This made the rounds before.

506
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,760
Rym: It makes the rounds every year or two, like around the Oscars.

507
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:55,900
Rym: If you've never seen what it looks like to actually make a live stream or television event or anything, like not a sport, but something more complex than a sport.

508
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:57,740
Scott: Even a sport is complex.

509
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,940
Rym: Sports are complex, but they're complex in this different way.

510
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:09,500
Rym: Sports tend to have a pipeline that is very repeatable compared to an event like the Oscars where it only happens once a year.

511
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:14,099
Rym: So the pipeline for that only gets dusted off once a year.

512
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,174
Rym: So there's a little bit of a distinction there, but...

513
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,900
Scott: And it's less of a predictable... You do have the whole thing scripted.

514
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:32,919
Scott: It's like you know that so-and-so is going to... Someone's going to come and read a thing, and then open a card, and then someone... There is sort of a pattern.

515
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:39,359
Scott: But you've got sometimes performances, and there's special presentations, and then you've got...

516
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,780
Rym: Someone trips, someone goes long, there's commercial breaks.

517
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:48,100
Scott: Actually, the ratings for the Oscars this year I think I read were super low, relatively speaking.

518
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:50,739
Rym: I could see that.

519
00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:56,175
Scott: Which is good, but it still has high ratings relative to television in general.

520
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:06,220
Rym: Like watching the NHL, they have low-key fuck-ups in their streams and their television broadcasts pretty much all the time because it doesn't matter that much.

521
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,639
Rym: But imagine if there was only one hockey game a year, and they messed that up.

522
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,419
Rym: So what this is is a video from actually a longer time ago than you might think.

523
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:24,820
Rym: You can figure out the date based on what actors are shown, but this is what it looked like behind the scenes to actually make this live stream happen.

524
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:38,580
Rym: And the thing I want to point out is that the technology is different now, and a lot of this is easier, but the process of what they're doing, why and how, is basically unchanged to this day.

525
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:50,719
Scott: There's many, many cameras, and even though you may be able to switch between them easier with big displays and touch screens and who knows what kind of stuff they got set up in the production crate or whatever.

526
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:56,820
Scott: But you still have to have a human deciding which camera to go to with which timing.

527
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,930
Rym: And how do you manage that on the fly with a bunch of people?

528
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,380
Rym: You've got 400 camera operators, let's say.

529
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:09,060
Scott: All those cameras are being operated by people who need to know where to aim, how much to zoom in, what to look at, right?

530
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:15,860
Rym: And this is just a video showing exactly how they do it, and literally it's not that different today.

531
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,483
Rym: They don't do the snap thing anymore.

532
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:23,620
Rym: Often the person making those calls will be actively just using the dashboard or telling someone else to use the dashboard.

533
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:26,558
Rym: But otherwise, it's pretty much the same, at least from what I've seen.

534
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:28,739
Rym: So what do you got?

535
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:35,860
Scott: Ah, so a listener in our Discord, where you should come to submit things of the day, why not, right?

536
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:47,400
Scott: Informed me that the great Keiichi Arawi, who is known for creating Nichijou, City, Helvetica Standard, right?

537
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:58,180
Scott: Has a YouTube channel, and on that YouTube channel they made this little animation, this animation which requires no knowledge of the Japanese language to understand.

538
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:05,460
Scott: And it is an excellent little animation worth the few minutes it takes to watch, and there are other things on the YouTube channel as well.

539
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
Scott: But I mostly want to highlight this one video, which is really fun.

540
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,040
Scott: This video is great.

541
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:14,560
Scott: And very much in the Keiichi Arawi style, if you appreciate that style.

542
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,940
Rym: It gave me this desperate urge to go watch Nichijou again, but I'm actually not sure where I can watch it right now.

543
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:22,199
Scott: That's a good question, I could watch some Nichijou.

544
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,360
Scott: I don't think it's on Crunchyroll.

545
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,800
Scott: It's gotta be somewhere.

546
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,958
Scott: Yeah, I'll figure that out later.

547
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:27,076
Scott: Sure.

548
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,060
Scott: But yeah, check out this YouTube channel.

549
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,120
Scott: Thank you to our only listener, Jay Vance.

550
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Scott: I guess you've seen this thing of the day already, so you only get one thing of the day this episode.

551
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,358
Scott: That's a shame.

552
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,239
Rym: And I got a little mini thing I'll just link to.

553
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:49,739
Rym: If any of you were at ConnectiCon 2009, it was a pretty interesting ConnectiCon, a convention in Hartford, Connecticut.

554
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,460
Rym: Because the previous year, we'd gone to this con and we kinda crapped on it for not being that well run.

555
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,291
Rym: And the con did what most fan cons do, they said, "Put up or shut up.

556
00:34:58,592 --> 00:34:59,977
Rym: If you want it to be better, volunteer.

557
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:00,399
Rym: We need

558
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:00,579
Rym: help.".

559
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:04,877
Rym: And we, being weirdos, were like, "Alright, give us a panel

560
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:05,078
Rym: room.".

561
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:06,803
Rym: And they said,

562
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:07,064
Rym: "No.".

563
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,600
Rym: And we eventually tricked them into giving us a panel room.

564
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,032
Scott: I think we were like, "Let us run your panels,".

565
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:14,400
Scott: and instead they gave us one room.

566
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,216
Rym: Well first we said, "Let us take over your whole panels department," and they were like,

567
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:17,276
Rym: "No.".

568
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,552
Rym: And they were like, "Fine, give us one panel room,".

569
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:19,915
Rym: and they said,

570
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:19,975
Rym: "No.".

571
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:24,900
Rym: But then they came back to us because they didn't have enough content, and they gave us a panel room.

572
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:31,039
Rym: And that led to us running all the content on that floor of that con for like nine years after that.

573
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:44,200
Rym: But the funniest thing was, that year at the con, our panel room, the one that me and Scott ran with our friends, had more content in it than literally every other room in the convention combined.

574
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:52,120
Scott: Right, if you looked at these schedules for the other panel rooms, it's like they had a panel and then like a huge gap in the schedule that was as big as a panel.

575
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:56,900
Scott: They'd be like an hour panel, and then an hour gap, or an hour 90 minute gap, and then another panel.

576
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,880
Scott: And there were many, many rooms, and those rooms had like two or three events a day.

577
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:10,060
Scott: And you see, when you looked at the schedule, there was then panel five, which was our panel room, that was just, we didn't put gaps at all, we just blocked it solid.

578
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,992
Rym: We were like, "There's a hole, fill it with

579
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:12,374
Rym: something.".

580
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:17,199
Scott: We just filled, we just got as much panels as we could and filled this one room.

581
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,880
Rym: And they opened the big con book, and there's just like this really sparse schedule.

582
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:31,480
Rym: And then right in the middle, panel room five was like packed from 8am to midnight, every single day, with just like great sounding panels.

583
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:33,706
Rym: And I gotta say, that was a nightmare.

584
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,540
Rym: That was more work than I've ever done in a weekend in my entire life, to make that happen.

585
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:45,240
Rym: But it was fun, so if you want to look, I found that schedule that we put together.

586
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:48,420
Rym: Like I found the Google Doc randomly when I was looking for something unrelated.

587
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:49,548
Scott: Okay.

588
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:51,680
Scott: In the meta moment!

589
00:36:52,840 --> 00:37:00,599
Scott: We are on the internet, and every possible place, most places that you can imagine on the internet that we would be, we are there.

590
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,026
Scott: Whether you, you know, we already mentioned your discords, right?

591
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:17,218
Scott: We got your good old web forum, our podcast, I don't know where you're listening to it now, but it's available on Spotify, Apple, even Amazon Music, Amazon Podcast, who the hell uses that?

592
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,040
Scott: Google Podcast.

593
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,725
Scott: It's on freaking everything.

594
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:24,760
Scott: It's on, Rym's even got a Patreon, you shouldn't give money though.

595
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,715
Rym: We have a number of t-shirts and also some other things on Amazon.

596
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:29,920
Rym: if you look for the GeekNights brand.

597
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:31,318
Scott: You don't need those either.

598
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:34,660
Rym: There's more stuff coming with our much better logos.

599
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:44,260
Scott: If for some reason you're hearing this, and for some reason enjoy and want more, think about what websites you like to use, and look for GeekNights there.

600
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,216
Scott: We even have a subreddit that nobody's in.

601
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:51,560
Rym: People joke about asking us for an OnlyFans, but no one has seriously asked us for one.

602
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,519
Scott: Right, you know, we're not on OnlyFans yet.

603
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,157
Scott: But it's, yeah, you can go on OnlyFans, you don't have to make porn, you can just have it if you want to.

604
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,280
Scott: No one's making you get naked.

605
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:04,460
Scott: Stay tuned, our Discord.

606
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:08,540
Scott: It's like, I don't even mind getting naked if you really want to see.

607
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,320
Scott: I mean, the reason I wear clothes is mostly because it's courtesy to others.

608
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,579
Scott: I'm like, you don't want to see this.

609
00:38:14,282 --> 00:38:15,140
Scott: Also, self-protection.

610
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,159
Scott: If you do, I don't care.

611
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,616
Rym: The only reason I wear pants other than the law is avoiding sunburns.

612
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,220
Scott: That's a good point.

613
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:39,460
Rym: But otherwise, in our Discord, once the Discord stage feature lets us at least show a slide or some video, we're probably going to start also streaming the show live in the Discord, which I think could be possibly much more interactive than what we do with the stream now.

614
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Rym: So stay tuned on that.

615
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:48,900
Rym: We're kind of waiting because it's a pain to stream to YouTube and that, because we can't do video on that, so TBD on how to get that all going.

616
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:52,460
Scott: Well, I think what we could do is we could, I don't know, we'll figure it out.

617
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,479
Rym: Yeah, I sketched out a pipeline that would work.

618
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,936
Rym: It's a little bit annoying and complicated, though.

619
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:57,500
Rym: That's the problem.

620
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,880
Rym: Compared to what we do now, which we've kind of got a rhythm going.

621
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:00,993
Rym: Well.

622
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,678
Rym: Anyway, otherwise, let's just get right into it.

623
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,840
Rym: Because The Great Pretender, it's not an A anime.

624
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,158
Rym: This is not Cowboy Peep-Pop.

625
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,358
Rym: Like, do not get us wrong at all.

626
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:22,060
Rym: But it's one of the rare anime that in recent history, I watched the first bit and I felt compelled to watch it all the way to the end.

627
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,560
Rym: I think this is DecaDance or something.

628
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:25,360
Scott: I did watch it all the way to the end.

629
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,280
Scott: I wasn't like super compelled to watch it all the way to the end because it wasn't like one sitting.

630
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,440
Scott: We're like, no, I'm not going to watch it.

631
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,200
Rym: No, no, we pointedly were like one episode a night, maybe two if there's a big interesting cliffhanger.

632
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,645
Scott: But on the one hand, I didn't have to control myself and force myself to stop, right?

633
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,360
Scott: But on the other hand, when the next day came around, I immediately went to the next episode.

634
00:39:53,762 --> 00:39:56,460
Rym: That's the sign of a B+ anime, like Scrap Princess.

635
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,160
Rym: I want to watch the next episode, but watching Evangelion, I am compelled to watch the next episode.

636
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,100
Scott: Right, like it's hard to just turn it off.

637
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,880
Rym: I have to be like, no, I've got to go to bed.

638
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,680
Rym: I remember that weekend at RIT, we pulled out Cowboy Bebop to show someone who'd never seen it the first four episodes.

639
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,080
Rym: And then instead of just going about our weekend, we watched the rest of it like that night and the next morning.

640
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,641
Scott: Exactly.

641
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:23,940
Scott: So The Great Pretender is an anime on Netflix and it's broken up into two seasons in each season.

642
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,067
Scott: I don't know.

643
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,059
Scott: I got some stuff going on.

644
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,467
Scott: Yeah.

645
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,200
Scott: Each season is broken up into cases of varying lengths.

646
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,739
Scott: There's four cases in total.

647
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,049
Scott: So season one is three cases.

648
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,374
Scott: The first case is longer.

649
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:39,920
Scott: The second and third cases are shorter.

650
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,586
Scott: And season two is just case four.

651
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:47,600
Scott: So there's four segments of the story with some time gaps in between of some sorts.

652
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,960
Rym: And what it really ends up being is the first season, these three arcs set up all the characters.

653
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,545
Rym: And that's it.

654
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,129
Scott: It's over.

655
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,460
Scott: There is no more Great Pretender.

656
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,685
Rym: And that's something I appreciate.

657
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:01,540
Rym: I really like shows that were made knowing how they're going to end.

658
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:07,900
Rym: Or, at least in the case of Paranoid Agent, it was going to end after that many episodes regardless if they knew how it was going to end.

659
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:09,040
Rym: Exactly.

660
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,179
Rym: So I can watch it as a unit and not think about, "Oh, well, it was season nine with the Hakage arc or

661
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:15,540
Rym: whatever.".

662
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,059
Rym: I can't deal with shows like that anymore.

663
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,280
Rym: But the first season is basically these three arcs sort of set up all these characters and all this world and bit by bit reveal things.

664
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,671
Rym: And then the fourth season is like, "Alright, here's what the deal was.

665
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:29,936
Rym: Here's what was going

666
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:30,257
Rym: on.".

667
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,241
Scott: Yep.

668
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:39,380
Scott: So the biggest question I have, and I think this is, it's such, you know, you can't see this show and ignore this, is that the show is called The Great Pretender.

669
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:47,460
Scott: And the closing music and the closer of this song is The Great Pretender by Freddie Mercury.

670
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:49,421
Scott: Right.

671
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:53,771
Scott: So that wasn't free, right?

672
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:57,820
Scott: Netflix paid for a sync license to get that song on there, right?

673
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:01,274
Scott: For every single episode, that's the closing song, right?

674
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,520
Scott: A real frickin' song.

675
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:15,740
Scott: Normally when this happens, why could they pay the money for Freddie Mercury on the closing and on fucking Evangelion, a show that is better than The Great Pretender, not to say The Great Pretender is bad.

676
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,034
Scott: They couldn't pay for fucking Fly Me to the Moon.

677
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:18,859
Scott: What the fuck?

678
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,223
Scott: My suspicion- There is no excuse.

679
00:42:21,744 --> 00:42:22,506
Scott: There's no excuse.

680
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:23,729
Scott: It's like, you know, it'd be one thing.

681
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,860
Scott: if like, yeah, they just had some chintzy, you know, but it's like you're paying for a big closing music here.

682
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,382
Scott: It's like, what?

683
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:30,230
Scott: People aren't watching it for the closing music.

684
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,560
Scott: You know, it's like, why would you ever pay money for it?

685
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:38,000
Scott: But if you do pay money for it, that means you must think there's value in having the good, correct closing music.

686
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:41,820
Scott: What, if they didn't get that song, were they going to change the name of the show to something else?

687
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,140
Rym: Normally, there have been a number of anime that had a like big song like that in their opener or closing.

688
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,707
Rym: Like, what, Speedgrapher, Eden of the East with that Oasis song.

689
00:42:54,148 --> 00:43:01,960
Rym: But when that happened, usually they'd have such a limited license that that opener would only be for like the first time it was aired on TV.

690
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,880
Rym: And then there was some terrible song that replaced it once they actually released DVDs like that would usually happen.

691
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:11,450
Rym: I suspect the only reason they paid for a real license was that Netflix made it.

692
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:15,280
Rym: So they were willing to throw money in it based on the creative vision of the creators.

693
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,748
Rym: But Ava, that's just a show they've got.

694
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:19,430
Rym: They don't care.

695
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,535
Rym: People are going to watch Ava with or without it.

696
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:23,760
Rym: There was no creative vision they cared about.

697
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,825
Scott: I think they also, yeah, which is BS.

698
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:32,530
Scott: But also I think as people will, you know, they make, especially in anime.

699
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:40,660
Scott: specifically, they'll license a show, they'll buy a license for just the Japanese territory or the US territory.

700
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,304
Scott: Because guess what?

701
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:43,560
Scott: The US sync license doesn't cost more, right?

702
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,232
Rym: So there's a reason why a lot of bad music ends up in anime in America.

703
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,700
Rym: Like, remember the Dominion Tank Police soundtrack in the dub?

704
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:50,621
Scott: Right.

705
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,142
Scott: Think about the.

706
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:53,891
Scott: think about the population of a place like Luxembourg.

707
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:55,417
Scott: They don't even talk about Luxembourg.

708
00:43:55,437 --> 00:43:56,360
Scott: They talk about Benelux.

709
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:03,911
Scott: Because it's that's, you know, if you're going to license something, you're not going to license in such a small place, right?

710
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:07,940
Scott: You're going to license it in all of, you know, Belgium, Netherlands.

711
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:08,801
Scott: Right.

712
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:14,911
Scott: But if you want to license a song, The Great Pretender, right?

713
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,335
Scott: Let's say you're making a TV show in Benelux.

714
00:44:18,638 --> 00:44:20,120
Scott: You know, you have to pay a certain amount of money.

715
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,754
Scott: And they know the population of Benelux and how popular, even if your show was a mega hit, how many people will see it.

716
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:26,740
Scott: And they charge appropriately.

717
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:34,200
Scott: If you want to license the same exact song for a similar TV show in the United States, they know the population and wealth of the United States, right?

718
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:40,280
Scott: They know how many people are going to be hearing that song versus if it was a Beneluxian TV show, it costs more.

719
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:40,900
Scott: Right.

720
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,404
Scott: So that's a lot of the issue here.

721
00:44:42,424 --> 00:44:49,840
Scott: But regardless, no, Netflix, I'm pretty sure is a worldwide license for The Great Pretender, which was couldn't have been free.

722
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,044
Rym: They named the show The Great Pretender.

723
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:58,380
Rym: The themes that are some of the themes that are addressed in that song are directly applicable to the plot of the show.

724
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,079
Scott: Like, did they license the song first and then make the show?

725
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:11,439
Rym: Actually, so I have an interview I'll link to with the writer and the director, and they were asked specifically, "When did you get the idea to use the Freddie Mercury song as the ending theme, make the visuals focus on his

726
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:11,720
Rym: cats?".

727
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:14,731
Rym: And the answer is very short and perfect.

728
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,980
Rym: This is the director, I think.

729
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:23,880
Rym: "When I was in my teens, I listened to Queen and became a big fan of Freddie Mercury, something that probably any fan wonders about.

730
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:29,080
Rym: But I honed my craft while thinking if he were alive, I wonder what kind of videos would delight him.

731
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:33,839
Rym: Also, I loved the music video of the song, The Great Pretender, so I made an homage to

732
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:33,959
Rym: it.".

733
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:48,100
Rym: But also, it doesn't address this in the interview, but if you watch the show to the end, it's very clear that the lyrics to that song are directly relevant to the overall, for real, plot of the show.

734
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,177
Scott: Alright, so the plot of the show.

735
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:51,940
Rym: The plot of the show is pretty good.

736
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,555
Scott: If you've ever seen the movie The Sting, go watch The Sting right the fuck now.

737
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:57,800
Scott: Isn't it what, Robert Redford, right?

738
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,738
Scott: Yeah, Robert Redford.

739
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,466
Scott: Okay, yeah.

740
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,238
Scott: Amazing, amazing movie.

741
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,358
Rym: When we lived in Beacon, you discovered that I had never actually seen it, and you made me watch it.

742
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:07,900
Rym: Like, I remember.

743
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,067
Scott: Well, it's such a Rym movie.

744
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,398
Scott: I was like, "How have you not seen

745
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:10,539
Scott: this?".

746
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,590
Rym: No, you literally were like, "We're watching it tonight, and we watched

747
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:13,790
Rym: it.".

748
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,596
Rym: And the whole time, you're like, "This is a Rym movie.

749
00:46:15,616 --> 00:46:16,058
Rym: This is a Rym

750
00:46:16,078 --> 00:46:16,298
Rym: movie.".

751
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,560
Scott: This is the most Rym-est movie.

752
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,550
Scott: The Sting is a movie about con men, right?

753
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,180
Scott: They trick, basically, this, you know, but they're con men doing good, right?

754
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:34,700
Scott: They're conning this rich, evil guy, but they basically set up, spoilers, right, an entire bookies, right?

755
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:38,220
Scott: And they fill it with actors who are all pretending to bet on horses.

756
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,240
Rym: Like, you know how Penn & Teller, their magic relies on someone going through such a ridiculous effort that no one would believe they would do it?

757
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:46,059
Rym: It's a con job like that.

758
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,221
Scott: Right.

759
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:53,300
Scott: So, they set up an entire fake bookies for horse betting, off-track betting, OTB.

760
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,000
Scott: They're not near the horses, because then, obviously, the whole thing wouldn't work.

761
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:57,779
Rym: And they run something called the wire scam.

762
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,985
Scott: Yeah, TV didn't exist yet.

763
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:01,269
Scott: So, obviously, right?

764
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:04,860
Scott: So, it allows this scam to exist at the time, in the movie, at least.

765
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:17,880
Scott: And the only person who isn't an actor in, obviously, everyone's an actor because it's a movie, but the only person who isn't a con man or a con artist is this one rich dude.

766
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:33,940
Scott: And they fool him into, you know, betting on these horses, and that make him think he's winning a lot of money, and then they get him to bet the farm on this other horse, and it loses, and they keep all his money, and they basically scam this rich dude.

767
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:47,740
Rym: The movie's great, but the point is, the kind of scam they run in that movie, and also, the vibe around the why of the scam, the great pretender is clearly riffing on this directly.

768
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,971
Rym: In fact, the writer said, "Why I made this movie?

769
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:53,499
Rym: I always liked films about con games like The

770
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:53,760
Rym: Sting.".

771
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:58,959
Scott: Yeah, probably maybe the best con movie there is that I know of, at least.

772
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:06,540
Rym: And also, the writer of the show, Ryota Kosawa, is known almost entirely for live action stuff, not for anime.

773
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,842
Scott: Yeah, okay.

774
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:17,657
Scott: So yeah, in this show, what you have is basically people running cons against each of the episodes, the four acts of the show.

775
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:35,220
Scott: Each of them are targeting a different rich, wealthy, evil person with some sort of con that is a big, elaborate con in order to take all their money and hurt them because they're bad people who deserve to be stolen.

776
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,503
Scott: But they're not evil, killing people.

777
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:42,108
Scott: They're con artists.

778
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:52,900
Scott: They're still criminals, but they're basically using their criminal skills to take a whole bunch of money away from evil, rich people that the police aren't doing anything about.

779
00:48:53,784 --> 00:48:55,618
Scott: They do it four times.

780
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,184
Rym: And not spoil anything.

781
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:03,837
Rym: I guess we'll talk a little bit toward the end of this, just about the very end of the show, because I think there's some things we both want to say about it.

782
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:05,100
Rym: that will be spoilers.

783
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:06,689
Rym: And I think you should just watch the show.

784
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:08,579
Rym: It's one of the better anime to come out in a long time.

785
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:18,660
Rym: But each of the heists sort of reveals why one of the members of this gang is a confidence artist, why they're doing what they're doing.

786
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:26,013
Rym: And the stakes just slowly escalate and the consequences slowly escalate and the ramifications slowly escalate.

787
00:49:26,373 --> 00:49:30,120
Rym: And then at the end, it all sort of comes together and you find out the original why.

788
00:49:31,981 --> 00:49:39,700
Rym: But the fun part is that the scams, the show takes great lengths to make them as plausible as they can be.

789
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:50,660
Rym: It has a little artistic license for just as anime, but like the very beginning, it starts with this just kid in Japan running some low rent con job.

790
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,575
Rym: But it's a 100% legit con you could literally do for real today.

791
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:55,319
Rym: It would probably work.

792
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:04,053
Rym: Like all the cons are actually very well thought out and the writing on what the cons are is good and free.

793
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:08,320
Rym: It's grounded up to a point, but it always sort of gets a little over the top.

794
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:14,252
Rym: It edges into Lupin territory toward the end of every arc, but it doesn't go like full Lupin.

795
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:17,820
Rym: That's how I describe it without like spoiling stuff.

796
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,820
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't go into like really supernatural territory or anything ridiculous like that.

797
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:32,620
Scott: But it's, you know, or people doing things that are like absolutely impossible for humans to do kind of, but it does get a little ridiculous.

798
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,100
Scott: The ridiculousness sort of comes towards the end of the cons for the climaxes, right?

799
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:45,760
Scott: It's like up until then, everything is sort of running in a normal fashion, even if it's an elaborate one.

800
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,855
Scott: It's just like, okay, yeah, no one's that clever.

801
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:49,680
Scott: This would never happen.

802
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:56,440
Scott: But if there was a character that was that clever and there was a cons within cons within cons, then yes, this is okay.

803
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:04,840
Scott: And it's sort of fun to have those cons within cons within cons unfold because certain characters are operating at different levels of the con.

804
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:05,393
Rym: Yeah.

805
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,500
Scott: And then you can sort of see like someone thinks they're conning someone, but actually they're being conned into conning someone as part of a larger con.

806
00:51:13,621 --> 00:51:16,800
Scott: And then they discover it and you discover it together at the same time.

807
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,132
Scott: And it's sort of you're zooming out and, you know, it's not like a terrible secret of space.

808
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:22,733
Scott: where it's like.

809
00:51:23,194 --> 00:51:25,980
Scott: we're telling you there's a terrible secret of space, but we're not telling you the answers.

810
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,264
Scott: You're always asking questions.

811
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:32,840
Scott: It's that you're watching a thing and then suddenly there are answers you didn't even have questions for.

812
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,341
Rym: Yup.

813
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:34,605
Rym: I think your analogy was right.

814
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:38,880
Rym: It's like the show, like the camera is just slowly zooming further and further out.

815
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,787
Rym: And bit by bit, things come into frame.

816
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:43,320
Rym: You're like, wait, what the fuck is going on over there?

817
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:48,773
Scott: It's like you see a puppet and you think it's real and then you zoom out.

818
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,419
Scott: It's like, oh, there was a puppet master.

819
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,634
Scott: And then you zoom out and the puppet master was also a puppet.

820
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:54,619
Scott: Daddy three puppets.

821
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,328
Rym: But what I also appreciated was the way it starts.

822
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:00,057
Rym: Like in the first episode, it's not really a spoiler.

823
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:00,800
Rym: It's the first episode.

824
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:12,820
Rym: But the show I thought was going to be a lot less good than it was because in the first episode it starts with this like really pedestrian con and the guy doesn't work out and it just feels really predictable.

825
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,980
Rym: But then when Ed and Murrah, like the main character, sort of slides in and you see what the real con was, I didn't expect that and it was clever.

826
00:52:21,582 --> 00:52:23,138
Rym: And then the show just escalates from there.

827
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:24,703
Scott: All right.

828
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:27,150
Scott: So let's talk about, there's a few details in the show I want to touch on.

829
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:30,060
Scott: So the first detail is the background art, right?

830
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:32,318
Rym: That background art is fucking amazing.

831
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,660
Scott: I don't know the name of the art style or the artist who drew that way.

832
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,439
Rym: It's like abstract and hyper saturated and colorful.

833
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:44,405
Scott: It's a style you've seen before.

834
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:51,180
Scott: It's like you could imagine that even though the show takes each of the different episode, the, what's it called?

835
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:52,703
Scott: The arcs or whatever.

836
00:52:53,284 --> 00:52:54,045
Scott: The arcs, right?

837
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:55,829
Scott: Take place in different geographies.

838
00:52:55,989 --> 00:53:01,580
Scott: One of them's in Singapore, one of them's in the UK, I think, or France.

839
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,378
Rym: I guess it's a spoiler to say where the last one is.

840
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:07,020
Scott: Yeah, but all four of them are in different locations.

841
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:17,820
Scott: The first one is in California, but they all feel like a painting that you would see hanging in like a motel in California in your hotel room, right?

842
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:19,263
Scott: And it's like a style.

843
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:29,100
Scott: I've seen that style before, but I'm not, I don't know enough about art history or what to Google for to figure out the name of that style or the artist who came up with that style.

844
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,206
Scott: But I've seen that style.

845
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:32,940
Scott: It's a style I like, you don't see it that often.

846
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:42,400
Scott: And they, every single background, whether it's like a shot where the background is taking up most of the frame or just like a regular old talking headshot.

847
00:53:42,941 --> 00:53:48,955
Scott: It's like almost always the background is a painting in that style, right?

848
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,960
Scott: With quite a bit of effort put into it.

849
00:53:51,080 --> 00:54:00,897
Scott: And it's really, you know, it sort of maintains, no matter what's happening in the show, that sort of, you know, sort of visual like anchor point, right?

850
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,700
Scott: Of stylistically.

851
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:11,220
Rym: And it subtly really sets the mood for the scenes and sets the mood for how apart from non-con men these characters are.

852
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:14,727
Rym: And also it really like pegs them to the place they're in.

853
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:21,560
Rym: Like the Singapore arc is like specifically and directly set in a very specific part of Singapore.

854
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,524
Rym: The LA one is like a real place.

855
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:24,687
Rym: Like they scouted locations.

856
00:54:24,707 --> 00:54:29,800
Rym: They made it very, very true to the spirit of those places, but highly stylized.

857
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,625
Scott: It's not one of those ones where it's like, you know, it's New York, but no, it's not.

858
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:33,546
Scott: It's not New York.

859
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:34,528
Scott: It's like, oh yeah, that's...

860
00:54:42,101 --> 00:54:55,260
Rym: It has that history of like where you've been and I've been there more than I've realized, but it really captures what Singapore feels like if you're there and you're well off and like in the kind of places that they're at.

861
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,705
Rym: Not like daily life, but like this larger than life experience.

862
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:09,340
Rym: The other thing I would say is that the soundtrack, I feel like it is like directly trying to pay some homage to Cowboy Bebop, like straight up.

863
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:13,829
Scott: It's not the kind of soundtrack that I would put on, right?

864
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:17,780
Scott: Like I would play, but it's, while you're watching it, it's a lot of fun.

865
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,855
Rym: It's one of those, it fits, but it's not a score that's particularly memorable other than of course the closer, but that's not a score.

866
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,860
Rym: That's a soundtrack and it's just a Freddie Mercury song.

867
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,061
Scott: Right.

868
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:29,645
Scott: We already know that song.

869
00:55:30,346 --> 00:55:36,000
Scott: Another thing I want to point out is that, you know, you have this main character who is a Japanese guy, right?

870
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:43,336
Scott: And his name is Edamura and people, a lot of the characters make fun of him and call him Edamame, right?

871
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:45,340
Scott: Which is, you know, the green peas.

872
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:54,320
Rym: Because the show is very specifically like he is a Japanese character out in the world among mostly non-Japanese people and people make fun of him for it.

873
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:55,761
Scott: Yeah.

874
00:55:55,821 --> 00:56:04,260
Scott: There's like a cultural sensitivity aspect to it, especially since even though these characters are traveling all around the world, right?

875
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,940
Scott: You're watching this show either in Japanese with English subtitles or with an English dub.

876
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,360
Scott: And so the characters will be mostly speaking in the language that you wonder that you choose for your audio track.

877
00:56:17,122 --> 00:56:22,453
Scott: But it's sort of assumed that like while they're in France, right?

878
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,800
Scott: It's like, okay, that character doesn't speak French, but all these other ones do.

879
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:32,100
Scott: And it's like, you know, sometimes they'll actually speak French with subtitles.

880
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,102
Rym: I love that.

881
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:34,386
Rym: I almost feel like it was a gag on them.

882
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:39,300
Rym: They made the voice actors speak English and French a bunch in this show as well.

883
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,167
Scott: But then there'll be times where like, okay, I watched the Japanese English subtitles.

884
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:52,100
Scott: There are scenes where characters are talking in Japanese, but it's just assumed they're actually talking in English because you're in California right now.

885
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:52,820
Scott: Right.

886
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:01,019
Scott: Because they'll make comments like your accent, you know, everyone, you know, your English accent is kind of no good, even though the character didn't speak in English at all just then.

887
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:09,118
Scott: So there's this sort of this and all the it's clearly it's very clear which characters are like, that's a French character, right?

888
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:09,860
Scott: That's a Middle Eastern character.

889
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:18,860
Rym: But they play it up and like there's in the first few episodes, there are long scenes of all the characters like speaking in English, even in the Japanese soundtrack or the Japanese audio.

890
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:19,521
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,363
Scott: They're all con artists.

892
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:27,320
Scott: So they all they're all fluent in many languages and can even, you know, hide their accents or not have accents in various languages to some degree.

893
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,984
Scott: But it's clear.

894
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:39,660
Scott: the main character's Japanese accent, you know, doesn't, you know, he has it when he speaks in English where like one of the other characters, you know, is French.

895
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,769
Scott: But if they speak English, you wouldn't know that they're French because they're so good.

896
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:43,631
Scott: They're a con artist.

897
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,295
Scott: They've learned to speak without an accent.

898
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,840
Scott: and how many different languages, you know.

899
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:52,608
Rym: Another thing I could say is that I like the like, for example, the first arc, which is kind of set in

900
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:53,008
Rym: L.A.,

901
00:57:53,549 --> 00:58:00,880
Rym: it definitely has a big get shorty vibe, like the way that who that director is, who's also in the mob and like what's going on.

902
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:08,299
Rym: And there's a scene that is clearly an homage to that scene in The Untouchables where Al Capone beats the shit out of a guy with a baseball bat.

903
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,022
Rym: But we're watching.

904
00:58:10,082 --> 00:58:12,266
Rym: I'm thinking, oh, they're going to do the Al Capone thing.

905
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:22,040
Rym: But the director guy, who is the mob boss guy, is such a basic piece of shit that he basically is like, I'm doing the Capone thing.

906
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,346
Rym: And then he does the Capone thing like that.

907
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,935
Rym: Like it's almost like he's almost you'll have to see it to see what I mean.

908
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:29,259
Rym: Like that guy is such a doofus.

909
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:31,054
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

910
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:40,817
Rym: In terms of like we're not going to spoil anything about the end, but I'd say the end is pretty satisfying with a possible off note.

911
00:58:41,197 --> 00:58:42,340
Rym: I see what they were going for.

912
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,959
Rym: There's sort of a post ending, very short scene that might radically change how you interpret the show.

913
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:50,659
Scott: Hmm, that's true.

914
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:56,887
Scott: But yeah, I think it's not just the post scene, but also the ending.

915
00:58:57,508 --> 00:59:05,720
Scott: On the one hand, the ending does sort of tie up and explain everything with like the most zoomed out biggest explanation, right?

916
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,297
Rym: Like at the end of the show, it's almost like I had a checklist of they better not just ignore the child trafficking that was happening in that arc.

917
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,000
Rym: And like every box got checked.

918
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:19,906
Scott: Yeah, they just took everything that they had and just like wrapped it up.

919
00:59:19,986 --> 00:59:24,334
Scott: But I think the ending was it felt at least whether it was rushed or not.

920
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,000
Scott: production wise, it's the pace of it is rushed.

921
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,327
Scott: It's like the things that happen at the end happened so quickly.

922
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,293
Scott: It's like, you know, this and then this and then this and then this.

923
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:37,360
Scott: It's like they're just like cramming that ending full of everything.

924
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,760
Rym: I felt like they could have either cut a little bit of that out or had like a few more episodes to make that all come together.

925
00:59:44,442 --> 00:59:44,622
Scott: Yeah.

926
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:52,080
Scott: And the other thing is that it becomes because of that rapid pace of the ending, it's a little like confusing and messy, right?

927
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,100
Rym: But at the same time, that almost works.

928
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,527
Scott: You get the information about how a thing was wrapped up and all the facts and all the questions are answered.

929
01:00:00,948 --> 01:00:10,060
Scott: But it's like you could have spent a little more time showing those answers in a more emotionally impactful fashion, right?

930
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:22,480
Rym: Though at least I can say that one thing that did do is that when we were watching it and the sort of final arc, like the con that's happening gets revealed and some people walk out a door after the floor thing happens.

931
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,822
Rym: I'm being very vague here on purpose.

932
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,970
Rym: We were both just sitting here thinking, what the fuck?

933
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,094
Rym: Does this show get weird now?

934
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:32,980
Rym: Is this supernatural or magic or nonsense?

935
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,723
Rym: Because we almost got conned.

936
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,065
Rym: Like we were conned ourselves.

937
01:00:36,486 --> 01:00:43,238
Rym: And then as the camera zooms out and it's like, oh, oh, like you have this moment of I get it.

938
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:44,440
Rym: I get what they did.

939
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:45,381
Scott: Yeah.

940
01:00:45,923 --> 01:00:46,104
Rym: Yeah.

941
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:49,120
Rym: And I feel like that was done well, but it could have been done slightly better.

942
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:50,041
Scott: Yeah.

943
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:57,020
Scott: Like I was saying before, how it's a show that's giving you answers without, you know, asking, you know, giving you the question.

944
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,708
Rym: That's the first time I gave you a question.

945
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,860
Rym: I was literally like, what the fuck just happened?

946
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:02,824
Scott: But it's sort of in that way.

947
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:04,127
Scott: It's conning you, right?

948
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:09,959
Scott: It's like you're rather than you knowing there's a terrible secret of space and just not knowing what it is.

949
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:10,260
Scott: Right.

950
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,485
Scott: It's like, I know there's a mystery out there.

951
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:15,673
Scott: It's like, it's like, no, there is no mystery.

952
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:16,495
Scott: This is the truth.

953
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:17,478
Scott: This is what's happening.

954
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:18,320
Scott: We're showing you everything.

955
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,026
Scott: Look, we're showing you that they're con men and that they're pulling a con.

956
01:01:21,086 --> 01:01:22,710
Scott: You see the whole con, right?

957
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,520
Scott: You see everything, but you're being, you yourself are being conned, right?

958
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:31,750
Scott: As the larger con is revealed to you and characters simultaneously.

959
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,354
Scott: Right.

960
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:36,020
Scott: So that's what I think gives it a little different structure.

961
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:46,780
Rym: Another thing, something actually I did appreciate around like the way the show progressed too, is that the characters were pretty complex and many of them had significant changes like over the course of the show for as short as it was.

962
01:01:47,521 --> 01:02:05,540
Rym: But also I didn't know where the show was going until the final arc because there are a lot of moments where the show looks like it's about to take a very dark turn and it doesn't necessarily reassure you of, no, it's not actually going to go too far down that road.

963
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:09,347
Rym: It almost feels like it's at any moment it could get real dark.

964
01:02:09,868 --> 01:02:16,920
Rym: Like there's a moment where a character kind of out of nowhere pulls a knife and you don't see it coming and an episode ends.

965
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,020
Rym: And I like, I give it a 50/50 shot that the show is about to take a really dark swerve.

966
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:23,901
Scott: Right?

967
01:02:23,921 --> 01:02:27,227
Scott: It's like there are dark things that happen in the show for real, right?

968
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:34,300
Scott: And the characters, while they're always, you know, when they're not conning someone and acting, right, to con people.

969
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:45,960
Scott: They are always, all of them, even if they all have dark pasts to varying degrees, they all act in sort of a jovial having a good time joking around manner with each other.

970
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,087
Rym: Well, you know how to sum that up?

971
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,160
Rym: There's a meta message in this show.

972
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,760
Scott: Teasing each other, right?

973
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,337
Rym: The meta message of this show is it's all fun and games until it isn't.

974
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:55,881
Scott: Right.

975
01:02:55,901 --> 01:03:06,180
Scott: And then at the same time though, they always will, even though they're almost always just joking around with each other, they'll always stop and say like, no, we're not teammates, right?

976
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,145
Scott: You could just, yeah, you could just die.

977
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,708
Scott: We're doing dangerous shit.

978
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:13,274
Scott: And they absolutely, and they absolutely are, right?

979
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,679
Scott: So, and they're also reminding you, the viewers.

980
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:30,600
Scott: So then when dangerous shit happens, sometimes it's real and sometimes it's a con and you can't tell until later when it's revealed whether that was, you know, a fake or real dangerous things that happened.

981
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:46,520
Rym: Which is because some con movies or con like confidence shows, they tend to portray thieves who don't suffer consequences and also seem to feel like they are immune to consequences.

982
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:56,080
Rym: Like it's always assumed everything's going to work, but the show definitely edges into talking about how that is a fiction and how real cod art is doing these kinds of things.

983
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:00,340
Rym: Like they are moments from death, basically constantly with what they're actually doing.

984
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:01,400
Scott: Yeah.

985
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,627
Scott: And there's, there's plenty of scenes where while they're executing a con, right?

986
01:04:04,647 --> 01:04:08,735
Scott: There's, they're building tension showing you like how close they are to messing it up.

987
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:10,860
Scott: Like, Oh, security, you know, they were trying to do something.

988
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:14,327
Scott: A security guard, you know, is coming back, right?

989
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:19,880
Scott: He's going off the plan and they had to, they have to think fast and come up with, do something else.

990
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,020
Scott: Right?

991
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,822
Scott: What are they going to do?

992
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:21,683
Scott: Are they going to mess up?

993
01:04:21,743 --> 01:04:23,987
Scott: Are they, you know, they were trying to escape.

994
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:24,708
Scott: They didn't escape.

995
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:27,373
Scott: Uh, you know, all these different things happen.

996
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:29,416
Scott: They, they, they wanted to convince someone of something.

997
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:30,478
Scott: They failed to convince them.

998
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:31,360
Scott: Well, now what do they do?

999
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:48,080
Scott: And it's like, you can't tell if sometimes because there are cons within cons, if the failure to convince was part of the plan or they've just successfully adapted to the plan or if the plan has failed and now they don't know what to do and they got to find a way to work it out later.

1000
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:49,381
Rym: Yeah.

1001
01:04:50,442 --> 01:04:53,246
Scott: Do they have the, all these layers planned out in advance or not?

1002
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:59,555
Scott: You're always, you don't really know because it's not like they sat you down and told you what the whole con was going to be before they executed it.

1003
01:04:59,575 --> 01:05:03,580
Scott: You're just watching this execution, not knowing who planned what at what level.

1004
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:11,200
Rym: Which is extra fun because for the first three arcs, Edamura, our main character, he is in just as much in the dark as you, the viewer are.

1005
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:14,660
Scott: I think in all the four arcs, you basically know what Edamura knows.

1006
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,063
Scott: Well, the fourth arc is interesting.

1007
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:24,339
Rym: It would always be a spoiler to make my argument about this, but I think the fourth arc is where that's the only time he knows what is going on.

1008
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:25,383
Scott: Yeah.

1009
01:05:25,424 --> 01:05:26,620
Scott: He knows more in that one for sure.

1010
01:05:26,982 --> 01:05:27,226
Rym: Yeah.

1011
01:05:27,246 --> 01:05:28,059
Rym: Cause that the final.

1012
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,239
Scott: Sometimes I guess in that one, sometimes he knows more than you.

1013
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:31,901
Scott: Yeah.

1014
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:38,439
Rym: I guess in the final one, one way to put it is the first three arcs are almost training and the fourth arc is he does the thing.

1015
01:05:39,463 --> 01:05:39,625
Scott: Mm hmm.

1016
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:39,969
Scott: Mm hmm.

1017
01:05:40,152 --> 01:05:40,577
Scott: Pretty much.

1018
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:40,699
Scott: Yeah.

1019
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,247
Rym: But yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about spoilers.

1020
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:47,760
Rym: So the last thing I'll just say is this show, like this is an anime, if you like anime, watch it.

1021
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,528
Rym: Like this is a fine anime.

1022
01:05:49,548 --> 01:05:51,276
Rym: It's one of the better ones to come out in a long time.

1023
01:05:51,336 --> 01:05:52,120
Scott: It's just on Netflix.

1024
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,477
Scott: I wouldn't subscribe to Netflix to watch this show, but if you have Netflix and you like animation, why wouldn't you watch this show?

1025
01:05:58,577 --> 01:05:59,440
Scott: It doesn't take that long.

1026
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,280
Rym: This is the kind of show, if we showed the first four episodes at like an RIT anime club, like the people would be cheering.

1027
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:11,740
Rym: It's the kind of show that like people would show up to the marathon, but like it's not a cowboy bebop, but it's a B plus.

1028
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,199
Rym: I think it could have been like a full on a minus if the ending had been a little bit tighter.

1029
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,143
Rym: Didn't really hit a, but it did do.

1030
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:32,120
Rym: a lot of the things that good shows do like the closing, like the closing animation, what's happening on screen with the cats and like the lyrics of the song together are allegory for what happens in the show.

1031
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:33,742
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

1032
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,287
Rym: That's one of the things we always talk about.

1033
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:39,880
Rym: Anime where you can figure out things in the show from the openers and closers tend to be better shows.

1034
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,906
Rym: So spoilers, we're going to spoil stuff.

1035
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:47,600
Rym: If you haven't watched the show, stop listening because we're going to spoil stuff in a show.

1036
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:54,140
Scott: Or if you're like me and you don't believe in that spoilers ruin spoil things and that's something that can be spoiled isn't, you know, worth watching at all.

1037
01:06:55,161 --> 01:07:00,593
Rym: But from this point, not only are we going to spoil things, but we're going to assume you've seen it and not explain what we're talking about.

1038
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:03,360
Rym: Like we're going to talk about it like you have seen it with us.

1039
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,180
Scott: Just out of common courtesy, we're just letting you know that's your choice.

1040
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,382
Rym: Last chance spoilers.

1041
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:18,220
Rym: My favorite thing at the end, like of all the things that happened in the end, I think the part I enjoyed the most, I was very happy that his wife was a hundred percent in on it the whole time.

1042
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:22,806
Rym: That would have felt like a sour note if he had been hiding this life from her.

1043
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:30,320
Rym: The fact that she knew and approved of it and was basically just like trying to set her son up to like survive and deal with it.

1044
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:44,380
Scott: I just thought that's why she kept, well, she didn't want to, the thing is like, she didn't tell her son cause he told her not to, but she would just, but like she, you know, she didn't, you know, hate the dad even though, you know, supposedly.

1045
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:51,996
Rym: I always got an undercurrent that she liked what he was doing and was probably even involved in some things when she was younger.

1046
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:54,180
Rym: And then they might've changed that because they had Edamura.

1047
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,577
Scott: Who knows?

1048
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:01,440
Rym: But they don't, they don't go into so much detail on that, but they, the way they reveal that all those scenes I think were just very emotional and touching.

1049
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:02,920
Scott: Yeah.

1050
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:13,240
Scott: The thing that really got me was that you have the, right from the early parts of the show, you see the dad was a, you know, this good lawyer who, you know, got arrested for child trafficking.

1051
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:13,581
Scott: Right.

1052
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:20,694
Scott: And you know, from that point on, I just assumed, you know, like I didn't have questions about that.

1053
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:21,636
Scott: Like where is dad?

1054
01:08:21,676 --> 01:08:23,500
Scott: I didn't think that was going to come up.

1055
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:27,974
Rym: Around the third arc I started wondering like, what was really the deal with his dad?

1056
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:29,680
Rym: Cause that was definitely going to be the fourth arc.

1057
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:38,595
Scott: Well, cause I saw, well, yeah, but I basically, you know, from arc one, two, and most of three, I was just like, dad's in jail.

1058
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:39,877
Scott: I had no questions about dad.

1059
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:40,939
Scott: He was just a bad guy.

1060
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:41,600
Scott: That's what happened.

1061
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,212
Scott: I did not think for one second, the dad was like a part of the plot of the show.

1062
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,319
Scott: I thought it was just like, he was part of the OG gang.

1063
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,380
Scott: Right.

1064
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:52,147
Scott: It's just, it's just like, that's the backstory of Edamura.

1065
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:53,691
Scott: His dad was a guy who went to jail.

1066
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:53,992
Scott: Right.

1067
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:55,975
Scott: I didn't question where's dad now.

1068
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:57,038
Scott: She's in a jail.

1069
01:08:57,059 --> 01:08:57,399
Scott: Right.

1070
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:08,920
Rym: And the show, it did that thing I love where an episode just starts or like a long scene just starts in the past and you see like a history when you see the original gang.

1071
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:15,129
Rym: And then the moment when she was like, all right, let's do one more score.

1072
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:19,314
Rym: That is the same as saying I'm going in for a closer look.

1073
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:22,160
Rym: That is the same as saying we're going to die.

1074
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:23,901
Scott: Yup.

1075
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:29,988
Scott: That's a, that's old cliche of like, okay, we've done all these, you know, we've climbed 10 mountains.

1076
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:32,432
Rym: It's like, all right guys, one more and then we're retiring.

1077
01:09:33,313 --> 01:09:33,533
Scott: Right.

1078
01:09:33,594 --> 01:09:34,073
Scott: Exactly.

1079
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:35,917
Scott: This is my last day before retirement.

1080
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:38,420
Scott: It's like, well, you're going to die on this day, aren't you?

1081
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:38,700
Scott: Yeah.

1082
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:48,500
Rym: But it did also bring up this interesting meta point about how everyone other than her had a reason, like a life and a reason to do cons, like to support that life in some way.

1083
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:53,191
Rym: Except her, she was the one who was conning because she loved it.

1084
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,840
Rym: Like that was the con, the con was the end and the means.

1085
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,764
Scott: And she just having a good time.

1086
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,165
Scott: Yeah.

1087
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:04,583
Scott: Like, you know, where other people might've had a good time as a side effect of, you know, But they had a real life to get back to.

1088
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:07,370
Rym: And there were consequences for them, like that.

1089
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:09,014
Rym: she didn't seem to care about as much.

1090
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:11,179
Scott: No, no, not at all.

1091
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:21,360
Rym: I, I feel like they tried to make the very end where, you know, she comes back as being ambiguous, the way she reacts when she sees the, there's two ways to read it.

1092
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:30,294
Rym: Either if she survived, like simply, or she orchestrated that on purpose to get Laurent out of that life.

1093
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:33,800
Rym: So she could keep criming without him, like having a problem.

1094
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:39,529
Scott: Or, you know, there's also the, you know, and she realized everything worked out.

1095
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:45,660
Scott: It's like, okay, if she's still alive, is she a, because they sort of made it ambiguous, right?

1096
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:50,370
Scott: Does she a still not remember anything, which she really doesn't remember anything.

1097
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,332
Scott: That's a possibility.

1098
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:53,217
Scott: B she's a con artist.

1099
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:54,720
Scott: She's pretending not to remember anything.

1100
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:00,328
Rym: And if she's pretending then was that just, she survived and that's how she survived.

1101
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:04,153
Rym: Or did she plan this thing failing all along?

1102
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:08,600
Rym: Was she the mastermind of freeing Laurent from this life and from his affection to her?

1103
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:20,060
Rym: And the, the, the way, like the intonation of the way she said the final line of the show when she saw that, that jewel really, I think they made that ambiguous specifically on purpose.

1104
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:28,080
Rym: And I don't know, it's a, it's not a bad moment, but I think the show would have been fine if it didn't have that last little scene.

1105
01:11:28,863 --> 01:11:29,045
Scott: Yeah.

1106
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:32,119
Rym: I think, you know, it was really- The interpretation of the show is cleaner without that.

1107
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:32,941
Scott: Yeah.

1108
01:11:33,242 --> 01:11:37,940
Scott: I think up until that point, you had all these different scenarios where people were fake dying.

1109
01:11:38,981 --> 01:11:40,410
Rym: They almost overused that.

1110
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,839
Rym: They basically gave Edinburgh PTSD.

1111
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,240
Scott: Yeah.

1112
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:49,751
Scott: They, they overuse quite a few things, you know, along those lines, but especially the fake dying.

1113
01:11:51,313 --> 01:11:55,400
Scott: And it's like, okay, you fake died and then, okay, you did it once.

1114
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,403
Scott: And then it's like, oh, you fake it.

1115
01:11:56,423 --> 01:11:58,591
Scott: Then it's like, you believe it the next time.

1116
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:01,220
Scott: Cause like you've already used the fake dying, right?

1117
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:04,045
Scott: And it's like, no, they just keep using the fake dying.

1118
01:12:04,085 --> 01:12:05,968
Scott: Like nobody fucking died at all.

1119
01:12:06,008 --> 01:12:08,212
Scott: They just fake deaths like a hundred times.

1120
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:12,620
Scott: And it's like, uh, after you've done it that many times.

1121
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:13,081
Rym: I don't know.

1122
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:16,454
Rym: The guy who got his testicles crushed by that baseball bat, he might not have survived.

1123
01:12:16,514 --> 01:12:16,915
Rym: We don't know.

1124
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:18,100
Rym: We don't see him again.

1125
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:23,592
Scott: But none of this, there are several times significant characters die and they're not really dead.

1126
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:27,060
Scott: It's like, they just kept doing that over and over.

1127
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:38,379
Scott: And it's, it's like they, they did it enough times that before the end of the show, like sometime in the middle of that last arc, I basically was like, well, I guess no one dies in this show.

1128
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:38,980
Scott: And I was right.

1129
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,246
Scott: And it's like, you used it too many times.

1130
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:44,073
Scott: If you would have used it maybe two less times, you would have been better off.

1131
01:12:44,454 --> 01:12:46,459
Scott: Um, you know, like actually kill someone.

1132
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:46,720
Scott: Come on.

1133
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:53,589
Rym: But I guess one thing I did appreciate that's, that's adjacent to that is that the actual cons were really simple.

1134
01:12:53,829 --> 01:13:01,719
Rym: Like while there's all this accretion amount around it, the con was literally just a very simple, all right, now this guy has given us the money and we're gone.

1135
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:02,179
Rym: It's over.

1136
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:15,591
Scott: And also, even though the, the big, big con, right, it's like, yeah, they planned this big, big con, but like they weren't, they clearly weren't planning the details of each thing.

1137
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:16,492
Scott: Right.

1138
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:24,940
Scott: So like, especially with the art guy, it's like, they weren't, it's like, you know, the fact that they accidentally sold him an expensive thing was an act, right?

1139
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:30,800
Rym: Arguably, Lawrence, it was implied that he might've set that up, but they don't actually reveal.

1140
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:33,379
Scott: Oh, that he might've just put that painting there?

1141
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,146
Rym: Yeah, I think that was heavily implied because remember he got him, he got him to stay there.

1142
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:40,972
Rym: Uh, like it fits with everything else Lauren was doing the whole time.

1143
01:13:41,593 --> 01:13:45,840
Rym: One of my favorite scenes with Lauren is when he just imagined himself murdering that triad guy.

1144
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:55,000
Rym: That, that was a, that whole scene was one of the tensest scenes in the show where he's playing Ma Zhang with the mob bosses.

1145
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,181
Scott: Yep.

1146
01:13:57,402 --> 01:14:03,172
Scott: Uh, they're also, I guess the fun, you know, one thing that show had, uh, is fun side characters, right?

1147
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:08,560
Rym: And they were very, the, the seductress and the old man are my two favorite characters in the show by far.

1148
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,779
Scott: Well, also the mechanic guy.

1149
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:16,840
Rym: Oh yeah, he was fun, but I don't know, the seductress and the old man together, like you could have a spinoff show of those two and it would be great.

1150
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,360
Rym: Exactly.

1151
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:21,684
Scott: They were the, the fun side character action and like they're there the whole time.

1152
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:37,759
Scott: Um, like they're there from the beginning to the end and they show up rather, you know, I think they did a good balance compared to other shows, which either don't use their fun side characters enough and you're disappointed or overusing them to where it's like, yeah, those are just like, you know, side characters.

1153
01:14:37,779 --> 01:14:39,420
Scott: You shouldn't be having them all over the place.

1154
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,039
Rym: They use them the right amount.

1155
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:42,883
Scott: The right amount, I think.

1156
01:14:42,923 --> 01:14:43,204
Scott: Yeah.

1157
01:14:43,264 --> 01:14:45,228
Scott: Which, which made me like them a lot.

1158
01:14:45,288 --> 01:14:46,670
Scott: So that was, that was good.

1159
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:51,700
Scott: Um, the bringing back of characters from the previous acts.

1160
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,880
Rym: That was the primary sour note I had from the show.

1161
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,462
Scott: It was a little, it was a little meh.

1162
01:15:11,282 --> 01:15:13,000
Scott: That sort of made sense.

1163
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,810
Rym: Especially cause he wasn't evil.

1164
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:16,160
Rym: He was just a playboy.

1165
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,094
Scott: He wasn't a bad guy.

1166
01:15:17,176 --> 01:15:17,360
Scott: Right.

1167
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:22,440
Rym: He was, he did some bad things, but he wasn't like actively aggressively bad like his shitty brother.

1168
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:23,320
Scott: Right.

1169
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:29,249
Scott: But this bringing back the, the villains from the first three arcs in the fourth arc, just for that brief moment.

1170
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:29,829
Scott: Right.

1171
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:35,497
Scott: And portraying them that way was like, uh, no, that doesn't work.

1172
01:15:35,517 --> 01:15:37,200
Scott: You should have just been done with them.

1173
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:37,761
Scott: Yep.

1174
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:40,727
Rym: Just leave them be the whole, I thought you got revenge on them.

1175
01:15:40,747 --> 01:15:40,827
Rym: Yeah.

1176
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:44,675
Rym: And also your gang is doing crime for all these other reasons.

1177
01:15:44,735 --> 01:15:46,679
Rym: They're just like selling meth to kids.

1178
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:47,140
Rym: Like what?

1179
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:48,341
Scott: Yeah.

1180
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:49,304
Scott: Why do you do it?

1181
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:49,485
Scott: Right?

1182
01:15:49,505 --> 01:15:50,549
Scott: Those are actual criminals.

1183
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:51,191
Scott: They're bad guys.

1184
01:15:51,231 --> 01:15:52,817
Scott: That's why you conned them in the first place.

1185
01:15:52,837 --> 01:15:53,680
Scott: What the hell are you just doing?

1186
01:15:54,020 --> 01:16:02,957
Rym: For a brief moment, I had hoped that they were all actually being conned and they were going to be like abandoned on a boat or like something was going to happen to them, but no, no consequences for them.

1187
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,260
Rym: That just got ignored.

1188
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:14,012
Rym: That was honestly my only real sour note because while the fake deaths was a little bit overdone, it sort of made sense as con artists using the tools they have that work.

1189
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:19,980
Rym: And they did play pretty well how Edamura was deeply traumatized by that.

1190
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,283
Rym: And they all tried to brush it off.

1191
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:27,759
Rym: And I thought it was interesting how Abby of all people was like, you guys are really underestimating Edamura and how much you fucked him up.

1192
01:16:29,641 --> 01:16:36,470
Scott: Well, especially I think the thing is that Edamura wasn't as much pre fucked up as the other people were.

1193
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:41,897
Scott: The other people had more serious traumatic events in their past already.

1194
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:43,860
Scott: Well, also they were older, I guess some of them.

1195
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:51,980
Scott: And I guess the younger one, Abby, it's like her past was at war, the most serious darkest past of everybody.

1196
01:16:52,120 --> 01:17:00,340
Rym: Just that moment when she's pushing the guy's wheelchair, then she stops and you just hear the knife and she's like, tell me, did you pilot bombers during the Iraq war?

1197
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,661
Scott: Exactly.

1198
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:01,941
Scott: Right.

1199
01:17:02,001 --> 01:17:05,225
Scott: But her, uh, Edamura's past is.

1200
01:17:05,566 --> 01:17:10,172
Scott: my mom got sick and died and my dad went to jail, which is a traumatic past indeed.

1201
01:17:10,212 --> 01:17:16,140
Scott: I'm not want to downplay that at all, but compared to my family was bombed while I was a child.

1202
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:23,320
Rym: Or the love of my life was murdered in front of me by the triad and I had to pretend I didn't know her to survive.

1203
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:24,721
Scott: Exactly.

1204
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:31,987
Scott: That is not, uh, you know, everyone else had more serious trauma than, uh, Edamura did.

1205
01:17:32,088 --> 01:17:36,812
Scott: So, you know, exposing him to this hard, uh, life, right?

1206
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:45,240
Scott: The hard parts of, uh, artistry was, you know, you know, he had to deal with things suddenly like, uh, the child trafficking that was going on.

1207
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:54,072
Rym: The fact that, the fact that it did a time skip that it's like, all right, you're working for the mob now, and then it just fast forwards and he's just actually working for the mob.

1208
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:56,776
Rym: They did that one with the cigarette.

1209
01:17:56,796 --> 01:17:59,780
Rym: There's that moment where he's like, he's faking smoking to fit in.

1210
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,779
Scott: The cigarette was symbolic of him, you know, actually, you know.

1211
01:18:04,081 --> 01:18:08,480
Rym: That's one of my favorite moments is just when Abby's like, you actually smoke now?

1212
01:18:09,421 --> 01:18:10,366
Scott: Yeah, right.

1213
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:13,039
Scott: It's like, you're supposed to be acting, not actually, you know.

1214
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:13,500
Rym: Yup.

1215
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,363
Rym: Like it almost shows like that there's a slippery slope there.

1216
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:27,916
Rym: It's very easy for someone, even if they're conning for all the right reasons and doing crime for all the right reasons, it's very easy to just get a little bit deeper and a little bit deeper and compromise a little more and compromise a little more.

1217
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:31,200
Rym: And eventually you're running the auctions for child trafficking.

1218
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,001
Scott: Right.

1219
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:38,171
Scott: And it's like, he started out as the only, you know, everyone else was sort of like, yeah, we don't like child trafficking, but we're, we're doing the con.

1220
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:43,920
Scott: So we have to just go along with it where he was like, no, I want to, you know, let's just, let's free these children right away.

1221
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:44,320
Scott: Right.

1222
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:50,500
Scott: Where, you know, and then he ended up being the one that got, you know, more in with it, running the auction.

1223
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,162
Scott: But think about what that con was.

1224
01:18:52,762 --> 01:19:04,033
Rym: Give him such deep trauma that he turns to this mob boss as a surrogate mother and joins the world of crime for real in order to run a longer con.

1225
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:06,556
Rym: Like that is fucked up.

1226
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:10,099
Rym: But the show very clearly is like, yes, this is fucked up.

1227
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:10,980
Rym: what is happening here.

1228
01:19:11,941 --> 01:19:12,041
Scott: Yep.

1229
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:13,244
Scott: All right.

1230
01:19:13,284 --> 01:19:14,367
Scott: That's that's enough of this.

1231
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:15,029
Rym: This show.

1232
01:19:15,269 --> 01:19:15,791
Rym: Go watch it.

1233
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:18,939
Rym: If you got to the end here and you didn't watch it, go watch it.

1234
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:19,380
Rym: It's great.

1235

1246

Rym: I actually don't decide... full disclosure, I don't actually decide what the final stinger audio is gonna be until usually an hour or two after I record the thing I'm recording right now.

1247
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,817
Rym: So, whatever you hear after I stop talking, I don't know what that's gonna be yet at this moment.

1248
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:37,660
Rym: I will know later.

1249
