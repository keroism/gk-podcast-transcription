1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,329
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:10,630
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:14,260
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,625
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:19,160
Rym: Tonight we are talking about the Chainsaw Man.

6
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:21,959
Scott: I don't think it's the Chainsaw Man.

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,379
Rym: It's just Chainsaw Man.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,659
Scott: It's just Chainsaw Man.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,039
Rym: But it's a... But there is only one Chainsaw Man, as far as I can tell.

10
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,218
Scott: Let's do this.

11
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:32,198
Rym: Yep.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,700
Rym: So it is Definite Article Chainsaw Man.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,660
Rym: It's about the Chainsaw Man, not just a Chainsaw Man.

14
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,220
Scott: The title of the book is just Chainsaw Man.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,660
Rym: But are we talking about the book or the character?

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,756
Scott: The book.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,439
Scott: That's true.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:52,620
Rym: So there is real news, and we're not going to dwell on this because... Read a book, read the news.

19
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:53,866
Rym: But you didn't notice.

20
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,020
Rym: the actual inauguration happened.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,499
Rym: There wasn't some magic nonsense storm.

22
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,360
Rym: Joe Biden is actually president.

23
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:01,779
Rym: That happened.

24
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:04,259
Rym: Now we can start to make changes.

25
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:11,880
Rym: The thing I want to point out to you, my news is, if you didn't watch the inauguration, I'm not saying you had to, but go watch...

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,397
Scott: It's kind of boring.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,093
Rym: Yeah.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Rym: Go watch the speech that the poet gave Amanda Gorman during the inauguration.

29
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:22,980
Rym: It is phenomenal.

30
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,440
Scott: I would say two things.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,380
Scott: One is that we made it past four years of not good times.

32
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:31,892
Rym: Yep.

33
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,760
Scott: A lot of people did not.

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:44,000
Rym: Do not roll into 2021 with the "I Survived 2020" t-shirt, because a lot of people you're going to encounter know people who didn't survive.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,880
Scott: Or maybe you know people who didn't survive.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Rym: It's also going to kind of get worse before it gets better.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,136
Rym: Like COVID's not getting better.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:02,137
Scott: I can't find the tweet because Twitter search is garbage, but someone definitely tweeted in 2016, "People are going to die because of

39
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:02,359
Scott: this."

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,120
Scott: And they were right.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,020
Scott: Whoever that person was, they should be in charge.

42
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:13,040
Scott: The other thing is, on the one hand... I'm going to put this in terms like a nerd can understand.

43
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,459
Scott: On the one hand, it's like, yeah.

44
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:24,740
Scott: The executor superstar destroyer crashed into the Death Star, and the Death Star blew up, and the emperor didn't actually die.

45
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:25,840
Scott: Whatever.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,239
Scott: He's not in power anymore.

47
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:34,659
Scott: But there's still a dozen other super star destroyers around the galaxy still.

48
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:40,099
Scott: So on the one hand, the empire is still out there.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,220
Scott: But on the other hand, you can still sing yub nub right now.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,080
Rym: Yup, that's a point I've been trying to make on Twitter and other places.

51
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:52,360
Rym: Like, yeah, we got a lot of work to do, but it is totally okay to celebrate this victory.

52
00:02:53,182 --> 00:03:02,920
Scott: You can sing a yub nub, but just don't forget that that was only one super star destroyer, and there was a lot more than that.

53
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,019
Scott: I guess if you've only watched the movies, you wouldn't be nerdy enough to know that.

54
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,280
Scott: There were so many of those.

55
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:09,756
Scott: That was only one.

56
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,480
Scott: So yeah.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:13,969
Scott: Yup.

58
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,300
Rym: So in some animation news, I got a little bit of a geek bite.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:31,620
Rym: I talked a while ago about Hilda, which is a phenomenal... I used that word too many times already today, but it is a fantastic top-tier A+ animated series that's on Netflix based on some graphic novels.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,680
Rym: Season two of it dropped, and we just finished it, me and Emily.

61
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:40,040
Rym: And I'm not going to go too deep into a geek bite because I don't want to spoil things.

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,108
Rym: You should just watch this.

63
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:42,279
Rym: Everyone should watch it.

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,360
Rym: I can't think of a single human.

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,059
Rym: What's it even about?

66
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,232
Scott: I know what it looks like.

67
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:45,739
Scott: I've seen it.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,956
Scott: I just don't know what it's about.

69
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:47,839
Rym: It's about a...

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,700
Scott: You're only Hilda, right?

71
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:50,540
Rym: So Hilda is a series.

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,519
Rym: It's about a pseudo-Scandinavian, maybe Swedish, pleasant town called Trollberg.

73
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:02,321
Scott: Is it sort of like Heidi of the Alps, only 2020?

74
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:08,940
Rym: A little bit, but it's more like... So imagine a world where there's a lot of fantastical stuff just there, but it's totally normal to everyone.

75
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,319
Rym: Like, why is it called Trollberg?

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,678
Rym: Because there's fucking trolls outside the walls that turn to stone every day.

77
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,478
Rym: But it's just like normal life.

78
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,452
Rym: And Hilda goes off on adventures in this setting, and it's just sort of fun.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,899
Rym: Like, kid has adventures and deals with dark forces and usually comes out okay in the end.

80
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:37,680
Rym: But with the twist that it's better than the average children's show that does this kind of thing, because the peril she gets into is a lot more perilous than you might expect.

81
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:48,740
Rym: Like, it gets way more serious and dangerous than a lot of children's media tends to, even though that level of danger is what kids actually want, if you ask them and not their parents.

82
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,180
Rym: So Hilda season two, what I'm going to say about it is that it's just as good as season one.

83
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,240
Rym: Like, the show just continues to be utterly fantastic.

84
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:08,216
Rym: But the last episode looked like it was going to just be like a good season finale and end, and I could think, "Well, now I'll just wait for season

85
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:08,398
Rym: three.".

86
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,239
Rym: Something happened I didn't expect.

87
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:20,980
Rym: The last episode of season two fades out, and then it fades back in and shows you something and it shows you the terrible secret of space.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,618
Rym: It shows you the kind of thing that you'd see at the end of a VHS tape of an anime where you can't see the next season for a year.

89
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,818
Rym: This is an Escaflode level cliffhanger.

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,964
Scott: What was that anime?

91
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,939
Scott: that was a very short one, only maybe it was an OAV.

92
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,960
Rym: Oh, Combustible Campus Gardress?

93
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,680
Scott: No, not that one.

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,480
Scott: And it was just like these... I think I remember there were robots and they had alien hats of some kind or something.

95
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,462
Rym: Alien 9.

96
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,919
Scott: I don't know if it was Alien 9 either, but it might have been.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,639
Scott: But there was stuff in the... Basically, when the credits played at the end of the last episode, ridiculous stuff happened behind it.

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Scott: Yeah, that was Alien 9.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,540
Rym: It was like, "Oh, all those characters died.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,025
Rym: Wait, what?

101
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:01,551
Rym: What?".

102
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:03,460
Rym: Yeah, it was Alien 9.

103
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,278
Rym: That's what we were thinking of.

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,057
Scott: Let me Google it.

105
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:07,939
Scott: Yup, that was it for sure.

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,974
Rym: Alien 9 weirdly is in my... It has a lot of brain space for me.

107
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:16,479
Rym: for some reason still, even though I read one volume of the manga and it didn't make sense.

108
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Scott: Literally, what I just said is all that I know about it, other than recognizing it and knowing crazy stuff happens during the credits.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,380
Scott: That's all I got.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:39,957
Rym: So, yeah, the end of Season 2 of Hilda, which it'll be a while before there's a Season 3 because the comics have to catch up to where they can even make another season, is quite a cliffhanger and I still haven't quite processed it.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,840
Rym: So, watch Hilda.

112
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,279
Rym: It is utterly amazing.

113
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:51,319
Rym: But if you are not good with dealing with spoilers, watch all the way up to the second to last episode of Season 2 and then just wait.

114
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:57,618
Rym: Because if you watched that last episode, it's a spoiler that I was shocked by.

115
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:00,172
Rym: It's a good spoiler.

116
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:07,740
Rym: It's a good... Whatever's gonna happen in Season 3 is gonna be like S-rank, I think, because of this.

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,598
Rym: But now I really want to know what the deal is with that thing that I saw.

118
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,840
Scott: It's a terrible secret of space.

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,481
Rym: Yup.

120
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,700
Rym: And Season 2 spent the entire time.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,839
Rym: Season 1 didn't seem like it was going anywhere other than Hilda's way more powerful than she should be.

122
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:30,340
Rym: But Season 2 sort of has this thread of things aren't necessarily what they appear or maybe the government is bad.

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,775
Rym: We should look into that, but...

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,939
Scott: Oh, you don't say.

125
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,109
Scott: Yeah.

126
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:34,960
Scott: So, yeah.

127
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:35,798
Scott: You don't say.

128
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,726
Rym: Watch Hilda.

129
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:37,980
Rym: I cannot stress this enough.

130
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,739
Rym: This is one of those shows where I would universally recommend it to anyone, regardless of what else they might like.

131
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:50,277
Scott: So, something else I'd recommend to anyone regardless of what else they might like.

132
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,400
Rym: I do agree with that.

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,472
Scott: But maybe not really, because there are some people for whom it wouldn't fly.

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,172
Rym: People are at least over the age of 18 in America.

135
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,960
Scott: Yeah, there is a webcomic named Ogloff.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,559
Scott: We've talked about it on the show before.

137
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:09,578
Scott: It is excellent, and it is rated X-lent, for sure.

138
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:29,419
Scott: And recently, they had a Kickstarter to kickstart printing the physical Volume 3 compilation of the Ogloff comics, which... The Ogloff website is actually somewhat painful to navigate, and they don't post their comics on other places because of the X rating parts, obviously, right?

139
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:36,360
Scott: So, they'll sometimes post a comic that has extra pages, and you have to click a different link to go to see those.

140
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:42,659
Scott: If you just click Next, Next, Next, you'll skip over different strips because of the way the website is.

141
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,880
Scott: And it's hard to keep up with it.

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,319
Scott: They do come out rather consistently, so if you don't stay on top of it, you'll miss some.

143
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:55,239
Rym: I don't think I have ever failed to read an Ogloff within a day of it coming out for years.

144
00:08:55,561 --> 00:09:00,440
Scott: I thought that, too, but then I read these compilations, and there were several strips I'd never seen before in my life.

145
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:07,959
Scott: And then, also, you hover over your mouse, and there's funny alt text on a lot of the strips as well.

146
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,173
Scott: And those sometimes are funny.

147
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,420
Scott: Not usually, but sometimes.

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,579
Rym: What was the first webcomic to do that?

149
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:14,688
Scott: I don't know.

150
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:15,460
Scott: That's a great question.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,140
Rym: Because I feel like even the early Penny arcades had the alt text.

152
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,871
Scott: It is a misuse of alt text, which is meant for accessibility and reasons, but whatever.

153
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,677
Scott: Not honestly, but kind of, you know.

154
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:29,000
Scott: Anyway.

155
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,010
Scott: But, yeah, they printed, they put this Kickstarter out, and they said, "You know what?

156
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,060
Scott: I'll kick it at the level that gets me all three volumes, and then I can read through all of it again.

157
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:45,940
Scott: Even though I've read most of it from the beginning, I'm sure there'll be parts I didn't remember, or maybe I was correct, strips I'd never seen.

158
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,927
Scott: I somehow missed them.

159
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,740
Scott: And I'll catch myself up, right?

160
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,900
Scott: Make sure I don't miss anything.

161
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:55,260
Scott: And then I'll just keep reading it like I do, and then get volume four one day to, you know, do the same thing.

162
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,268
Scott: Catch up and fill in the

163
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:56,551
Scott: blanks.".

164
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:03,960
Scott: So, yeah, first of all, these printed volumes are a really great way to read Ogloff.

165
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,899
Scott: Much better than the kind of eh website.

166
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,040
Scott: However, the alt text are printed at, like, the side and the top of the page, right?

167
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:23,360
Scott: And this sort of happened to me also with the Adventure Time comic, where they would put, like, a funny, tiny line of text, like, outside the panels, like, at the bottom of the page.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,805
Scott: Oh, yeah.

169
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,253
Rym: I missed those at first.

170
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,540
Rym: Like, I just didn't pay attention to them.

171
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,240
Scott: As sort of like a commentary on the page, right?

172
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:46,680
Scott: And while those often contained awesome content that I was happy to get, it's sort of like you're reading these panels, and then you stop to read this line of text, and it totally messes up the pacing, and sort of, like, hurts my head a little bit, right?

173
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,220
Scott: Not, you know, like, it's hard to read words.

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,460
Scott: But it's just sort of like, if I was reading only panels, I could, like, blitz through the whole thing, right?

175
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,358
Scott: And just take them all in.

176
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,860
Scott: But, like, it's like I'm in panel reading mode.

177
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,800
Scott: Like, it's almost like having a car going 100 miles an hour, and then you hit the brakes and stop at a red light, and then you go to 100 miles an hour to read the next strip, and then you stop at a red light.

178
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Rym: I've always felt like, especially if it's a commentary thing, like, you should read the whole comic, and then whenever you read it again is when you look at that commentary.

179
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,380
Scott: Maybe, but the thing is, all those alt text only make any sense in the context of you just read this comic, now read this alt text.

180
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,400
Rym: No, I mean, you read the comic again, but that, like, the second time through is when you also stop and read all those bits.

181
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:28,802
Rym: Right.

182
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:39,000
Scott: This is as opposed to, say, something that does it, I think, much better, which is, like, Watchmen, where you read the whole comic, and then there's some non-comic part that you read separately, right?

183
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,100
Rym: I feel like we had to admonish a lot of people for not reading those, like, bits between the drawn parts of Watchmen.

184
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,100
Scott: There are a lot of nerds who just don't read those at all, which is, I think, that's way bad.

185
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,460
Scott: But it's like, in Watchmen, you're only hitting, you're going from 100 miles an hour to stop once, right?

186
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:59,240
Scott: You get that feeling one time, and then you read the text, right?

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,379
Scott: Here, it's like, you're reading two rows of panels, and then you're stopping, and it's sort of like, ow, ow, ow, over and over again.

188
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:15,740
Scott: And I think maybe, you know, I might have been happier just not reading those alt texts, because, like I said, only some of them were actually kind of funny.

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
Scott: The comics are all great, right?

190
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:19,136
Scott: It's like, the comics are all, like, A+.

191
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,000
Scott: But the alt texts are just sort of like, they weren't that necessary.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,160
Scott: I could have just read all the, you know, if I'd read it again, I would just skip all of them and read the panels only.

193
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,660
Rym: Yeah, because one thing about Ogloff is they're not, like, particularly funny like they are on some comics.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,772
Scott: That's true, yeah.

195
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:36,260
Scott: Anyway.

196
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:53,237
Scott: But yeah, if you are, you know, talking about, like, web comics, right, and quality level, like, Ogloff is actually, you know, of the web comics I've read in my life, which is quite a few, I think it's pretty high ranking in terms of, right?

197
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:57,700
Rym: It's current level of funniness compared to every other web comic I read.

198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,279
Rym: I think it's the funniest web comic I read right now.

199
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,820
Scott: It might be, like, a top ten all-time web comic period, right?

200
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:04,080
Scott: Oh, easily.

201
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,620
Scott: But it's just sort of, like, under-represented in terms of, you know, its popularity.

202
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,481
Scott: I don't know how popular it actually is, but in terms of its, you know, how much praise it gets, I think it's lessened, and because of its X-rated nature, it's like.

203
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:22,100
Scott: they're not, like, you know, tweeting out and stuff, right?

204
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,460
Scott: Even on their Patreon, it's like, yeah, they only put other stuff on Patreon.

205
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,680
Scott: They don't put, you know, certain things on there, right?

206
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,280
Scott: Even though Patreon has had a history of being full of porn.

207
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,580
Scott: I guess they can start an OnlyFans.

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,279
Scott: If there was an Ogloff OnlyFans, I would make an OnlyFans account.

209
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,216
Rym: I think I might, too.

210
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:52,260
Rym: It is a shame that it's hard to, like, make a space for adult content that isn't just gross, like, just generic content of any kind that happens to also include these sexual and mature themes.

211
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,960
Rym: That is not necessarily pornographic.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,020
Scott: Yeah, Ogloff isn't regular old porn.

213
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,240
Scott: It's not, like, Fritz the Cat kind of situation.

214
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:08,380
Scott: It's not a anime porn game on Steam situation.

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,920
Rym: It's just like there'll be a joke that's about D&D, but that joke may involve a penis, because penises are funny.

216
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:19,640
Scott: It's funny comic that would be in the Playboy magazine without the rest of the Playboy magazine.

217
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:25,560
Scott: It's like just tear that comics page out of the Playboy magazine and have it on its own situation.

218
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,299
Scott: And also it's better than anything that's ever in a Playboy magazine.

219
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,160
Scott: And yeah, that's what Ogloff's all about.

220
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:41,700
Scott: So you missed the Kickstarter, but you can still buy the books on Topatico, and I'm sure there'll be a Kickstarter for Volume 4 someday.

221
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,560
Rym: At some point I should get those books, but I've been reading it online for so long.

222
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,380
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure we've talked about Ogloff on the show before, but reminder, Ogloff exists.

223
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,700
Rym: Pretty sure we straight up reviewed it at one point.

224
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,086
Scott: We may have.

225
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,719
Scott: Yeah, we've definitely done webcomic shows.

226
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,479
Scott: So I'm sure we've talked about it on those.

227
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,256
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

228
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:06,980
Rym: What do you got?

229
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:28,973
Scott: So a long time ago I did a thing of the day where it was like an old Groucho Marx TV show, I think, and someone was on the show and they were trying to figure out who this person was or what had happened to them, and it was like, "Oh yeah, this person was like a child who was in Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was assassinated, and the person lived to be on

230
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,577
Scott: television."

231
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:35,400
Scott: To sort of show you how, and it gives you a new perspective on how time has passed.

232
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:48,500
Scott: And I sort of saw that occurring again, because it was MLK Day, and people love on MLK Day to, correctly, I love it too, to post color photos of Martin Luther King to show you how fucking recent that was.

233
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,856
Scott: It's like, yeah, if he hadn't been shot, he could still be alive, right?

234
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,277
Scott: It's like Betty White is alive and she's older than he was, right?

235
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:57,538
Scott: That sort of thing.

236
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,680
Scott: And yet that same phenomena came again with a YouTube video I saw linked, and this YouTube video is from 1958.

237
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:16,500
Scott: I guess '50s TV is like the perfect time for this sort of thing, because in the '50s there were still people alive from the 1800s, yet television existed, right?

238
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,660
Scott: And if any of them appeared on television, that sort of bridges that sort of time gap, right, and messes with you.

239
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:33,840
Scott: But yeah, here you have the author of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley, being interviewed by Mike Wallace for 28 minutes on CBS, right?

240
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:41,080
Scott: And the things I want to say about this are A, Aldous Huxley was right about a lot of things and wrong about a lot of things.

241
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,520
Scott: It's not some perfect genius person, either was Orwell, and I think the truth is some combination of the two, right?

242
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,220
Scott: Number two, notice the way the interview is conducted.

243
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,080
Scott: It's like Mike Wallace asks a question, Aldous Huxley gives an answer.

244
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,080
Scott: Question, answer, no one's yelling over each other, right?

245
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:06,380
Scott: The questions are actually like they're talking with some amount of depth.

246
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:10,480
Scott: It's more like what you get in a podcast in 2020 than what you get on television.

247
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,619
Rym: I gotta say, in general, 50s and 60s interviews are some of my favorite content compared to later interview styles.

248
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:33,029
Scott: Yeah, and I think, you know, in the first set of questioning in this interview, he asks him about like, you know, hey, what's like hurting freedom in the United-- what are threats to freedom in the U.S.

249
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,980
Scott: and the world that you believe exist?

250
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:40,960
Scott: And I think he somewhat wrongly talks about overpopulation, right?

251
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:50,800
Scott: But then, somewhat correctly, mostly correctly, talks about, you know, technological threats to freedom, which we have seen being very right.

252
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,860
Scott: So this is worth 28 minutes of your time, I guess, right?

253
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,179
Rym: I'm definitely going to watch this like right after we do the show.

254
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:13,140
Scott: But also, I want to say, if anyone knows, right, because the YouTube algorithm has been actually quite bad at recommending more of these to me, even though I've watched all the ones I've confined, I think you sort of have to know they exist.

255
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,899
Rym: Did you watch the Salvador Dali one?

256
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,659
Scott: Yeah, I've seen Dali, yes.

257
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:32,424
Scott: But yeah, if anyone knows any more like super old TV interview with person you think, you know, who you would think wouldn't have been on TV, right, you know, kind of thing, let me know.

258
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,120
Scott: I can make more things for the day or just enjoy watching them.

259
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,357
Scott: Maybe we should make a YouTube playlist, you know, something.

260
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,900
Scott: I've been a fan of the YouTube playlist lately.

261
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,579
Rym: I find that that helps me tune my own algorithm, and also it lets me like bucket types of content that I want to share with other people instead of just going to my own likes.

262
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Scott: Right, also archive.org, right, good venue for this sort of thing.

263
00:18:52,521 --> 00:19:00,220
Scott: The other thing I want to point out is that I did go through the effort to confirm that this was real and not some sort of deep faked thing.

264
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:07,240
Scott: If it was a deep fake thing, god damn you did a great job of posting stuff all over the internet to make me believe it was not a deep fake thing.

265
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:16,880
Scott: But the second thing I want to say is we should make a deep fake thing along these lines.

266
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:27,279
Scott: If we can make it as good as this black and white, we don't even need color, we can make a black and white low res video, right, and voice act it.

267
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:34,079
Scott: Or use some sort of AI on like samples of Mike Wallace's voice to get one half of it.

268
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:47,759
Scott: And all we need is audio of someone else's voice, so we can find like a person who didn't live long enough for TV, but has a lot of radio, and get their voice, right, use AI to then type text and have it speak like them.

269
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:53,077
Rym: You know the worst thing is though, hold on, we could get them to then promote gig nights from the 50s.

270
00:19:54,821 --> 00:20:00,060
Scott: We could do that, I was going to say, they'd be dead, we can't get them to do anything.

271
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,660
Rym: Just drag that corpse out of the earth and get it to sell some products.

272
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,440
Scott: But I'm saying, let's make deep fakes of old public domain people, right.

273
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,480
Rym: I think our code of ethics would be we'd only ever make them say true and righteous things.

274
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:27,940
Scott: Obviously it would be, who knows what we're going to make it say, but the point is, we would not be evil, right, we would put the hint there, right, we wouldn't actually try to deep fake it, we would be like, yeah, this is fake y'all.

275
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:37,160
Scott: You know what the bigger danger to us is, you and me specifically, is-- It would be fake, it would be obviously fake in the way that War of the Worlds is fake, talking about old radio.

276
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,795
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

277
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,960
Rym: Now I'm thinking more that we've been podcasting longer than almost anyone has been podcasting.

278
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:46,000
Scott: Oh, you want to deep fake Scott Rym?

279
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:55,360
Rym: I think it would be, with the data set that exists, it would be pretty trivial to train one of those deep fake audio algorithms to get both of our voices perfectly.

280
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:03,260
Scott: I think that is correct, anyone could do that with our Creative Commons licensed MP3s that are freely available on the internet.

281
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,040
Rym: I welcome you to do this, just as long as you never make me or Scott say Nazi shit.

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,040
Scott: Please do this, so that way-- Plausible deniability.

283
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:19,557
Scott: If Rym decides he wants to bail, I can make a podcast and just type what he's saying, or vice versa.

284
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,880
Rym: If Scott decides to bail, the problem, what if we both bailed and the AI just starts making GeekNights forever, it's just like, I was biking to work today, were ya?

285
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,620
Rym: I just shaved with my safety razor.

286
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:46,657
Scott: Also, I could, for example, go to a-- you could go to a convention, I could just type what I was going to say, and then the deep fake me on the video screen can just do my part, I don't have to go there.

287
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,140
Scott: Lots of good stuff, anyway.

288
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:52,680
Rym: I just miss going to conventions.

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,767
Rym: So anyway, my thing of the day, there is an old, there's an 80s manga.

290
00:21:57,248 --> 00:22:03,700
Rym: that was also an 80s anime that I doubt any of you have seen called Genga Nagaraboshigan.

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:04,977
Rym: I've never heard of it.

292
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,698
Rym: It's about dogs.

293
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,259
Rym: It's about a bunch of dogs.

294
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,479
Scott: Is it like What's Michael, which is about cats?

295
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:19,019
Rym: Uh, so it's about a bunch of dogs who go off to fight this really powerful bear, but it's like-- It's nothing like What's Michael.

296
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
Rym: But it's like a war movie, like a war story, but it's just dogs.

297
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Scott: Oh, like the penguin one, the penguin war one.

298
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,248
Rym: Yeah, except they are just dogs.

299
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,300
Rym: Like, there is no-- they're dogs dogging.

300
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,947
Scott: Okay, okay, I think I may have.

301
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:35,100
Scott: actually, now that you've described it, I may have seen some images of it.

302
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,059
Rym: You've probably seen images of it, but you've probably never read it or seen even one second of the information.

303
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,059
Rym: I never had either.

304
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:49,914
Rym: So our friend Judith pointed me, because this is up Judith's alley, like dogs doing this kind of thing, like that's a-- You know, like there's weird manga that only I'm into.

305
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:50,780
Rym: This is a Judith thing.

306
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Rym: And Judith pointed me at this YouTube video, and this YouTube video is a condensed version of the musical stage show that was put on very recently.

307
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,860
Rym: that is an adaptation of this manga.

308
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,499
Scott: Is it like cats only dogs?

309
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,260
Scott: Yes.

310
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,920
Scott: And plus war?

311
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:24,380
Rym: It is a bunch of hot guys dressed up as like basically dog furries doing this musical, and this video is ten minutes of like choice bits from it with subtitles.

312
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,186
Rym: I approve.

313
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,360
Scott: I approve strongly.

314
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,754
Rym: This is fucking amazing.

315
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:28,280
Rym: The look.

316
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,860
Scott: That's right.

317
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:40,080
Rym: You've got to see it to believe it, and the thing that I want to point out to you to pay attention to are, look at how hot these guys are, and two, look at the bear.

318
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:46,198
Rym: The bear is basically a Fist of the North Star villain singing his song-- Is it Zangief?

319
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:48,199
Scott: Street Fighter?

320
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,129
Rym: No, he's a little more refined than Zangief.

321
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,499
Rym: He's more like hot, massive guy.

322
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:53,937
Rym: Gaston?

323
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:05,980
Rym: Yeah, with big like bear paw hand glove things, and he just appears like above the stage singing this song about how fucking great it is to be a murderous bear, and how no one will ever kill him.

324
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,360
Scott: So Gaston from 3D and the Beast.

325
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,619
Scott: That was right the second time.

326
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,360
Rym: I don't know if you need to watch the entire musical for real, but watch this video at least.

327
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:24,318
Rym: And if you enjoy this video, it's probably worth your while to see the actual musical, but I don't know if it's worth your while to watch this 80s anime.

328
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:39,020
Scott: I do wonder if in the post-pandemic United States, right, if there is a greater, you know, hunger for, you know, theater, concerts, those sorts of things, right?

329
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,742
Rym: I think there will be.

330
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:45,600
Rym: I feel like I'm gonna go kind of crazy once I can go outside again, like going to theaters.

331
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:55,120
Scott: It's hard to do anything on Broadway because Broadway is owned by a very few small number of people who only let certain things on their stages, right?

332
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:06,060
Scott: It's a very controlled platform, but, you know, I wonder if community theater instead of, you know, most community theaters, they just sort of put on all the old plays, right?

333
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,799
Scott: You know, existing famous plays is what they put on, right?

334
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:18,960
Scott: Would there be some sort of, you know, market, because it seems like in Japan, you see a lot of, "Oh yeah, we put on this, this is like a stage show for a fucking yoga pedal," right?

335
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,520
Scott: It's like, you know, all kinds of stuff has like these, they put stuff on stage that normally wouldn't be.

336
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,486
Scott: It's like, how come no one in the U.S.

337
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:32,779
Scott: is like, and I don't even watch these things, right, but like, you know, what are the popular TV shows in the

338
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:33,099
Scott: U.S.,

339
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Scott: right?

340
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Scott: Why isn't there like The Wire on stage, Sopranos on stage, Breaking Bad on stage, Game of Thrones on stage?

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,399
Rym: Like you don't cover the whole show, you just do like this.

342
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:54,780
Scott: You could just make like a, you know, two hour show, two and a half hour, you know, whatever, just, you know, take whatever popular fucking thing is on TV, you know.

343
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,132
Scott: They tried Spider-Man, that didn't work.

344
00:25:58,876 --> 00:25:59,820
Scott: Avengers might work.

345
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,339
Rym: It turned out that dark, all right.

346
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:04,760
Scott: But that would be on Broadway, Disney owns Broadway theaters, right?

347
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,950
Rym: I think part of it might be licensing issues.

348
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,032
Scott: I feel like I worry that more- No, but I'm saying the people that make those TV shows should just do it themselves.

349
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,520
Scott: Don't license it to some, you know, whatever, right?

350
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,800
Scott: You know, make it, do it yourself, make it happen.

351
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:22,800
Rym: I, my best guess is that they just don't think there'd be enough return for them.

352
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,281
Scott: Right.

353
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:28,700
Scott: If I was a producer at a TV show, I would be like, all right, our TV show ended its run.

354
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:34,000
Scott: Let's try to get it on stages in places just to make more money and see what happens.

355
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,080
Scott: And if it worked to any extent, everyone else would do the same thing and that would start a whole thing.

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:47,720
Rym: You know, like a cross media thing where like every year or two, you just got to make one thing to rekindle interest in your whole like IP back catalog of whatever that thing is.

357
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,759
Rym: Like Adventure Time, they're just releasing this HBO thing every now and then.

358
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:52,120
Rym: Yep.

359
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,802
Rym: But go big.

360
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:56,460
Rym: If there was an Adventure Time musical stage play, I would go see that.

361
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,345
Scott: I'd see that shit.

362
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,451
Scott: Opening night, let's go.

363
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,039
Scott: I don't care how crappy that is.

364
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,100
Scott: Let's see it from there.

365
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,261
Rym: All right.

366
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:12,419
Rym: In the meta moment, I have not read any more Tale of Hanzo yet because I read- I'm going to read it real, I'm feeling a reading mood lately.

367
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,240
Rym: Well, I'm starting to feel it too, partly because I can't go outside anymore.

368
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,099
Scott: The only thing between me and that book is volume three of Ogloff.

369
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:25,960
Rym: Well, I did pre-order Chainsaw Man, volume three, but that does not take long to read.

370
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,833
Scott: Oh, I read the digital edition.

371
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:28,680
Scott: I didn't read the paper one.

372
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,402
Rym: Oh, yeah.

373
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:32,240
Rym: I pre-ordered the digital version, meaning it'll just appear in my Comixology.

374
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,127
Scott: Oh, okay.

375
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:33,714
Scott: Okay.

376
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:34,119
Scott: Yeah.

377
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,981
Rym: So, yeah.

378
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:51,939
Rym: Otherwise, you may recall a while ago, we appeared, quote, finger quotes, at MagWest for the first time because it was online and we did a panel that was a- So, we didn't have time to like write a new talk.

379
00:27:52,581 --> 00:28:00,820
Rym: So, we took that old like hour long play dirty to win and we tried to do it as condensed and like fast as possible.

380
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,230
Rym: I almost think this version is better and that it's more usable and practical.

381
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:10,259
Rym: if you just want to win because it's literally just do this, do this, do this, do this, trust us.

382
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:16,291
Rym: So, but they're like, there's no chatter.

383
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,414
Rym: We didn't do anecdotes.

384
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:20,620
Rym: It was really hard to put this together because we are used to talking.

385
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:34,220
Rym: Like we've spent so long doing panels that my brain, when I start talking to people, just says like there's this intrinsic timer of you've got 58 minutes and I just everything ends in exactly 58 minutes for me no matter what.

386
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:39,619
Rym: It was really hard to make this panel happen, but we did it and now it's on our YouTube channel and you can just watch it.

387
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,540
Rym: If you didn't see it live, add MagWest.

388
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:46,100
Scott: I guess you should also mention MagFest as having like a huge drama.

389
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,020
Rym: I was trying to not mention it because I don't want to get involved in nerd convention drama.

390
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,404
Scott: Well, I think that's what I want to say, right?

391
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:54,825
Scott: Is like.

392
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:01,860
Scott: people are aware there's a huge MagFest drama and they might come looking to us since we have appeared at MagFest so many times.

393
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:09,253
Rym: I've been, I've been added in threads about this on Twitter by three different people trying to get me to comment on it.

394
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:12,380
Rym: Someone posted in our forum trying to get us to comment on it.

395
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,180
Scott: Right.

396
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Scott: So the thing is, is like, it's such a drama and I'm not like, even though we appear at MagFest, you know, have gone to it so many years in a row.

397
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,983
Scott: Like I don't know these people.

398
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,005
Scott: I don't know the staff.

399
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:24,366
Scott: I don't.

400
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:31,120
Rym: And it's like, you know, I know on the staff, I know, like I know the people that like I work with to set up our gig.

401
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:35,598
Scott: The people in the person in the majors department and the person in the panels department.

402
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:35,960
Scott: That's it.

403
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,331
Rym: We are hired guns.

404
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,039
Rym: We are brought in.

405
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,100
Scott: And we have a friend, we have one friend who is on staff who hasn't told us anything.

406
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,044
Scott: So it's like, there's a drama there.

407
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:52,000
Scott: The drama is so deep and it's not some simple drama that I can just like make heads or tails of easily and be like, yes, no.

408
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,567
Scott: It's like a complex twisted drama.

409
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,051
Scott: And there's all these documents and stuff.

410
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:57,595
Scott: And it's like, I don't have time for that.

411
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:58,037
Scott: Right.

412
00:29:58,117 --> 00:29:59,180
Scott: I can't figure this out.

413
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:03,012
Scott: So I'm basically not touching that drama with a thousand foot pole.

414
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:03,393
Scott: Right.

415
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:04,878
Scott: It's like, it's got nothing to do with me.

416
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:05,380
Scott: Right.

417
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,243
Scott: It's got nothing to do with GeekNights.

418
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:11,815
Scott: We'll wait until that drama ends when the drama has ended, because it still hasn't ended.

419
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,700
Scott: It's like ongoing continuous drama.

420
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:20,134
Scott: When it ends, then we'll go and we'll see what the right thing to do is.

421
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:22,400
Scott: Until then, I got nothing to do with it.

422
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:27,636
Scott: Magfest isn't happening, so I don't have to decide whether to stop attending to continue attending.

423
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:29,060
Scott: There's no Magfest anything happening.

424
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,120
Scott: So I'm just going to continue in the meantime, not going to the non-existent Magfest until such a time.

425
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:48,200
Scott: If Magfest returns and the drama has been sorted out and we can figure out the drama is, you know, whatever the answer is to it, then we'll say something.

426
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,852
Scott: Until then, don't come looking to us for answers on Magfest drama.

427
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,720
Scott: Go to people who are way more involved in Magfest than we are.

428
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,645
Rym: I will say that Google Drive, you refused to read.

429
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:00,268
Rym: I did read everything in that thing.

430
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:04,096
Rym: And I still have no fucking comment, no opinion.

431
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,320
Rym: I could not make head or tails of it.

432
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,633
Scott: I got nothing to say about that.

433
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:12,360
Scott: No comment.

434
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:18,560
Rym: The only convention drama I'll be involved in is when I am running a convention, and I haven't run a convention in a while.

435
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,979
Rym: So, Chainsaw Man.

436
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,660
Scott: So I heard about Chainsaw Man from the Twitters, obviously, other people, right?

437
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,816
Scott: And it sounded like, you know, a Shonen manga with some ridiculousness, sort of like in the One Punch Man zone.

438
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,500
Scott: It has a man in the title, right?

439
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,578
Rym: It's in Shonen Jump, and you'd always see this picture that was like, "A dude with chainsaws coming out of

440
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:43,719
Rym: him.".

441
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,086
Scott: Right, a dude with a chainsaw coming out of his face.

442
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:50,499
Scott: You're like, "That is the anime/manga style that I am all

443
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:50,780
Scott: about.".

444
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,628
Scott: A dude with a chainsaw coming out of his face called Chainsaw Man.

445
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:54,832
Scott: That's amazing.

446
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:57,319
Scott: I think that's all I need to know to know that this is A+.

447
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,255
Scott: But, I read a summary, and the summary had my opinion lowered.

448
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,720
Scott: Quite substantially, in fact.

449
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:12,520
Scott: Because the summary I read talked quite a bit about how this main character, Chainsaw Man, like, his goal was to touch boobs.

450
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:17,979
Rym: Yup, now judge anime by its cover, that is like, that is a red flag, 100 feet tall.

451
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Scott: That is a crimson flag at the top of the flagpole, seen halfway around the world.

452
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,460
Rym: Like start singing the Soviet national anthem.

453
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:30,632
Scott: I was like, "That makes me think Chainsaw Man is not gonna be good, actually.

454
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:34,159
Scott: I should just enjoy the fact that there is a person with a chainsaw coming out of their

455
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:34,420
Scott: face.".

456
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:47,019
Scott: But then, you know, there was so much tweeting, I said, "Okay, I will read, Chainsaw Man is available for cheap in digital form, I will read it digitally, I will not waste bookshelf space on it, let's see what the deal

457
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,139
Scott: is.".

458
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,187
Scott: So, indeed, it was not lying.

459
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:53,580
Scott: Chainsaw Man is a man who wants to touch boobs.

460
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:58,360
Rym: Yeah, but somehow that is not the problem that I expected it to be.

461
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:05,920
Scott: They dedicated way more ink to that plotline in the summary than there actually is in the story.

462
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,690
Scott: Spoilers, I guess, he actually touches the boobs quite early on, and that stops mattering.

463
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,140
Scott: Yup, and also- And it's not in the sort of, you know, perverted anime kind of way.

464
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:30,140
Rym: It kind of is, but it's not intrinsically bad in the way that I would say it is fucking intrinsically bad when that comes up in most anime.

465
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:39,418
Scott: Yeah, and actually the lesson that he learns almost immediately is like, yeah, just touching some random person's boobs who consensually lets you touch them.

466
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,540
Scott: isn't that exciting, right?

467
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,580
Scott: It's like touching boobs with someone that you're, you know, in love with and in to be with is what you're really after.

468
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:47,724
Rym: So it got bugged me.

469
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,672
Rym: It was like, "Alright, read Chainsaw Man.

470
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:50,616
Rym: It's actually good.

471
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,399
Rym: We'll do a show on

472
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:51,479
Rym: it.".

473
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:03,440
Rym: And I think what you told, because you told me more to try to sell me on it to actually get me to read it, because when neither one of us, if either one of us recommends something to the other one, like it never gets consumed unless there's like the right tickle.

474
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,556
Scott: The right tickle was, "We're doing a Wednesday show on this.

475
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:06,980
Rym: You better read

476
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,040
Rym: it.".

477
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,620
Rym: No, the tickle you gave me was- It's cheap and digitally available.

478
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,279
Rym: You said something to the effect of, "Wait till you find out the deal with the Gun Man, like Gun Demon as opposed to Chainsaw

479
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:17,560
Rym: Man.".

480
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,819
Scott: That's right.

481
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:25,230
Rym: And when I got to that point, I went from thinking this is good to thinking this is like legit good.

482
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,780
Rym: Like that was a moment, once I learned the deal with the Gun Demon, I'm down for whatever the hell happens in the rest of this manga.

483
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:33,139
Scott: But- Yeah.

484
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,105
Scott: So the story is, plot summary, right?

485
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,891
Scott: It's a world of humans, much like our world of humans in Japan, right?

486
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,411
Scott: I guess, right?

487
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,355
Scott: Because it's a manga.

488
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:45,239
Scott: And there are demon/devils, right?

489
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,552
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:54,580
Scott: And they are a lot like how, you know, sort of like a polytheistic culture will have like God of this, God of that, God of this.

491
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:54,721
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,800
Rym: There's a demon of like a devil of like everything.

493
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,464
Scott: There's a demon or devil for everything, right?

494
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:07,136
Scott: Demon or devil of swimming pools, demon or devil of television, demon or devil of, you know, forks, whatever it is.

495
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:09,820
Scott: And of course, it's a demon/devil of chainsaws.

496
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,132
Scott: Yep.

497
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,382
Scott: It's just one of the things.

498
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,609
Scott: And I guess how powerful a devil is depends.

499
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:19,033
Scott: It's a lot like Rym's Forgotten Realms, right?

500
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:22,399
Scott: How many people believe in the God, the God gets stronger, right?

501
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:26,520
Rym: So- I'm amazed that you remember that much about the theology of Forgotten Realms.

502
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,387
Scott: You've gone on about it.

503
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,239
Scott: How long for how many years?

504
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,440
Rym: To be fair, that is in fact true.

505
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,089
Scott: So, you know, if people, you know, something like television would be a very powerful demon indeed, right?

506
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:44,554
Scott: But chainsaw, I mean, it's powerful because it's a fucking chainsaw.

507
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:48,500
Scott: But how many, how much, how much do chainsaws take up the mindshare of human society?

508
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:48,993
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,155
Scott: Not a very powerful large demon.

510
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:58,000
Rym: when it comes- At the same time, if you encounter a chainsaw directly, you're probably afraid of it if you're not a master of chainsaws.

511
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,042
Scott: Indeed you are.

512
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:12,100
Scott: So, what happens is this poor, sad kid encounters the chainsaw demon and somehow merges with it, which is, I guess, sort of like the plot, right?

513
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:12,418
Scott: Yep.

514
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,667
Scott: To become the chainsaw man.

515
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:17,720
Scott: Fucking literal chainsaws just coming out of his arms in space.

516
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,324
Rym: There's a pull cord in his chest.

517
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:24,575
Rym: If he pulls it, he transforms into the chainsaw man in a bloody missile.

518
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,600
Rym: Like, it's just horrific and amazing.

519
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:35,829
Scott: And he's actually quite powerful and ends up, right, that there are these demon devil hunters that are sort of part of the police, right?

520
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:46,360
Scott: And they go around stopping demons and devils, but they also have sort of demon devil people on their team to help them, right, fight demons and devils.

521
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,630
Scott: Yep.

522
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,343
Scott: And they sort of keep them under control, right?

523
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:52,751
Scott: So he becomes sort of like, you know, a tool of the police, right?

524
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:58,040
Scott: They sort of have him on a metaphorical leash, right, and use him to fight other demons and devils.

525
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:02,888
Scott: And then you get into the, right, the sort of structure of the manga, right?

526
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:05,573
Scott: It's like, oh, there's going to be a demon or devil causing trouble.

527
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:09,360
Scott: The police, along with chainsaw men, go out to deal with it.

528
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,920
Rym: Yeah, the AD police go and can't deal with it, and then they call in the special government squad.

529
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:14,201
Scott: Exactly.

530
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:18,946
Scott: And they do this over and over again, and each one they encounter is a different one.

531
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:21,449
Scott: that provides a different challenge to them.

532
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:24,311
Scott: And it's not always just some combat challenge.

533
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:32,319
Scott: It's, you know, really interesting kind of things happen with different kinds of devils doing weird shit in almost a Junji Ito-esque kind of way.

534
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,005
Rym: That's a good way to put it.

535
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,560
Rym: They are very non-human.

536
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,765
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit with each devil they got to deal with.

537
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:50,280
Scott: And then along the way, character development happens for all of the characters, the main ones being, of course, chainsaw men and the other members of this police group.

538
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:56,992
Scott: And then, of course, they're building up to the head boss, which is the gun devil, right?

539
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,896
Scott: Because guns are such a thing for humans.

540
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:00,940
Scott: The gun devil is just, like, ridiculously strong.

541
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,902
Rym: It makes a big point.

542
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:09,060
Rym: Like, there's a mass shooting in the US, the gun devil spawns and starts fucking murdering, like, everybody when it appears all over the world.

543
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:10,002
Scott: Right.

544
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:17,980
Scott: So there's also the societal message about gun control, which is a big deal coming from Japan, where guns are heavily restricted versus the rest of the world.

545
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:29,340
Rym: Now, normally, this is the kind of setup that would just be like a kind of boring shounen fighting show, or fighting manga, but as Scott pointed out, the fights aren't fights always.

546
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,560
Scott: No, not at all.

547
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,340
Rym: And they tend to be pretty quick, or if they're long, it's because, like, real plot stuff is happening.

548
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,613
Scott: Yeah, some of the longer ones sort of get into an almost Death Note-y situation, like, "What did we do about this devil?

549
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:45,535
Scott: What's he doing?

550
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,939
Scott: Why did we go up the stairs and we're still on the

551
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:48,180
Scott: floor?".

552
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,877
Rym: Yeah, the bit in the hotel, that's what I was thinking of, where the little blobby guy goes by and they're like, "Well, killing that devil didn't do anything.

553
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:54,118
Rym: Hmm.".

554
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,244
Scott: Yeah, let's solve the riddle of this devil, right?

555
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,828
Scott: So it's like, not every devil is the same kind of challenge.

556
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:12,040
Scott: It's almost like a video game where it's like, well, this is a puzzle part, and now this is a combat part, and now this is a, you know, different kind of... Like, it's a different genre, almost, for each devil, of how they get, you know, how the conflict is shaped.

557
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:21,020
Scott: So, the other thing is that artistically, right, you know, it's very good, you know, shounen manga artwork, right?

558
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:21,272
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:35,200
Scott: But, whenever the Chainsaw Man fucking cuts the shit out of some devil, there's like an incredible Blade of the Immortal, like, two-page splash image, and these are just like, fucking incredible.

560
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,820
Scott: Um, and it, you end up, I ended up staring at those for, like, a long-ass time, whenever they happen.

561
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,819
Scott: Well, you turn the page, and you're just like, "Ooh, Chainsaw

562
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:43,920
Scott: Man!".

563
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,657
Scott: Yeah, it's like, the Chainsaw Man just fucking, like, when he chainsaws, it's like, "Oh,

564
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:47,858
Scott: baby!".

565
00:39:48,901 --> 00:40:03,059
Scott: Uh, um, so yeah, it's like, those are just really fantastic, and they have you wanting the Chainsaw Man to chainsaw somebody just to see another one, and the artist, I'm sure, is like, "Please, writer, don't, let's go longer without having the

566
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,320
Scott: chance.".

567
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,755
Scott: "We don't have to draw another one of those, it took me, like, a

568
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:05,997
Scott: week.".

569
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:16,800
Rym: The other thing about it, though, that I cannot stress enough, is that it's very funny, and it's funny in a lot of different ways.

570
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:25,320
Rym: Like, it's not, like, a lot of comics and manga will have, like, very simple jokes, or, like, the same joke happens over, this is just funny in, like, surprising, random ways.

571
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:41,280
Rym: But there's, like, the two things that stand out to me very early, that I laughed out loud, was in the very beginning, when you, when he fights, like, his first devil, and the way the devil talks to him is like a shitbag, 13-year-old internet edgelord.

572
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:54,899
Rym: And the second part that made me laugh out loud, and made me decide that I love this comic, is specifically when the one cop who doesn't like him is, like, beating him up, like, "Yeah, you can't be one of us, like, just go run

573
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:55,220
Rym: away.".

574
00:40:55,862 --> 00:41:00,100
Rym: And then you turn the page, and he just starts wailing on that guy's dick.

575
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:13,900
Rym: He knees him in the nuts, and then starts kicking him in the nuts over and over and over again, and it's this whole bit about how the crotch, when I fight guys, I only aim for the crotch, and you get multiple pages of this.

576
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:23,020
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of, uh, it's sort of the same vein of humor as, like, One Punch Man, but more mature, definitely like an older audience a little bit, right?

577
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:35,280
Scott: It may be kind of the same, you know, but it definitely, you know, I guess, eh, it just feels, it has a, I don't know, a different target, it's not exactly the same, there's something else about it.

578
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:41,100
Scott: Yeah, well, it's kind of like- It's less, I guess it's less cartoony, slapsticky, I don't know.

579
00:41:41,400 --> 00:42:08,300
Rym: Yeah, like, it's weird, it's a little slapsticky sometimes, but it's always in this, like, kind of brutal, violent way, but it always sends back on how, like, the main character is kind of a, like, dirtbag piece of shit, but you also kind of can't blame him for being that way, considering how he grew up, and you see him trying to improve himself bit by bit, but always from this starting point of being this kind of dirtbag piece of shit.

580
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:19,173
Scott: He is, alright, but it's, like, he also is very introspective, and, like, you know, you'll see the main Chainsaw Man, like, thinking about, like, ah, you know, what, what should I do?

581
00:42:19,193 --> 00:42:20,174
Scott: Hmm, right?

582
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:24,400
Scott: He's actually, like, thinking about his own life, and, like, what are the right and wrong things to do?

583
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:33,409
Rym: Like, he has this really dumb goal, like, I want to touch a boob, like, cause, like, that's the kind of person he is, but the whole time he's thinking, like, oh, what does this mean?

584
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,630
Rym: Why do I want this?

585
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:44,640
Rym: And, I don't know, it's very interesting to read, like, his inner monologue in the context of the story, but then outwardly, his interaction with other characters will just be hilarious.

586
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:50,695
Rym: I also like the main girl, the cop who, like, runs the whole division.

587
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:52,100
Rym: There's something up with her.

588
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,917
Scott: He's definitely, like, that mysterious, um, reminds me of in Eccentric Family, the, the girl.

589
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:00,980
Scott: that's the bad one.

590
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:01,819
Rym: Oh, Benten?

591
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,999
Scott: Who's really, yes, reminds me of Benten.

592
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:04,480
Scott: Yeah.

593
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,579
Scott: Kind of character, a lot.

594
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,540
Rym: Kind of mysterious, like, tells people what they need to know, but clearly is omitting something.

595
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:21,960
Scott: Yeah, also in, in Patlabor, there's the, I forget her name, but there's the one that's used in a meme all the time, where, like, she shows up at the airport, and it's, like, business or pleasure, and she's, like, combat.

596
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:22,458
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,595
Scott: That character in Patlabor is very similar to that one in Chainsaw Man, also.

598
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:29,220
Scott: Same kind of character.

599
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,420
Rym: So, yeah, as long as you're down for some, uh, ultra violence from a living chainsaw.

600
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:44,820
Scott: Yeah, if you, like, if you're the kind of person who, you know, likes, takes those ridiculous ideas that are in manga and anime every so often, right?

601
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:58,740
Scott: Guy who punches someone and they explode, you know, sniper who always hits someone in one shot, guy who punches, can beat anyone with one punch, you know, any of those sort of ridiculous ones, Chainsaw Man is the latest in that line.

602
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,842
Scott: You know, a death note, right?

603
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:01,585
Scott: There's always some ridiculous thing.

604
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:10,080
Scott: This is the latest in that line of ridiculous premise shown in mangas, um, but, and it's a good one.

605
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,773
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep, I've read two volumes of the manga.

606
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:15,700
Rym: You can just get it on, like, Amazon or Comixology or whatever.

607
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,060
Scott: Yeah, I would recommend getting digital editions or if you really want paper editions.

608
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,620
Rym: The first three chapters are just free to read on Viz, so you can actually read a good chunk of it.

609
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:24,999
Scott: There you go.

610
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,739
Rym: To decide if this is your bag or not.

611
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,220
Scott: That sounds like a great idea.

612
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,979
Rym: And you'll get well past the nut shot that I was talking about.

613
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,320
Scott: Yep, and you will definitely see the Chainsaw Man chainsawing in those first three chapters, for sure.

614
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:44,658
Rym: Yeah, you know, but the, the, the, the proto-chainsaw demon or devil actually reminds- It's really cute, I want, you want, like, a toy.

615
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:53,160
Rym: I do want a little lot of plushie of that, but also kind of reminds me of, uh, it's hard to say anything about this without spoiling it, The Thing in Decadence.

616
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:57,139
Rym: The little pet in Decadence.

617
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:01,657
Rym: Being very vague there for a reason, if you haven't seen Decadence, watch it.

618
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:04,638
Rym: We reviewed it not too long ago.

619
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:10,540
Scott: It's definitely, you know, got that great combination of cute but also powerful and evil.

620
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,187
Rym: Yep, but is it really evil?

621
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,354
Rym: Because it does the right thing.

622
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,279
Rym: It's just a cute little guy.

623
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,582
Scott: Kinda.

624
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:15,596
Scott: Kinda.

625
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,090
Rym: Yeah.

626
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:16,583
Scott: Sorta.

627
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:17,420
Scott: I mean, it is a devil.

628
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:21,180
Scott: I mean, that's probably going to be a, you know, a plot point at some point.

629
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,469
Rym: I get the impression that devils, like, they're not necessarily bad.

630
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:31,339
Rym: Like, there's definitely an undercurrent of they're not all necessarily bad and they're all- The gun devil is bad.

631
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,580
Scott: Yeah, but they're driven by- I don't think there's any question about it, you know.

632
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:34,780
Scott: Like,

633
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:52,550
Rym: the, the girl devil that he meets that they kind of partner together, you see, like, you get his inner monologue, but you don't really get these other characters' inner monologue, but you can sort of infer from the way he is that if you look at those other characters, if you understand what they're trying to achieve and what they care about, even the weird things.

634
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,480
Rym: they do seem to actually make a lot of sense and they're almost trying to do the right thing.

635
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:04,699
Rym: They just have, like, weird views on morality because there's this undercurrent of the world is a late capitalist hellhole.

636
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:15,340
Rym: Like, the only reason he's even in this, like, the main character even is the way he is, is because the mafia is going to murder him unless he kills devils for them because of late capitalism.

637
00:46:16,642 --> 00:46:19,640
Scott: That part also reminded me of, like, you know, Kaiji or whatever.

638
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:20,920
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

639
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:40,240
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know, I've mentioned so many different other mangas, right, and I guess it's sort of like a mixed salad, right, of these, like, components and characters that I've seen all before, but, like, such a wide variety of them all together, right, in a new formulation, right, that it feels completely fresh.

640
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:51,780
Scott: You know, even though I can relate it, I'm relating it to all these other things, at no point when I was reading it did it feel like, "Ah, this is just X redone," right?

641
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,520
Scott: It never felt, it felt like a completely new kind of deal except for the fact that it was a shounen manga with a ridiculous premise.

642
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,735
Rym: Yep, and the last thing I'll say, because we can wrap this up, is it does not drag at all.

643
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:05,080
Rym: It moves pretty quick.

644
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,282
Scott: Oh, yeah.

645
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:16,760
Scott: All the fights, like I said, are pretty much just like, "I'm gonna chainsaw you, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw," something, and then the two-plate splash where he, you know, chainsaws something like that, and that's it, right?

646
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,107
Scott: It's not like, you know, Naruto, "I'm gonna use my wah-wah-wah technique.

647
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:22,269
Scott: Oh, no, I better use my

648
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,331
Scott: wah-wah-wah.".

649
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:24,453
Scott: None of that.

650
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:25,575
Scott: That does not happen here.

651
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:28,140
Scott: The fights are real quick when they happen at all.

652
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,537
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

653
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:41,570
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

654
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,970
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

655
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,917
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

656
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:54,650
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

657

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

658
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,524
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

659
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:05,610
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

660
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:14,350
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, and Eiji Graham-Fitz, you hold the key to my heart.

661
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:20,336
Rym: Now go through the last year or so of podcasts and make Rym sing.

662
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:34,350
Rym: Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Review, MadBull34, Cowards, Dread, Lily, Tenebrae, JustLikeADudeGuy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin, Ron Hall, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their name.

663
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:43,485
Rym: Celebrate what happened today, and you can start the work on what we gotta do for the next phase of making things better tomorrow.

664
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:46,030
Rym: But tonight, like honestly, just like breathe a sigh of relief.

665
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,750
Rym: And now, I leave you with something that has nothing to do with that.

666
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:10,639
Scott: I said it.

667
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,073
Scott: Wait!

668
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:13,568
Scott: We have more excellent advice!

669
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,548
Scott: Filthy opaque intruders.

670
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,768
Scott: Wait, I was being haughty.

671
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,148
Scott: Well, we're not.

672
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,286
Rym: Last voice, smack a pair of trash water harpies into our perfect civilization.

673
00:49:27,253 --> 00:49:27,401
Scott: Shorts!

674
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,409
Scott: Take 'em back to the tower, you guys.

675
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:33,230
Scott: This could be any run-of-the-mill cave hack.

676
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,290
Rym: Why should we believe you even?

677
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:39,850
Rym: Of course, this day is subtle.

678
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:44,930
Rym: Is this what passes through music and cotton candy land or whatever?

679
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,054
Rym: You've gotten warped, princess.

680
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:49,901
Rym: First glass boy, then the fakie Marceline.

681
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:53,510
Scott: Now you're putting faith in a princess even more helpless than you, okay?

682
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,868
Scott: It's just as we predicted.

683
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,086
Scott: Oh, shut up!

684
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,710
Scott: This is the last place the feast will happen.

685
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,229
Scott: Yeah, get in that death hole.

686
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,249
Rym: So what now?

687
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,435
Rym: Yes!

688
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:06,108
Rym: We can trap them both in there forever!

689
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,010
Rym: Shutting down the barrier?

690
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,530
Scott: Um, it's not advisable, majesty.

691
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,018
Scott: What a tragic turn.

692
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:18,550
Rym: I am so sad to tell you that your reign is over.

693
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:19,494
Rym: No, no, no!

694
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:21,090
Rym: Everyone stop taking your clothes off!
