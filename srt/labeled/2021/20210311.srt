1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,167
Rym: It's Thursday, March 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:10,368
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:13,880
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,666
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:18,618
Rym: We are talking about seasons of life.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:28,600
Rym: So, uh, I did just go outside and run, so anyone watching the stream, I'm literally, like, wearing my running clothes.

8
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:33,340
Rym: And I realized, now that I'm looking at the stream, that, uh, I'm wearing my running hat.

9
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:36,180
Rym: Which is, like, this Under Armour reflective running hat.

10
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:40,940
Rym: And it is fucking, like, the sun reflecting the spotlight on my face.

11
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:42,799
Scott: Oh, so it's, like, my head.

12
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:53,680
Rym: But, uh, so earlier today, I was just in a Twitter conversation with some games people, and they were talking about, like, Cookie Clicker-type games.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,217
Rym: And, like, "Oh, I have this urge to play, like, a garbage game like that

14
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:57,479
Rym: again.".

15
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,800
Scott: So I've been playing this Loop Hero, and there's another game I can talk about.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,980
Scott: I might talk about them a bit on Tuesday, but it is Loop Hero, and it's also a game on Steam I've been playing called Luck Be a Landlord.

17
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,960
Rym: Oh, you mentioned that multiple times, and I saw you playing.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,934
Scott: We'll talk about it on a future GeekNights.

19
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:14,820
Scott: We'll talk about Luck Be a Landlord.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,840
Rym: I think I gotta poke at that, but we will talk about that on a future GeekNights.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,860
Rym: But, uh, yeah, so, uh, I remembered a game that we've talked about, we reviewed, we used to reference a lot.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,399
Rym: A game called Candy Box.

23
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:33,139
Rym: So I went and looked up, like, "Oh, what's the current URL of Candy

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,340
Rym: Box?".

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,600
Rym: 'Cause I wanted to suggest to these people, "Hey, you want a clicker-type game to play?

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,971
Rym: This is, like, the err-clicker game.

27
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,956
Rym: Like, this is the ultimate

28
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:41,277
Rym: clicker.".

29
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,679
Scott: Yeah, man, it's definitely newer than Progress Quest, but I feel like it is.

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,999
Rym: But it did the most with that genre, I think.

31
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,600
Rym: 'Cause there was a real, there was a legit real game in there.

32
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:57,679
Scott: It's pretty much Cow Clicker, Cookie Clicker, Candy Box, and Progress Quest are, like, you know...

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,580
Rym: Yeah, Candy Box 2 almost went too far and added, like, too much of a game.

34
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,833
Scott: Candy Box 2, you can just put that in there.

35
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:04,780
Scott: It's not that exciting.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,760
Rym: Yeah, but, uh, here's the problem.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,540
Rym: When I went to look at Candy Box, I discovered that Candy Box had been updated a little bit.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,109
Rym: Like, there's a little better UX.

39
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,719
Rym: It's still the same original game.

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,260
Rym: But, like, things just work a little bit better.

41
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,260
Scott: So, that's cool.

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,057
Rym: So, I poked at it a little bit, and I made my recommendation, like, "Hey, you should play Candy

43
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:26,278
Rym: Box.".

44
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:35,639
Rym: But then I left it open in a tab and didn't think about it, and I shifted to that tab later, and I had a bunch of candies, and I clicked on everything I could click on.

45
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:39,460
Rym: And I kind of kept playing Candy Box for, like, a day.

46
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,159
Scott: Did you beat Candy Box?

47
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:46,078
Rym: I got to the point where you fight the dragon, and then part of my brain said, "Rym, fucking,

48
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:46,600
Rym: stop.".

49
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,480
Rym: And I didn't beat the dragon.

50
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:54,760
Scott: So, Candy Box 1, at least, runs entirely locally in the browser and is written in JavaScript.

51
00:02:55,862 --> 00:03:01,158
Scott: So, you can just open up your JavaScript console in the browser and just be like, "Change your number of candies

52
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:01,340
Scott: directly.".

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,779
Rym: Number of candies, number of lollipops.

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,900
Scott: Yeah, I just gave myself a zillion candies and beat the game in a few minutes.

55
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:12,820
Rym: You do still have to cast right spells in some places to get some things to happen.

56
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,720
Rym: Like, there is still a game there.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,980
Scott: Yeah, basically, I just figured out, like, anytime I needed to do... Basically, I eliminated all the waiting.

58
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:28,359
Scott: At any moment, I gave myself as much resources as I needed, and then just figured out what to click on and what order to get the game to go towards the end.

59
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,298
Scott: And that's how I beat Candy Box.

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,589
Rym: I did when I first beat it.

61
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,113
Rym: I beat it

62
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:32,898
Rym: "legit.".

63
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,188
Rym: But the way I did it is.

64
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,840
Rym: I just got the game up to a state, and then I just left it running in a tab at work for, like, a week.

65
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,620
Rym: And I just came back to it, and then I had enough candies to literally do everything in one go.

66
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:46,498
Scott: You could have just saved a week of computing time.

67
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,088
Rym: I just left the tab open.

68
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,399
Rym: That computer was doing stuff anyway.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,697
Scott: I'm just saying.

70
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,740
Scott: It's a little silly, isn't it?

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,325
Rym: Here we go.

72
00:03:54,567 --> 00:04:00,059
Rym: Let's make Candy Box, but you have to mine cryptocurrencies to make candies.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,438
Scott: Yeah, how about no?

74
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:03,736
Rym: So you got any news?

75
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:06,020
Scott: Do we have news?

76
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,099
Scott: Yeah, so here's a news.

77
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:10,480
Scott: I know it sounds like a K-pop news, but trust me, it's not.

78
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,800
Scott: It's actually related to my job somewhat news.

79
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:14,780
Scott: At least, you know, right?

80
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,260
Scott: So I work for a music publisher, but regardless, a thing happened.

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,820
Scott: There's a company called Kakao M that is basically the secret master of K-pop.

82
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:25,918
Scott: You can think of it that way.

83
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:30,200
Scott: Usually you think of these big K-pop companies.

84
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,300
Scott: They're like record labels, and they have the big groups.

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,880
Scott: But actually, almost everyone who's not in the big groups and some who are big as well are basically all under this one mega company.

86
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:50,025
Scott: that's like a distributor and an everything-in-one company, Kakao M, that they just own a large percentage of the K-pop world.

87
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,120
Scott: But regardless, the story is that they got into a fight with Spotify.

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,699
Scott: Spotify recently launched in South Korea.

89
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:00,140
Scott: Very recently.

90
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,506
Scott: This month.

91
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,514
Scott: Previous month.

92
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,240
Scott: Super recently.

93
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:16,540
Scott: And because the biggest streaming services in Korea, the biggest one I think is actually Melon, which is owned by Kakao M. So there's some shenanigans going on there.

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Scott: But anyway, they got into a fight and the vast majority of K-pop was just removed from Spotify entirely.

95
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,460
Scott: So a lot of people got mad.

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,934
Scott: For example, Tablo, a famous K-pop dude, he was like, "What's up with this

97
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:31,459
Scott: bullshit?".

98
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:39,976
Scott: Two big companies get into a fight and presumably, Spotify is fighting on behalf of the users.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:49,359
Scott: They want to keep the price of Spotify low because if they have to pay artists more money they would have to raise the cost of Spotify or reduce their profits.

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,640
Scott: Kakao M is fighting on behalf of the artists.

101
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Scott: They want more money for themselves and the people who actually make the music.

102
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,480
Scott: There's no right and wrong really.

103
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,160
Scott: Artists are underpaid.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,847
Scott: True.

105
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:07,619
Scott: Also true.

106
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,599
Scott: People aren't going to pay much more than what Spotify costs.

107
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:18,260
Scott: Spotify raises the price to 50 bucks a month, which is probably what it would take to pay artists fairly.

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,700
Scott: People aren't going to pay that and artists will have nothing.

109
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:35,319
Scott: They fight and Tablo is like, "Look, these two big companies fight and basically the people they're trying to help, the artists and the customers respectively, are both hurt.

110
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,990
Scott: The customers are without the music they want to listen to and the artists are now getting nothing for that duration because no one can listen to their music and they're going to go to YouTube or who knows where else to pirate.

111
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,657
Scott: who knows, right?

112
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:52,158
Scott: But they settled today for undisclosed terms and so now the music is back.

113
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,640
Scott: But I think it's just an interesting situation to think about, right?

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,815
Scott: Because usually when these battles go on we're coming in here like, "They're right and they're wrong and they're right and they're on this

115
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:04,058
Scott: side.".

116
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:14,957
Rym: The problem is, honestly, capitalism because we kind of talked about this when we talked about cryptocurrencies last week.

117
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:29,959
Rym: around there are some commodities that have effectively become valueless to the average consumer or if they have personal value the incremental cost of getting one versus another starts to approach zero.

118
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:32,539
Rym: for a lot of people music is like that.

119
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:39,835
Rym: They can listen to music generally and they use some services to listen to music but they don't think a lot about music.

120
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:46,120
Rym: otherwise it's not like they'll say, "Oh, well I really need to listen to this specific band so I'm jumping ship on Spotify.

121
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,889
Rym: I'm going to Kweeblo because Kweeblo has got this one

122
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,011
Rym: band.".

123
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:54,746
Scott: A lot of K-Pop people were like, "Hey, should we use YouTube Music or should we use iTunes now?

124
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,091
Scott: because Spotify was pretty much the place,

125
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:57,416
Scott: right?".

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,153
Rym: But now they're like, "Okay, it's resolved, they came

127
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:01,417
Rym: back.".

128
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:10,460
Scott: But if this had gone on longer you absolutely would have seen K-Pop fans leave, cancel Spotify and go to YouTube Music or Apple Music.

129
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:39,578
Rym: I think part of that is that K-Pop fans are, they're not monolithic don't get me wrong, but they are definitely semi-unique in the music fandom world for a lot of reasons we've talked about before as a group but also I think for most people if they move to one service or the other, not much changes because most services have most of the music that any given community will listen to unless there's a specific genre that is under or over represented on one versus the other.

130
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:41,197
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,960
Scott: But all the mainstream music is going to be, the vast majority of it is going to be on all these services.

132
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:55,319
Rym: like I got a Sonos, I literally just type "meatloaf" and I don't even care where the meatloaf comes from, do I hear it or not?

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,677
Scott: I care where the meatloaf comes from.

134
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:15,435
Rym: But if I ever type something big mainstream, generic, old into one of my devices and no music comes up, I'm going to suddenly be very surprised and try to figure out why, but that basically almost never happens.

135
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:21,660
Rym: The music I want to listen to that isn't on Spotify, is not on really any service I'm going to subscribe to.

136
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:22,156
Rym: It's not on anything.

137
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:39,520
Scott: I just see there's a lot of parallels with this between some other things we look at like Apple versus Epic, where it's like Epic is nominally fighting for the customer and Apple is sort of fighting for the developer in a way.

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,780
Rym: Or in the old days with Amazon, Amazon fights for us, the jerk buying something.

139
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:47,980
Scott: Right, but Epic sort of is a developer, so it's a little hairy.

140
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,100
Scott: But there's these battles going on where there's no... It's not just good guy and bad guy.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,487
Scott: It's like, is it two bad guys fighting?

142
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:57,620
Scott: Is it two good guys fighting?

143
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
Scott: Is it two good bad guys fighting?

144
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,559
Scott: Two gray areas battling each other.

145
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,240
Scott: It's like, oh no.

146
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:12,698
Scott: Two gray areas battle each other and you don't really know who to root for or what outcome you want, but as long as they battle everyone suffers.

147
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:23,419
Rym: But the incremental cost of listening to a song one more time is basically zero and the distribution of cost of that is also basically zero.

148
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:32,658
Rym: So we kind of destroyed how we fund new works being created and this problem is not going to get resolved in any field anytime soon.

149
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:40,079
Rym: It's not zero-sum, but it acts like zero-sum for all intents and purposes from a lot of angles.

150
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:42,640
Scott: Anyway.

151
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:55,390
Rym: So in some other news if you are looking for work or in some trouble financially right now and you're in New York but there are things like this going on in a lot of other places.

152
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,117
Rym: I'm going to link to one from New York.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:11,640
Rym: So way, way back when I desperately needed some money in high school to afford to go to college I had a job working for the government and for the time it paid really, really, really well and it wasn't the kind of job that someone like me would have thought I could get.

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,359
Rym: That's how I got my first job ever working for the US Census.

155
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:23,319
Rym: And I'll tell you in the year 1999 and 2000 that job paid $10.50 an hour.

156
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,020
Scott: That was a lot in 1990.

157
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,660
Scott: That's more than I made working at the dry cleaner and way more than the summer camps.

158
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:41,437
Scott: I worked at summer camps several times and the way they worked is you would just get one paycheck at the end of the summer for the whole time and it was way less than minimum wage.

159
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:48,859
Scott: Part of it was that the compensation also included all this lodging and food you were getting and things like that.

160
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,059
Scott: So it's a little bit fair a little bit because you don't have to pay rent while you're working at a summer camp for example.

161
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:03,815
Scott: You would work eight weeks in a row not 24/7 basically with a few days off here and there and then at the end they'd give you like $3K.

162
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:09,420
Rym: It's kind of similar to how working at an amusement park often works for people.

163
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,600
Scott: The point is that $10 an hour is real good in 1990 whatever for a high school kid.

164
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:23,680
Rym: I got my first paycheck and it was like $400 something bucks and I was like I didn't know what to do with that much money.

165
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:27,438
Scott: On the one hand it's still criminally low.

166
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,936
Scott: The minimum wage should have been more than that even then.

167
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,720
Rym: Like the fight for $15 right now was obsolete.

168
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:39,360
Scott: But it was still better than average at the time and the circumstance.

169
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,860
Rym: So right now there are a lot of jobs.

170
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:43,989
Rym: these are temporary jobs.

171
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,978
Rym: You're not going to make a career out of this at least not working for the same place.

172
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:54,740
Rym: Managing all the infrastructure which is more substantial than you might realize around getting vaccines out to people.

173
00:12:56,456 --> 00:13:06,071
Rym: The effort of getting vaccines out to Americans is one of the larger logistical projects that has ever happened in America.

174
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:10,560
Rym: This is on the level with big great depression era things that we did.

175
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:11,608
Rym: Like the CCC.

176
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:15,892
Scott: Even though it's ongoing you think oh they've already got everything.

177
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,196
Scott: It's like no we've only gotten some of the way there.

178
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:24,940
Scott: We're still giving them to only people who are like getting in New York just said okay you can make an appointment if you're 60 or over.

179
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,959
Scott: It's like when they open it up to 40 plus 30 any old adult.

180
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,060
Scott: there's going to be so many people.

181
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:37,759
Rym: And there are so many tasks that need to be done to make these things work.

182
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,112
Scott: Not just jabbing people.

183
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,079
Scott: There's a lot more jobs.

184
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,330
Rym: Think about a PACS.

185
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:47,285
Rym: How many enforcers at a PACS does it take to just keep lines together?

186
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:54,959
Rym: Now imagine keeping lines together that are an order of magnitude bigger who are not PACS attendees but regular ass people.

187
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,643
Scott: And there's a line.

188
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:58,574
Rym: And there's a pandemic.

189
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,788
Rym: so you still got to keep them like six feet apart from each other the whole time.

190
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,293
Scott: There's all kinds of problems going on.

191
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,560
Scott: And that's just one of the things you could be doing.

192
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:10,374
Rym: There are things like this all over but I'll link to one of these as an example.

193
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:17,384
Rym: In New York City right now there's a giant vaccine center at the Javits which is our terrible convention center.

194
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,040
Rym: It's a terrible convention center.

195
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,050
Scott: It's fine for vaccine distribution.

196
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,140
Rym: It is but it's not good.

197
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,786
Rym: It's a big empty room.

198
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,620
Scott: It'll get the job done.

199
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,249
Scott: You're not doing it.

200
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,665
Scott: It is perfect for this.

201
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,351
Rym: They are desperate for people to help them administer the vaccines.

202
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:43,000
Rym: They are paying $27 an hour and you can get shit tons of overtime if you're willing to just work like 12 hour shifts.

203
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:45,079
Rym: They'll pay you time and a half on top of that.

204
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,380
Scott: $27 an hour is I'd say like a fair minimum wage almost.

205
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,840
Rym: I'd say $27 an hour would be a good starting point for the new minimum wage in America.

206
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:56,398
Scott: Yeah it's close.

207
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,393
Rym: $15 is not enough.

208
00:14:58,393 --> 00:14:59,427
Scott: $27 I'd like to.

209
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:01,360
Scott: I should do the math.

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,780
Scott: If you made $6 an hour in the 50s let me get my inflation calculator.

211
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:20,676
Rym: The last time I did something like that because the metric I used the last time I looked at this was something like what is the wage it took for one person to support a family of four and buy a house in the 50s.

212
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,420
Scott: Alright so actually I think $27 might only be halfway there.

213
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:29,969
Scott: Usually I hear old people say "When I was a kid in the 50s I only got like $5 an

214
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:30,110
Scott: hour.".

215
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,440
Rym: Yeah and somehow you bought a house and like married someone and had kids and sent both of them to college.

216
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:47,463
Scott: $5 an hour in 1955 adjusted for inflation with USInflationCalculator.com in 2021 would be $49 an hour.

217
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:53,098
Scott: so $27 is halfway there.

218
00:15:54,188 --> 00:16:02,390
Rym: So the Javits they need people right now like if you call them up with your resume like there's a good chance you can get these jobs.

219
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:05,060
Rym: They need customer service people, vaccinator support.

220
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,986
Rym: they do need people who have technician training like they need pharmacists and licensed professionals.

221
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:14,191
Rym: but they also need people just to do shit like manage lines fill out paperwork.

222
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:19,379
Rym: One of these jobs is data entry just sitting at a desk typing data in from pieces of paper.

223
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:20,635
Scott: Yeah someone comes up.

224
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,877
Scott: you're like so and so got their first vaccine.

225
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,534
Scott: on this day you type it in right?

226
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,120
Scott: Who are they?

227
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,850
Scott: What's their name?

228
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:26,460
Scott: Where do they live?

229
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,440
Rym: And if you think you're not qualified for this kind of stuff.

230
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,100
Rym: that job I got for the US Census.

231
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,060
Rym: I'd never been trained in anything.

232
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:34,682
Rym: I went to high school in America.

233
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:42,373
Scott: If you know how to listen to a fucking podcast you know how to do most of those jobs.

234
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:47,564
Rym: My first real jobs were data entry and clerical work like payroll stuff.

235
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:48,330
Rym: One of my.

236
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:55,948
Rym: I sat there for four hours a day at one point looking at pieces of paper and typing numbers on those pieces of paper into a system.

237
00:16:56,856 --> 00:17:11,542
Scott: I had a lot of jobs doing filing where there would be a stack of paper and there would be a big shelves full of filing folders and you would literally take a piece of paper look at the last name find the folder and put the piece of paper in the folder.

238
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:13,159
Rym: I did that at the end of the census.

239
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,200
Scott: You just do that over and over again and I got paid money for that.

240
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,147
Rym: I did that at RIT but they didn't pay me $27 an hour to do it.

241
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,723
Scott: If you're listening to this you can do that.

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,038
Scott: I'm sure you can.

243
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,219
Scott: If someone paid $27 an hour to do that I might rather do that than what I do now.

244
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:45,897
Rym: I definitely it's interesting where on one hand I like a really challenging job but on the other hand I do sometimes think back to when I had jobs that were mindless and how I could literally 100% compartmentalize them away.

245
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:49,485
Rym: And I miss it sometimes.

246
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:53,567
Rym: but then I also remember the reality of a job like that and how boring and soul crushing it was.

247
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:57,569
Rym: Really we just need a post scarcity society and communism but we'll get there.

248
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,098
Rym: Anyway in some news that is political news but it is a big deal and there's a reason I want to talk about this.

249
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:12,236
Rym: The American rescue plan like that giant covid relief bill actually was signed into law today.

250
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:18,700
Scott: Without the aforementioned minimum wage increase but with most of the other stuff.

251
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:26,920
Rym: We can talk about that in a second because actually removing the minimum wage from this bill was probably a good idea because otherwise the bill would not have passed today.

252
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:34,078
Rym: even if the minimum wage happened it would have taken like possibly months more to pass the bill for reasons like that's beyond the scope of the show.

253
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:46,747
Rym: But as an aside because you mentioned it most not all but most of the senators who voted no on the minimum wage issued statements saying they only oppose including it in this bill.

254
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,036
Rym: they are sponsoring the next separate bill that is the minimum wage bill.

255
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:52,989
Scott: We'll see about that.

256
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,615
Rym: Yeah we'll see.

257
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:59,008
Rym: but the thing about this bill that's important is that it passed for real like this is a law.

258
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,759
Scott: This is now the law of the land in the United States.

259
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,545
Rym: And if you haven't actually looked at what it does it's not just like that stimulus check.

260
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,355
Scott: Well it's enormous.

261
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,979
Scott: I'm not sure if there's anyone who knows everything it does.

262
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,990
Rym: No the only person who knows.

263
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,960
Scott: Not any one person.

264
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,184
Rym: There is one person who knows everything.

265
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:22,831
Rym: because part of the reason why it took so long to pass this bill is you know what the Republicans did like right at the end?

266
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,133
Scott: They made him read it because the procedural nonsense.

267
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:27,577
Rym: Yep they voted to force a reading of the bill.

268
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:36,280
Rym: What that means is every single word in this bill which is like 680 pages had to be read aloud on the senate floor.

269
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:39,438
Rym: the Republicans forced that to happen and then they all left.

270
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,423
Rym: And this dude had to sit there.

271
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,100
Scott: You should have changed.

272
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:45,272
Scott: you know it's like you get what you.

273
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,493
Scott: you know that's the procedure.

274
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,240
Scott: that's in the rules.

275
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:55,780
Scott: if you don't like it you should change those procedural rules to be like alright if there's a reading every senator must sit there for the entire reading.

276
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:03,533
Scott: Common sense rule if you think that having readings should be part of the rules in the first place then make everyone sit there.

277
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:08,443
Rym: Yep well like the filibuster fuck this idea that you can filibuster something by saying I'm going to filibuster it.

278
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:11,619
Rym: If you want to filibuster something you better fucking stand there and piss your pants.

279
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,535
Scott: Well you shouldn't have that either.

280
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:15,436
Scott: you should be forced to vote at some point.

281
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:24,746
Rym: Yep but well anyway we make fun of the monarchy because that came up lately but we have the filibuster and the senate so we got our own problems over here.

282
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:31,536
Rym: But anyway this bill is honestly like the best way to describe it is transformative.

283
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:40,424
Rym: This bill does a ton of really progressive stuff the benefits of which we're going to see for like decades and decades and decades to come.

284
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,039
Rym: There's huge tax credits for people who have kids.

285
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,900
Rym: there's lots of housing assistance.

286
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:51,860
Scott: it's like this bill is a big deal and the reason I bring this up It's not like what you're used to where it's like.

287
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,074
Scott: oh you know we're here to save the day by giving money to companies.

288
00:20:55,155 --> 00:21:00,487
Rym: Yep like the previous covid relief bills that the republicans put through that didn't actually do much for us.

289
00:21:01,437 --> 00:21:04,487
Scott: Yeah so but I don't want to get any relief.

290
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,788
Rym: Yep but this bill will like.

291
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:13,252
Rym: this is one of the biggest pieces of legislation America has ever passed in the modern era dollar wise.

292
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,467
Rym: Yep and also in terms of what it changes it's on par with the ACA.

293
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:35,457
Rym: you know Obamacare but the reason I bring this up as news is that the Democrats you know the not evil party I'm not necessarily saying the good party just the not evil party they are doing a very different strategy with this bill compared to what happened the last time.

294
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:40,140
Rym: they passed a big bill like this because in America they passed the ACA.

295
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:48,850
Rym: what you know is Obamacare which radically transformed America and got healthcare to a lot more people and honestly like just made America a better place.

296
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:55,900
Rym: it was a really good bill and what it did was actually very popular in America among all Americans.

297
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:59,399
Rym: even republicans were very happy with what the bill did.

298
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,556
Rym: the problem was they hated the bill.

299
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:08,812
Rym: that disconnect is a big part of why American politics got so broken and extreme so quickly.

300
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:33,160
Rym: the Democrats basically lost the house and lost a lot of representation and like lost on the issue of this bill being passed despite this bill being very popular partly because what they had assumed was that if they passed a bill that radically reformed healthcare for the better they would get credit for the fact that they had radically reformed healthcare for the better and would be able to build on that foundation.

301
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:47,260
Rym: but the assumption that because you did a good thing the people who benefit from it will understand what you did is false similar to the idea that if I make some good software like if I design a really good game of course people will play it.

302
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,268
Rym: it's a really good game.

303
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,739
Rym: why wouldn't they play it?

304
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:55,639
Rym: the reality is if you don't also market and like tell people about the thing people will never find out about the thing.

305
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:59,440
Scott: yeah people don't know and people are you know ignorant.

306
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:00,660
Scott: they're not paying attention.

307
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,039
Scott: they've got other things going on.

308
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:06,711
Scott: they've been lied to by someone else who's in their ear right.

309
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:10,631
Scott: there are so many reasons besides just being you know.

310
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,419
Scott: some you know you obviously are thinking of.

311
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,964
Scott: you know the stereotypical republican who lives in the hills listening to some right wing radio people right or watching the faux news.

312
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:23,396
Scott: but there's a lot of other people that you know don't.

313
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
Scott: for a wide variety of reasons.

314
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:32,387
Scott: you just will not learn or learn the wrong thing because you need to control right.

315
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:32,710
Scott: it's like.

316
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:33,880
Scott: is it propaganda?

317
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,250
Scott: yes but there's propaganda on the opposite also.

318
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,980
Rym: you know what there's a real.

319
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,458
Rym: if you don't tell your own story someone else is going to tell your story for you.

320
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:47,076
Scott: right and it's like.

321
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:51,159
Scott: the problem with propaganda is when the propaganda isn't true.

322
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,840
Rym: if your propaganda is all true what's the problem?

323
00:23:55,982 --> 00:24:06,508
Scott: yup hey everyone get a vaccine they work and not having not putting out true propaganda you're just leaving a huge vacuum for false propaganda to exist.

324
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:10,920
Scott: you can't stop anyone else from doing it in a society with free speech exactly.

325
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,279
Scott: so you need to put the truth.

326
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,115
Scott: propaganda out there.

327
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:18,468
Scott: right and you know propaganda is a bad word.

328
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,610
Scott: but if it's true why is that bad?

329
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,305
Rym: and that's what's different here.

330
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:23,880
Rym: this is something i want you to internalize.

331
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:35,558
Rym: if you're thinking about american politics the the democratic party and i'm not saying this is a an unapped application to them has never been super good about getting its message out there for a lot of reasons.

332
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,520
Rym: and the big difference between right now and the last time they passed a big bill.

333
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:42,328
Rym: is they real?

334
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:48,673
Rym: like they've learned from their mistakes like they have openly talked about at length into too long?

335
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,938
Rym: yep they've talked about like.

336
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,156
Rym: why did we fail?

337
00:24:53,217 --> 00:25:05,380
Rym: why did we lose the messaging battle on obamacare one of the most popular bills that ever passed and they took those lessons to heart and they are spending a lot of time like they're going to advertise the fact that this bill passed.

338
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:18,428
Rym: one of the things like they are really focused on making it clear that that people understand that this bill that is going to help a lot of people passed because of the democrats and that no republicans voted for it and you can see it starting to work.

339
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:32,754
Rym: multiple republican senators have praised this bill already and said oh yeah this is going to help my constituents and the democrats immediately started running ads and pushing the message out making it clear that you so and so voted against.

340
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:34,131
Rym: yeah you voted against this bill.

341
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,672
Rym: fuck oh you don't get credit for this.

342
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:40,654
Rym: you actively opposed us doing this mm-hmm.

343
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:46,960
Rym: this is a profound shift in how american politics has gone for the last like several decades.

344
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:54,086
Rym: i don't know if this will work but i want you to notice that like pay attention to how this messaging is different.

345
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,106
Rym: democrats ain't perfect but they are trying a different strategy.

346
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:09,080
Rym: if you're losing against hades over and over again in hades and you never change your strategy that's not you like if you're trying to make the sword and artemis work against hades.

347
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:10,658
Rym: that's real fucking hard like.

348
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:13,526
Scott: but also the propaganda angle right.

349
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,828
Scott: also the propaganda angle again right.

350
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:20,209
Scott: it's like we at least hopefully anyone listening to this right.

351
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,200
Scott: you can recognize that it's propaganda.

352
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:32,252
Scott: if you can think about it in the meta then hasn't it lost its power to just like mindlessly brainwash you like we talk about with ads?

353
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,280
Rym: i know it's an ad.

354
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:35,523
Rym: i'm immediately suspicious of it right?

355
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:45,059
Scott: so when you see the messaging coming you know whether it's from whoever it is the good people or the bad people or some other third party who knows right.

356
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:59,365
Scott: consider all of it in the meta circumstance the way we're discussing the strategy in the meta circumstance to keep your head in the correct place whenever a message is sent to you or like like given to you or you see propaganda like.

357
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:07,970
Rym: think specifically who is putting this message in front of me what are they trying to convey and what motive might they have?

358
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:08,233
Rym: like?

359
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:17,506
Rym: those are the three things to ask yourself because if you know the who you know the motive and you know the what you can evaluate this message and understand what's going on.

360
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:29,423
Rym: you can also protect yourself from bad propaganda and dangerous lies yep and you can also help spread the messages that might allow us to achieve better goals.

361
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:39,955
Rym: so if the who is democrats the goal is get people to understand that this bill helped them and the motivation beyond that is so that we can then pass more bills that are like this.

362
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:42,554
Rym: that's a message to share.

363
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:46,274
Rym: even though we didn't get everything we wanted like we still need the $15 minimum wage.

364
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:47,969
Rym: that's like a baby step.

365
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,979
Rym: we still need to fight for that.

366
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,807
Rym: but don't tank the messaging of.

367
00:27:51,848 --> 00:28:00,268
Rym: we did do something because we didn't do one of the hundred things we could do alright.

368
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:05,586
Scott: so one of the hundred things we could have done that we didn't do was cancel the rent anywhere.

369
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:06,513
Scott: pretty much right.

370
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:17,180
Rym: we delayed evictions in some places I guess depending on your state the different lots of technicalities mostly we just take that can down the road of misery and it's going to be a bad situation.

371
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,249
Rym: still right.

372
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,411
Scott: so the bad situation is an example.

373
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:24,799
Scott: I want to highlight this example of the bad situation coming because it hits close to home.

374
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:26,414
Scott: right.

375
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:32,440
Scott: you know most of the cases in which people have said oh no this pandemic is going to cause me to go out of business.

376
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:41,160
Scott: right you know on the one hand obviously sympathetic someone losing their business is not good but if you think about it on the whole it's like okay.

377
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:56,460
Scott: you've basically just decided that instead of paying people's rent and letting them off the hook you're just going to have businesses go out of business and then when the pandemic is over people can start new businesses right from nothing and you know to like if your local pizza place goes away.

378
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:02,980
Scott: and then it's like okay well no one's buying pizza right now but in two years from now start a new pizza place and now we have pizza again.

379
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:11,040
Scott: right it's not like you know in the grand picture while it sucks for the previous pizza owner in the grand picture it's not you know.

380
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,675
Scott: like the worst yeah of course there's.

381
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:19,787
Rym: the asterisk of capitalism has made this all much worse than it needed to be obvious yes but here's an example where no right.

382
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:28,940
Scott: this is why we still needed to cancel the rent and why just saying oh go out of business and come back later is not a good enough answer.

383
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:33,929
Scott: so there is a place in New York and Chinatown called the Jing Fong dim sum.

384
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:37,203
Scott: right and now there's plenty of dim sums in New York City.

385
00:29:37,223 --> 00:29:42,356
Scott: if you don't know dim sum it's like the greatest Chinese food experience you can have right if you've never?

386
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:43,689
Rym: you said you've never heard of it.

387
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,203
Rym: just find a place that has it.

388
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:47,326
Rym: go there on like a Sunday morning and have a grand old time.

389
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:48,420
Scott: that's right.

390
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:51,405
Scott: so there's some in Flushing there's others in Chinatown.

391
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:52,274
Scott: there's plenty.

392
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:56,198
Scott: we're not going to be without dim sum in New York City probably ever right.

393
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:02,058
Scott: we've been without it for a while but we're going to be going back into it as soon as it's safe.

394
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,956
Rym: I'm already hungry and I have not had dim sum since February.

395
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,340
Rym: no late January.

396
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:18,026
Rym: I'm salivating for dim sum specifically late January 2020. yeah late January 2020.

397
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,837
Rym: I had some dim sum.

398
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:26,540
Scott: I probably hadn't had it since 2019 but Jing Fong was it the best dim sum?

399
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:33,158
Scott: I don't think so but it was very good definitely good enough and I went there many times.

400
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,900
Scott: there are obviously people who went there way more than me.

401
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:38,240
Scott: I've gone there with like co-workers.

402
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,579
Scott: I've gone on dates there.

403
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,900
Scott: I've gone there with friends there.

404
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:48,533
Scott: I have a lot of memories going to there even though it's maybe been only double digit number of visits in my life.

405
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:56,791
Scott: right and the thing about that place is that it was just this enormous ballroom like in New York City.

406
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:01,680
Scott: you do not see a room this big often and it's like you would go there.

407
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:07,600
Scott: you would take an escalator up to the second floor and then they would seat you at these enormous circular tables.

408
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:33,239
Scott: you would usually be sitting with strangers unless you had a lot of friends with you and the room was just huge and it's like people would be going around bringing food everywhere and then it would also be like someone sitting at a desk just like in the middle of the ballroom and they're like taking reservations because people having birthday parties there, office functions there, award ceremonies, like any kind of event you could book, you only needed a portion of the room, you didn't even need the whole room.

409
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:47,659
Scott: sometimes they'd wall off a part of the room to have an event because it's like you don't need that much space, it was so enormous and it was just such a unique experience eating at this place and obviously I wouldn't be talking about it if they weren't shutting it down.

410
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:55,180
Scott: they have no choice financially because of the situation and not cancelling rent and a jerk landlord.

411
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:57,760
Scott: they have no choice.

412
00:31:57,902 --> 00:31:58,832
Scott: it's like they're going down.

413
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:07,520
Scott: goodbye, it's closed, you can never go there again, you'll have to go get your dim sum somewhere else and it's like oh, just come back later.

414
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:10,979
Scott: it's like a place like this can't come back later, right?

415
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:19,600
Scott: you can open up a new dim sum restaurant in New York with the same chefs I guess, they make the same food but you can't get that ballroom back.

416
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:23,498
Scott: it's going to be carved up into apartments or who knows what the heck they're going to do with it.

417
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:32,900
Scott: turn it into something but you're not going to find another space to get that large square footage to have that same experience.

418
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:43,258
Scott: and the amount of money it would cost to renovate it and to get all those tables and the way the room was decorated it would probably cost six figures just to renovate.

419
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:47,399
Scott: even if you got a room just to renovate it to look like that.

420
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,940
Scott: probably we're talking cheap decorations.

421
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:53,600
Rym: I'm still talking seven.

422
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,959
Scott: those aren't actual gold dragons on the wall.

423
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,100
Scott: it's just like stuff painted with gold paint.

424
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:12,099
Scott: but the point is it's basically impossible unless a rich person bails them out because capitalism that's it.

425
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,120
Scott: there's no hope whatsoever.

426
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:16,590
Scott: no amount of crowdfunding would be enough.

427
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,980
Scott: they could not crowdfund enough to rescue this.

428
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:20,800
Scott: it would be so expensive.

429
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,260
Rym: this kind of story is going to play out all over America.

430
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:40,040
Rym: the previous topic about messaging and propaganda do not let the public consciousness forget all the things that we've lost that we don't realize we lost yet that we're going to discover that we've lost as we enter a post-Covid society.

431
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:42,979
Scott: we're not talking about replaceable things that were lost.

432
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,119
Scott: a local pizza joint went away and a new one came in.

433
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:54,020
Scott: we're talking about the unreplaceable experience here and it's just one place but there will be many such places.

434
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,500
Rym: it's a tiny thing but Burger Garage.

435
00:33:56,762 --> 00:34:00,278
Rym: I don't think a place like that could come back to Queens like this part of Queens.

436
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,820
Scott: we lost Malu and that was way pre-Covid and no ice cream has been.

437
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:14,379
Rym: we got some good ice creams now nothing close to Malu that awesome nerdy dude who ran that shop.

438
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:15,398
Rym: I miss that dude.

439
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:18,159
Rym: we talked about him the other day.

440
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:22,518
Rym: Emily and I were actually thinking about what's going to be out there post-Covid.

441
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:29,079
Scott: we have Ample Hills which is really good ice cream and has lots of interesting flavors but it's not Malu.

442
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,475
Scott: it's still A+ tier.

443
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:37,877
Scott: we had that S tier ice cream and now we have a different A+/S tier ice cream but it's not that S tier ice cream.

444
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:59,859
Rym: as we enter a post-Covid society and we start to try to live our "normal lives" again we have to make it very clear societally what we lost and it has to be abundantly clear we need to talk about and make sure that message gets spread that we didn't have to lose those things.

445
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,159
Rym: most of what we've lost to Covid on this scale, I'm not talking about humans who died though many of those were also preventable.

446
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:18,317
Rym: a good chunk of the things we lost to Covid did not need to be lost but in America one political party forced us to lose them and the other political party didn't do enough to stop them.

447
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:25,919
Rym: don't let the government get away with letting us lose all these things.

448
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:37,460
Rym: remember that we could have saved a lot of them but anyway things of the day.

449
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:49,637
Rym: on a lighter note a while ago I did The Legend of Beavis and if you recall The Legend of Beavis reeked of effort, it was way higher quality than it had any right to be or even needed to be.

450
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:51,780
Rym: it was just so tightly done.

451
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:53,600
Rym: this is another one of those things.

452
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:57,119
Rym: it's from January of 2021. it's relatively recent.

453
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:01,580
Rym: it's called Life as a Bokoblin a Zelda nature documentary.

454
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:03,779
Rym: this shit is 20 minutes long.

455
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:11,380
Rym: it is a full BBC style documentary on the lives of Bokoblins.

456
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:15,138
Rym: the production values on this are off the charts.

457
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:17,136
Rym: we started watching it.

458
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,140
Rym: last night we watched a few minutes.

459
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:20,739
Rym: this is actually pretty good.

460
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,919
Rym: we watched the whole goddamn thing.

461
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:23,735
Rym: this is a trial.

462
00:36:25,952 --> 00:36:31,160
Rym: you could put this on the BBC and it would fit in right next to a legit real nature documentary.

463
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:32,818
Rym: that is how well they put this together.

464
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,080
Scott: I guess they had a lot of time on their hands.

465
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:39,019
Rym: they made a four hour long the making of video.

466
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:42,759
Rym: it's an hour and a half long but it is how we made this.

467
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:44,500
Rym: this is a full on production.

468
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,600
Rym: this is crazy.

469
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:56,479
Scott: so we know that sports analytics has become a big deal over time and there are various sources of data that are more or less accessible to the general public.

470
00:36:57,427 --> 00:37:06,380
Scott: but most of the analytics people in sports are trying to figure out things in relation to betting or scouting.

471
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,300
Scott: it's like what players are better than others who's improving?

472
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:11,760
Scott: who should you draft higher?

473
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:15,018
Scott: these sorts of player specific questions who's better than who?

474
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:17,500
Scott: or what team should I bet on tonight?

475
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,920
Scott: who's more likely to win in this matchup?

476
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:27,115
Scott: all these sorts of things are the questions people are trying to answer and they're not using the people whose job it is to do.

477
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:38,940
Scott: analytics aren't using the data necessarily to just answer fun, interesting questions that matter to people who are just generally interested.

478
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:56,818
Scott: occasionally journalists will do this but usually they're relying on the analytics people more, sometimes at least I know some journalists are putting in big efforts to learn the analytics stuff themselves and to up their own skills to make themselves better at their job which is kind of awesome.

479
00:37:57,303 --> 00:38:01,876
Rym: I'm getting more into that deeper type of statistical analysis myself at work

480
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:29,262
Scott: but anyway some random person on Reddit decided to take the data from basically the entire decade of the NHL and they counted all the penalties all 105,639 penalties for all the teams and they arranged them to answer such questions as which penalty is called the most, which team gets called for each penalty the most which player

481
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,286
Rym: gets called for which penalty

482
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,388
Scott: the most, which player

483
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,537
Rym: gets called for which penalty

484
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,336
Scott: they draw penalties the most the least, etc.

485
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:44,071
Scott: you know, which teams get penalized more often.

486
00:38:44,091 --> 00:39:29,124
Scott: in total right, pretty much anything you can get that's interesting out of just knowing just a straight list of which penalties were called, what penalty was it against which player on which team and add that all up and it's all presented here just in a Reddit post for everybody to read with 2.8 thousand upvotes on it as you would expect and, you know, the interest a lot of it is just exactly what you'd expect like, yeah, the dirty player has the most unsportsmanlike conduct penalties common sense, but also you know, yeah, things we know like, you know, referees like to just sort of even up the penalties instead of just calling whoever deserves to be penalized you know, to sort of manage the game a bit and this you'll see.

487
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:38,700
Scott: the teams that are penalized the most often also draw penalties the most, right, the refs like to even it out there, right you know, these sorts of things.

488
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,064
Scott: you'll also see.

489
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,480
Rym: the penalties that don't get called.

490
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,019
Rym: spearing is the one I was going to bring up.

491
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:42,724
Rym: spearing

492
00:39:42,765 --> 00:40:01,680
Scott: does not get called nearly enough right, but also these penalties that get called like once in a decade right, coach on the ice headbutting right, and then you can say hey, that penalty was called once, there must have been a special incident, and indeed there was, and then you can YouTube and find that special incident and learn what the story was.

493
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,826
Rym: I'm Miles Wood, possibly the only person ever to get called for.

494
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:16,380
Scott: butt ending in like the modern era right, and slewfooting which gets called way not enough but yeah, go ahead and take a look at this.

495
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,739
Scott: it is quite fascinating even if you don't care about ice hockey.

496
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:28,540
Rym: oh, interesting, it's funny, just looking at data like this, the things that just stood out to me are one, the Rangers actually are the leaders in boarding for some reason.

497
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:43,055
Rym: like they board people more I mean, you're adding up a whole decade, which is like, you know yeah, yeah in the meta moment still stuck at home, like I don't know what to say we're reading the tale of Genji again though it's happening.

498
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,493
Scott: yep I read some more.

499
00:40:47,554 --> 00:40:56,320
Scott: last night some stuff happened, someone died which is, you know, it's like yeah, there's a lot of characters and it's a huge book.

500
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:57,280
Scott: that's not a spoiler.

501
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:58,978
Rym: yep, more characters will die.

502
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:06,080
Scott: the tale of Genji is the first novel ever written by human beings, ever.

503
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:07,659
Scott: how could you not read that?

504
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,980
Scott: it's like, have you seen the first movie?

505
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:20,019
Scott: you know, have you watched the first animation ever, I hope you have, right it's pretty short you know, it's like, if there's a first have you played the first video game?

506
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:24,419
Scott: right, probably, right space war, what, right, something like that?

507
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:37,899
Scott: yeah, space war pong, depending on yeah, depending on your definition or whatever, but it's like, if there's a first of something, I feel like okay, I'll read, if I'm gonna live this life as a human being I will read the first book.

508
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,038
Scott: I will do that, and I'm doing it now.

509
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:52,739
Rym: yep, and it's getting warm, I can do the thing that I thought I would do, where since I'm still stuck and I can't get the vaccine for a while I might just go bike out to a park and sit out in the middle of nowhere and read for a little bit, under the sun.

510
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:56,419
Rym: yep, because it was like 70 degrees today in New York.

511
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:06,540
Rym: actually, the high was 69, nice it was a little bit cold today, but still I opened the window I went out and ran shorts and a t-shirt.

512
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,840
Rym: okay, I think this weekend I'm gonna do a long bike ride.

513
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:14,900
Scott: we'll see, it'll be like it's gonna get colder, it's getting colder.

514
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:16,398
Scott: this is a temporary deal.

515
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:28,840
Rym: so, way back in the year of our Lord 2012 we did an episode of GeekNights called Seasons but in that case, not my Lord we reviewed a board game called Seasons.

516
00:42:29,786 --> 00:42:32,100
Rym: we did another show which was more fascinating.

517
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:33,410
Rym: oh, when did we do this one?

518
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:42,322
Rym: We did this one in it's important the month, June of 2007 called Gaming Season and the episode description is tonight.

519
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:46,118
Rym: on GeekNights, we talk about why we're not playing any video games.

520
00:42:46,922 --> 00:43:04,838
Rym: I actually went back, before the show we were looking at what was going on in 2007, that was basically like the literal rock bottom of PC gaming like, that was before, like Team Fortress 2 came out a couple months after we did this episode.

521
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:14,400
Rym: so, this was the era where like, I don't think either one of us was running Windows, like we both had Linux on the desktop, I bought that Mac.

522
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:19,779
Rym: like, we were not playing video games, like we were between consoles and like, the Wii had come out yet.

523
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:24,159
Rym: so we were like, past a generation of consoles, new generations hadn't come out.

524
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:28,120
Rym: we were never on board with like the Playstation 2, Xbox era.

525
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,473
Scott: so, we were playing Xbox 360, that was later than that.

526
00:43:32,563 --> 00:43:33,760
Rym: I also had an Xbox 360.

527
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,920
Rym: I played Street Fighter on it, and then eventually I sold it to a co-worker.

528
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:38,797
Scott: I played a few things on it.

529
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:41,557
Rym: I think, Shadow Complex?

530
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,790
Rym: Or was that on the GameCube?

531
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,720
Scott: Yeah, that was Shadow Complex.

532
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,540
Rym: That was Shadow Complex.

533
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:47,253
Scott: So yeah,

534
00:43:47,658 --> 00:44:11,077
Rym: but it was interesting, because looking at that old episode, I was thinking about seasons and seasonality of our lives because something we've complained about a lot as we left school, was that in our lives up until college and like, right at the end of college the seasons radically changed our life, like fall, go back to school, summer, summer vacation like, there was a.

535
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:18,696
Scott: there were two winter and I guess winter was always a holiday season but that's still true.

536
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:26,498
Scott: but basically fall through spring, it was pretty much either school or not school.

537
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:31,939
Scott: it wasn't like, you know that much of a deal, to go from winter to spring.

538
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:43,620
Rym: I guess winter to spring, for me, was always like, ok, it's starting to get warmer out but more importantly, summer's coming and school will end all of spring, I would just be thinking here comes summer vacation.

539
00:44:45,506 --> 00:45:05,607
Scott: sure, the point is once you have a job, right in the adult world, it's like doesn't matter what freaking season it is your daily life routine doesn't change, right you might have things on your schedule throughout the year based on your life, right like we have packs on the schedule or we did, you know.

540
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:20,298
Rym: but for the most part it doesn't matter if it's 90 degrees summer like today, it was 70 degrees all day and beautiful, guess what I was doing sitting at my desk, working all day.

541
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:32,480
Rym: yeah, when it was freezing cold two weeks ago or whatever it was, sitting at my desk, working all day yup, but I was thinking about that in the context of my life still actually does have a lot of seasonality.

542
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:37,080
Rym: I'm gonna discard the COVID era, because this was a weird.

543
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:46,376
Rym: this was COVID season but the rest of my life and I'm curious I'll never forget that one time I saw

544
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,059
Scott: a ghost one time I saw a virus

545
00:45:50,262 --> 00:46:00,580
Rym: but I was thinking about it and I realized that there is a lot of seasonality to my life still as an adult and it's actually gotten more defined as I've gotten older.

546
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:06,300
Rym: but it's not tied to the weather seasons anymore, but it's still there, there is still a seasonality.

547
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:18,140
Rym: but it doesn't help that the weather seasons have gotten all fucked the fuck up they have, and this is not, we talked about this on GeekNights, officially in terms of how the seasons work New York City is subtropical.

548
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:20,920
Rym: we live in a subtropical zone.

549
00:46:21,021 --> 00:46:22,379
Rym: this is not a temperate zone.

550
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:35,040
Rym: we don't have four seasons like you think, because especially American listeners and a lot of European listeners spring, summer, winter, fall you realize a lot of places on Earth don't have those four seasons, like weather patterns are different.

551
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,540
Scott: they've got rainy season and not rainy season.

552
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:47,100
Rym: yep, or like Singapore has the hot rainy season and the windy rain, like there's two different kinds of rainy season that happen and New York is not like that.

553
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,139
Rym: we don't have four seasons.

554
00:46:49,326 --> 00:46:58,938
Rym: spring is a weird almost vestigial season in New York now, there's like a rainy summer and a non-rainy summer are like our seasons now.

555
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:14,599
Rym: but I was just thinking about this a lot and I've realized that my life seasonality is actually pretty well defined, but it's defined by all these different clocks and not the weather anymore but the only seasonal weather clock that I still have.

556
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:19,060
Rym: and I've realized this happened to me by accident, when I was a kid.

557
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:21,080
Rym: my parents would always talk about spring cleaning.

558
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,646
Rym: "Oh it's spring, we're gonna do spring cleaning".

559
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:34,080
Rym: and I just ignored that, but my parents would be all busy and they would do all these things every year, like as soon as they got a warm enough to open the windows "I wonder where that term came from, we're gonna do some Google".

560
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:35,474
Rym: Gotta look that up?

561
00:47:37,381 --> 00:47:39,321
Rym: Cause my impression of it was always "If

562
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:53,914
Scott: my feeling is that people do spring cleaning because of the phrase spring, like because you know the phrase you feel like that's the time that you should do some cleaning, and I'm gonna read the history on Wikipedia, which any listener could just do themselves and stop listening right now".

563
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:59,858
Rym: Some researchers trace the origin to the Iranian normas the Persian New Year which falls in the first day of spring.

564
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:05,793
Scott: another possibility relates to Passover "Yup, cause you gotta clean all the bread out".

565
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:20,046
Rym: Cause I grew up in Michigan, spring cleaning was definitely a thing, like all the parents would do it, but I think part of it was, it was so cold in the winter, cause you know we're in Michigan like winter's real cold, as soon as it was

566
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:20,510
Scott: warm enough

567
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:28,140
Rym: to be in the garage with the garage door open and open the windows and like go outside.

568
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:38,719
Rym: there's a lot of cleaning that we didn't do during the winter because it was cold, like we didn't take rugs outside and beat them, the rugs just stayed dusty all winter and in the spring, you take them outside.

569
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:52,098
Scott: It does say here that before they had a vacuum cleaner, March was the best time for dusting because you could open the windows like you just said, but not warm enough for insects to come in and the high wind would help.

570
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,559
Scott: and also, it was warm enough you wouldn't have to run your coal furnace and fill your house with soot.

571
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:06,120
Rym: So I wonder if it came out of that era and persisted as a cultural tradition as many of those factors were no longer present.

572
00:49:07,003 --> 00:49:10,040
Scott: Yeah, I've never done, I've never followed the spring cleaning, not that I've.

573
00:49:10,161 --> 00:49:17,006
Scott: I'm not saying, there are definitely times of the, you know, where I will say "Okay, it's time, and I'll do an extra cleaning".

574
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:22,259
Rym: right, like I'll super clean stuff I'll clean the windows Those aren't tied to spring, that's just like it's time to bleach the bathroom.

575
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:28,675
Scott: Right, I just do it like, when it's time I'll do this big clean but it's not necessarily spring.

576
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,559
Scott: I've done it, I'm sure I've done it, it's spring at least once, but like, you know, other times I will, you know, do different cleans.

577
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:45,160
Rym: So when I think back, yeah the things that my parents would do big cleans about were mostly things that required the garage door to be open like cleaning out the garage.

578
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,419
Rym: the garage basically didn't get touched all winter.

579
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:49,419
Rym: no one went in there, it was cold.

580
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:57,276
Rym: as soon as it's spring, and you can be in the garage comfortably, we would like clean the garage out, and deal with all the mess we made all winter, and that kind of thing.

581
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:13,499
Rym: and in my adult life now, living in New York I think there is a big difference between people who live in houses and people who live in apartments in this regard too, because the seasons don't change what we can do to our apartments as much as they change what we can do to our houses.

582
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:15,379
Scott: That's true, that's true.

583
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,980
Rym: But, I have taken up a lot of sports.

584
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,120
Rym: If you have a house, right?

585
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:27,200
Scott: Yeah, if you have a house, and suddenly it's warm out you can do like a gardening and there's all these things you can do with how you can fill your pool.

586
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:29,200
Rym: if you got a pool, there's a lot of money.

587
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,189
Rym: There's like house chores that appear There's chores

588
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:48,238
Scott: There's chores, but there's also things that you could just you know, not tasks even but just like, things you can do that you couldn't do when it was cold because if you got an apartment it's like the things that you can do pretty much the same.

589
00:50:48,441 --> 00:51:00,340
Scott: There's one thing, I can go out on my balcony in the spring and summer, but I can't really do that in the winter Right, but it's like you can, you know and there's other things that you can do just sort of replace each other, right?

590
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,899
Scott: So it's like in the summer you can go to the beach and in the not summer you can go to the hockey game.

591
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:08,620
Scott: it's like, okay, but other stuff, it's just like, it doesn't matter.

592
00:51:09,004 --> 00:51:12,779
Scott: you can do X and it's cold you can do X and it's warm, but it's the same X.

593
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:23,539
Rym: Yup, but one thing the main seasonality I find in my life is more around, what is the set of activities that consume my not like day to day life, but like week to week life?

594
00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:28,879
Rym: but hockey season isn't like just winter because hockey season kind of gets long and weird and COVID also made it weird.

595
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,559
Rym: like there's a season of.

596
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:39,120
Rym: I go to a hockey game semi-regularly and I put hockey on like kind of regularly when I'm around the house, like there's hockey season and non-hockey season.

597
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:53,440
Rym: and the fact that hockey is there sort of informs how my life goes, like dirt when hockey is a thing many nights we'll cook dinner and have the hockey game on kind of while we eat dinner, maybe I'll watch the whole game, maybe I'll go play Overwatch.

598
00:51:53,621 --> 00:52:02,315
Rym: but if I'm playing Overwatch, the hockey game's like on, on the other monitor I'm kind of paying attention to it and I notice it's lack when it's not hockey season

599
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:09,320
Scott: It is biking season and it is not biking season, some people that season doesn't end, they just bike no matter what.

600
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:19,701
Rym: I got a co-worker who like pre-COVID he bikes to work from further away than you would expect is reasonable no matter what I think I determined like 12.

601
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:25,820
Scott: yeah I think I determined that like 12 miles would be my absolute limit for a commute.

602
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:32,020
Scott: right, daily but I can't do weather that's too cold or any precipitation whatsoever.

603
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:37,093
Scott: I've been caught in the rain a couple of times, but if I see that it's raining I'm not going on purpose, right?

604
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:41,920
Rym: And my old job I used to, because I could show up to the office looking like a dead rat, it'd be fine.

605
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,203
Rym: but I can't really get away with that with my current job.

606
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:47,640
Scott: I was always caught in the rain on the way home, I was never caught on the way to work.

607
00:52:47,942 --> 00:52:49,980
Rym: I biked home once from work and I got caught.

608
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:51,899
Rym: I thought I could beat the rain home.

609
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:58,825
Rym: the rain that came down on me, on the Williamsburg bridge was like, legendarily strong.

610
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,413
Scott: I've been hit, I think twice by the legendarily strong on the way home.

611
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:08,100
Rym: The point is I stopped biking because I couldn't see far enough ahead of myself and just stood there.

612
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,610
Scott: the point is that in the winter it's like in the summer.

613
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:11,660
Scott: I'm just checking for rain.

614
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:20,896
Scott: it's still biking season, in the winter it will never be a bike to work day in the winter even if it doesn't snow it's too cold.

615
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:29,800
Rym: so the seasons in our lives right now are things like that, like are there outdoor activities I can or can't do?

616
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:32,000
Rym: like I ski in the winter, I can't ski any other time.

617
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:39,839
Rym: I structure my life around skiing during ski season because it's something I can only do during this very limited window.

618
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:48,669
Rym: I don't structure my life as much around biking because I have a much longer bike season, it's like mid spring to late fall.

619
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:50,222
Rym: I can bike almost as much as I want.

620
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:55,480
Scott: Yeah I don't structure around the biking, you know the biking would just like fill in gaps.

621
00:53:56,482 --> 00:54:00,646
Scott: I'm not doing anything this weekend, I guess we're going biking and or beaching.

622
00:54:00,848 --> 00:54:05,820
Rym: Yup, but like in the winter it's like okay, there are only so many weekends I can ski.

623
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:19,049
Rym: I'm gonna ski every single weekend I can unless something gets in the way and I structure things around it like multiple PAX Souths, I would go to PAX South and then remember I would like fly home kinda early Sunday to get to a ski trip.

624
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,258
Rym: but living in an apartment added an extra weird seasonality to that that I never had to deal with because as a kid we lived in a house and in Beacon we had a house.

625
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,999
Rym: I don't have a lot of room for stuff.

626
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:39,580
Rym: so, nope I will store things some things I have to store in a way that I can get to them easily, like during biking season.

627
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:45,759
Rym: all my bike shit has to be like readily available, it can't be like buried under the bed behind suitcases.

628
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:47,252
Scott: Yeah it's like.

629
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:54,020
Scott: it'll take you if you decide to bike and you're gonna have to either the night before or the morning of dig a whole bunch of shit out.

630
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:55,925
Scott: it's like a huge pain in the butt and that'll probably.

631
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:02,283
Scott: that might even, just the difficulty of that will probably prevent you from biking like.

632
00:55:02,304 --> 00:55:10,402
Scott: you will bike less whatever your hobby is, right if the stuff you have to do the thing is like not out like.

633
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:14,159
Scott: imagine if I had to tear down and put away all the podcast shit and then set it all up again.

634
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,780
Scott: I would podcast a lot less.

635
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:18,464
Rym: Why do you think we're doing a lot less video during COVID?

636
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,899
Rym: We have to put a lot of shit together to do a video, like way more.

637
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:54,699
Scott: If your shit is just set up and ready to go all the time you will do the thing, whatever it is more, so if there is a thing you do seasonally such as biking or skiing whatever that stuff is when the season starts set up the stuff and find a way to have it out and ready and available and then when the season ends put it into the deep sleep, right so it's out of the way and you make room for some other stuff and that way you will do the seasonal thing more than you otherwise would have.

638
00:55:54,962 --> 00:56:05,698
Scott: and it's just basics, like hey your bathing suits are in a thing under the bed, now they're in with the rest of the shorts where the pants go and the jeans are under the bed you know, simple stuff like that.

639
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:13,757
Rym: so right now, ski season basically is over now, it's like literally 50 or 60 degrees up at even the nearest mountain I could get to.

640
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:14,362
Rym: so

641
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:19,450
Scott: ski season, done at least here it is, you can go to the other half of the world the bottom half, yeah,

642
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:20,340
Rym: and if it wasn't Covid

643
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,764
Scott: or the top half, depending on your point of view I might,

644
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:35,980
Rym: can't now, but yeah basically when ski season ends, now that I live in an apartment I really took for granted the fact that my family had a basement and a garage for basically my entire life, so if we wanted to go skiing.

645
00:56:36,364 --> 00:56:42,239
Rym: I went into the basement, got my skis and they stayed in the same place year round, there's no reason to move them.

646
00:56:42,643 --> 00:57:00,100
Rym: now, like, ski season ends, I have to Tetris all this ski shit that barely fits into my apartment like into the deepest corners of the apartment, as far and deep as possible, because I literally can't use them again until next year, so I can then bring out from those deepest crevices all the things I'm going to use in the summer.

647
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:05,088
Rym: and I do this like, there's three points in the year where I have to like shift all this crap around.

648
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,660
Rym: in the apartment.

649
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:31,352
Scott: you could get a mini storage thing but I've never done that because that's again, that would be really it would be great to have because the stuff just wouldn't be in my apartment at all, so my apartment would have like all this extra space in it and like you know, that would be so great and I wouldn't even if I was stupid and ended up, you know, feeling like I had all this empty space and I bought more shit, that shit would also go into the storage

650
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:31,818
Rym: facility

651
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:33,206
Scott: right?

652
00:57:33,693 --> 00:57:52,139
Scott: So it's like it would free up space in the apartment and it would be nice, assuming you can afford the cost of it, but I imagine the difficulty of moving, you know it's like digging stuff out of the closet and putting stuff back in the closet, moving stuff from your apartment to another location back and forth once or even just twice a year.

653
00:57:52,684 --> 00:58:12,764
Scott: just the hassle of that, just losing two days every year basically of having to, you know put stuff in and take stuff out, assuming I can only, I only do it twice, two times, it's like if there's something that I can afford to just not have for half the year and have it be in another place entirely, I can afford to throw that thing out,

654
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:13,612
Rym: just in

655
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,415
Scott: the garbage, right?

656
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:26,420
Scott: So that's why I do not, and I probably won't have some sort of storage place unless they open up like a mini store, like literally next door or across the street or something like that.

657
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,866
Rym: Yup, the problem is those tend to be way too expensive.

658
00:58:29,795 --> 00:58:39,579
Scott: Yeah, but if that happened, it would be, it might be considered, but you know, cause the cost of going to it would be significantly lowered, but that has not happened, so no.

659
00:58:41,166 --> 00:59:00,803
Rym: The other thing I was thinking about is, you know, that gaming season episode are in, like we'll have, like we will suddenly get into a certain kind of game and play that kind of game a lot for a long period of time and then like that'll ebb and flow and a different game will come in, we'll have like seasons of we're playing a lot of tabletop, playing a lot of RPGs, playing a lot of online games.

660
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:01,511
Rym: for some reason.

661
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:04,340
Rym: COVID time made a special season of a lot of async games.

662
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:16,708
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like when you have, there's some people who have only one or a few you know, really focused interests that they're big into that thing and not into other things.

663
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:20,930
Rym: Then their seasons become like it's Magic Tournament season, it's not Magic Tournament season.

664
00:59:21,678 --> 00:59:21,900
Scott: Sure.

665
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,749
Scott: But it's like they're doing, that's the thing that they do, right?

666
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:26,688
Scott: Or the handful of things that they do.

667
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:36,020
Scott: People like us, there's so many things that I do, and they're constantly waxing and waning relative to each other, right?

668
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:39,452
Scott: I haven't really done a lot of baking recently.

669
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:43,049
Scott: I haven't, you know, maybe like six months since I like baked maybe something like that.

670
00:59:43,655 --> 00:59:46,522
Scott: Photography I haven't done in like a year plus, right?

671
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:53,757
Scott: Because I'm not really, you know, I see other people who are like taking photos in their house or going out anyway and neither of those interest me, so.

672
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:54,967
Scott: Yep.

673
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:59,980
Scott: But I'll probably explode on that front as soon as I can safely go outside, right?

674
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,345
Rym: Yep.

675
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:11,779
Scott: And you know, just all the different hobbies, it's like, you know, someone like you'll have Gundams and it's like you'll go and you'll build like five Gundams in a row and then you won't build another one for months.

676
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,393
Scott: You know, it's just, it's a seasonal interest changes.

677
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:17,435
Scott: Right now, I'm watching a lot of anime suddenly.

678
01:00:17,455 --> 01:00:18,626
Scott: I haven't watched it before.

679
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:23,819
Scott: Before, like a few weeks ago, I wasn't watching any anime for like months.

680
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,596
Rym: Yeah, and lately there's been a lot of part of it, sometimes it's because like there'll be more media of a certain type.

681
01:00:29,677 --> 01:00:33,800
Rym: Sometimes it's just like that clock rings and it's time, but same.

682
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,800
Rym: I'm watching a lot of anime lately too and it's not like.

683
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:39,656
Rym: some of the shows I'm watching are a couple of years old.

684
01:00:39,717 --> 01:00:42,100
Rym: It's not like ah, particularly good season of anime.

685
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,907
Rym: It was like, you know what?

686
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,139
Rym: I like anime.

687
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,200
Rym: I haven't watched a lot of anime recently.

688
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,593
Rym: What anime is out there?

689
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:48,020
Rym: that's good.

690
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,538
Rym: and suddenly watching a ton of anime?

691
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:50,907
Scott: Mm-hmm.

692
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,771
Scott: You watch one and you're like, right, I remember.

693
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:54,852
Scott: Yep.

694
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:08,159
Rym: There was an era at RIT where I stopped, when I became president of the anime club, like when I had a lot more responsibilities on the eboard, I watched a lot less anime for like a year and a half, like the lead up to that.

695
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:13,233
Rym: And there was an era where like, I didn't like any of the shows that were coming out.

696
01:01:13,293 --> 01:01:23,713
Rym: Like I'd watch them out of obligation, because I had to be able to speak to them and know about them and stuff, but like I didn't really like, I'd watch an episode of Scried, didn't really give a fuck about the next episode, but I'd watch it just because.

697
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:27,599
Rym: But like, then like, I'll watch it.

698
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:38,691
Rym: like recently, like I watched an episode of The Great Pretender, and that the anime gland in my body suddenly perked up and said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, you should watch the second episode of that right now.

699
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:39,580
Rym: Don't wait.

700
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:41,557
Scott: Don't miss

701
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:41,659
Scott: it.".

702
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:47,435
Scott: If you keep doing that, and watching tons and tons of anime, eventually it'll just be like, "All right, I had enough of

703
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:47,677
Scott: that.".

704
01:01:50,562 --> 01:01:55,092
Scott: Not consciously, but just like naturally, you'll move on to a different thing.

705
01:01:55,112 --> 01:02:03,659
Scott: We'll be like, "All right, I remember that thing," and you'll start doing that other thing that you forgot about, and then you will just naturally take away the anime watching time from, you know.

706
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,799
Rym: Yep, it's almost like you have a stacked rank priority list of things, but they'll cluster together.

707
01:02:11,108 --> 01:02:15,979
Rym: But one seasonality that changed a lot for us is convention season, because it used to be.

708
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,254
Scott: Well, conventions used to be a summer thing, yeah.

709
01:02:19,638 --> 01:02:45,019
Scott: All the conventions, you know, San Diego Comic-Con, Otakon, these conventions were intentionally scheduling themselves in the summer, historically speaking, and their logic was sound, which was, "We will hold our convention in the summer when a lot of people are, especially students, are not working and have no obligations, and the weather is good, and people will come on vacation to our place.

710
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:55,916
Scott: You know, we can get, for example, summer camps could take field trips to our convention, things of that nature, and that will just be really great for our business.

711
01:02:55,956 --> 01:03:04,340
Scott: If we hold our convention at another time of the year, less people will come, we risk shitty weather, right, and we'll make less money.

712
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,739
Scott: So conventions were all in the summer.

713
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:10,705
Scott: And then other conventions were like, "You know what, we can't be competing with these big boys in the summer.

714
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:16,080
Scott: Let's have our convention and not the summer, right, because we'll just lose to the big

715
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,259
Scott: conventions.".

716
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:21,192
Rym: Yeah, like the magfest over near New Year's.

717
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,967
Scott: Right, and so it's like now, and those conventions were somehow pulling it off, right?

718
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:31,518
Scott: Enough people were going regardless of the time of year, and they were making it work.

719
01:03:32,082 --> 01:03:43,679
Scott: So that trend of all conventions in summer sort of ended, and there are just conventions all times of year, and your convention season ends up then being determined by which conventions you choose to go to and not go to.

720
01:03:44,082 --> 01:04:04,579
Rym: As we backed away from anime conventions, and like basically everything but PAX and Magfest, because of how PAX and video game type stuff is clustered and board game type stuff, our convention season went from summer to all year to September through March.

721
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,540
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much like it was almost like school season, right?

722
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,039
Scott: It's like you'd kick off PAX in Labor Day, like school starting, then there'd be more PAXes.

723
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:22,039
Scott: You know, PAXOS we only went to barely, but PAX Unplugged is now November times, and then you got South January, Magfest January.

724
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:25,057
Rym: Yep, PAX East would kind of like end it.

725
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:44,978
Scott: Yeah, East is usually in the spring, and then it's like, okay, summer, spring, summer break, no conventions till PAX West again, and they'd all be clustered into that school time of fall through early spring, and then summer, you know, nothing.

726
01:04:45,701 --> 01:04:59,030
Rym: And it made me notice something, because whenever there's a seasonality like that in my life that persists over enough years, other things start to get attached to it, like it accumulates traditions and it accumulates expectations.

727
01:04:59,515 --> 01:05:04,768
Rym: I would start to think of PAX West as the end of summer, specifically.

728
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:07,799
Rym: Flying to Seattle is the ritual that marks the end of summer.

729
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:16,870
Rym: The pre-Pax board gaming and dinner was like this moment that would loom large in my vision toward late summer.

730
01:05:16,971 --> 01:05:25,919
Rym: I'd be thinking, well, summer's ending, that sucks, but, and I'd imagine sitting in the pre-Pax gaming hanging out, playing a quartermaster general before PAX starts.

731
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,350
Scott: Right, but it's like I'd get there and be like, well, I guess I'm not going to the beach anymore this year.

732
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:35,278
Scott: I guess, you know, biking's probably not too much more this year.

733
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:43,159
Scott: It's PAX time, hooray, but, you know, this other stuff is over, I guess, until next time.

734
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:43,602
Rym: Yup.

735
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:49,559
Rym: So, I think that killed enough time, we actually did kind of a long episode, so I'll just stop right there.

736
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:52,257
Rym: I'm hungry, thanks to you talking about dim sum.

737
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:56,548
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

738
01:05:56,609 --> 01:06:01,580

Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

740
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,923

741
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:14,535

744
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:25,620
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

745
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:33,864
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this particular episode of GeekNights, because I record this every goddamn time, it's currently March 11th.

748
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,026
Rym: Wren from New Zealand, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Shervin Von Horl.

749
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:56,559
Rym: You hold the key to my heart and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

750
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:10,773
Rym: Stay tuned for actually some Patreon exclusive content that's going to start appearing as I walk through production, pre-production and post-production processes and other cool things that I'm working on.

751
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:19,200
Rym: Utena still kind of working on it, but honestly, that's probably not going to really start up until after COVID when Scott and I can do it in the same room together.

752
01:07:19,663 --> 01:07:21,744
Rym: But for now, I will leave you with...

753
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:23,403
Scott: Help!

754
01:07:23,423 --> 01:07:25,040
Scott: The human's about to escape!

755
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,654
Scott: Get your paws off me, you dirty ape!

756
01:07:28,986 --> 01:07:29,697
Scott: He can talk!

757
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:30,886

Scott: He can talk!

760
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,887
Scott: He can talk!

761
01:07:32,927 --> 01:07:33,513
Scott: He can talk!

762
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:34,080
Rym: He can talk!

763
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,046
Scott: I can say Help me, Dr.

Scott: What's wrong with me?

782
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:54,759
Scott: I think you're crazy.

783
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,990
Rym: Want a second opinion?

784
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,268
Rym: You're all so lazy.

785
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:57,671

01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,428
Rym: Of course you can!

807
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,750
Scott: Well, I couldn't before.
