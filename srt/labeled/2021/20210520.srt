00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,500
Rym: It's Thursday, May 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,961
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,970
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:21,790
Rym: We were talking about things that grind or grease or possibly have no particular impact on our gears.

5
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:26,454
Scott: Let's do this All right.

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,465
Rym: I actually got nobody but that I can start with.

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,410
Scott: I got no even.

8
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:31,515
Rym: Let's start with mine.

9
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:32,078
Rym: You can do yours.

10
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:32,521
Rym: How's that?

11
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:34,169
Scott: I'm just gonna say warm today.

12
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:37,195
Rym: Huh, you can start with.

13
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:39,004
Scott: that works, I think that works better.

14
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,463
Rym: if I say it first, all right You start with that then I'll do my thing.

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,840
Scott: Woman today.

16
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:47,876
Scott: woman It is.

17
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,069
Scott: no it's not woman.

18
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:57,923
Rym: The problem is we used to do that earnestly and say it was warm today when it was warm and do the other bit when It was cold, but then we inverted it and did the opposite for years.

19
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,814
Rym: So now I'm never sure which one Remember ever doing the opposite.

20
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:03,699
Scott: I'm saying it's actually finally warm.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,960
Rym: We started pretty it's pretty great around 2008 or 2009. for years We would be like warm today when it was way too cold.

22
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,164
Rym: And then that was our shtick.

23
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:13,810
Scott: I don't remember that shtick.

24
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,685
Scott: I just remember being honest with the weather.

25
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:24,227
Rym: Yeah I had to turn on the air conditioning because I can't have the windows open Because they're working on the facade of the building and there's so much dust out there.

26
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,395
Scott: It's a problem And it's not working.

27
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:30,788
Scott: I haven't had to turn the AC on yet, but I did turn on the fan.

28
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,326
Rym: briefly I have the windows open all the time except during and I've had wind.

29
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,357
Scott: I've had windows open But there's no.

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,787
Scott: the construction is far enough away That's not it.

31
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:44,524
Rym: So I realized now how bad the facade on this building is and why they're redoing it.

32
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,650
Scott: the city like that old a building.

33
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,315
Rym: Yeah, they built it shittily.

34
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:53,270
Rym: They're replacing you like a scary percentage of the bricks in the facade.

35
00:01:54,231 --> 00:02:03,450
Rym: Okay, they took like 50 bricks out of the facade just around our balcony alone And there's a giant pile of bricks and they're masonry them back in one by one.

36
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:07,770
Scott: So I guess the bricks aren't the problem but such someone did shitty masonry.

37
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:15,452
Rym: Yep The bricks in the facade were put in so shittily that they were all a like serious risk of injury or death to anyone walking Under our building.

38
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,041
Scott: So I guess whoever did that original masonry.

39
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,790
Scott: Are they gonna get sued or insurance or what?

40
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,578
Scott: I have no love for the landlord.

41
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,686
Scott: if they have to pay could they own a building?

42
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:27,830
Scott: they can certainly afford it.

43
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:34,847
Scott: But if it was, you know If I paid to have something done and it was done so shittily that it needed to be redone way ahead of schedule.

44
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,509
Scott: I Would want yeah Well, you know what?

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,470
Rym: Yeah, that's the classic situation of someone can be bad but also be wronged and still deserves justice for when they were wronged.

46
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:51,850
Rym: Yeah, you know within bounds there's certain people who don't deserve justice even but that's a whole separate conversation.

47
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,620
Scott: I could just be like look, you know under normal circumstances.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,183
Scott: This would require some you know, some Justice action, but you've done injustices.

49
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:05,315
Scott: So we're just gonna say it cancels out this afraid This will be your consequence.

50
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:12,869
Rym: that other thing useful skeleton stole a bunch of stuff from your company But your company was exploiting workers so bad that you can't get anything back from them.

51
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,421
Scott: Yeah, it's like huh, you know, this guy screwed you over.

52
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:18,690
Scott: build in your building shittily, but you're an evil landlord.

53
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,518
Scott: So I don't care eat it fucked.

54
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:25,962
Rym: So, uh last weekend we uh, We went up hiking or two weekends ago.

55
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,288
Rym: Oh god, it was two weekends ago.

56
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,882
Rym: last weekend We went biking because it was finally warm enough.

57
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:37,048
Rym: I saw you bike to you I'm you went up into the Tarrytown Bridge We went up to Briarcliff Manor and then just turned around and came back on the South County.

58
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,944
Rym: hmm, though, uh When we went hiking the other day we went up to somewhere different.

59
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,370
Rym: we wanted to do some mountain climbing.

60
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:49,490
Rym: So we went up to the corner of like Connecticut massive who sits and New York.

61
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:50,649
Rym: There's like a little corner there.

62
00:03:50,710 --> 00:04:00,890
Rym: We're like a like it's you just driver like even just driving past you go over all those borders a bunch of times Mm-hmm kind of near where the Harlan Valley Railroad usually is and I know where that is.

63
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,470
Rym: We hiked this mountain and on the way home We were like, why don't we stop at the cafe Maya and get takeout and like eat that?

64
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:16,766
Rym: Yeah, so we'd stop at the original cafe Maya the one on 90 not the one on in Fishkill Mm-hmm, and there's nobody eating outside.

65
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:17,470
Rym: It's like empty.

66
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,627
Rym: So we actually sit down outside and they turn out of heat lamp and we're just by ourselves.

67
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:22,190
Rym: and we got that.

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,598
Rym: I got Emily got a Verano.

69
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:24,825
Rym: I got the enchilada squeezes.

70
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:25,509
Rym: There's a really good time.

71
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:31,370
Rym: the waiter Was talking to us and being like extra friendly like in a mask on we had a master.

72
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,509
Rym: We're talking to him, but he's like being extra friendly and like we're just chatting and then he's like.

73
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,050
Rym: I feel like I know you and we start talking.

74
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:44,670
Rym: Remember when the cafe Maya opened in Beacon and then eventually failed?

75
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:51,490
Rym: Yeah, so we were some of the only people that eat ate there apparently like it didn't go well at all.

76
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:57,429
Rym: So yeah, uh, he remembered us because he was the only waiter they ever had.

77
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:02,565
Rym: He was no waiter at the cafe Maya on Main Street in Beacon.

78
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:07,862
Rym: He recognized us Me and Emily, I mean, that's cool.

79
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:11,713
Scott: But also somebody was There there.

80
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,020
Scott: that's their job for 10 years.

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,470
Rym: Okay, I get the impression that that place actually pays them pretty well.

82
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:19,020
Scott: I hope so.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,430
Rym: Yeah, what kind of like the bear?

84
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,149
Scott: I hope after 10 years though, that guy's like just a manager and was doing waiting because there was you know slow time.

85
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,375
Rym: Also, yeah I mean Let's put our communist hat on.

86
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:41,030
Rym: the real answer is there should be dignity in all labor and there should be Totally expected and fine for most people to have a fairly quotes easy job their whole life.

87
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,429
Rym: No one should have to try to get promoted into a quote real job because there's no such thing as a red job.

88
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,240
Scott: I agree 100% but at the

89
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,710
Rym: current late capitalism that implies that that dude probably is not Not on a great trajectory

90
00:05:56,932 --> 00:06:10,184
Scott: Right, but also even if you do have, you know dignity and good compensation in all labor I still feel like you know, if you've been you know Waiting tables for 10 plus years and you're just sort of still doing that.

91
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:20,584
Scott: It's like I've been promised I during for 15 years Right, but it's like you you're you know, you must freakin, you know, really love that spot.

92
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,950
Rym: I don't love product managing.

93
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,950
Rym: Exactly The problem is capitalism.

94
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,330
Rym: Anyway, anyway, I was that was just a surprising moment.

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,053
Rym: So he taught it.

96
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:33,414
Rym: he was.

97
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:36,950
Rym: we actually talked to him a bit about that cafe Maya and how they thought it'd do so.

98
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,503
Rym: Well, and the problem was all the people in bacon Most of the people who lived in Beacon wouldn't eat at the restaurants on Main Street.

99
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:55,430
Rym: They'd all drive to the places in Fishkill Mmm, like the people who actually walked to Main Street and like ate in those places Relatively small group of people and on weekdays fucking nobody eats on Main Street.

100
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,442
Rym: Well, so, uh, yeah, they tried really hard.

101
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,145
Rym: We did we did.

102
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,109
Rym: we were like the only ones.

103
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,696
Scott: I Think they also might have tried too soon.

104
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:06,909
Scott: I've heard that Beacon Main Street has, you know only continued to.

105
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:08,473
Rym: It has.

106
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:19,350
Rym: there are a few places open that were definitely like over fancy and catered to Out of towners like people who drive up from New York City and are only there on the weekends and we're overpriced food.

107
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,750
Rym: But the restaurant scene in Beacon is pretty fucking awesome.

108
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,390
Rym: We used to go up there a lot before COVID and we plan to go up there a lot.

109
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,396
Scott: They still have that.

110
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,570
Scott: what happened to his location is still open.

111
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,996
Rym: Yeah but The problem is we went up to Beacon a bunch of times on weekends because we were hiking up there like in the previous years And it was awesome.

112
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:38,710
Rym: Like it felt like like Main Street was crowded.

113
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,564
Rym: There were people everywhere like walking around just tons of people.

114
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:42,710
Rym: like it felt really bustling.

115
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:47,562
Rym: Emily went back up like during that period when we were like We had to move up to Beacon.

116
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,329
Rym: it wouldn't be so bad.

117
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:53,470
Rym: She went up on like a Wednesday to take care of something like took the Metro North without me completely dead.

118
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,169
Rym: There are only people there on the weekends.

119
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,264
Scott: Yeah, that's yeah.

120
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,179
Scott: So they're working.

121
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:06,313
Rym: So, uh Yeah, anyway in some news New York just announced and other states have done this It's I got a lot.

122
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:11,250
Rym: I got a. I have a nuanced take on this and you might be surprised that I'm totally okay with this.

123
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:24,710
Rym: New York State is now going to have a Vax and scratch program where if you are not vaccinated against kovat currently and During the time range they're doing this you go and get the vaccine.

124
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:31,710
Rym: They will give you a for free a $20 lottery ticket for the upcoming five million dollar mega multiplier lottery.

125
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,201
Rym: Okay Uh, I want.

126
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:41,548
Scott: some other state did this recently I don't I just give people if it's a $20 scratch-off when I just give people 20 bucks.

127
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,586
Rym: Yeah Because people are bad at statistics and I feel like the kind of

128
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:47,550
Scott: rather have the 20 bucks

129
00:08:47,937 --> 00:09:02,049
Rym: I would argue The kind of person who needs to be given an incentive to go get a vaccine when it is free and easy to get one And wouldn't get a vaccine without that incentive Probably more swayed by the lottery ticket than 20 bucks.

130
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,940
Rym: Maybe yeah, but other states did this to like.

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:22,009
Rym: this was a thing and on one hand I am totally okay with this because the reality is humans are let's just charitably say complex and Anything that gets people to get the shot is okay in my book at this point like just get people to get the shot.

132
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:32,039
Rym: but so like I'm totally okay if this stuff works and the evidence shows that other states that have done similar programs had Massive upticks in people getting the vaccine.

133
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,726
Rym: So I am 100% good with this.

134
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:41,770
Rym: I'm not mad about it I'm just disappointed in it because I hate that this works on people.

135
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:45,134
Rym: I hate it because it doesn't work on me Like I know it doesn't.

136
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:51,221
Rym: but also I'm weird and prickly about things like advertising and extra skeptical Like I like any email I get.

137
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:56,492
Rym: that's even like slightly off I assume is malicious and delete like that's the kind of life I live.

138
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,163
Rym: if I see an ad I assume the thing is bad until proven.

139
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:07,449
Rym: Otherwise, I know you're like that, too It's just really sad to me how effective these lottery incentives for vaccinations are.

140
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:15,016
Rym: But if they work do it do whatever works, that's how public health policy policy Right.

141
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:15,898
Scott: I mean there's a it's.

142
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,907
Scott: you know, we know that there are certain psychological tricks that work You know on most people even on people who are aware of them.

143
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,454
Scott: occasionally Oh, right.

144
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:36,630
Scott: I can get tricked and add might sneak in and trick me like Yeah, you know it happens and The problem is not it's like the tricking someone in and of itself.

145
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:49,667
Scott: You could argue that it does harm someone in that you have taken away their agency or some aspect of it and manipulated them And that in and of itself is a violation a moral violation of the person's free will.

146
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:53,749
Rym: if such a thing exists It is perhaps for a use of weapons.

147
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,510
Scott: Yes, perhaps.

148
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:12,983
Scott: But If you are manipulating someone into doing something that is perhaps Empirically beneficial to themselves others society the world the universe Right, and there wasn't some other way to do it.

149
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,270
Scott: That was say less harmful, right?

150
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,635
Scott: It's like okay.

151
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:17,338
Scott: Is it?

152
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,610
Scott: you know, this person refuses to willingly get the vaccine?

153
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,104
Scott: I will attempt the moral path of convincing them.

154
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:26,869
Scott: just normally They refuse still.

155
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:31,129
Scott: Okay, what is more harmful a let them go about their business?

156
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:40,656
Scott: Unvaccinated be trick them with a lottery ticket kind of situation Be hold them down and inject them with physical force.

157
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:53,070
Scott: I'm good with the two that you just raised right But you get the idea it's like, you know, you don't really want to go exactly my take on this kind of thing to like.

158
00:11:53,712 --> 00:12:00,661
Rym: These psychological tricks are gonna be used for evil no matter what we do have to minimize the uses for evil But the reality is it will be used for evil.

159
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:19,210
Rym: Look at bad memes Misinformation campaigns like people who watch Fox News and literally believe objectively false things right, but if these things exist anyway And will be used for evil then don't we do we not have a moral obligation to use them for good wherever possible?

160
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:20,893
Scott: Mm-hmm.

161
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:24,001
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's the old saying do the ends justify the means right?

162
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:32,459
Scott: and obviously the answer depends on the means Right, of course, you know The answer is you know The saying is the ends don't justify the means.

163
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,542
Scott: and I think people take that as like just this absolute thing Which is like, you know, and they think of like some extreme circumstance, right?

164
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:43,895
Scott: It's like, you know, oh, you know you just You know, we want to.

165
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:47,170
Scott: we could get rid of say I don't know tax filing.

166
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:51,345
Rym: We can literally just get rid of that whole industry and have the government auto file taxes for people.

167
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,897
Scott: that would put that way No doubt, that would be a good ends.

168
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:59,270
Scott: Yeah, we can achieve that by murdering every single person at the TurboTax corporation.

169
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,535
Rym: Well, we could also have.

170
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,261
Scott: it would not justify those.

171
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,470
Scott: those means would not justify that end.

172
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,436
Rym: Yeah, but a but even imagine this.

173
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:10,750
Rym: the means would be the IRS just provides it for free as a service.

174
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:17,110
Rym: the Includes a whole ton of people don't have jobs anymore.

175
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:18,774
Scott: Well, but that's it.

176
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:19,436
Scott: That's an ends.

177
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,929
Scott: That's not a means that has nothing to do with ends justifying the means.

178
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,196
Scott: Those are ends.

179
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,504
Scott: Those are additional ends.

180
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,429
Scott: Those aren't means.

181
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:35,050
Rym: Arguably, well one could argue that shutting down the industry is also the means to the end of people don't have to do taxes anymore.

182
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,834
Scott: Semantic I think.

183
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:45,536
Scott: people get the idea that you know, it's like yeah there are cases where ends don't justify means.

184
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:52,929
Scott: but it's like yeah, if you're if your means is trick someone and the end is You know end a pandemic.

185
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:57,266
Scott: You could just have them, you know that end could justify that means.

186
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,786
Scott: it definitely could You know.

187
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,182
Rym: So in some other news, I know we talked about this before.

188
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:09,100
Rym: we thought that the peppermint butler Adventure time was gonna come next as most people did.

189
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,670
Rym: we learned that in fact, it's the one about Finn and Jake.

190
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,443
Rym: Neither of us have seen it yet.

191
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,049
Rym: Uh But people are talking about it already.

192
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:26,026
Scott: All I've really seen you know is is you know, not that I care about spoilers But people other people do care about spoilers, so they haven't posted any.

193
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,041
Scott: so I haven't seen any And not that I'm looking for them either.

194
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:37,045
Scott: I'm just gonna watch it probably pretty soon Yep, but yeah, what I've seen is a lot of people have saying like wow that hits hard Wow.

195
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:41,430
Scott: It is serious Wow I shouldn't have watched that to start my day what?

196
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,397
Rym: clubs headline Bob said it best.

197
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:49,030
Rym: Finn and Jake are back and they've brought adventure times darker impulses with them.

198
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:55,848
Scott: Yes, that gives me the impression that maybe they should have done this one last unless the P butts one got something going on.

199
00:14:55,968 --> 00:15:01,210
Rym: Yeah Maybe they don't want to end on this note, or maybe they'll keep making these forever.

200
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,958
Scott: Maybe that's just how things worked out.

201
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:05,650
Scott: But yeah, apparently this really hits huh?

202
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:11,149
Rym: So that your time as a whole hit pretty hard in a lot of different.

203
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,510
Rym: no Apparently this is this is even more even more and I want that because adventure time pushed.

204
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,858
Rym: I do want that and all sorts of different directions.

205
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,644
Rym: So fuck me up with the.

206
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,430
Rym: fuck me up with the feels adventure time.

207
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:22,012
Rym: I'm ready.

208
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:23,036
Scott: You're gonna get fucked up.

209
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,060
Scott: That's what's gonna happen.

210
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:33,185
Rym: I Think I'm excited enough about this to where even though we're only about halfway through the last season of castle vassal I think we're gonna watch this first.

211
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,458
Rym: Mmm, I didn't see one spoiler.

212
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:49,346
Rym: I ended up a random YouTube video for Castlevania got recommended to me and the title was so and so's death in Castlevania and it had a thumbnail that was like well, that's how that character goes down.

213
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:50,450
Rym: Thank you Internet.

214
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,079
Scott: I guess I kind of wonder who it could be.

215
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:07,830
Rym: Well knowing the Castlevania lore excludes several characters Indeed unless they break from the Castlevania lore I mean I could I'm willing to put a small amount of money down.

216
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,596
Rym: Yeah, well we'll talk about that separately.

217
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:15,225
Rym: when we actually talk about that show ending I think it.

218
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:16,570
Rym: I think it'll deserve a final thoughts.

219
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:20,220
Rym: episode Mmm, like a review of the entire thing.

220
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,550
Scott: It's not really gonna end they're gonna make another thing.

221
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,695
Rym: Ah, the another thing though.

222
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:27,130
Rym: They've said it's gonna be different characters and possibly in a different part of the timeline.

223
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,058
Scott: I think it'll be a different Belmont right?

224
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:29,901
Scott: This one is what.

225
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,010
Scott: which Belmont are we dealing with in the current one Trevor?

226
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,052
Rym: Yeah, the next.

227
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:40,981
Rym: so they could go Richter they or they could go Simon do a precursor story Which I think there's plenty of Belmont's that they can do right?

228
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,366
Rym: I'd like to see a Simon one.

229
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:53,519
Rym: I Mean, yeah, duh But anyway things of the day, what do you got?

230
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,406
Scott: So this?

231
00:16:55,487 --> 00:17:00,208
Scott: articles from like late April here and What it is.

232
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:16,585
Scott: It's sort of like this I guess a piece in this magazine about this guy and his job or at least his job was To be the money collecting counting person for the MTA Right in New York.

233
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:19,479
Scott: So all the basically all the subway bus money.

234
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,791
Scott: You know all the cash right it has.

235
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,500
Scott: you know, you put quarters in the in the bus.

236
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:34,960
Scott: You can still do that if even though they they take you can swipe your phone in the bus now But you can still put quarters in And you know if on the subway it's like yeah, you got the MetroCard, but then they got the MetroCard machines.

237
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,724
Scott: You're shitting cash into those things and then MetroCard come out or you go up to the window the window You give them cash.

238
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:42,808
Scott: they give you MetroCards.

239
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:50,510
Scott: right all that cash goes to one place eventually Where it is counted and organized and such and such.

240
00:17:51,573 --> 00:18:02,487
Scott: and this person was the boss of that place And you know its security and its operations for a very long time and It's pretty close to where we live.

241
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:26,918
Scott: It's it's you know, we don't know the exact location because it's semi-secret But you know, it's mixed in amongst the bakeries and other warehouses and stuff over there garages and it's really fascinating how that kind of place operates and it seems you know, like It would be very lucrative if you could heist it but also next to impossible to heist it.

242
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:34,738
Rym: well It would be easier to heist Materially than Fort Knox just because cash is way lighter than gold.

243
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:36,967
Scott: Sure, Fort Knox.

244
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:42,396
Scott: I heard doesn't have that much gold is really the Federal Reserve you want to get yeah Which is also nearby in a basement.

245
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:42,759
Scott: Good luck.

246
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:55,679
Rym: Yeah I always just think back to why didn't fucking anyone in high school Actually tell me about the kinds of jobs that existed in the real world?

247
00:18:56,442 --> 00:19:01,660
Scott: Well, cuz these are these jobs that are like this that are like these one in a million jobs, right?

248
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,262
Scott: It's like this.

249
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:03,829
Scott: it's it's a unique position.

250
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,620
Scott: It's not like oh you could be a cash room runner.

251
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,979
Scott: It's like that's not a common job.

252
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,720
Rym: There's only so many come from someone working in an industry and slowly Specializing while also rising in the ranks within that industry.

253
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:27,430
Scott: There's only so many organizations that have a need for such a person and that person usually gets in that position Because they've done like.

254
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,052
Scott: another thing.

255
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:41,940
Scott: like I remember I was listening to a podcast About the guy who was a lawyer and you know, there was like the 9/11 You know fund to sort of give money to all the people who suffered in 9/11 right to distribute money, right?

256
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,893
Scott: So this lawyer was just like managing this this, you know benefit fund, right?

257
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,860
Scott: How did that lawyer get that job?

258
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,289
Scott: Apparently a long time ago.

259
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,065
Scott: There was some other similar fund.

260
00:19:52,306 --> 00:20:09,060
Scott: the guy was just you know, like a early in his career kind of lawyer and He just happened to get you know a job You know managing one of those sorts of funds and is just now by circumstance these like premier expert on running those sorts of things.

261
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:15,067
Scott: Right, it's it's not so like if you go to law school there probably isn't even like, you know I can't imagine there.

262
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:19,528
Scott: Maybe there's a class on something like that Because it's such a specialized thing.

263
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,975
Scott: How many of those frickin things are there right?

264
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,741
Scott: You know, not too many It's.

265
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:37,290
Scott: you know, there aren't room for that many specialists, but just being in the right place at the right time You know and have is just how you can end up in something and then if there's just the right number of Things in that category.

266
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,618
Scott: Well now that's your that's your life.

267
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:47,763
Rym: now You know, it's kind of funny cuz that's sort of how I like on a low-key way how I ended up doing the kind of work that I do is I learned this one protocol and Slowly.

268
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:51,480
Rym: that just kept worming its way into my life and giving me like different opportunity.

269
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:52,987
Scott: You didn't I didn't seek out.

270
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,192
Scott: you didn't seek it out.

271
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:54,594
Scott: You weren't?

272
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:55,960
Scott: you didn't know about it in advance.

273
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,086
Scott: You're just in a spot.

274
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:59,380
Scott: you had to learn that you were in a spot doing a thing.

275
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:03,780
Scott: You had to learn a thing and then because you learn the thing then not too many other people knew.

276
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:04,753
Scott: Well now that's your thing.

277
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:14,473
Rym: Yep I'm trying to get away from that being my thing But it's hard because I have a. I have a scarily deep reputation for strangers I meet in my industry like oh, you're the fixed guy.

278
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:16,120
Scott: I know you I've heard of you.

279
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:20,750
Rym: Okay No one remembers me as the clock setting guy.

280
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,740
Rym: At least I got a guy wormed my way out of that one.

281
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,226
Scott: You should go back to clock setting.

282
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:24,748
Scott: It's more fun.

283
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:25,933
Rym: It's different now.

284
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,902
Rym: I actually don't know the state-of-the-art Me either.

285
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,630
Rym: Yeah, it's not NTP though.

286
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,614
Rym: I'll tell you that you could.

287
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:32,457
Scott: you could figure it out.

288
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:32,839
Scott: I'm sure.

289
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,228
Rym: well I have people who do that for me.

290
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,437
Rym: I could I could go ask my people.

291
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,540
Rym: Anyway, so my thing of the day could possibly.

292
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:51,726
Rym: Well, probably not because I doubt there's a lot of glass in this place But it could plausibly if there was a glass security wall of some kind be a way to Perhaps liberate some of that coin.

293
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:53,392
Scott: So, uh, never.

294
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:59,220
Rym: I never heard of this term before but I learned it Well, I was literally looking up the details of this thing of the day.

295
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:04,120
Rym: There's a whole Wikipedia article on the concept of ninja rocks.

296
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,979
Scott: That sounds like a kids show.

297
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:08,324
Rym: Yep, it's also.

298
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:17,819
Rym: I guess these existed before but they started being called ninja rocks in the 90s Probably because America was obsessed with ninjas for some reason during that era.

299
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,653
Rym: Like that was the thing late 80s through like late 90s like America.

300
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:24,840
Rym: There's a lot of ninja stuff in pop culture.

301
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,799
Scott: So we need sure we should bring the ninjas back a ninja rock.

302
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:38,554
Rym: There's a small Incredibly light thing Usually made of like alumina and it looks like a really tiny pebble.

303
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:41,606
Rym: like they're so small and light You'll be shocked that this would work.

304
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:47,531
Rym: But if you throw them at a piece of glass Especially safety glass tempered glass.

305
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:54,656
Rym: It'll just fucking shatter Mm-hmm, like a pebble wouldn't do it even with the glasses even if the glass is laminated.

306
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:59,720
Rym: Yeah laminated Tempered glass it'll shatter but it'll stay within the laminate usually.

307
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:01,489
Scott: Well, that's what lemon it's for.

308
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,740
Scott: Yeah, you don't get cut up with glass if it breaks.

309
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:05,971
Rym: So, uh what the so I want?

310
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,960
Rym: I wondered after I learned these are called ninja rocks.

311
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,426
Rym: Hey could I buy these on Amazon?

312
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:19,116
Scott: and it turns out you could just buy them on Amazon because I've heard rumors that you could just Like take a spark plug and sort of smash it and take the pieces of the ceramic part.

313
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,140
Rym: That is exactly it.

314
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:26,640
Rym: Nothing, if you can't buy anything called a ninja rock on Amazon But you can buy spark plugs for a few bucks each.

315
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:31,560
Rym: And yeah, basically just smash a spark plug with a hammer and all the white pieces that fall out.

316
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,364
Rym: Those are ninja rocks.

317
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,919
Scott: Like how how hard do you have to throw it?

318
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,150
Rym: Uh, not that hard like with your arm strength.

319
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:42,102
Rym: You could basically carry them in your pocket Like it.

320
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:43,426
Scott: or does I have to throw it?

321
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:47,700
Rym: throw like imagine throwing a tiny pebble like it's a baseball.

322
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:53,420
Rym: Okay, so you have to react to throw it like wing it like you're trying to skip a rock about that level of violence.

323
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:56,212
Scott: Right, but like if I just go like eh it's not gonna do it.

324
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,176
Scott: probably some power.

325
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:57,940
Scott: you need some power.

326
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:01,613
Scott: Yeah, but you know what is what is so if this this?

327
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:02,557
Scott: I've only heard of this.

328
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,400
Scott: I've never witnessed it.

329
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,484
Scott: It weren't really true.

330
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:05,207
Scott: I've done it.

331
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:08,340
Scott: if it's really true explained to me the physics behind this.

332
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,059
Rym: Oh, so the ceramic or alumina like that type of material is extremely brittle and extremely hard.

333
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:24,590
Rym: It also if you break it because it's so brittle it forms a lot like multiple extremely sharp points That are small.

334
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,620
Scott: That's that's true.

335
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:37,640
Rym: so if you wing it at a piece of tempered glass those sharp points have a high percentage likelihood of Hitting one of those tiny fault lines that causes the tensile strength to loot to explode and have the whole thing shatter.

336
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,178
Scott: It's I say because it is so pointy.

337
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:44,684
Scott: Yes All of the power goes into that one Very small area.

338
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:48,817
Rym: you need pointy and hard are the key but you might but you might.

339
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:52,171
Scott: if you miss You may have to throw if you might not work every time.

340
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:57,437
Rym: the thing is when I've done it It worked every time and I've seen videos where it just works.

341
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,692
Scott: every time Like I have to watch on you you have a easier thing of the day.

342
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:05,159
Scott: YouTube video explaining it is Frating because my good and I don't have to search for one.

343
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:06,524
Rym: I don't know.

344
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:11,859
Rym: I haven't used the slow-mo guys in a long time because the I've talked about I've used them multiple times.

345
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:25,190
Rym: Oh Yeah, they uploaded a new video Yesterday because there is a new phantom camera and it can record at up to 800,000 frames per second.

346
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:26,313
Scott: It's a big number.

347
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:30,346
Rym: That is the biggest number that Still black.

348
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:31,111
Scott: Is it black and white?

349
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:31,634
Scott: I'm guessing.

350
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:34,322
Rym: Nope full color This can.

351
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:36,448
Scott: usually the ultra high-speed ones are black and white only.

352
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:47,840
Rym: so this one can record like high resolution video at Higher frame rates than almost any one of the cameras they've ever used before and it cost eight hundred thousand dollars a dollar per frame.

353
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:58,145
Rym: So if you turn it if you reduce the vertical resolution But keep the horizontal resolution you get this thing all the way up to a little over 800,000 frames a second.

354
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:02,942
Rym: and it's funny because the first half of the video is he's like this fucking camera Like.

355
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,067
Rym: look at this the.

356
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:09,104
Rym: the exposure time is now being measured in Nanoseconds.

357
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:12,556
Rym: ten twelve nanoseconds of exposure per frame.

358
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:13,720
Scott: That's pretty great.

359
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:33,839
Rym: so, uh, he records throwing a piece of a spark plug add some tempered glass and it's so High frame rate that you actually can see the breaking of the glass moving slowly Which they've never been able to achieve with any camera they've ever had before.

360
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,328
Rym: Awesome, it's Really amazing to watch.

361
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,198
Rym: and of course, they uploaded it in glorious 4k.

362
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,606
Rym: So this video is only is less than 10 minutes long and a hundred percent worth watching In the better moment.

363
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,240
Rym: still mostly stuck inside, but it's warm out.

364
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:56,120
Scott: Yep, we were gonna do a show Tuesday, and we didn't because Rym bailed.

365
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,446
Rym: Yeah, bye bales at the pet.

366
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:58,270
Scott: It was at the pet vet.

367
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,656
Rym: I had to take the pet to the vet.

368
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,023
Rym: moogies fine He's.

369
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,436
Rym: he's got to go back to the vet on Monday for a tooth thing.

370
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:10,984
Rym: He needs a dental Cleaning and we got to grind down some little spurs on his teeth, but he's doing fine Tooth spurs.

371
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:12,410
Scott: I want can I get some tooth spurs?

372
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,193
Rym: You don't want to spurs.

373
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,418
Rym: They hurt a little bit when you chew.

374
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,369
Rym: No, I'm gonna grind it down to get rid of them.

375
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,923
Scott: Yeah, I wanted to grind up things by chewing Molars.

376
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,070
Rym: for that your molars are good enough.

377
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,307
Rym: Yeah, they're okay My molars are pretty good at that.

378
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,597
Rym: But uh, yeah, we'll do that show.

379
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,965
Rym: Don't worry We'll review Pokemon snap.

380
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:35,580
Rym: It's uh, it's just Pokemon snap to like almost exactly.

381
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:42,533
Scott: also in the meta moment The book club book is still you know, the tale of Genji.

382
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,793
Scott: It's gonna be that for a while, you know But hopefully not too much longer.

383
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,156
Scott: We'll see.

384
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:47,163
Rym: Yep I'll.

385
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:52,974
Rym: uh, the problem is even if I start going back to my office in the coming months Occasionally, I'm gonna be biking cuz I'm not riding the subway yet.

386
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:53,920
Rym: So nothing's changing.

387
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,391
Scott: Well, you know what was changed.

388
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:59,966
Scott: I think is that I'm not Watching hockey games.

389
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:03,680
Scott: so that is basically if I'm not doing GeekNights, you know I'm gavel.

390
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,577
Scott: I have more free time than I did before and not losing like a few hours here and there.

391
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:08,199
Scott: and also the.

392
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,570
Scott: you know This hockey season there were so many games closer together.

393
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,917
Scott: So I was losing way more time.

394
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:19,020
Rym: Yeah, but But also it's warm enough for me to just go sit in the park and read which is something I've been right.

395
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:27,160
Scott: The balcony I have here compared to the one at my previous apartment is way more usable and comfy.

396
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,795
Scott: So if it's warm, it's like I got it's like I finish eating dinner.

397
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:31,618
Scott: It's like what I got to do.

398
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,188
Scott: Oh go outside and read on my balcony.

399
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:34,549
Scott: Why not?

400
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:34,911
Scott: Yeah.

401
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:35,212
Scott: Yep.

402
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:39,408
Rym: And while I could also play the switch out there I'm uh, I'm switched out right now.

403
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,873
Rym: I've played enough games on the switch.

404
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:41,938
Rym: I played Pokemon snap.

405
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:42,540
Rym: enough to review it.

406
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,451
Rym: I don't have to play switch every single night and people are.

407
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:50,884
Scott: you know, I could play games with people But people don't seem to want to play games Much these days.

408
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:53,151
Scott: they want to go where it's warm play overwatch with me.

409
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:55,137
Rym: No, I'll buy it for you.

410
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,054
Scott: No I don't even have battle net installed anymore.

411
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:08,405
Rym: I'm trying to cut down I don't build up and I guess otherwise stay tuned for there's gonna be a new another packs online and There's a high likelihood.

412
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,734
Rym: We'll be doing between one and three panels for it.

413
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:14,009
Rym: So stay tuned on that and It's all I got.

414
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,111
Scott: Follow us on just yeah follow us in the internet.

415
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:19,014
Scott: We are everywhere.

416
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:24,753
Scott: and I just want to remind people You know that our forum specifically, you know, we got a discord going on.

417
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,600
Scott: We got a forum, you know, we got Twitter.

418
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,520
Scott: You know, we got YouTube, right?

419
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:28,901
Scott: We got.

420
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:31,511
Scott: I think our community has become like a little dispersed.

421
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:36,419
Scott: right people are going to the place that they want to be Which is good, right go to the place that you want to be.

422
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:43,480
Scott: But our forum specifically right I think is like not getting.

423
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:49,580
Scott: You know, it's it's still active even after all these years, but it's like its activeness is not increasing.

424
00:29:49,861 --> 00:30:03,657
Rym: Well, it's interesting because the mostly what I see is forums serve an important purpose But it's a purpose that a lot of people on the internet don't care about anymore as if you want to have an asynchronous Conversation where you type a lot.

425
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:16,000
Scott: well, that's true, but I think also there are quite a few people who use our forum as Like a platform to like host what would otherwise be like a standalone blog, right?

426
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,250
Scott: So it's like we got.

427
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:18,260
Rym: I like that a lot.

428
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,287
Rym: I actually like.

429
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:25,520
Rym: I don't post in our forum a ton because I'm busy But I read our forum because good stuff gets posted there, right?

430
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,920
Scott: So like imagine, you know, it's like, you know We got a listener who's big in a pro wrestling that we haven't been into since we were kids.

431
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:38,180
Scott: Right and when big pro wrestling stuff comes they make what's basically in this one thread like a huge as blog post.

432
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,975
Scott: I read it even though I don't know or care about pro wrestling that much.

433
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:43,320
Scott: Yeah, I read it.

434
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,852
Scott: Anyway, you know something big will happen in like, you know, I don't know.

435
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:48,317
Scott: imagine the gathering and it's like.

436
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:55,645
Scott: we don't care about that But there's a listener who does and they come and make a huge blog post about it right or you know We don't care about.

437
00:30:55,665 --> 00:31:01,719
Scott: I don't care about Formula One racing as much as I used to but occasionally some Something will happen and someone will post a big thing.

438
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:10,848
Scott: You know, it's like those people could just have their own blogs of their own Twitter threads and post those things on their own somewhere But they all post them in the same place.

439
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,336
Scott: as we got a friend who's designing a board game.

440
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:16,960
Scott: They make like huge Design diary posts all the time, right?

441
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,212
Rym: It's like and I see that's a ton of people read that stuff.

442
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:24,020
Rym: Even if very few people are posting that stuff, right?

443
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,300
Scott: So it's like if you started your own WordPress blog, you know, how many people would read it, right?

444
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,700
Scott: You know if you're if you're not already a popular famous internet person probably it, you know, it'd be hard, right?

445
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:41,260
Scott: So, you know, I would recommend if you if you're this something you're doing, you know that you could make like a big-ass posts about right?

446
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,395
Scott: It's like I'm posting big-ass kpop posts in there that no one responds to but I think people are.

447
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:45,917
Rym: I read.

448
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:46,660
Rym: I read everyone.

449
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,424
Rym: They're fascinating.

450
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:51,406
Scott: I don't care if people are reading them or not But I just you could read.

451
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:59,579
Rym: you could probably get a history of like the last X years of kpop I really like there's been a thread that I've been enjoying that is just called songs about trains that you started.

452
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,659
Rym: and Yeah, it just keeps going And I keep finding more songs about trains.

453
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:15,000
Rym: My favorite post though was someone who just out of nowhere realized that song that was made famous in the Blues Brothers is about a train.

454
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:25,020
Scott: Sure, so, you know, I just if you're so if you're somehow listening to this I think you belong at least as a lurker in our forum.

455
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:30,071
Rym: It is totally cool to lurk in that forum Like you don't have to community community front row crew.

456
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,540
Scott: calm if you try to make an account there.

457
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:42,680
Scott: Make sure that when you fill out the registration form you fill out all the stuff and make make it clear to me Who will be seeing or registration application that you are a real human being?

458
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,119
Scott: You know who listens and whatnot, so I don't reject you.

459
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:55,040
Scott: And if I do reject you just email me and that will make it very clear or you know It'll make it clear that you were real person and I rejected you back.

460
00:32:56,101 --> 00:33:06,796
Scott: But I've never had I assume like I'm basically not hesitant at all to reject if I have the slightest doubt because I feel like If I accidentally reject someone they'll be like, hey, why'd I get rejected?

461
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:07,960
Scott: I'm like, ah, it's a real first.

462
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,789
Scott: Yeah, I'll fix that right for you right now.

463
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,993
Scott: That's never happened.

464
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:15,059
Rym: So and our discord is cool I like our discord too.

465
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,400
Rym: I actually I try to make a point of hanging out in there more even if I don't post a lot cuz I'm just busy.

466
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:26,679
Rym: But you know the difference between them is the discord is just people kind of bantering and playing random games And it's a fun active place.

467
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,629
Rym: But like Scott said the forum is really like.

468
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:32,759
Rym: just there's a lot of content there and that content is actually pretty good.

469
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:39,524
Scott: The discord people do have little do use the voice chat a lot and hang out and they also will stream games They're playing.

470
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,800
Scott: I seen people streaming some some stuff in there.

471
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,874
Rym: We will eventually when they add slide and video support to the discord stage We will definitely also be doing GeekNights.

472
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:49,738
Rym: live in there.

473
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:53,835
Rym: Yep, so actually last thing I'll say we're.

474
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:57,948
Rym: I don't know when we're gonna do this But we are we're planning at some point.

475
00:33:57,968 --> 00:33:59,372
Rym: talk today.

476
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:18,697
Rym: This is something I 100% want to do is use the discord stage To do a call-in show which we never did before because while we had the technology to do it The pipeline to do call-in podcasts is a gigantic pain in the ass and the discord stage Actually makes it really reasonable and easy to do.

477
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:20,826
Scott: Yep, theoretically.

478
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,311
Rym: Yeah, and I want to try it.

479
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:28,172
Scott: So stay tuned after him after 15 years We'll finally do the call-in style radio show.

480
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:34,014
Scott: We won't do it all the time something something that Something that normal old radio stations have been doing since telephones.

481
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,100
Rym: Yeah, you know how they did it.

482
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,460
Rym: They had the if it was a show with like two hosts.

483
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:41,735
Rym: They had the third person who dealt with all that shit and had a bunch of technology.

484
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,940
Scott: It was their actual jobs.

485
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:47,714
Rym: Yeah, we're not hiring anyone to work on the GeekNights except like graphic designers and maybe some coders.

486
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,958
Rym: but stay tuned on that, too.

487
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:54,543
Scott: mm-hmm all right, so The title?

488
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:55,726
Scott: yeah, well it was.

489
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:59,378
Scott: it was my idea that I was against that I knew Rym would be for.

490
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:03,630
Scott: yeah Basically, you know how we have tech news roundup, right?

491
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:14,700
Scott: But it's all tech news and I was like, hey, it's Thursday Let's just do a roundup of things that are a not news Not things of the day because we could use those as news the things that they don't waste them, right?

492
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:20,660
Scott: And are not things that could be a GeekNights' show topic, right?

493
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,329
Scott: But yet you have something to say right?

494
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,640
Scott: that seems to happen quite a bit like I got something to say about something.

495
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,365
Scott: Yeah, right, but yet It's not like a show topic.

496
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:37,484
Scott: It could be like a mini rant, but it isn't necessarily a negative grind My gears style rant.

497
00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:43,004
Scott: it could just be like I noticed a thing and I have something to say about it and whatever and I Was like it.

498
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:47,256
Scott: well if we could you know Just combine all those into one show.

499
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:49,504
Scott: that got real Out of your system.

500
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:52,593
Rym: Eldian swatch the deal with.

501
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:53,355
Scott: we already did it.

502
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:55,340
Scott: We already did a podcast about nothing.

503
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:59,204
Scott: We can't do that again But it's a.

504
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:04,948
Rym: it's funny cuz on the patreon for a while and I kind of stopped doing it during Covid in particular and a little bit before.

505
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,253
Rym: there's rants Rym's rants.

506
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:07,780
Rym: I am planning to bring that back.

507
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:15,319
Rym: I just I got to get enough of a Backlog right after the cut right after the call-in show, uh, probably right after the call-in show actually.

508
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,940
Rym: But I did that for a while.

509
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:34,714
Rym: But what I struggled with was that because that was a scheduled thing I had to have something to talk about every week and I had to force it and I felt like I had to talk about it long enough to make it like a podcast If that was worth listening to like go at least 15 or 20 minutes.

510
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,698
Rym: Otherwise, like who cares?

511
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,859
Rym: So It's a lot of things.

512
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:45,440
Rym: I have maybe Three minutes of things to say but then Scott might have something to say and it's a lot harder to do that kind of thing.

513
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:51,740
Rym: When it's just me talking to the void I feel like I have to lecture and fill the time as opposed to a normal conversation.

514
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:55,593
Rym: Two friends might have about a thing where stop Scott might have some insight.

515
00:36:55,653 --> 00:37:08,518
Rym: I didn't think of or an anecdote to relate and like how every now and then mere Scott has had to do a panel by herself at a con and It's way hard to do the kind of panel we do for an hour without someone else to bounce off of.

516
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,923
Rym: hmm Is by myself once at a Connecticut and that was grueling All right.

517
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:19,440
Scott: So here's an is an example of something that came to mind where I got something to say, right?

518
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:29,935
Scott: So, you know being a person who has you know podcasted Streamed YouTube videoed owns lots of cameras and other recording equipment, right?

519
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:31,620
Scott: I sort my brain.

520
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,928
Scott: It's like any literally almost anything I do.

521
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:37,720
Scott: that's not just like everyday stuff or even sometimes everyday stuff.

522
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:45,020
Scott: I sort of get into my head the idea like oh, man I should record that or put it up or make a. you know, I've been production out of it.

523
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,771
Rym: I have forced myself years ago to not live that way because for the first like five years We did GeekNights that consumed my every thought.

524
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:59,880
Rym: anything I did anywhere was like, oh I gotta figure out how to turn this into content and put it on geek dice expand the Empire, huh?

525
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,456
Scott: Really it's like in me up All right, it's like oh let's go biking.

526
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:05,940
Scott: it's like man.

527
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:19,939
Scott: I should bring camera and I should make I should make like a little video montage of this bike ride and upload it when I'm done Right, and what I found is that you know, maybe if I did that every single time, right?

528
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,585
Scott: It would be enough content.

529
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:27,807
Scott: It actually, you know, I would get better at it from practicing and doing it more And it would grow an audience and it would.

530
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:28,530
Scott: there would be.

531
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,940
Scott: there probably could be a return on investment.

532
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:40,112
Scott: But the problem is is that the effort required in doing it sort of a takes away from the thing you're actually doing.

533
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:47,900
Scott: yup, right and B puts up a barrier to where you might not actually do the thing, right?

534
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,520
Scott: So like, you know, oh I'm gonna go on this bike ride.

535
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,391
Scott: Well now if I'm gonna carry all this camera shit, maybe I'm.

536
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:54,997
Scott: you know, it's like fuck it.

537
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:57,287
Scott: Let's just stay home Right or all right.

538
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:09,036
Scott: Well, let's not bike as far because I'm carrying all this shit or You know, I'm not gonna bike along I'm not gonna bike long and get in the zone Right and concentrate and biking because I keep stopping and doing camera shit all the time.

539
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,505
Rym: the GoPro Problem is what I've seen.

540
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:17,714
Rym: some people call that they get a GoPro and then now like every time they ski they think well I bought that GoPro.

541
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:18,339
Rym: I can't waste it.

542
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:25,080
Rym: So they like try to use the GoPro to capture video of skiing But that's really hard and it adds a lot of overhead to skiing.

543
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:38,120
Rym: I'm a lot happier when I don't either don't bring that GoPro at all or I bring it and I tell myself in advance I am only going to bother fucking with this piece device if something interesting is happening and I want to record this for me.

544
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:42,606
Scott: Yeah, that's what I do is I have Yeah on my bike.

545
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:50,500
Scott: I have a GoPro mount on the front and when I go on the bike ride I put the GoPro in there and I make sure the batteries are charged and the memory cards empty up.

546
00:39:51,507 --> 00:40:01,424
Scott: But other than that I don't like, you know Turn it on record the whole ride Swap the memory cards and swap the batteries constantly because that's a pain in the butt and you know, you don't remember it You don't notice it.

547
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:04,377
Scott: It's a big distraction and you just get a bunch of useless footage.

548
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:10,779
Scott: Yeah, right It's like if I need to take photos and I'm on a bike ride I just use my iPhone which is actually a better still camera than the GoPro is.

549
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,654
Scott: At least the GoPro that I have.

550
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:13,420
Rym: I have the newest.

551
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,365
Rym: It's actually I've GoPro.

552
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,268
Scott: I have GoPro 5.

553
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:18,776
Rym: the newest GoPro is scary good.

554
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,120
Scott: It's really good.

555
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,753
Scott: Yeah, the five is still 4k 30 or whatever.

556
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,100
Scott: I'll just still plenty good enough.

557
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,440
Rym: Oh, yeah I mean for the things will actually use them for to make content like review con like recording ourselves playing a board game.

558
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,740
Rym: Those two GoPros are going to be indispensable.

559
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:42,579
Scott: Yeah I think the the features that the only feature I've seen that my GoPro does not have that new war ones do have is the Ability to stream to your phone which would then stream to the internet.

560
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,914
Rym: Yeah I think I have more slow-mo options and the low-light performance is better.

561
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:49,436
Scott: You probably like higher frame rate or whatever Stuff like that.

562
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:52,551
Scott: But anyway, the point is is it's just like.

563
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:54,340
Scott: yeah, it's just a thing that you know.

564
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:02,670
Scott: I could talk about that, you know I could produce more content, but I don't because it makes you know, it's sort of like.

565
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:07,934
Scott: You know sort of like interferes with the thing you're actually doing.

566
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:16,940
Scott: running of Strava Strava Addiction is something people run into to where like I don't have that Right, I push start and when I end the bike ride if I stop.

567
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:25,711
Rym: Yeah, but the people who like have to make sure it's right and worry about the stats and like get it every time like lately Unless I'm running like four or five miles.

568
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:30,850
Rym: Like if I'm doing a short workout, I don't track it I don't like going to Google Fit and like even type anything in.

569
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:37,695
Rym: I don't even try to even bring my phone and it's so It was so liberating to just walk outside start running not think about anything.

570
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:38,257
Rym: Just enjoy it.

571
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:46,239
Rym: yep, I the only I basically if it's The listener is just like ah GoPro FOMO.

572
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:49,269
Scott: Yeah, because Oh FOMO for sure.

573
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:55,396
Scott: Yeah, it's like I have my bike computer Which I only use them like a long bike ride when I need the GPS functionality.

574
00:41:55,817 --> 00:42:03,140
Scott: and with that I just I'm putting I'm gonna be using the bike computer because I want to don't not get lost and that will Automatically send over to Strava, right?

575
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,528
Scott: So I have to do any special Strava stuff right.

576
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:10,566
Scott: the indoor biking again with the with the Zwift bike MMO Automatically will go to Strava.

577
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,153
Scott: I don't do anything special right?

578
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:19,986
Scott: my Apple watch If I go if I if it senses that I'm exercising It'll be like hey, are you walking?

579
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:22,153
Scott: and I'll just be like, yes, right?

580
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:25,764
Scott: I don't go into it and intentionally You know poke it.

581
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,913
Scott: It's just I let everything sort of track passively.

582
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:30,458
Scott: if something isn't passively tracked.

583
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:33,440
Scott: It's not tracked I don't care, right just go about my business.

584
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,641
Scott: But

585
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:53,100
Rym: I don't want to get too far in the direction of never making interesting content because one of the things that did make us Sort of get good at this quickly was we were a little hungry to make content and we did experiment a lot in the early Days, it was a lot of effort and we kind of stopped like the last like seven or eight packs as we went to.

586
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:58,935
Rym: We literally brought the bare minimum equipment to do the bare minimum content creation and we just enjoyed our packs.

587
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:05,013
Scott: and I don't I've had This idea like oh, I got all this stuff I'll edit the video on my laptop while we're there.

588
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:06,099
Scott: and it's I never did it.

589
00:43:06,763 --> 00:43:08,835
Rym: That one never really and it was barely did.

590
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:14,019
Rym: it was fine early But we recorded one of those and I was pretty drunk and it worked out.

591
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:21,750
Rym: But like in San Antonio that one year we went around and spent like an hour Interviewing those statues and like doing a bunch of fun.

592
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,138
Scott: You're very lonely at that that that packs out of the first.

593
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,897
Rym: Yeah we also.

594
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:33,779
Rym: We did that thing like three or four times where we'd go through the expo hall and like get a bunch of footage and like Put a big video together and it was fun.

595
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:38,580
Rym: But it took so much effort and so few people gave a shit after the first one.

596
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:39,603
Rym: Yep.

597
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,892
Scott: Well, I don't care how many people give a shit.

598
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:43,317
Scott: It's a question of whether I enjoy me.

599
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:43,940
Rym: That's it.

600
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,080
Rym: I'm focusing right now on other than baseline geek diets where it's like we still force ourselves to do it.

601
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:58,505
Rym: But I'm not gonna try to make content unless it is fun to make that content beyond the baseline content I already make right.

602
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:02,318
Scott: if I'm if I'm gonna be making content, it's like I. you know, it can't be.

603
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:05,554
Scott: you know It's like I've always thought oh, it's you know, it's it's so great.

604
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:09,834
Scott: video photo Recording just sort of goes with everything that you're doing right.

605
00:44:09,874 --> 00:44:14,211
Scott: if I'm doing some other hobby It's like well, I can just combo or I can get two for one deal.

606
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:15,656
Scott: But now it's like.

607
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:24,589
Scott: I still do Photo video stuff as a hobby, but I'm only doing it if it is the primary thing Like I'm going to go out and do photos now, right?

608
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:25,471
Scott: It's photo time.

609
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:26,092
Scott: I'm not like.

610
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:34,186
Scott: well, I'm doing um, I don't know Biking right better, you know carry 20 cameras with That happening.

611
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:36,776
Rym: Well, I remember the moment the one magfest.

612
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:39,044
Rym: we were like fuck it Let's not even record our panels.

613
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:42,916
Rym: and I packed so little to bring to that con.

614
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:43,658
Rym: It was weird.

615
00:44:43,678 --> 00:44:45,103
Scott: Yeah All right.

616
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:46,809
Scott: So that was that's an example of a thing.

617
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,134
Scott: I got something to talk about.

618
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:48,957
Scott: It's not a show.

619
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:49,519
Scott: It's not you.

620
00:44:53,183 --> 00:45:08,391
Rym: So I grew this beard because you know been my whole life I would I was mustached until not too long after RIT and then I got rid of the mustache and then I would alternate between clean-shaven stubbly because I'm lazy and Scraggly beard because I'm extra lazy.

621
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:10,000
Rym: that eventually goes back to clean-shaven.

622
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:18,139
Rym: Maybe like four or five times I've grown a beard on purpose, but usually only for a relatively short span of time that I get rid of it.

623
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:24,898
Rym: but I grew a beard during quarantine and I kind of just kept it and I actually maintained it.

624
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:27,399
Rym: and Now I'm in a situation where?

625
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:35,774
Rym: Almost everyone I know who has interacted with me on video chat is Constantly telling me that I look better with a beard and I should keep the beard.

626
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:41,196
Rym: and there's like this Huge pressure of you look great with a beard never get rid of it.

627
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:42,100
Rym: That is amazing.

628
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:57,043
Rym: Yeah, and I would never thought I'd be the kind of person who would wear a beard because I tended to always like to be pretty clean-shaven, uh And I'm 50/50 on if I'm gonna keep the beard after COVID or not It's up to you.

629
00:45:57,063 --> 00:45:57,827
Scott: You can always grow it back.

630
00:45:57,908 --> 00:45:58,652
Scott: I can take.

631
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:01,231
Scott: it takes me when you're 90 year old man The beard still gonna grow.

632
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:08,600
Rym: I mean it takes About eight days to grow a full beard for me Like it's a full beard after eight days like wait eight days shave the neck.

633
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:17,780
Rym: I think the one difference is when I started having a beard longer than two a couple weeks I actually had to go learn how to take care of a beard because it's not actually that intuitive.

634
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:22,240
Rym: Like a lot of people want to grow a beard and the beard ends up not looking the way they want.

635
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:26,599
Rym: Sometimes you just lose the genetic lottery like it's patchy like you can't do anything about that.

636
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,459
Rym: Sometimes you got a hair issue where it doesn't work out.

637
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:37,780
Rym: But if you can grow a good beard Like you got to learn techniques of like what to do about it or it'll kind of look bad by default.

638
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,570
Rym: I think a lot of people get discouraged because it just looks bad.

639
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:47,837
Rym: They don't know why they don't want to pay someone to fix It and you actually have to learn to do some things and maybe even buy a little bit of equipment.

640
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:50,639
Rym: like you can't get away with just scissors most likely.

641
00:46:51,922 --> 00:47:01,520
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I know, you know, I do think I actually look better with you know Some amount of facial pretty good with a beard like a like a one of those clean-cut like a lot like a very stark line.

642
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,460
Rym: Beards looks pretty good on you, right?

643
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:16,288
Scott: The problem is is that basically I was just having so many face problems like, you know Itching and scratching and ingrown herring and all that kind of stuff and I'm just sort of like I went the opposite direction during the quarantine.

644
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:19,137
Scott: It's like well, I don't you know have all this time not commuting.

645
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:28,750
Scott: I can actually shave More frequently, right And you know put lotions on my face whatever.

646
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,940
Scott: I tried the beard oils and they didn't really work.

647
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:32,896
Scott: So that's really that was my attempt right?

648
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:37,520
Scott: It's like alright Let me try these beard oils and my beard oil and a beard balm.

649
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:44,853
Rym: I use the beard oil just kind of all the time and I use the balm if I'm going out or doing a video and I The beard to like stay nice and like well-groomed.

650
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:46,100
Scott: Yeah, it's like it.

651
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,528
Scott: It helped a little bit, but it didn't it.

652
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:54,712
Scott: after a certain point the beard, you know when the beard got bigger It's like no your face itches no matter what now.

653
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:56,438
Scott: and I was like, oh fuck this right.

654
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:01,605
Scott: and it's like This way I don't have any Irritation in my face.

655
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:04,520
Scott: if I just don't have it then who cares if it looks worse, whatever.

656
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,246
Scott: I'd rather not have face irritation up.

657
00:48:06,888 --> 00:48:08,674
Rym: So the listener was actually asked a question.

658
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:10,480
Rym: What special techniques did you have to learn?

659
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:16,200
Rym: I had to learn how how to make the line like where does the line go between beard and neck?

660
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:18,438
Rym: It's real easy to get that wrong.

661
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:24,440
Scott: And I just watched it was a YouTube videos this thing of the day that you that taught you where to go.

662
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,060
Rym: Yeah, I watched a lot of YouTube videos and that one was the one that was like the good thing at the day thing.

663
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:35,994
Rym: But honestly, I just watched like five or six different YouTube videos and they all mostly said the same things about how to manage beards.

664
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:37,259
Rym: and I just did what they said.

665
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:44,643
Rym: and Other than I shaved this a little bit under my lips I can play my trumpet Mmm, actually, that's the segue I've.

666
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:48,879
Rym: I've been playing my trumpet a lot during quarantine and I really want to keep that up.

667
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:50,465
Rym: Like that's one of those things of.

668
00:48:50,766 --> 00:49:01,140
Rym: I'm never gonna make trumpet content or like music content really for the internet ever again because like I'm not gonna dedicate myself to making music enough to be good enough to bother sharing.

669
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:11,920
Rym: But I do appreciate the hobby where you're not a pro You're not the most skilled or the most talented but you do it because it's fun on its own and I'm good.

670
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,880
Scott: I just like I said, I just do photography.

671
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,580
Scott: It's like yeah, basically mostly gave up on like try and like make some portfolio side or that kind of nonsense, right?

672
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:31,180
Rym: Yeah, like I dump a lot of my photos just in my Google photo timeline mostly so in the future I can scroll back through it and just see oh, what was I taking pictures of in like October?

673
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,583
Rym: 2008 like.

674
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,734
Rym: oh, I guess I took a lot of I don't know Google Glass photos.

675
00:49:35,794 --> 00:49:38,837
Rym: that must have been when I had the Google Glass you know.

676
00:49:39,892 --> 00:49:42,188
Rym: but Yeah playing the trumpet.

677
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:58,318
Rym: It's been interesting because It took me a long time like almost a year to get all those muscles back to like be able to play it Well, and it was frustrating because I was very good like to the point where I literally almost went to school for music instead all this tech stuff.

678
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:12,839
Rym: and It was frustrating to have been Legitimately good at something and be terrible at it when you pick it up again because you have lost muscles You've lost like physical skills that you need to relearn.

679
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:15,085
Scott: Well father time.

680
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:17,615
Scott: Yeah, you know imagine what it feels like to be.

681
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:18,880
Scott: I don't know yarmul yaga.

682
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:22,560
Scott: You know who's playing hockey out in Czechoslovakia or whatever?

683
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,090
Rym: I mean even with like as much as I'm doubling down on running.

684
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,436
Scott: Czechoslovakia doesn't exist.

685
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,103
Rym: I'm almost 40.

686
00:50:28,103 --> 00:50:31,094
Rym: I'm never going to run a 17-minute 5k again in my life.

687
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:42,000
Rym: like 20 19 to 20 minutes is the best I'm gonna do and I do not feel great after those 19 minutes in my current body.

688
00:50:42,904 --> 00:50:44,935
Rym: So, you know that we've talked to the geek guys before.

689
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,102
Rym: I'm kind of focusing on Sports.

690
00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:50,935
Rym: at least that I see old people doing a lot.

691
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:52,580
Rym: I don't see old mountain bikers.

692
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:56,240
Rym: I don't see like too many old people rollerblading seriously.

693
00:50:56,722 --> 00:51:00,420
Rym: I see a lot of old runners a lot of old bikers and a lot of old skiers.

694
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:02,146
Rym: So those are the three sports.

695
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:04,313
Rym: I am doubling down on a guy.

696
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:08,166
Scott: should we should quadruple down a shuffleboard there I could play some shuffleboard.

697
00:51:08,186 --> 00:51:08,908
Rym: I like shuffleboard a lot.

698
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:12,420
Scott: I love shuffleboard, but the only place to play shuffleboard is that place in Brooklyn.

699
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,387
Scott: That's all fancy for like, you know pride.

700
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,214
Scott: There's no like, you know, just like.

701
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:17,780
Scott: there's no like shuffleboard just in the park.

702
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,808
Rym: I like bocce more to be honest.

703
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:20,330
Rym: There's buys.

704
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,860
Scott: There's a though the bocce you can do in the park over by me.

705
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:27,257
Rym: So, but actually what I want shuffleboard more what I want to start doing.

706
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,884
Rym: so Ted if you don't live in New York City, like I used to play tennis I used to love tennis.

707
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:39,940
Rym: the problem with New York City is by law You can't actually use the New York City Municipal Tennis Courts without a tennis license.

708
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:49,329
Scott: Yep, there's all sorts of bureaucracy around who gets to play tennis and when on the courts because it's a large amount of space that's Occupied by only two or four people.

709
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:56,036
Scott: Yeah There's only so many courts and there's a lot more people that want to use them than there are courts and time on which to Play them especially on weekends.

710
00:51:56,056 --> 00:52:00,490
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure if you want to play, you know an early afternoon This you might be competing with old people.

711
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:01,357
Scott: There's so many people.

712
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:03,010
Rym: but there's also special tennis courts.

713
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,570
Rym: Like if you bike up the west side, you'll pass a few tennis courts that are special because they're clay.

714
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:09,315
Rym: Aren't that many of those?

715
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:15,792
Scott: there's different courts in different places, you know the sum up in the Bronx and this is private ones There's.

716
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,224
Scott: there's you know, this semi public ones.

717
00:52:18,244 --> 00:52:21,900
Scott: they're all over different Different rules in each one.

718
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:23,389
Rym: like as much as I want to get back into it.

719
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,670
Rym: It's too much of a pain in the ass living in New York City.

720
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,305
Rym: I actually gave up tennis when we left Beacon because in Beacon there's tennis courts.

721
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,570
Rym: I could just go play it like the high school.

722
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,630
Rym: so, uh Yeah, but wall ball courts do are not licensed.

723
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,583
Rym: You can just use a wall ball court if someone else isn't using it.

724
00:52:40,185 --> 00:52:40,908
Scott: So racquetball.

725
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:42,395
Rym: Yeah Well, you can't.

726
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:43,399
Rym: racquetball.

727
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:45,910
Rym: courts are all indoors and mostly private like you gotta pay.

728
00:52:45,931 --> 00:52:49,610
Scott: Oh, no They play racquetball out in like McCarran Park and in the in the same areas.

729
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:54,070
Rym: That is not technically racquetball because you need to have all the walls.

730
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:59,812
Rym: All sides need to be walls at the place where the lines are so you can bounce them off the walls or it's not actually Racquetball.

731
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:02,700
Scott: Well, they're playing one one wall racquetball.

732
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,643
Rym: Yeah, that's not racquetball.

733
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:07,680
Rym: That's that's one of a few different sports But it's racquetball adjacent.

734
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,410
Rym: They're all in the same class of sport.

735
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:12,650
Scott: They have rackets and they got the blue rubber ball and they're hitting it again.

736
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,956
Rym: Yeah, but that is not racquetball.

737
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:16,770
Rym: racquetball rules are very specific around like how it works.

738
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:17,915
Rym: Have you all right?

739
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:19,402
Rym: Have you ever played racquetball?

740
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:20,990
Scott: No, it's old man game.

741
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,559
Rym: Yeah, but it's also a young man game.

742
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,690
Scott: You did just say you're gonna play old man game.

743
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:31,030
Rym: I do but I don't want to play racquetball because I have to pay to join like a gym that has racquetball.

744
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,258
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to play pickleball.

745
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:34,042
Scott: Oh, that's an old man game.

746
00:53:34,062 --> 00:53:34,926
Rym: Pickleball sucks ass.

747
00:53:34,986 --> 00:53:35,650
Rym: It's not fun.

748
00:53:36,752 --> 00:53:38,646
Scott: I never even heard of it until relatively recently.

749
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,899
Rym: I know I think You were like pickleball what the fuck is pickleball?

750
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,590
Rym: and I was like, how have you never heard of picketball pickleball?

751
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,282
Rym: We did a whole thing.

752
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:48,549
Scott: Now I've heard of it for the first time like maybe two years ago.

753
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:51,549
Rym: But what I'm thinking about doing is me and Emily could just do this.

754
00:53:51,791 --> 00:54:06,921
Rym: There's a bunch of wall ball courts behind us and while I cannot play racquetball or tennis We could just volley that blue ball back and forth against that wall and that would mean like I just said But that's not racquetball that's not even a. that's not a sport.

755
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:10,193
Rym: we're just playing volley we're just volleying We're not playing.

756
00:54:10,233 --> 00:54:11,338
Scott: tell that to the people.

757
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,046
Scott: tell that to the people in McCarran Park.

758
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,030
Scott: They're playing it way serious.

759
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:16,700
Rym: Yeah, I just want to hit a ball back and forth.

760
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:19,109
Rym: It's the equivalent of just play catch.

761
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:22,480
Rym: But I dug out as part of cleaning up.

762
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,288
Rym: now that we're cleaning stuff up and donating things.

763
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:27,590
Rym: after COVID I dug out my old baseball mitt.

764
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,843
Rym: I had a guy had a catcher's mitt and just a regular bit.

765
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:40,865
Rym: the catcher's mitt I threw away because it was rotten because this thing is from like the 20s and My other catching mitt like my regular old like outfielders mitt had also rotted to nothing.

766
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,228
Rym: So it was not salvageable.

767
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:47,117
Rym: just threw it away Mmm, but rackets don't really go bad.

768
00:54:47,438 --> 00:54:49,103
Rym: So all my old rackets are fine.

769
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:51,230
Rym: So that is what I'm gonna do in that park.

770
00:54:51,330 --> 00:55:06,149
Scott: Well, I mean they don't go bad, but sometimes depending on the string Will reduce or that's true Solid piece of wood racket, but Yeah, technologies will change and then the racket could be like there's.

771
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:10,890
Scott: you know Remember like back in the day tennis rackets looked almost like, you know badminton rackets do now, right?

772
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,472
Scott: It's like that.

773
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:16,516
Scott: It's like those one, you know, it's like yeah, you might have one that's still good But that no it's.

774
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:17,459
Rym: it's I threw away.

775
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,928
Rym: I had some racquetball rackets that were like from the late 60s.

776
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:21,318
Rym: I got rid of those.

777
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:39,768
Rym: those things were terrible Mm-hmm, but I feel like that's how I can get my racket sport craving done and scratch that itch without having to deal with the Whole New York City licensing system or some private club that has racquetball courts Mm-hmm.

778
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,040
Scott: So something just something else right?

779
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:50,390
Scott: So one thing that's been bothering me lately I don't know how many people know about this right is we got this problem, especially where I live the fart car problem.

780
00:55:51,006 --> 00:55:52,987
Rym: I Got a lot to say about that.

781
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:54,935
Scott: There's a lot going on here.

782
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:59,410
Rym: It's a really it's a specifically bad problem here because we live next to the Queensborough Bridge.

783
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:04,950
Rym: They are going back and forth over that bridge all night every fucking night and they have been for like six months, right?

784
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:11,830
Scott: So there's basically there are certain people who they enjoy and I actually respect, you know as a hobby, right?

785
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:16,130
Scott: You know driving, you know tricking out your car, right?

786
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:20,450
Scott: No different than customizing your computer to make it cool and go faster, right totally off.

787
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:28,222
Rym: well to the to the extent of I am super not cool with the people who Disable the pollution controls on their car to do that.

788
00:56:28,282 --> 00:56:29,910
Scott: Yes that well, I mean, yeah, you know.

789
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:37,098
Scott: But I mean, I'm also super not cool with people who trick out their computer and then mine bitcoins Yeah in doing damage with their hobby is not cool No matter how cool your hot.

790
00:56:37,118 --> 00:56:42,790
Rym: the fart cars are almost all Technically illegal because they've almost all removed their muffler and replaced it with nothing.

791
00:56:43,792 --> 00:57:03,779
Scott: indeed There's also people who are riding all sorts of dirt bikes and ATVs and other sorts of vehicles that are not street-legal Right, but it's like, you know riding that vehicle on its itself as a hobby is totally cool Right, just you're doing it on these public streets in a way that is, you know Dangerous and hazardous to others.

792
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:10,970
Rym: it is like like seriously Like you should see some of the shit that I witness with these kids on a pretty regular basis.

793
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:19,650
Rym: You know cuz I run a lot I bike a lot but lately Full-on ATVs are just screaming down like separated bike paths all the time, right?

794
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:23,430
Scott: It's also very noisy and disturbing the whole neighborhood.

795
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,535
Scott: They're also so it's like

796
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:44,950
Rym: really polluting because most of those things are two-stroke engines Which arguably should be banned in the u.s Two-stroke engines like if you drive a two-stroke engine vehicle for a couple hours You probably give out like exude more material pollution than an actual SUV being driven regularly.

797
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:46,778
Scott: Well, I don't know about that.

798
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,104
Rym: I found multiple stats on that.

799
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:54,093
Rym: I'll dig one up maybe But the point is Controls right.

800
00:57:54,354 --> 00:57:59,930
Scott: so you have this problem and that people are doing a thing that I think should be able to be done.

801
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:03,810
Scott: There's validity in the thing right enjoying that hobby.

802
00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:08,270
Scott: So you don't want to just ban it outright right especially, you know, someone who really cares.

803
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,778
Scott: They tricked out their car their car.

804
00:58:09,858 --> 00:58:12,150
Scott: Actually if I saw their car, maybe I think it was cool, right?

805
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:15,802
Scott: It's like I don't just be like, you know, you can't do this anywhere ever right?

806
00:58:15,942 --> 00:58:18,170
Rym: Well, they're doing something that is anti-social.

807
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:28,669
Scott: Yes, they're doing it But they're doing enjoying this valid hobby in a way that is damaging and disturbing to other people and causing You know external harms.

808
00:58:30,492 --> 00:58:36,709
Rym: People do that stuff all the time, but if they came through your neighborhood, you know It's out like not a dense city.

809
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:40,681
Rym: Maybe a few hundred people hear you and then you're gone in New York.

810
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:52,956
Rym: if you drive one of those things around in like Queens Several hundred thousand people were woken up by that possibly and it's not and it's not just one's going by right now And it's not just a few people.

811
00:58:53,016 --> 00:58:55,003
Scott: It's lots and lots of better trend.

812
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:57,150
Rym: It's during coding police.

813
00:58:57,672 --> 00:59:01,510
Rym: There's a lot like don't we're not super not saying we support the police like don't even think we're going down.

814
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:13,600
Rym: We're gonna get to that aspect of it next but the police be in New York City Partly in reaction to the black lives matter protests and partly in reaction to kovat Stopped enforcing a lot of traffic.

815
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:14,345
Rym: They never.

816
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:15,290
Scott: they never enforce.

817
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:27,920
Rym: they enforce this one a little bit and now barely because Now like they don't enforce it at all and the number of people doing it has been rising steadily for over six months I don't think enforcement would decrease it.

818
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:29,989
Scott: Anyway, even if they did enforce it, right?

819
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:31,631
Rym: They did.

820
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:38,353
Rym: I remember I saw them writing a ticket to a dude who had a motorcycle on the Queensborough bike path once Pre kovat.

821
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:39,636
Scott: Okay one time.

822
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,719
Rym: Yeah nowadays.

823
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:46,096
Rym: I'll be running over that and a full tickets don't discourage Speeding now, right?

824
00:59:46,297 --> 00:59:49,270
Rym: But a speeding before this past summer.

825
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:58,967
Rym: I don't think I would encounter a full-size motorcycle on the bike path Except maybe once every several years and it was like a crazy event.

826
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:05,490
Rym: now I am passed by a gas-powered motorcycle on the Queensborough bridge bike path every single weekend during my run.

827
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:11,210
Scott: Yeah full-size motorcycle Alright, so what could be done?

828
01:00:11,492 --> 01:00:12,680
Scott: what can be done about this, right?

829
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,692
Scott: So I just got through the you know, explaining how enforcement will.

830
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,520
Scott: even if you enforce right?

831
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:25,253
Scott: You're not going to decrease the behavior significantly most likely and you're going to cause a lot of you know It's just harm that's not gonna.

832
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:26,060
Scott: it's eye for an eye.

833
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:31,400
Scott: Most of the people doing this activity are not white people.

834
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:37,380
Scott: They are young people of color most of the people who are doing this right almost exclusively, right?

835
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:41,620
Scott: So, you know, but it's like yes, they're misbehaving also.

836
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,015
Scott: But if you the only body we have that can do enforcement is police.

837
01:00:46,216 --> 01:00:46,858
Rym: that's not gonna.

838
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:55,080
Scott: actually Not only if you got the police to and try to enforce these laws Would it not solve the problem.

839
01:00:55,621 --> 01:01:02,280
Scott: It also would just cause more harm to the people in those communities who don't need any more harm done to them, right?

840
01:01:03,602 --> 01:01:05,554
Scott: So we need to come up with some other solution.

841
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:06,560
Rym: I don't know what to do about it.

842
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:20,035
Rym: So one thing that's been happening in the last few months like it This is a new thing But I'm seeing it a lot is they'll take the ATVs and the motor dirt bikes To a park like the Queens Ridge Park or the Randall's Island.

843
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,360
Scott: Yeah, it happened one time.

844
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:36,599
Rym: every time I run down and they'll just tear around and tear up the grass and drive around on the grass for hours and pretty much only leave if Someone comes and harasses them like eventually a cop car comes in the horizon and they leave and go to a different parking.

845
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:41,498
Rym: keep doing it Mmm, so all the baseball fields are torn up with dirt bike tracks.

846
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:49,015
Scott: now Alright, so my idea to fix this which is obviously something that will never happen ever Is This right?

847
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:56,920
Scott: So obviously you don't want to chase people and the police actually have a policy of not chasing people because it actually creates a more Dangerous situation especially in the city.

848
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:03,260
Scott: I think that you know, you go and see like videos of car chases and like, you know highways and like Florida or whatever.

849
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,513
Scott: I think they shouldn't do that either.

850
01:02:04,594 --> 01:02:07,326
Scott: Yeah Chasing people just makes more danger.

851
01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:14,487
Scott: Don't do that is that you should a. just chill and They're not hard to find.

852
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:15,935
Scott: you can see these people.

853
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:16,819
Scott: they want to be seen.

854
01:02:17,921 --> 01:02:19,005
Scott: Check out my cool car.

855
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,292
Scott: just video them from somewhere right?

856
01:02:21,352 --> 01:02:22,917
Scott: It's like you see a fart car.

857
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:23,600
Scott: You can see it.

858
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,199
Scott: There's license plate, you know, it's like there it is.

859
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,634
Scott: It's just chillin at the stoplight and then it's gonna go.

860
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:31,286
Scott: it's gonna you know Do a little burnout and go to the next stoplight.

861
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:33,253
Scott: just identify it right.

862
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:35,160
Scott: sit in a few places around town.

863
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:38,560
Scott: Just chill and just gather lots and lots of you know.

864
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,526
Scott: Identifying be like up.

865
01:02:39,546 --> 01:02:42,183
Scott: that car clearly has no muffler right down the license Right?

866
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:50,600
Rym: Oh that too with that data do not have Police as they exist today with guns in any way be involved in what gets done with that data.

867
01:02:51,345 --> 01:02:56,507
Scott: no, then take that information and Just go to write.

868
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:57,651
Scott: those people live somewhere.

869
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,895
Scott: They're keeping that car.

870
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:00,620
Scott: They're not driving it all the time, right?

871
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,419
Scott: They're keeping that car somewhere, right?

872
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:07,247
Scott: the car is Street illegal, right?

873
01:03:07,528 --> 01:03:08,290
Scott: It's street illegal.

874
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:11,260
Scott: So we shouldn't allow that car on the street period up, right?

875
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,786
Scott: It's not legal to be on the street.

876
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:16,080
Scott: Just go to where the car is and just take the car.

877
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:16,765
Scott: Just take it.

878
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:17,391
Scott: be like.

879
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:18,380
Scott: it's not street legal.

880
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,528
Scott: We're not gonna allow it on the street.

881
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:22,670
Scott: bring a truck put this, you know You can't drive it somewhere right.

882
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,140
Scott: put it up on the truck and take it away.

883
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:25,899
Scott: It doesn't matter if the person's there or not.

884
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:31,420
Scott: Just fucking tow that shit and don't tow it to the impound lot where the person can get their car back.

885
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:33,809
Scott: No, they lose the car.

886
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:34,351
Scott: Okay.

887
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:35,496
Scott: It's like you can't have this.

888
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:36,620
Scott: It is an illegal item.

889
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:37,643
Scott: It is now come.

890
01:03:37,663 --> 01:03:43,060
Rym: so the problem is it is technically not illegal to own only to drive on a public street.

891
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:47,300
Scott: Well, you could change the point that but I could own a dirt bike.

892
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:50,531
Rym: I could put the dirt bike in my car drive it somewhere.

893
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:53,922
Rym: It's legal and then drive it Right.

894
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,957
Scott: So what I think what you could do is, you know to sort of be like, okay, we've taken the car, right?

895
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,945
Scott: What are we gonna do with this right?

896
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:05,630
Scott: We don't want to sell it because then someone's gonna drive it modify it It's not street illegal and then sell.

897
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,977
Scott: they'll just modify it back.

898
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:07,983
Scott: that's pointless Right.

899
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:23,160
Scott: what we should do is we should build a cool We should write build a cool racetrack place for all the cool people to enjoy legitimately and perhaps more safely the hobby of Driving cooled cars and motorbikes around make like a big like a fucking pair.

900
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:28,074
Rym: No, that is how most cities solve the problem of skateboarders ruining all the masonry.

901
01:04:28,335 --> 01:04:30,140
Rym: just make skate parks, right?

902
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:36,959
Scott: It's like Germany has like like a Nurburgring like it's like where they have f1 races But you can just go there and drive, you know, it's like we have some places like that.

903
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,205
Rym: I don't have a free public one.

904
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:49,643
Scott: There's no free public Racetrack right that you could just go right and we even if we did have one it certainly wouldn't be big enough to handle all These.

905
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,057
Scott: it's so popular, right?

906
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,152
Scott: But we should make a huge out in Long Island somewhere right where we hate build.

907
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,299
Scott: it did replace a golf course, right?

908
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,285
Scott: Make it that big as bad golf.

909
01:05:00,326 --> 01:05:02,211
Rym: makeup makeup is really accessible.

910
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:05,279
Rym: free buses and transportation make it easy for New York, right?

911
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,551
Scott: You're so when you take someone's car.

912
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,140
Scott: when you take someone's car, right?

913
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,179
Scott: You should a give them right an unlimited Metro card, right?

914
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,720
Scott: Yeah, and all sorts of other transportation for that might buy their Metro card, right?

915
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,252
Scott: That might be their transportation that you just confiscated.

916
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:27,260
Scott: so you need to sort of compensate them Right, maybe even give them like, you know the cheapest car.

917
01:05:27,421 --> 01:05:30,371
Scott: That's not a new illegal car a car that like you couldn't.

918
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:32,680
Scott: we wouldn't want to modify because it's so uncool.

919
01:05:32,941 --> 01:05:34,050
Rym: Here's your 2012 Chevy Cruze eco.

920
01:05:36,123 --> 01:05:37,736
Scott: Yeah, right something like that.

921
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:40,378
Scott: People would figure out a way to modify.

922
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:51,460
Scott: But bring all the cool cars to the car paradise, right and then Be like, hey your car is in a garage at the car paradise.

923
01:05:51,622 --> 01:05:55,889
Scott: you can come there and Drive it all around the racetrack all you want, right?

924
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:58,579
Scott: Like just come on down and your car is waiting for you.

925
01:05:59,382 --> 01:06:02,235
Scott: But there's a wall around the place and you can't get any cars out of there.

926
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:05,228
Scott: They're just stuck in there Right the end they don't leave.

927
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,380
Scott: Um, you know, so built a race car it stays at the racetrack.

928
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,929
Scott: You can never take it out of the racetrack.

929
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,900
Rym: Here's there's the the one hard mode.

930
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,770
Rym: Most of these things are not only not street-legal.

931
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:15,995
Rym: They don't have license plates.

932
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,300
Rym: They're just a dirt bike.

933
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:20,475
Scott: That's the dirt bikes are the unidentified.

934
01:06:20,495 --> 01:06:21,963
Scott: dirt bikes are the problem You're gonna have to.

935
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:26,120
Scott: you know, the identification you get to see the person who's on it and identified them.

936
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,668
Rym: Yeah, but that starts getting into facial recognition problems.

937
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:33,944
Scott: The other problem is there's so many problems there, but the cars at least The you could.

938
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:35,910
Scott: the cars are a significant portion.

939
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:38,478
Scott: So just reducing those would help a great deal.

940
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:38,940
Rym: It would.

941
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,684
Rym: America has a problem.

942
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:42,811
Rym: where I'm do not.

943
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:45,460
Rym: we still cannot go back to the old way or even the current way.

944
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:53,199
Rym: But when police officers were not armed and would have would pull people over or interact with people to confiscate a car.

945
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:57,258
Rym: Violence against the people who tried to do that was common.

946
01:06:58,246 --> 01:06:59,599
Scott: Yep, indeed very common.

947
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:02,791
Rym: but this gets into something I think about a lot that's adjacent to this.

948
01:07:03,172 --> 01:07:10,910
Rym: the New York City Street like speed limit if you're not On a special road like the FDR is 25 like everywhere unless there's an exception.

949
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:20,427
Rym: Cops Should not be able to pull anyone over for speeding in New York City because cops pulling people over is a big part of how They fuck with people who should not be fucked with.

950
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:24,298
Rym: But we should have enforcement of that speed limit.

951
01:07:24,399 --> 01:07:32,050
Rym: My idea has always been there should be speed cameras and everywhere Yeah, and any car that's a 24/7 Yeah.

952
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,061
Rym: And any car no matter what anywhere in New York City.

953
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:39,510
Rym: if it's on one of those streets and it hits like 27 miles an hour you get mailed a ticket.

954
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:44,102
Rym: An absolute 100% enforcement of that speed limit no exceptions.

955
01:07:44,864 --> 01:07:46,690
Scott: and if you pass three cameras three tickets.

956
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:51,670
Scott: Yep, right If you're going if you go 60 and you somehow get through three take three different cameras identify you as speeding.

957
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,654
Scott: Well, you were speeding three times.

958
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,260
Rym: babies like, you know a common sense.

959
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,931
Rym: like the speed limit is 25 set it to 30.

960
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:58,623
Rym: It only does the ticket if you get above 30, right?

961
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:02,807
Scott: We also need times to be scaled based on what you can afford etc, etc.

962
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,930
Rym: Yeah, rich people should hurt a rich person to get that ticket, right?

963
01:08:07,432 --> 01:08:12,550
Scott: The main point here is that like look it's like we have this problem of fart cars, right?

964
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,053
Scott: You know you know ruining everybody

965
01:08:14,134 --> 01:08:17,886
Rym: like Nova like the majority of New Yorkers want to deal with this problem because it is a

966
01:08:18,086 --> 01:08:24,849
Scott: only people only the People who aren't any the only people who like the fart cars are on the far car So every single other person does not like them.

967
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:26,215
Scott: maybe some kid thinks that

968
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:39,250
Rym: I cared a lot less about this kind of thing when we lived outside of the city, but it's so Dense here and like I can it's hard to express to you out there If you don't live in New York how much of a problem this has become just in the last few months

969
01:08:40,053 --> 01:08:40,273
Scott: Right.

970
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:44,950
Scott: So the point is is that like look it's like every solution we try to come up with right?

971
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:56,109
Scott: It's like well we can't because right these other things and it's like you look and you see the root Right is the car culture and the gun culture of the United States, right?

972
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,517
Scott: This is actually just an offshoot of that.

973
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:11,348
Scott: if we solve our general car problem, right in that You know, we don't if we destroy car culture itself and you know Like the same way that like Amsterdam or the Netherlands did our roads won't be conducive to fart.

974
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:14,901
Rym: so This actually gets into something if we destroy.

975
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:23,807
Scott: if we ban guns and don't have a stupid Second Amendment Then you could enforce things against people without having to shoot them or bring or worry about them shooting you.

976
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:24,729
Rym: this gets to a farmer.

977
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,649
Scott: Do something like confiscate someone's car, right?

978
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,337
Rym: This is something that bothers me a lot.

979
01:09:29,379 --> 01:09:31,510
Rym: the ways we can end on this because we made a plenty long show.

980
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:35,943
Rym: But that all gets to the a fundamental problem in America.

981
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:38,430
Rym: Is that at all levels of our government?

982
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:39,729
Rym: We have minoritarian rule.

983
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:41,652
Rym: guns are a good example.

984
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:45,738
Rym: the vast majority of Americans want strict gun controls.

985
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,979
Rym: a Near majority of Americans want to get rid of the Second Amendment.

986
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:57,780
Rym: Yet somehow we can't make any gun rules Not even the ones that like 80% of Americans support.

987
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:04,642
Scott: the majority of New Yorkers probably want to get rid of fart cars Can't but the problem is the way our government is set up.

988
01:10:04,963 --> 01:10:10,184
Rym: the minority of people Mostly rural people have the majority of the power.

989
01:10:10,264 --> 01:10:11,570
Rym: by the way, the system is designed.

990
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:15,050
Rym: That is a fundamental problem that we can't get past.

991
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:21,990
Rym: What's if the majority opinion on a lot of things were possible to be expressed in our government?

992
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:36,748
Rym: I'm not saying things would be perfect because our majority also has a lot of stupid ideas But it would mean that we could have earnest debates and try things right now because of this minoritarian rule we can't try Anything for almost any problem?

993
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,515
Rym: Right, but the we can't change.

994
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:44,470
Scott: there is like a lot of people, you know privileged people act like or believe they're like.

995
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,816
Scott: Oh, I don't care about politics.

996
01:10:45,856 --> 01:10:47,222
Scott: It doesn't affect you whatever.

997
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:50,154
Scott: and then we get mad about something like fart cars And it's like guess what?

998
01:10:50,656 --> 01:10:50,917
Rym: Right?

999
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:51,599
Rym: It's all the same.

1000
01:10:51,639 --> 01:10:54,208
Scott: pros and the filibuster are not unrelated.

1001
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:57,779
Rym: Yep But here's what bothers me.

1002
01:10:57,839 --> 01:11:01,309
Rym: this is like that the zoomed in like wonk thing that bothers me.

1003
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:28,827
Rym: I don't know if there is a legal way to fix that because fundamentally the US Senate holds all the power and because of the filibuster rules you need 60 senators to agree to pass literally anything and you need 50 senators Minimum to agree to change the filibuster rule to even force someone who wants to make it 60 to have to stand there and piss their pants.

1004
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:38,569
Rym: We cannot get 50 senators who would agree to change the rules of the filibuster So that you have to actually piss your pants if you want to do it.

1005
01:11:39,975 --> 01:11:41,858
Scott: No, you could do it with What?

1006
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:49,830
Scott: Evil, yeah The only ways to change that Would you do it by waiting for a lot?

1007
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:50,512
Scott: We just waiting.

1008
01:11:50,632 --> 01:12:05,189
Rym: we just wait long enough and hope that enough people die now because demographic trends are actually putting more power in states That have such a margin toward Republicans in the Senate that Democrats cannot feasibly or plausibly win a statewide election in those states.

1009
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:13,334
Rym: Gerrymandering doesn't even fix that because the gerrymandering is at the level of the state boundaries themselves and the structure of the Senate is defined In the Constitution.

1010
01:12:13,655 --> 01:12:16,750
Rym: amending the Constitution requires a majority of the states.

1011
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:21,829
Rym: The majority of states are red and not and there is no possible way to make them blue in the foreseeable future.

1012
01:12:22,732 --> 01:12:25,863
Scott: Well, something don't happen eventually, you know, she gets bad enough.

1013
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:34,907
Rym: people get mad enough or they won't Because people the majority of people are mad, but the people are mad are concentrating themselves in blue states where it's better.

1014
01:12:36,194 --> 01:12:44,689
Rym: Yeah, well if but event, you know Eventually, you just have 70 Republican senators who will just make things worse for everyone and no one can stop them.

1015
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,587
Scott: Yeah, but then the people who live in the blue states will get mad, you know get mad.

1016
01:12:48,628 --> 01:12:49,010
Rym: What do they do?

1017
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:51,845
Rym: What are we gonna do to see think they could do?

1018
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:52,649
Scott: who knows what they'll do?

1019
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,619
Scott: I'm just saying that hopefully that's far enough in the future.

1020
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:56,020
Scott: It won't be.

1021
01:12:56,361 --> 01:13:05,129
Rym: all I'm saying is that the system as it's designed There is literally no legal path to fixing that fundamental problem right now.

1022
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,465
Rym: Mmm, I don't know what to do about that.

1023
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:09,150
Rym: I don't have an answer.

1024
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,218
Rym: I don't have an idea other than changing it.

1025
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,628
Rym: But the only way to change it is to use it.

1026
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:19,126
Scott: Try really hard and you know win some elections that you believe are unwinnable.

1027
01:13:19,247 --> 01:13:29,419
Rym: We would have to win 11 new Senate seats in red states statewide elections And not lose any of the ones we already have.

1028
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:32,330
Rym: George is gonna be hard to keep because we didn't pass the Voting Rights Act.

1029
01:13:32,572 --> 01:13:34,630
Rym: We didn't pass the Voting Rights Act because the Senate.

1030
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,863
Scott: Yeah, do something try something try water.

1031
01:13:38,983 --> 01:13:39,847
Rym: That's that's why I don't know.

1032
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,052
Rym: that can't fight I don't.

1033
01:13:41,072 --> 01:13:42,096
Scott: that's what I don't understand.

1034
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:45,970
Scott: right is like, you know, you're these senators are actual human beings, right?

1035
01:13:46,271 --> 01:13:47,255
Rym: It's I so saw.

1036
01:13:47,576 --> 01:13:50,810
Scott: some of them are in favor and understand how important them are evil.

1037
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:55,750
Rym: They 50 of them realize that if any of these rules change their party loses power forever.

1038
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,139
Scott: But I mean, there's still a human being.

1039
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,850
Scott: there's something that they care about right?

1040
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:06,933
Scott: Go and go and talk to them and it's like just you know figure out right, you know Do figure out.

1041
01:14:06,953 --> 01:14:09,181
Scott: something's gotta be something you can do, right?

1042
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:12,778
Scott: It's like even someone like me right think about it the reverse direction right.

1043
01:14:13,101 --> 01:14:14,168
Scott: let's say I was a senator.

1044
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:17,928
Scott: and They said Scott, you know, we want you to vote for.

1045
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,916
Scott: Yes guns guns good, right?

1046
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:21,879
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

1047
01:14:22,641 --> 01:14:25,209
Scott: is there a way that they could get me to vote for guns?

1048
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:26,850
Rym: good But it's partisan.

1049
01:14:28,474 --> 01:14:36,330
Scott: It would be really really hard to get me to vote for guns good But I'm not gonna lie and say it's impossible, but there's some way they could get me to do it.

1050
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,918
Scott: Right, so fucking figure it out.

1051
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:40,223
Scott: What you're there cleared all you there.

1052
01:14:40,323 --> 01:14:41,528
Scott: I see all these people senators.

1053
01:14:41,548 --> 01:14:42,110
Scott: They're just tweeting.

1054
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,780
Scott: It's like stop tweeting go talk to the other said they have.

1055
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,566
Rym: and so the thing is they have.

1056
01:14:46,586 --> 01:14:47,610
Scott: figure out what you gotta do.

1057
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:49,489
Rym: And the answer has been so far.

1058
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:59,577
Rym: There is nothing that will convince any Republican senator to vote to make elections fair because if they did that Many of them would not win reelection.

1059
01:14:59,898 --> 01:15:03,550
Rym: and if even and if any of them don't get reelection all of them lose power.

1060
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:09,370
Rym: So there's nothing you could do because you're literally asking them to vote to permanently remove themselves from power forever.

1061
01:15:10,231 --> 01:15:11,254
Scott: Okay, fine.

1062
01:15:11,776 --> 01:15:12,739
Scott: It's so Scott.

1063
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:18,870
Scott: I'm a senator right now and they say Scott senator Scott We want you to vote on a thing that will make you no longer a senator.

1064
01:15:19,632 --> 01:15:19,954
Scott: It did.

1065
01:15:20,094 --> 01:15:20,455
Scott: Okay.

1066
01:15:20,495 --> 01:15:21,258
Scott: Well, what what?

1067
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:25,834
Scott: there must be something in it for me to compensate for the fact that I'm gonna lose now They're already rich.

1068
01:15:26,034 --> 01:15:28,343
Scott: So yeah, it's like fucking work it out, right?

1069
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,130
Scott: There's got to be something, you know.

1070
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:38,268
Rym: so one fundamental thing that's going on in politics, I know you don't pay attention to like Senate procedure and all that kind of stuff, but What's mostly been happening now is?

1071
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:43,765
Rym: Democrats have been constantly trying to talk to them about this and their answer is always there is nothing.

1072
01:15:44,066 --> 01:15:45,370
Rym: literally we do not care.

1073
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,049
Scott: No, there has to be something.

1074
01:15:49,551 --> 01:15:50,114
Scott: There's something.

1075
01:15:50,134 --> 01:15:51,018
Scott: there are human being.

1076
01:15:51,058 --> 01:15:51,782
Scott: they have a life.

1077
01:15:51,842 --> 01:15:53,390
Scott: There's something in their personal life.

1078
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:56,100
Scott: They must have desires goals feelings, right?

1079
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,465
Scott: You need to figure them out.

1080
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:01,859
Rym: send a PI after so Their desires and goals are.

1081
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,570
Rym: pass harmful legislation to hurt people that they perceive as their enemies.

1082
01:16:06,356 --> 01:16:11,527
Scott: Okay, fine Here we'll agree to pass this harmful legislation that hurts your enemies as long as you vote.

1083
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,490
Scott: Yes on this voting one.

1084
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:20,614
Rym: No, because if they vote yes on the voting one It is guaranteed and they know that all the heart Try to fool them.

1085
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:21,155
Scott: right?

1086
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,339
Scott: there's still a human being.

1087
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:23,563
Scott: they're not geniuses right?

1088
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:25,348
Scott: you could try something right.

1089
01:16:25,408 --> 01:16:27,476
Scott: work harder Right is your only job.

1090
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:34,685
Rym: even the ones who are retiring and not running for re-election Until are still refusing to even you might be able to fool.

1091
01:16:34,725 --> 01:16:35,810
Scott: some of these people are so old.

1092
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:38,626
Scott: You might be able to fool them with the rabbit season duck season on the yay.

1093
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,390
Scott: Nay, right?

1094
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:45,533
Rym: It's like no because the party whip actually tells them here's what to vote and they just do it Right.

1095
01:16:45,553 --> 01:16:48,310
Scott: Yeah, you know, maybe you know, see if you can fool them.

1096
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:52,510
Rym: In fact, the one time Democrats did try to fool them once it was a few several years ago.

1097
01:16:53,052 --> 01:16:58,690
Scott: They they there was a bill that they were all the last second, you know to invert all the language in the yes.

1098
01:16:58,771 --> 01:16:59,863
Rym: No, they did something like that.

1099
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:00,530
Rym: This was crazy.

1100
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,796
Rym: so basically the Republicans had some bill.

1101
01:17:01,836 --> 01:17:04,478
Rym: that was would have like Been so bad.

1102
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:06,029
Rym: that would have caused a problem for them, too.

1103
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:08,169
Rym: But they wanted to performatively vote for it.

1104
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:13,129
Rym: They could say the Democrats voted against it even knowing that if it passed it would destroy things.

1105
01:17:14,332 --> 01:17:23,429
Rym: The Democrats all voted for it suddenly at the last second and it was about to pass and they had to scramble To change all their votes to no.

1106
01:17:23,951 --> 01:17:29,449
Rym: So now you had a situation where the bad bill had no Republicans voting for it and a bunch of Democrats voting for it.

1107
01:17:31,052 --> 01:17:32,338
Rym: But it didn't work in the end.

1108
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:34,970
Rym: It didn't actually pass because they try harder.

1109
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:42,430
Rym: Hey, you can't try harder because the guess what the rules of the Senate are controlled by the Senate.

1110
01:17:42,753 --> 01:17:44,990
Rym: You need a vote of 50 people to change the rules.

1111
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,274
Scott: The point is right.

1112
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:51,047
Scott: the Republicans do all sorts of shady tricks, right and somehow those shady tricks work.

1113
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:51,890
Scott: do the same?

1114
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:55,546
Rym: Ah, no, I got there's the answer better at shady tricks than they.

1115
01:17:55,566 --> 01:18:00,410
Rym: the answer that is simple They're only doing shady tricks to prevent things from being passed.

1116
01:18:02,131 --> 01:18:03,898
Rym: They never do shady tricks to pass anything.

1117
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,830
Rym: They only do shady tricks to not let bills go forward.

1118
01:18:07,364 --> 01:18:07,610
Scott: All right.

1119
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:10,221
Scott: So do shady tricks to prevent any of their stuff from getting we do?

1120
01:18:10,241 --> 01:18:13,743
Rym: you realize the Senate has done nothing Since the election because they can't.

1121
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:17,105
Scott: because of this There has to be.

1122
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:18,962
Rym: you know Senate has literally done nothing.

1123
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:22,561
Rym: no bill that has been Passed by the house is gonna get to the floor of the Senate.

1124
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:31,090
Scott: at least points at the very least Right, whether it's true that they're really trying every last trick in the whole book and the tricks just aren't working.

1125
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:32,588
Scott: It's it's just so difficult, right?

1126
01:18:33,951 --> 01:18:36,339
Scott: At least make it look like you're trying right?

1127
01:18:36,599 --> 01:18:39,830
Scott: They're not looking like they're trying every last dirty trick in the book, right?

1128
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:47,743
Scott: So at least make it look like you are so that we can have some more confidence in you that you are Being you know putting in the full effort, right?

1129
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,210
Scott: They're not making it look like they're trying?

1130
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:51,961
Rym: Well, but anyway, we've gone on for an hour and 20 minutes.

1131
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:54,070
Rym: So I think this was a good topic for a show.

1132
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,982
Rym: What we just did this was one of the longer GeekNights in recent history.

1133
01:18:58,765 --> 01:18:58,945
