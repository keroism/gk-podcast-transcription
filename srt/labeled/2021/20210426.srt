00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,316
Rym: It's Monday, April 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,622
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,289
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:18,309
Rym: tonight It's a tech news round.

5
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,206
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:27,930
Scott: Okay, so recently we did a show about like what something like wiring cable management or something like that.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,907
Scott: But you know and we talked about different places to manage your cables data center house, etc.

8
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:49,709
Scott: Yep So, you know, of course after we do that, you know, I should have done this before we had that show but I went and I rewired my desk because the situation with my desk up until since I moved was basically Let's take all the wires and they'll be behind the desk.

9
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:58,910
Scott: But if you look under my desk, it was a disaster because they're all hanging and going every which way all over the place Right, but if you're above the desk, it looked kind of nice above the desk, right?

10
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:15,270
Scott: The only thing that didn't look nice was that I got this big shelf up on the wall above the desk and There's two speakers up there and I have the amp down here and so the speaker wire like running up the wall Right behind my little frame, you know, it was kind of fugly, right?

11
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:23,996
Scott: So what I did is I went and I bought a little Speedway like a little plastic Speedway Like.

12
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:25,488
Rym: they cost super cheap.

13
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:28,348
Rym: You'll just buy a giant pack of them and you won't be able to use them all.

14
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:32,990
Scott: Right, and it was it's a Speedway design to hold like one wire.

15
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:37,690
Scott: It is actually way smaller than I thought it was gonna be which is nice because it's way less conspicuous.

16
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:46,765
Scott: And basically all you do with this thing is it comes with some cheap sort of two-sided tape And you just stick it to the wall and run your cable through it.

17
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:47,749
Scott: It's so easy.

18
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:55,705
Scott: And now that cable is hidden and even though the Speedway is so cheap It looks way way nicer like significantly.

19
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,770
Scott: So so that was a bonus.

20
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:01,670
Scott: The second thing I did is I moved my desktop from the left side, right?

21
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,735
Scott: So it was on the left side of my desk because that was closer to the router and the NAS and such right To get the network cable to reach.

22
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,830
Scott: I moved it to the right side because that's closer to the power outlets and the UPS.

23
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,374
Rym: Oh, I get a longer network cable Right.

24
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:17,679
Scott: So I also got a switch.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,250
Scott: so the network cable now, right?

26
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:31,714
Scott: switch before Right, so just to add some more ports anyway right because the router was full and I wanted to get my work laptop connected by wire instead of Wi-Fi to stop which did by The way I we talked about.

27
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:33,884
Scott: did we talk about the annoying noise on the show before?

28
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,170
Rym: did we talk about it on the show?

29
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,840
Rym: Or did we just talk about that in our real lives?

30
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:38,764
Scott: I don't know.

31
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:51,364
Scott: but the point is there was a situation I'm using some software where a lot of packets a small packets were sent very quickly and when that happened to go to my work Laptop you would hear my router making noise and I'm pretty sure it was the radio.

32
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:58,090
Scott: and I'm now 100% sure it was the radio Because as soon as I plug the work laptop in with a cable to the switch that noise is gone.

33
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:02,463
Scott: So yes They've said a lot of small packets quickly over the Wi-Fi.

34
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:07,569
Scott: the router will make noise That you can hear if you have good ears, so that's solved.

35
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:16,809
Scott: But yeah, the only wires that go horizontally now all the way across the desk from the left Are the NAS power cable because I want to send that to the UPS.

36
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,090
Scott: All the other power cables that are over there can just go to the wall.

37
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:22,818
Scott: And then the red one.

38
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,775
Scott: now one network cable from the router going horizontal Everything else.

39
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:34,166
Scott: now what I did is I flipped my desk over and I drilled And I attached two cheapo metal cages to the bottom of the desk.

40
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,070
Rym: Ah the cage.

41
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:46,150
Scott: So now there's two metal cages under there and all the cables and all the power adapters and amplifier Which was previously on my desk, right?

42
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,710
Scott: Because the only thing I actually need to access with my hands is the little audio interface thing the scarlet whatever, right?

43
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,220
Scott: I don't actually need to access the amplifier.

44
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,505
Scott: I can just shove that underneath.

45
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:58,730
Scott: So that's down in the cage.

46
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:07,543
Rym: My annoying part is my audio input device needs a USB-C cable That's below like it has can't be longer than the spec or it'll run into sequence.

47
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:09,610
Rym: It'll run into synchronization problems possibly.

48
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:19,750
Rym: So I have the maximum length USB-C cable I can use and the only place I can put that thing where it's convenient is Behind my monitor instead of up top where I used to put the old one.

49
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,803
Rym: It's a minor annoy.

50
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,034
Scott: Yes for me.

51
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:28,970
Scott: So now the underneath my desk looks way cleaner with all those cables just in this cage thing.

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,984
Scott: So the cage thing itself is a mess just cables.

53
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:31,829
Scott: I just threw them in there.

54
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,346
Scott: Yeah, whatever but it's still a lot of less stuff on my desk a lot more stuff.

55
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:39,422
Scott: as you look under my desk It's like big and open now and it's like the wall.

56
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:40,629
Scott: you see the white wall there.

57
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,713
Scott: It's really great.

58
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:43,135
Scott: I have the.

59
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,144
Scott: it was super inexpensive right to do this like very very.

60
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,850
Scott: I bought the cheapest crappiest stuff.

61
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:54,009
Scott: My desk is very expensive and I screwed in these the cheapest possible metal cages to the bottom of it.

62
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,770
Scott: It was actually kind of a little bit difficult.

63
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,985
Scott: I'm glad I bought a new power drill to do it because the wood was so solid.

64
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:01,833
Rym: Oh, yeah I got some crap.

65
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,300
Rym: Oh I can't desk so I could just drive.

66
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,370
Rym: actually drilled a lot of things into it over the years.

67
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,376
Scott: It actually said do not.

68
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:10,705
Scott: the cages I bought were like do not mount this on a crap.

69
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:11,447
Scott: Oh IKEA desk.

70
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:16,850
Scott: It will just destroy At least with the included screws that it came with.

71
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:21,330
Scott: Yeah, if you've got it, if you have a big old wire mess, right?

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,584
Scott: I suggest go on the internet and buy the cheapest wiring.

73
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,050
Scott: There's so many options available.

74
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:27,494
Scott: It was way worth it.

75
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,581
Scott: And now I my desk is super nice every day.

76
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:38,690
Scott: I also bought a USB hub to put on my desk Which is super great as well, I have like 10 USB ports on my desk now like just right up front in the middle.

77
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:44,670
Scott: So I'm not like reaching down to the desktop to use the ports on that or the back of the monitor or anything like that.

78
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,422
Scott: They're just right there.

79
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,370
Scott: And I was also because I have this hub.

80
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:59,106
Scott: I was able to take various USB devices that used to have permanent homes on my desk and sort of stowed them away and it's Like well if I need to use them I'll take them out and plug them in and then put them back because I got a hub right here.

81
00:05:59,146 --> 00:05:59,970
Scott: It's so accessible.

82
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:02,474
Scott: So that's great.

83
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:08,379
Scott: what I was surprisingly unable to find one thing is that I wanted to get you know This is a USB 3 hub.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,890
Scott: It's not a USB C hub.

85
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,921
Scott: I wanted a USB C hub because a lot of more things are USB C. now.

86
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:19,299
Scott: all the USB C hubs I found were Designed for like.

87
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,530
Scott: you have a MacBook or you have an iPad.

88
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,530
Rym: It's got one USB C and you want to turn it into a bunch of other stuff, right?

89
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,755
Scott: I want something that turns one USB C into several USB C's at least four Right, maybe six something like that.

90
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:40,730
Scott: the one I have now turns one USB 3 into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 USB 3's and three that are just power only.

91
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,435
Scott: Right, so it's pretty great.

92
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:57,225
Scott: The USB C ones were like it turns one USB C into an SD reader and one more USB C and maybe HDMI or display port or like some other.

93
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:59,373
Scott: you know, it's like that kind of thing Wasn't?

94
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:08,959
Rym: I think it's one USB C becomes five USB C because the technology of USB C Usually things that are gonna plug into USB C you're gonna take advantage of the special things USB C does.

95
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:18,805
Rym: that from what I've read are difficult to do in a hub the way that I sound like old USB Like I remember in the old days a USB hub divided the bandwidth by however many ports you had.

96
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:24,539
Scott: Yeah USB one or two Yeah, yeah Yeah, so I couldn't get a USB C hub.

97
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,010
Scott: that struck my fancy, but the USB 3 hub is still great.

98
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,735
Scott: I still have a lot of.

99
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:33,091
Rym: here's one that makes see for and it's only 20 bucks Five.

100
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,988
Scott: it's got me that link Dobe brand.

101
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,345
Scott: I'll check it out and see if it's legit.

102
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:39,769
Scott: cuz I want that.

103
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,908
Rym: I just type USB C hub and Amazon is one of the first things that popped up.

104
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:50,755
Scott: I'd search for that and I didn't see anything like that USB C hub for port high-speed data transfers Compatible with laptops.

105
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,407
Scott: I did that search and I didn't find any such thing.

106
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:53,949
Scott: But anyway.

107
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,513
Scott: So There you go.

108
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,679
Scott: That's that's the opening bit.

109
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,508
Scott: desk rewiring is good idea Yep.

110
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:07,354
Rym: So, uh Well pretty much just skip through the news and get right into the main bit after thing of the day since it's a tech news Round-up day.

111
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:11,596
Rym: We're just gonna talk about news the whole time Managed to last not a year.

112
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,010
Scott: you managed to last a year and a month since the last tech news roundup.

113
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,630
Rym: Good you had a few vague ideas for a different topic, but you weren't super into those.

114
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,750
Rym: So I figured we just do the tech news roundup next month next Monday show.

115
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:27,525
Scott: Now you realize you can't do one next, you know in 11 months you have to do it in.

116
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,210
Scott: now the date new date is April.

117
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:36,630
Rym: Pay ahead on principle instead of interest on your student loan exactly.

118
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:47,713
Rym: So things Of the day, this is a really short thing.

119
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:51,046
Rym: It tickled my fancy Partly because of the line of work I do.

120
00:08:51,086 --> 00:09:04,553
Rym: but I sometimes enjoy when someone can make something that is horrific Like utterly horrific, but which technically 100% conforms to whatever specification it is ostensibly made for.

121
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,920
Rym: like I like that kind of toy project.

122
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,764
Rym: That's just the kind of thing.

123
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:08,266
Rym: I enjoy.

124
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:11,199
Rym: so Parker meek has written a song.

125
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:16,073
Rym: Parker is titled this song jingle bells - oh, I've seen this.

126
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:16,414
Scott: Okay.

127
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,600
Rym: It's uh, it's pretty fun.

128
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:19,485
Rym: it is.

129
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:26,400
Rym: it's playing around with the Rules of how music notation works at least like Italian style music notation.

130
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:28,686
Rym: Nothing here is wrong.

131
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:31,254
Rym: This is perfectly valid notation.

132
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:32,999
Rym: It is just shall we say?

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,019
Rym: unorthodox notation and also this song other than the snare solo at the end is terrible.

134
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:52,740
Rym: I Mean, you know, you wouldn't want to listen to this song But if you're gonna listen to it You have to actually look at it'll play to show you the sheet music as it plays to fully appreciate what's going on here.

135
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,968
Scott: If you don't know how to read sheet music I mean You should at least know.

136
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,742
Scott: you don't need to read be able to read all that element Like.

137
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,914
Rym: I feel like everyone learns how to read Italian style sheet music in elementary school.

138
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:04,680
Scott: I learned like the basics.

139
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,403
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

140
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,591
Rym: yeah, you don't need to know much to understand this.

141
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:08,916
Rym: What's the time signature?

142
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:10,080
Rym: What's a key signature?

143
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:10,302
Rym: That's.

144
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:11,091
Rym: what's the tempo?

145
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:11,758
Rym: That's pretty much it.

146
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:16,160
Scott: You only even need to know like, you know whole note half note quarter note, right?

147
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,481
Scott: It's like.

148
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,833
Rym: well, there's some 16th notes and 32nd notes and glissandos here.

149
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:25,499
Rym: Yeah, anyway Over for a time signature at one point.

150
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,450
Scott: So my thing of the day.

151
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,579
Scott: I just mentioned how.

152
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,591
Scott: you know, I got a new little 12-volt power drill to.

153
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,799
Scott: you know, attach those things to my the bottom my desk is.

154
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:52,459
Scott: my existing power drills were Grandpa's drill from which is a super heavy unwieldy black and Decker monstrosity from who knows when it really sucks to use has to be plugged into the wall and a Battery powered power screwdriver from at least the 90s if not older.

155
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,166
Scott: That is so weak.

156
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,980
Scott: You're better off just using your hands and putting it in manual mode.

157
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:03,300
Scott: so We're gonna get rid of both of those things because the new power drill I got is way good.

158
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,363
Scott: But the new power drill I got advertises that it has a brushless motor, which is something I've heard Frequently, right?

159
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,249
Scott: They always talk about like oh, it's got a brushless motor.

160
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:18,387
Scott: It's way better, right and I always knew that like Yeah, there's a brushed motor and a brushless motor.

161
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,694
Scott: They're both, you know, DC motors.

162
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:24,606
Scott: They turn they rotate, you know The brushless one is better.

163
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:25,067
Scott: It's like.

164
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,355
Scott: that's why they advertise get the brushless one, right?

165
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,620
Scott: It's it's better in some way.

166
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:33,313
Scott: But and I knew the general principles of how a motor worked.

167
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:39,435
Scott: just any generic motor right, you know Electromagnet, right north-south it gets pushed in a circle, right?

168
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:44,779
Rym: I know how it's right Except that the mode of motors are basically AC.

169
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:53,640
Scott: Yes But did I if you told me hey Scott, what's the difference actually between a brushless and a brushed motor?

170
00:11:54,322 --> 00:12:02,480
Scott: like I literally imagined like brushes like Brushes you would clean up your dust with like, you know, like that kind of brush, right?

171
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:05,230
Scott: And obviously, you know, but that made no sense.

172
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,016
Scott: It's like a brush in a motor.

173
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:07,960
Scott: What the fuck does that do?

174
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,310
Scott: Is it to like reduce friction?

175
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,812
Scott: I don't know.

176
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:12,540
Scott: Why would there be a brush in there?

177
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:21,299
Scott: So I went and I googled for what the difference was and I don't need to explain the difference because you can google as Well, and that's not what the show is about.

178
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:28,380
Scott: But what I found was something that was thing of the day worthy and that is this website Which is a brushless motor simulator.

179
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:35,500
Scott: You can control with this website pretty much almost every aspect of a brushless motor.

180
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,067
Scott: Right, how many volts are going into it?

181
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:42,640
Scott: It's everything right and see how it will respond.

182
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:47,140
Scott: You know how much torque it'll put out how many RPMs you can get all that kind of stuff.

183
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,620
Scott: So after you read about the difference between brushed motors and brushless motors, you can come here to test your your knowledge.

184
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,913
Rym: It's really easy to make a motor that doesn't do anything.

185
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,080
Rym: Oh, yeah.

186
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:15,639
Scott: And if you ever happen to be in a situation where like maybe you're writing some software It's like control of brushless motor in you know, some piece of hardware This will really help you out in terms of figuring out like what you know You should do to make the motor go forwards backwards stop, etc.

187
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,700
Rym: Yeah, usually a lot of those things like you'll have some abstraction software.

188
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,018
Rym: You can just tell it like I want to beat this RPM or this direction.

189
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:23,380
Scott: Yeah, sure.

190
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:26,378
Scott: But if you're writing that abstract, it's true true.

191
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:31,580
Scott: Or maybe just making something that's just an electronic device straight up.

192
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,243
Rym: Thanks, Dayton.

193
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:37,868
Rym: the whole time I was futzing with it till I got it to actually rotate Same direction at a consistent.

194
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:38,812
Scott: Yeah, it's surprising.

195
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're just fiddling randomly.

196
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,352
Scott: It's surprisingly difficult to make it spin that.

197
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,260
Scott: arguably you need to know what's happened.

198
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,409
Scott: You need to know what's happening to make it go.

199
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:55,540
Rym: most of the foundational changes in human Technological evolution have been someone discovering that if you just fiddle with it randomly, it won't do anything.

200
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:00,028
Scott: Yep Yeah, it's good good stuff to know.

201
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:05,059
Scott: also I just want to just mention right I've one thing I forgot when time are rewiring my desk.

202
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,373
Scott: I got one of these little arch the cheapest possible arm to hold the microphone on.

203
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,440
Scott: Oh, yeah as we discussed previously.

204
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:14,320
Scott: So now it's no longer on a little stand on my desk.

205
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,247
Scott: It's now on this arm.

206
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:16,940
Scott: not really much difference.

207
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:22,580
Scott: The main difference is that now when I put my hands towards my keyboard There isn't some microphone stand in the way, which is pretty nice.

208
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,445
Scott: Not bad than that.

209
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,429
Scott: It's basically the same.

210
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,260
Rym: I have to remount my arm because it's a little bit too far away.

211
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,598
Rym: I've got it like stuck in a straight line between where it's mounted in my face.

212
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:36,038
Scott: Okay, but it's the cheapest possible arm like literally 20 bucks.

213
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:36,560
Scott: that cheapest.

214
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,131
Rym: Yeah, the better arms are mostly not actually better.

215
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:40,954
Rym: in my experience.

216
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,020
Scott: if this breaks like when will this break?

217
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,821
Scott: I don't know, but I'll just buy another $20.

218
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:49,717
Rym: I think I've had to break in the history of GeekNights and I spent about 10 bucks on each one.

219
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:53,994
Rym: So Considering that a nicer arm costs like $90.

220
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,620
Rym: I'm still I'm still profiting.

221
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,668
Rym: Yeah, this is fine in the meta moment.

222
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,934
Rym: Uh, it's warm out started reading.

223
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:01,636
Rym: tell again G again.

224
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:02,137
Rym: Watch out.

225
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:02,879
Rym: Watch out.

226
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,489
Rym: Oh Otherwise, we got no car.

227
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,476
Scott: I do that tonight because I have nothing to do tonight after I'm gonna play some games tonight.

228
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:11,882
Scott: No, I'll play a game.

229
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:12,203
Scott: what game?

230
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:14,046
Rym: Oh Roo doesn't come out yet.

231
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:14,888
Rym: That's when's.

232
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,110
Rym: that's tomorrow tomorrow, huh?

233
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,689
Rym: Tomorrow I got bleeds in the dark.

234
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:27,920
Rym: Well, nope I don't think I can play your wall I'm playing blades in the dark Considering I think we're about to make a deal with some sort of demon to make our boat powerful.

235
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:32,944
Rym: Anyway, so sort of vagabond to get a crossbow Just dive right into it.

236
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:33,868
Rym: It's the tech news roundup.

237
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:37,019
Rym: So I've semi randomized the order of all these newses.

238
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:39,627
Scott: Apple news first, right?

239
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:44,280
Rym: Yeah, let's do the Apple news first cuz that's sort of like the obvious news that's going on right now.

240
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:48,020
Scott: You know, I mean so the Apple news is like a week or two ago.

241
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:51,460
Scott: Apple news has always seen to happen on Tuesdays right after a GeekNights, right?

242
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,159
Scott: It's like we'll do a GeekNights Monday and then there'll be an Apple keynote the next day.

243
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,260
Scott: So what did Apple announce at the keynote that happened after we did a podcast?

244
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:11,199
Scott: The biggest thing they announced was the air tags, right which is a rumored for years I feel like at least two years and now is real like things that do these kinds of things in the past Like it's not a new.

245
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:19,640
Scott: Well, okay, so there is a popular product called tile and it does work rather well and I'm talking about tile.

246
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,389
Rym: I remember seeing some things that didn't.

247
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:23,620
Scott: your tile is the one that works right that everyone.

248
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:30,140
Scott: You know If you wanted one of these before you would get the tile one and so basically the idea is that you get some sort of electronic doodad.

249
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:39,618
Scott: You attach it to something that you don't want to lose and then if you lose that thing You can now digitally locate that thing because it has a doodad attached to it.

250
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,660
Scott: So you put one on your keys and now you can't lose your keys.

251
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,400
Scott: You can use your phone to find your keys.

252
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,624
Scott: Just the same way you can use your phone to find your Apple watch your Apple watch to find your phone or your Apple phone To find your iPad.

253
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:51,989
Scott: right with the find my system.

254
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,640
Rym: Yeah, put it on the car of someone you're stalking.

255
00:16:55,722 --> 00:17:03,079
Scott: so the air tags are surprisingly a Inexpensive the 30 bucks each and you can buy a four-pack for a hundred which is what I did, right?

256
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:09,079
Scott: - yeah, Apple's gonna you know strong arm you on the accessories, right?

257
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,069
Scott: The air tag itself doesn't attach to anything.

258
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,380
Scott: You need to get something else to attach it to something.

259
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,400
Scott: So they're charging $30 for like a thing that turns an air tag into a keychain.

260
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:24,958
Scott: Wait, the third parties will be up on Amazon with like 10 packs of keychain right for like $5, right?

261
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,729
Scott: Just hold your horses on the go to some tech conference.

262
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:31,624
Rym: People will be giving away things to put air tags into Exactly.

263
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:34,220
Scott: You could even just attach it to something with tape.

264
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,598
Scott: I guess if you wanted to or you know, make your own right with your 3d printer or something, right?

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,790
Scott: the surprisingly even more.

266
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,308
Scott: the air tag takes a Perfectly standard coin cell CR.

267
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:49,117
Scott: I think 2032 battery which is a very common kind.

268
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:49,880
Scott: I have a whole bunch.

269
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:54,160
Rym: Apple didn't put a proprietary non replaceable battery in there.

270
00:17:54,653 --> 00:18:06,060
Scott: No You're just a user replaceable coin cell battery that will last a year and that year estimate is Based on you like looking for your lost keys daily.

271
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:13,218
Scott: So if you basically don't lose your keys and don't try to find your air tag that often it that coin cell is gonna last a long time.

272
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:19,280
Scott: So yeah, you can get four of these for a hundred bucks and you can put them on your luggage, right?

273
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:20,649
Scott: That seems like a good thing to put.

274
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,899
Rym: a lot of people want to put them in their wallet Like put them on the things you lose the most.

275
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:29,380
Scott: I could see people putting what making wallets that have a spot for the air tag like inside somewhere.

276
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:39,954
Scott: I could see myself putting one in like the seat of my bike for when my bike I want to figure out where to hide it on the bicycle Like I'm gonna maybe try to mount it on the bottom of the rear rack or something like.

277
00:18:40,296 --> 00:18:46,339
Rym: try to find a hiding place If you put it on your bike, that's not gonna help you get your bike back most likely.

278
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:50,978
Scott: Uh, you know, maybe maybe not who knows right it could.

279
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:51,340
Scott: it might.

280
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:56,080
Rym: Unless someone parks that bike outside you could just steal it back.

281
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,910
Rym: You're probably not getting back with an air tag.

282
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,760
Scott: this, you know, it's better than nothing, right?

283
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,380
Scott: It's and for 30 bucks that is worth it right if you it's like someone stole my bike.

284
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,876
Scott: I lost a $30 thing, you know, that might have given me a good chance of getting it back.

285
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,721
Scott: I say 50/50.

286
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,504
Scott: I'd say that's worth it.

287
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,956
Scott: You know, it depends on your bike and your $30, right?

288
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:15,599
Scott: But you know, yeah.

289
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:22,279
Scott: So yeah, these are I say pretty good if they were rumored for a long time there and they seem okay, right?

290
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,532
Scott: Yeah, next news the iMac.

291
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:29,205
Scott: They so the I met the new iMac is Shockingly thin.

292
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:29,346
Scott: it.

293
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:40,600
Scott: basically what they did is they took a MacBook the One and they took the keyboard off and the touchpad off and they stood it up and they put a big old monitor.

294
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:45,280
Scott: Well, I guess a my book has a monitor but a bigger monitor and they just stood it up there.

295
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,955
Scott: That's actually, you know, if you don't need to take it anywhere, that's pretty nice.

296
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,300
Scott: You get a bigger nicer monitor.

297
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,719
Scott: Yeah, you're getting the same m1 chip in all the other Mac devices.

298
00:19:55,981 --> 00:20:03,579
Scott: You get your external keyboard and mouse and they make an iMac that has visa mount instead of a stand So you can put it on an arm and that's pretty nice.

299
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:10,426
Scott: so if you're a Mac user and you want a Mac on your desktop and you You know get the bigger screen.

300
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:13,535
Scott: It seems like a good good choice, I guess right.

301
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:19,171
Rym: it comes in nice colors They look slick and really if you're not playing games, you don't need to GPU.

302
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:20,094
Rym: probably fine.

303
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,320
Scott: It's it's not for me, but it's for someone.

304
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:25,922
Scott: so the next one is Apple.

305
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:39,380
Scott: the new iPad Pro right has an m1 in it and also Not only that even bigger news that people still seem to care about as much about 5g thunderbolt and an XDR display.

306
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,140
Scott: Right the XDR display, right?

307
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:45,581
Scott: That Means the.

308
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:58,693
Scott: the big iPad Pro which is the one I have only mine is few years old already has the same screen as like the super amazo Met ridiculously overpriced screen that sells.

309
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:01,886
Rym: people are saying like the contrast ratio Which is a little bit of a like.

310
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,500
Rym: that's a number that you should take with a grain of salt.

311
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,330
Rym: They're saying that the contrast ratio of this thing is a million to one.

312
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:12,370
Scott: Well, so the trick that everyone's doing these days is local dimming, right.

313
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:18,850
Scott: So for example the LG monitor I have here in front of me This 4k monitor has local dimming which and you can sort of see it in action.

314
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:43,371
Scott: And what happens is for example, if I put a black screen on the monitor except for my mouse cursor Which is white and I move the mouse cursor left and right you'll see that the monitor is dark Except wherever the mouse cursor is There'll be a noticeable vertical band where the LEDs are like turning on and the other LEDs in the back are off right and You know, so it's like okay you've made.

315
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:50,252
Scott: you've sort of achieved contrast like directly around the mouse cursor isn't really the great contrast because It's your.

316
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:55,850
Scott: you're illuminating this entire vertical band, but at least the rest of the monitor is dark, which is better than nothing, right?

317
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,408
Scott: It's better than having the whole monitor lit up.

318
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:02,590
Scott: It also saves power Although some power is spent on the processing of figuring out which LEDs to turn.

319
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:11,342
Rym: I mean, I think that's still a transitionary technology because event like OLED or the equivalent where each pixel is its own brightness Yeah, I don't know why Apple hasn't made it.

320
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:12,470
Scott: I guess they just can't make it work.

321
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,054
Scott: You think they would.

322
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,147
Rym: oh LED TVs even now ain't that cheap?

323
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:17,055
Scott: Yeah, of course, they're really.

324
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,379
Rym: they're pretty low resolution.

325
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:20,928
Rym: They're like if like 4k but gigantic.

326
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:21,570
Rym: so they're big.

327
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:24,081
Rym: I don't know how small LEDs can get right now.

328
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:24,703
Rym: That's true.

329
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,250
Scott: You make a retina one as an iPad.

330
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:32,462
Scott: I don't actually don't know about the current state-of-the-art of like small LEDs at all But what Apple has done is they taken that to the next level.

331
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:33,970
Scott: They don't have like this, you know.

332
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,104
Rym: Think we lost Scott.

333
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,648
Scott: I don't know what happened.

334
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:42,376
Scott: My my phone just started playing music randomly.

335
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:43,940
Scott: I didn't touch anything interesting.

336
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:46,087
Scott: Yeah, I want to see about that.

337
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,258
Scott: Oh, maybe I bumped my why I bumped my watch.

338
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:50,118
Scott: Yeah That's what happened.

339
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:56,220
Scott: okay, so What Apple has done with the XDR display is instead of just like these vertical bands?

340
00:22:56,521 --> 00:23:04,103
Scott: They actually have lots they crammed as many little backlight illuminating LEDs as they could in a grid, right and those are like Individually.

341
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:14,393
Scott: not only are there so many of them, but they they can sort of you know, increase or decrease their own brightness level Individually, so if you did you looked at an XDR display.

342
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:19,279
Scott: if you had the black screen with the white mouse cursor It would pretty much only be bright where the mouse cursor was and that was it.

343
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:27,645
Scott: Yeah, so the the iPad Pro the 13-inch one the big one does that which is like An incredible screen.

344
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:31,479
Scott: like I kind of want that iPad, but the iPad Pro I have is still just fine.

345
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,244
Scott: So I'll probably get.

346
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:46,420
Scott: but it's exciting to know that whenever this iPad Pro does die two three four years from now Whatever the one I replace it with is gonna be like ridiculously good right without m2 or m3 in it or something.

347
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,560
Rym: It's like the upgrade is not super straightforward because also the new iPad Pro requires a different keyboard.

348
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:59,335
Scott: Yeah, so you if you like me bought the an expensive keyboard To attach to your iPad Pro.

349
00:23:59,396 --> 00:23:59,980
Scott: Guess what?

350
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,680
Scott: Your pencil your expensive Apple pencil will work with the new iPad Pro, but the keyboard will not fit.

351
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,008
Scott: You need to buy a new expensive keyboard Yeah Which is more expensive than my actual mechanical key.

352
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:15,339
Rym: because the new iPad Pro is thicker like significantly thicker than the old one.

353
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:20,660
Scott: It's really thicker because they crammed all those LED backlights into yeah as a whole extra layer in there.

354
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,924
Scott: But I'd say that's worth it, right?

355
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,969
Scott: It's not enough thickness that it's not worth it.

356
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,118
Rym: Yeah, and 5g which is sort of expected.

357
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,993
Rym: but That puts people an interesting situation where someone who

358
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,691
Scott: I always get the Wi-Fi only one But yeah if you do get the 5g one

359
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:42,599
Rym: Because then you've got a device that basically has unlimited bandwidth and all these features and depending what you're up to That could be the only device you really use.

360
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,360
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing is, you know, there's two things that you know come from this.

361
00:24:47,420 --> 00:25:02,432
Scott: It's like hey Apple now has the same exact processor in the Not the iPhone the iPad Pro The iMac the MacBook Right the Mac Mini all have the same exact CPU.

362
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:03,596
Scott: That's m1.

363
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:04,980
Scott: all of them, right?

364
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,301
Scott: I don't know.

365
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:06,468
Scott: There might be slight differences.

366
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,339
Scott: I don't know if they've changed it, but they're calling them all m1.

367
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,392
Scott: I assume it's the same exact chip, you know, the differences are surrounding it You.

368
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:19,004
Scott: why aren't you Cowards putting a OS X on the iPad Pro, right?

369
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:22,450
Scott: They let you run iOS apps on Macs.

370
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:26,926
Scott: Don't let you run OS X apps on an iPad that has an m1 same chip.

371
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:27,750
Scott: No reason it couldn't.

372
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:31,350
Scott: And they still don't have Xcode on the iPad Pro.

373
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,275
Scott: Right, which is the?

374
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:35,642
Scott: you can't make an iPad app on an iPad.

375
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:38,169
Scott: that is still I've been saying this for years horseshit.

376
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:53,226
Rym: When I see about all I'll fix that like in general the old the people who I see using iPad pros where they actually use Like the real kit like all the extra capabilities it provides seems to be mostly Photographers and to a lesser extent video.

377
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:53,850
Scott: That's what I use it for.

378
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:55,935
Scott: Yeah, that's what I use it for.

379
00:25:55,955 --> 00:26:00,289
Scott: Yeah, it seems like that is that might be which is why that improved screen is really good.

380
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,140
Scott: Yeah Right, that would be like it's still.

381
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:12,190
Scott: even with a brand new monitor The iPad Pro is the best screen in the whole house because almost everyone else I know like who has an iPad Pro and mine's an old iPad Pro.

382
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,150
Scott: It's old and it's still the best screen in the whole house.

383
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:21,205
Rym: But other than you and a few other people like everyone else I know who has one of these things doesn't do anything on it that a non Pro iPad could do.

384
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:29,999
Scott: if you are not doing any pro things photo video editing Anything of that nature do not buy an iPad Pro.

385
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,302
Scott: get the regular iPad.

386
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:34,570
Scott: It's just a regular iPad that is still phenomenally powerful.

387
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:38,002
Scott: That will is like the new iPad like the thing to do.

388
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:38,605
Scott: I've had air.

389
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:39,449
Scott: It's like it's a way.

390
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:43,164
Scott: good You don't need the iPad Pro if you're not doing pro stuff plus.

391
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:43,766
Scott: it costs a lot.

392
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:44,650
Scott: It's a thousand dollars.

393
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,629
Scott: It's like it's right if you you're getting the iPad Pro because you don't have a laptop right you're.

394
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:50,545
Scott: Your laptop is gone.

395
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:50,969
Scott: You're right.

396
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:56,870
Rym: Yeah I feel like you either have a laptop and a really shitty cheap tablet or you have an iPad Pro and no laptop.

397
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,243
Scott: You also if you have the iPad Pro, you're not buying the big phone.

398
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:01,969
Scott: You're getting the mini phone, right?

399
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:05,946
Scott: Well, no reason to have the pro iPhone based on the data.

400
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,455
Rym: No one's buying the small phone.

401
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:18,115
Rym: So Apple launch, you know iPhone 12 12 mini a little bit the fancy purple color but there's a lot of The last small iPhone.

402
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:30,981
Scott: if it's the last small iPhone if they announce in September October when they announce new iPhones as usual On schedule if the iPhone 13 does not have a mini variant I will be buying an iPhone 12 mini to put in the closet.

403
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:32,145
Scott: maybe two who knows.

404
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:47,108
Scott: yeah stash away Just in case because there's a bit alone is going to be good until it's considering the fact that my iPhone 7 is still good The iPhone 12 at MIDI is going to be good until 6g is out and 5g is like being faded away.

405
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:57,220
Rym: So yeah, but there's a lot of chatter in the industry generally about how basically Nobody wants small cell phones anymore at all.

406
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:05,810
Rym: Like nobody does there is no demographic of people Except like weird tech nerds like us who want small phones and any of you know any amount that matters.

407
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:11,670
Rym: So I think Sony might literally have the only small smartphones that are left that are like toys.

408
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,830
Scott: Yeah, we've talked about it many times.

409
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,794
Scott: Is that for most people like phone is their only thing or maybe they have a tablet just to be convenient At home?

410
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:27,150
Rym: part of what disrupted this I think is people have dedicated streaming devices instead of Htps, which later on we'll talk about how that is often still a mistake.

411
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,620
Rym: but anyway, yeah, so they have that.

412
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:36,305
Rym: most people just have their cell phone and If they're a kid, they probably have the Chromebook their school gave them.

413
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:40,030
Rym: Yeah, I forget I don't think we actually talked about some of the show, but it's a mini news.

414
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,920
Scott: Chrome OS it's an older news, but it checks out.

415
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:53,690
Rym: Yeah, it's literally the number two Operating system desktop computers like desktop consumer desktop operating consumer desktop laptop operating.

416
00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:00,419
Rym: Yep, Windows is far and away the champion for you know, cuz people like to play games and run software But include servers Linux is the champion.

417
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,352
Rym: Yeah, but for consumer laptops and desktops It's Windows.

418
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:09,470
Rym: and then the next one down is Chrome OS almost entirely because of the school situation.

419
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,289
Rym: And then Mac OS is just an increasingly shrinking space.

420
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:14,926
Scott: Yep, pretty much

421
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:30,690
Rym: But it's interesting that I think what that means is that most kids like young people today like whoever like the kids younger than zennials They pretty much have a phone and a Chromebook They don't like to use because the school makes them use it and that is it and that is all they will ever want.

422
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,798
Scott: That's all the Chromebook doesn't do anything that they need.

423
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:36,693
Rym: personal, you know, yeah used for also depending on the school They go to.

424
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,950
Rym: either they like it's super locked down and the school doesn't let them do anything with it.

425
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:49,471
Rym: Chromebook by default is locked down it can only do so many things and also they probably are afraid to do anything interesting on it because they assume the school's spying on Them.

426
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:51,187
Rym: and they're probably right depending on the school.

427
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:58,610
Rym: So, uh, I'm not saying anything good or bad about that, but I think that trend is just the state of the world.

428
00:29:58,933 --> 00:29:59,075
Rym: It's.

429
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:11,429
Rym: I think it's underestimated how that might shift consumer usage of things down the road because There's been a lot of speculation that larger phones are being driven by people wanting better battery life.

430
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:28,110
Rym: But so partially it may be partially true, but at the same time smaller phones Usually not iPhones, but all the other like Android phones They usually have a lower resolution screen and have comfortable or an oftentimes better battery lives than their larger equivalents.

431
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:30,615
Scott: Yep, that's it's definitely a thing.

432
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:35,650
Scott: where in Android there are you know, whatever smaller phone is available is also a weaker phone.

433
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,090
Scott: It's like they're not putting the highest end chips the highest end specs in the smaller phone.

434
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:46,536
Scott: It's like people, you know, if you want the most powerful best top-of-the-line phone It's only a big phone.

435
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:50,190
Scott: even Apple where the iPhone mini is really strong.

436
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:56,310
Scott: Yeah, that the better the max iPhone the bigger one does have better specs in addition to being bigger.

437
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,770
Scott: You can't get the pro max iPhone in the mini size.

438
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:00,954
Scott: Don't have that.

439
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:06,492
Scott: so but as we're even it even is someone who does want small Isn't with?

440
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:16,423
Scott: there are people who want might want smaller but aren't willing to sacrifice the battery life and the horsepower Which is interesting because most phone users don't use any of that horsepower.

441
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,789
Rym: like cell phone gaming does not push the boundaries.

442
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:19,912
Rym: that much For most.

443
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:26,618
Scott: well, I think also if the cell phone is your primary computing device and that's what you've got Then a big one makes more sense.

444
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,778
Scott: Yeah, I give I. if I only had the iPhone I didn't have the iPad or a desktop or anything.

445
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,350
Scott: I sure as hell I'd buy the giant iPad iPhone Pro.

446
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:43,708
Rym: so if I had no device and I could only have one I would probably get a tablet and with with cell capabilities and Literally not have a phone at all.

447
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:45,719
Scott: That might be a good choice.

448
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,496
Rym: Also, that's probably what I would do Just thinking about my life the big.

449
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,044
Scott: the biggest problem with that though.

450
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:55,830
Scott: Is that It's like that makes perfect sense until I have to like go somewhere right?

451
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:59,929
Scott: Go to a concert and bring my tablet Ride a bike with my credit.

452
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:06,510
Rym: I see so many people at conventions like holding up their stupid tablet to like get a video in a concert.

453
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:09,696
Scott: so because they were Convention makes a little more sense.

454
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:12,850
Scott: You have a lot of sitting in line time and you know, you may have a bag with you.

455
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:14,895
Rym: Yeah But I have.

456
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:17,547
Rym: I've encountered that a surprising number of times in my life.

457
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:24,050
Rym: someone like Holding on to a giant tablet trying to take pictures like out in the wild in situations where it really isn't appropriate.

458
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:32,855
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I think the screen size seems to be the primary reason because if that's their primary device What are kids doing on these things?

459
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:36,505
Rym: They're mostly watching movies and watching TV and watching shows.

460
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,010
Rym: that seems to be killing your battery.

461
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,415
Scott: That's why my battery doesn't go down.

462
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,018
Scott: I don't do that.

463
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,022
Rym: that kills the battery.

464
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:42,849
Rym: It also uses bandwidth etc.

465
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:52,454
Rym: It seems like all these factors together Lead me to believe that the screen size is the primary thing they care about because if the thing that's draining the battery is watching A bunch of movies.

466
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:55,450
Rym: They probably don't want a tiny screen to watch those movies on.

467
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:58,926
Scott: You know, I watch plenty of stuff on my iPhone 3G on the train.

468
00:32:58,946 --> 00:32:59,830
Scott: I would watch anime.

469
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:02,950
Rym: I mean I watch stuff on my Sony Xperia and it's totally fine.

470
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,110
Scott: But yeah, I mean I don't watch a lot these days on my phone because I use the other devices.

471
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:09,908
Scott: But I have watched whole things on my iPhone 3G.

472
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:14,984
Scott: No problem Anyway, so one last Apple news that wasn't announced that their keynote is someone suing Apple.

473
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,010
Scott: and basically the story here.

474
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,343
Scott: I'm not gonna get into all the details.

475
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:18,930
Scott: You can read them.

476
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,110
Scott: It's you know legal stuff and whatnot, right, but somebody bought a bunch of stuff on iTunes Apple Store, etc.

477
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,339
Scott: Right, and it's when you go to buy stuff.

478
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,190
Scott: Sometimes it says get sometimes it says rent.

479
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,022
Scott: Sometimes it says buy, you know, depending on what you you know, like.

480
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:36,630
Scott: sometimes you like, you know get so you can download something.

481
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,380
Scott: But it's like there's gonna be in-app purchases.

482
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:39,910
Scott: It's not a whole all free, right?

483
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,323
Scott: But you can download it and at least run it for free.

484
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:48,910
Scott: you just you know There might be limited functionality until you pay for example, but if something says buy that you means buy, right?

485
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,604
Scott: So it's like if there's a game and the app stores is five bucks.

486
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:52,790
Scott: you pay five bucks.

487
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,914
Scott: You now have the game right.

488
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,949
Scott: there still might be more in-app purchases, but you you have the only game now.

489
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,921
Scott: He bites a music on iTunes or a movie.

490
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,210
Scott: Yeah, you download that movie and you can watch it, right?

491
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:11,235
Scott: Someone bought a bunch of stuff on iTunes a whole lot actually and then their account was shut Right for whatever reason.

492
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:14,570
Scott: I guess they broke Terms of Service or something and Apple decided to close their account.

493
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,620
Scott: Maybe they were doing something?

494
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:16,408
Scott: shit, you know, who knows?

495
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:21,996
Scott: And now all this stuff that they bought is gone and LA.

496
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:28,606
Scott: so they're suing Apple and they're saying hey Yeah, the Terms of Service says, you know, you can shut my account at any time.

497
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,597
Scott: and Apple says yeah Of course people it's common sense.

498
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:39,841
Scott: Everyone knows that if your account is shut you lose access to everything, but they're saying no No, no, it says buy I bought that you should at very.

499
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,090
Scott: they're saying that like at minimum sure you close my account.

500
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,822
Scott: You should not be able to take away the things I bought.

501
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:59,730
Scott: I should be allowed to log in and watch those movies listen to the songs play those apps that I bought and Even if you deny me from doing anything else making further purchases, you know, whatever, you know, that's okay.

502
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,215
Scott: But I bought those things.

503
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:05,430
Scott: So therefore I should have those things and I think apples in the wrong here.

504
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,550
Rym: I think this complain it now they I don't know why their account was shot.

505
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,494
Rym: It might have been bad stuff.

506
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:10,077
Rym: Like we don't know.

507
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:20,210
Rym: but yeah at least in terms of what this means If you buy something like if I buy a movie on Amazon I should have the legal right to watch that movie even if I don't have an Amazon account anymore.

508
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,389
Rym: However, they make it happen.

509
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,060
Rym: They should be forced to accommodate me and

510
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:36,610
Scott: I think I talked about how when you buy an app in the App Store Even if you know the app Goes away and you can't no one else can buy it You can still go it's like the purchased section of the of your account and find it and download it again.

511
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,057
Scott: Yeah, and how you couldn't?

512
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:43,270
Scott: we talked about that in relation to the Sony stores Not going down even though they might have gone down.

513
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:52,690
Rym: Well like I bought a bunch of random shows over the years just on Amazon and I pointedly chose to buy them instead of like get A rental or whatever and I can still just watch him because I have an account.

514
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:56,443
Rym: But I think this should also apply to if I buy something like that.

515
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:57,085
Rym: Amazon can't.

516
00:35:57,226 --> 00:36:00,189
Rym: even if they stop selling that thing They have to give me access to it forever.

517
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,799
Scott: Exactly, and this is where it gets like the streaming services.

518
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,890
Scott: It's obvious like hey, you know you you're paying for Netflix.

519
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,903
Scott: This show is no longer on Netflix.

520
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:09,910
Scott: You can't watch it anymore.

521
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,809
Scott: It's like yeah, I'm paying for access to the service whatever the current state of it is.

522
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,795
Scott: Yeah, but if you were to buy something on Netflix doesn't sell things, but let's say they did Amazon you can.

523
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:24,350
Rym: there's Amazon streaming stuff that as long as you have an account like it's just for you to watch.

524
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,283
Scott: Let's say Amazon has a determinator for sale for five bucks.

525
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:33,989
Scott: You can pay five bucks and you now own Quotes the Terminator digitally on Amazon Prime video, whatever.

526
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:35,900
Scott: You can watch it all you want.

527
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:36,504
Scott: You own it.

528
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:37,168
Scott: You're not renting it.

529
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:43,127
Scott: Suddenly their agreement with determinators studio whatever studio owns the rights to Terminator.

530
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:46,555
Scott: I don't know who You know runs out.

531
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:49,743
Scott: and now they Terminator is no longer on Amazon Prime.

532
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,643
Scott: if I bought it I There should be right.

533
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:57,805
Scott: I should be Still able to download it and watch it as much as I want.

534
00:36:57,886 --> 00:36:58,449
Scott: I bought it.

535
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,275
Scott: Yeah, now these companies should have.

536
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:09,868
Rym: they should be able to just not sell things like that like they could make different terms or whatever They really want to but don't use the word by use a different word which is sort of what the lawsuits about.

537
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:12,782
Rym: also I would try to grab services that did.

538
00:37:13,003 --> 00:37:15,535
Rym: let me buy things and frankly I think the law should be.

539
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:22,363
Rym: the laws and regulations around this should be such that if you buy something The company has to provide access to it in perpetuity.

540
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:30,148
Rym: if the company fails to write access Then you should be able to get redress in terms of either the thing in an unencrypted

541
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:30,570
Scott: money back

542
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:36,950
Rym: Uncontrolled format like they have to give you the movie file now, or they are you have the legal right to pirate it

543
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:39,458
Scott: Or something like

544
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:39,759
Rym: that.

545
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,187
Scott: right just give me five bucks back.

546
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:41,529
Scott: That's fine.

547
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,710
Scott: But yeah, it'd be interesting to see a conflict here, right?

548
00:37:44,770 --> 00:38:03,750
Scott: It's like let's say Amazon makes a deal to distribute a movie and then they say buy the movie I buy it and then it's like okay The court says they have to provide it to me forever because I bought it But then they're their agreement with whoever they got the movie from runs out and they're not allowed to give it to me anymore.

549
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,917
Scott: So now they're basically wronged on both sides.

550
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:09,650
Rym: So it seems like Amazon already handles this when you buy stuff.

551
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:17,503
Rym: I definitely have bought things on Amazon like movies and TV shows that are not on Amazon anymore But I can still watch them when I'm logged into my account.

552
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:18,207
Scott: Okay.

553
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:22,956
Scott: Well, that's good You know, but it's not a guarantee that that'll be the case and also The case.

554
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:25,084
Rym: I would sue Amazon personally, right?

555
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:28,177
Scott: Of course, but it's like, you know Something could happen to your account.

556
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:31,050
Scott: Maybe they accuse you of writing fake reviews or something and shut you down.

557
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,119
Scott: You lose all your movies, you know, who knows.

558
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,830
Rym: but I think Apple is squarely in the wrong.

559
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:45,350
Rym: and the saddest part is Apple like their lawyers really pulled some like Spurious arguments to try to get this case dismissed and the ruling was not that Apple is wrong.

560
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:48,430
Rym: The ruling was that Apple's motions to dismiss were not.

561
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,084
Scott: Yes, the case is going through.

562
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,034
Scott: they're gonna get sued Getting sued now.

563
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:57,810
Rym: Apple basically tried to argue that it's ridiculous that someone would think buying something means that they bought it.

564
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,189
Rym: Yes, that's basically what they argued.

565
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:11,545
Rym: Yep So there is actually some gigantic science and technology news like this Should in a just world overshadow any other news on earth right now.

566
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:12,990
Rym: This is bigger than COVID vaccines.

567
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,672
Rym: This is like.

568
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:14,955
Rym: this is big.

569
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:25,877
Rym: a year-long trial in Burkina Faso has concluded on a malaria vaccine And this malaria vaccine is Shockingly effective like 77% effective.

570
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:26,218
Rym: That's a lot.

571
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:31,800
Scott: malaria all the malaria in the world.

572
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:40,729
Rym: if we could vaccinate everyone and we could decrease malaria by 77% that would change the world more than like any medical advancement that's ever happened in the US in the past like 40 or 50 years.

573
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:51,028
Scott: So if you find a hundred people who had malaria and you said listen, I know a hundred of you have malaria But actually in the future only 25 of you are gonna have malaria and the rest of you won't.

574
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,194
Scott: the rest of you will Just live normal.

575
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,130
Rym: It's actually better than that not to get into it.

576
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,816
Rym: But you know because I learned all.

577
00:39:55,856 --> 00:40:08,649
Rym: I learned a lot about but I'm not qualified to speak about The you know when we talk about the efficacy numbers of these vaccines like all the COVID vaccines 77% effective does not mean that the remaining 30 ish percent of people get it.

578
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:14,357
Rym: It's actually way better than that, but I don't of course That's the worst case.

579
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,489
Scott: in that worst case, it's still incredible.

580
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:22,350
Rym: Yeah But like I think especially a lot of Americans are people who live in industrialized countries.

581
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:29,710
Rym: Don't really without my personalized the horrific scourge that malaria is around the world and like it is still a huge problem.

582
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,713
Rym: It has not gone away.

583
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:34,004
Rym: It is in fact worse than it was in the past in many cases.

584
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:34,365
Scott: Yep.

585
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:39,182
Rym: You don't want it But this is huge news.

586
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:57,490
Rym: that like ate a vaccine deployed in the parts of the world that experienced malaria and high rates could actually like a fundamentally transformed society in those places in a Relatively short span of time as so many days all are killed or wounded or have long-term chronic issues from malaria.

587
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:03,850
Scott: So not only will that basically save like the people who live in malaria places, right?

588
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:10,370
Scott: But people who don't live in malaria places can now would be able to get the vaccine and then go there, right?

589
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,821
Scott: Places like this place is like I won't go.

590
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:14,530
Scott: It's like oh no, there's malaria there ain't going there.

591
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:17,470
Rym: I mean, I've been to places where malaria and yellow fever endemic.

592
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:21,530
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I'm not gonna go there on purpose.

593
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,134
Scott: It's some at least.

594
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:30,196
Scott: it's definitely just waiting people from going to places suddenly, you know, if you get malaria out Suddenly a lot of places turn way.

595
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:36,576
Scott: good, you know, you just you know, especially, you know, you think about it's like, you know In America, we have shitty health care, right?

596
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:41,110
Scott: how much like one medical incident can like ruin a whole family, right?

597
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,093
Scott: It's like oh, you know Someone got sick.

598
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:48,599
Scott: now our whole light all of our several people's lives are up ended taking care of this person because we don't have Universal health care.

599
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,349
Scott: It's a bunch of bullshit.

600
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:59,015
Scott: And then that you know add that up across an entire society an entire country multiple countries continents Right of how much damage is done.

601
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:10,470
Scott: if you could eliminate just like this one disease even 70 something percent How many of those families aren't gonna have just this fucked up thing that ruins their whole life of several people, right?

602
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:19,750
Scott: Not just the person who got it and got sick or died But all the people around them now won't have that and can now go about their lives, you know doing what they were doing before.

603
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:25,670
Scott: Right, it's like, you know and the net effect of that and the entire world is just you know, incredible.

604
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:29,744
Scott: So I hope this is legit and I deploy it which I'll get there.

605
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,410
Rym: we and there's a bunch of other.

606
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:42,414
Rym: Let's deploy vaccines from Larry like all these MR Like all the MNR mRNA research for the kovat vaccines has led to like there is a vaccine for multiple sclerosis That's being tested now.

607
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:44,541
Scott: We might be even know that was a virus.

608
00:42:44,922 --> 00:42:46,608
Rym: It's not your food.

609
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:46,889
Rym: You can.

610
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:53,343
Rym: Vaccines can be made in novel and interesting ways now using this technology.

611
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:54,647
Rym: that opened up something.

612
00:42:54,687 --> 00:43:02,355
Rym: We don't fully comprehend yet We might be on the cusp of radical transformation of how we treat disease just globally The end of disease.

613
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:02,978
Scott: that can be great.

614
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,287
Rym: Yeah, the problem is right now.

615
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,836
Scott: That is you know, that is a thing.

616
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:09,558
Scott: That's right.

617
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,990
Scott: It's like we keep going a universal health care universal health care, right?

618
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,781
Scott: And it's like if we just end a disease That wouldn't be such a big deal in right?

619
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:20,629
Scott: It's like for for.

620
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:26,730
Rym: well Let's just invite that to disease caused by pathogens and autoimmune disorders because when you get it amounts of mental health.

621
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:27,756
Rym: That is a different kind.

622
00:43:27,776 --> 00:43:30,090
Scott: It's not gonna say a vaccine won't stop you from breaking your leg.

623
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:31,995
Rym: Also, yeah, well, there's a lot of other things.

624
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:49,874
Rym: but if there were no more infectious agents and there wasn't a huge let's say But also even then the cost of universal health care would be so much lower, you know, well unless you know Things like maintaining bodies maintaining mental health also Psychological.

625
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,160
Rym: there's a lot going on there.

626
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,505
Scott: It would still be lower than it is.

627
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:57,040
Rym: Hmm, right I mean I hope one day there's a cure for aging like.

628
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,587
Rym: I really consider aging beyond like 30 years Just be a disease.

629
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:03,477
Scott: Yeah, there are though, right?

630
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:04,481
Scott: It's like people talk about.

631
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:07,070
Scott: you see like it comes to the environment.

632
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:18,170
Scott: There's a lot of people looking for some sort of like technological escape hatch Like hey We won't have to stop burning fuel if we can just invent something that'll clean all the carbon out of the air like this pipe dream and that's very

633
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,997
Rym: Gorillas will freeze to death over the winter,

634
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,060
Scott: right?

635
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,190
Scott: It's a very unrealistic dream right to be able to do that.

636
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,770
Scott: It's not impossible, but it's like you can't be aiming as that as your way out, right?

637
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,089
Scott: It's like that's not gonna be the way we'll be dead before you figure that out, right?

638
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:42,522
Scott: But in terms of infectious disease, it's like, you know, I'm not saying that we should Give up on other options in saying.

639
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:54,832
Scott: Oh, we haven't a technological escape hatch now But this is a really promising technological escape hatch that we shouldn't just you know Brush off the way we brush off people with fantasies about sucking all the carbon out of the well Especially

640
00:44:54,872 --> 00:45:02,878
Rym: because vaccines are interesting in that almost everything we can do to treat infectious disease relies on our immune system to do the heavy lifting.

641
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:22,810
Rym: because remember like to put it simplistically your body is filled with a semi-autonomous army that literally defends you from all this shit and most of the treatments we have for infectious disease involve Augmenting or assisting that system in some way are like most drugs don't do anything directly like the antibiotics will kill bacteria.

642
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:30,064
Rym: But most treatments for diseases just buy your body time to do its thing or train your body to do its thing in a particular way.

643
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:39,252
Rym: So those autonomous kill BOTS are going to be the neck of one of the biggest frontiers of medicine to come Like I think humans are barely if real.

644
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:54,350
Rym: So, uh pursuant to that Bill Gates is a horrible person because he actually argued recently that the u.s Should not open up the patents on all these COVID vaccines and all this type of research.

645
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:57,358
Scott: Strange it like the guy who's been known for like his.

646
00:45:57,398 --> 00:46:01,850
Scott: number one thing is charity to fight malaria and diseases, especially malaria.

647
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:06,840
Scott: Yeah is like hey, let's not Let's not share vaccines.

648
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,078
Rym: It's like what the yeah, there's a Scope of this show.

649
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,345
Rym: but suffice it to say there should not be billionaires.

650
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:14,990
Rym: Bill Gates's money should be seized.

651
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:18,383
Rym: But also there's a weird problem right now where the u.s.

652
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:20,010
Rym: Actually has a surplus of vaccines.

653
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:36,690
Rym: But due to the former guy, I just like I like the fact I don't have to say his name anymore But the former president of the United States Specifically engineered the contracts with these companies to make the vaccines to prevent the export of those vaccines.

654
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:41,150
Scott: Means the US companies are evil and have no interest in going back on that housing it.

655
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,430
Rym: I feel like the right answer is to nationalize every major pharmaceutical.

656
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:51,362
Scott: yes, good answer, but Anyway, the go-go Moderna people.

657
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:52,185
Scott: I saw an art.

658
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:53,450
Scott: I saw in my headlines today.

659
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,485
Scott: I saw two headlines next to each other from two different news sources.

660
00:46:56,646 --> 00:47:04,229
Scott: One of them said Moderna agrees to temporarily not enforce its IP rights until the end of the.

661
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:07,439
Rym: yeah The word temporarily is a load-bearing word.

662
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:08,202
Scott: So basically there.

663
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:16,150
Scott: so that headline basically says hey If you make COVID vaccine and give it out, we promise not we we're still holding the rights.

664
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:16,974
Scott: We own this.

665
00:47:17,054 --> 00:47:21,353
Scott: but if you make it and give it out before the pandemic is over We won't.

666
00:47:21,393 --> 00:47:26,449
Scott: we probably semi pinky swear with ourselves that we won't that we won't sue you.

667
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:33,961
Scott: But at whatever arbitrary point we declare the pandemic over of course people are still gonna want Vaccines because to prevent, you know, you have a new baby.

668
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:35,547
Scott: It needs a COVID vaccine.

669
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:36,170
Scott: Well, you're right.

670
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,445
Scott: It's like you don't want it, you know, right?

671
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:42,482
Scott: Or hey the pandemics over here someone hasn't been vaccinated.

672
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:43,968
Scott: they want to be vaccinated now, right?

673
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:50,130
Scott: Yeah We're gonna then start suing you and make you stop so that will then you know be the only ones making it afterwards.

674
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:59,667
Scott: And then the next headline I saw was like yeah, Moderna's full of shit And I was like those two headlines next to each other.

675
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:07,517
Rym: it's like Yeah, the one thing I hope before we go on to all the other news here that Something unique happened with these vaccines.

676
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:15,501
Rym: because irrespective of the intellectual property problems at least in the United States a Whole bunch of people experience what universal health care is like.

677
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,686
Rym: like you just show up.

678
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,302
Rym: They give you a shot They don't ask for any paperwork.

679
00:48:19,585 --> 00:48:22,534
Rym: It just works Mm-hmm.

680
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:25,463
Rym: Yeah, that's you know, that's literally what universal health care is like.

681
00:48:25,804 --> 00:48:27,469
Rym: imagine if you could do that when you got hurt.

682
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:29,898
Scott: Yeah, it's like I got a band-aid.

683
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:31,970
Scott: walk into somewhere get a band-aid.

684
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:32,196
Scott: Okay.

685
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,688
Rym: So in some other news, let's skip ahead here.

686
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:44,970
Rym: So yet another car company has said that they're going to stop selling combustion engines by some arbitrary date.

687
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,313
Rym: That's far too out in the future.

688
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:52,617
Rym: It's 2040 which is earlier than some companies have said But it's still not enough.

689
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:53,643
Rym: We actually have a bunch of news.

690
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:54,870
Rym: is that we'll get to around cars.

691
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:00,150
Scott: But yeah, I saw a headline that was like yeah, you know, they're talking big about electric cars.

692
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:04,610
Scott: But if you look at the numbers Detroit is going all-in on SUVs for quite a while.

693
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,870
Scott: Yeah, right making more and more of them, you know.

694
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,163
Rym: Well, cuz there's two problems going on here.

695
00:49:08,203 --> 00:49:14,149
Rym: on one hand We've put the moral hazard on the side of the consumer in that the consumer has to choose which car to buy.

696
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:17,459
Rym: Maybe can't afford a car that is more efficient.

697
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:26,405
Rym: Like there's a lot of problems there, but the electric cars are more expensive, but also Consumer preferences where I do want to put the moral hazard on those people.

698
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:29,456
Rym: people are buying Gigantic cars that are just.

699
00:49:29,476 --> 00:49:30,037
Scott: they've been made.

700
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:32,746
Scott: they've been made to want those cars by the car companies.

701
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:34,717
Scott: They didn't want them originally Yeah, but it was.

702
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:35,908
Rym: but where is the line of?

703
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:42,043
Rym: advertising made them buy that cuz one could Not be tricked by advertising.

704
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,302
Scott: and yes If you look at the number no because we we have an example for this.

705
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:50,094
Scott: we got rid of tobacco advertising and it fucking work Yeah, which proved right.

706
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:55,269
Scott: so we should ban car advertising and alcohol advertising as well and pharmaceutical advertising.

707
00:49:55,309 --> 00:50:02,201
Scott: Yep Well That tobacco advertising was bad, right but it's constitutional.

708
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:07,365
Rym: the problem with this type of news of like Honda in this case They're gonna stop selling combustion engines.

709
00:50:07,507 --> 00:50:18,970
Rym: fine the problem is electric cars pretty much pollute the same amount because Most of the local pollution that comes from cars is from the tires which are not regulated at all.

710
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:23,521
Rym: Electric cars in the local environment pretty much just as bad as combustion engines.

711
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:28,347
Scott: look at look at a photo of a traffic jam And just be like okay all the cars are electric.

712
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:30,574
Scott: now It's like okay.

713
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:33,665
Scott: I guess there's a little bit less pollution in this area.

714
00:50:33,686 --> 00:50:33,746
Rym: Yep.

715
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:36,885
Rym: We have a better Came from somewhere.

716
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:42,905
Rym: we have a better Collecting and distributing the energy to run those cars like electric car.

717
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:58,110
Rym: if you ignore the tire problem Electric cars are at least better than the alternative because we can generate Electricity and transmit it with overall less harm Assuming our electric grid moves away from things like coal which is yet another problem.

718
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:06,890
Scott: You're replacing the you know, the gas refinery with some lithium battery factory, you know You know replacing the oil rig and the ocean with a lithium mine.

719
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:13,390
Rym: But that arguably if we move to certain kinds of nuclear power that ends up being mostly a wash or likely slightly better.

720
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,606
Rym: And it's different kinds of pollution contributing less to global warming.

721
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:26,281
Rym: However Local pollution doesn't go down because electric cars generate more particulate pollution from the tire degradation Which there's no good way to solve right now.

722
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:30,690
Rym: and that kind of pollution Well, it doesn't contribute as much to things like global warming.

723
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:36,369
Rym: That's the kind of pollution that causes things like health problems in the people who live in the places where cars are.

724
00:51:37,113 --> 00:51:40,574
Scott: It also, you know maintains car supremacy Which doesn't help.

725
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:41,197
Scott: you're locally.

726
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:44,230
Scott: it still maintains all your public space is still taken up by roads.

727
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:48,490
Rym: It doesn't change the induced demand problem of cars and car infrastructure.

728
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,082
Scott: Anyway, anyway cars are not the answer.

729
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:52,785
Rym: So here's the news.

730
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:53,569
Rym: It's kind of nuts.

731
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,263
Rym: So there was this post office scandal in the UK.

732
00:51:57,303 --> 00:52:01,601
Scott: Like I haven't gone deep into the story I saw the headlines but didn't read the details.

733
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:08,026
Rym: So basically there was some software It looks like was made by Fujitsu and it was used to manage the finances of post offices.

734
00:52:09,858 --> 00:52:23,644
Rym: in the early 2000s Apparently a bunch of people 42 people who worked for the post office were convicted of stealing money Based on data from the software like the accounting caught them stealing.

735
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:25,209
Rym: some of them went to jail.

736
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:39,584
Rym: There was they like 42 people had their lives basically ruined because recently Judges in a court of appeal have ruled that all those convictions are invalid Because it was just due to software glitches in this.

737
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:43,035
Rym: in this system Some of them lost their homes.

738
00:52:43,356 --> 00:52:44,500
Rym: Some of them couldn't get insurance.

739
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:47,390
Rym: Some of them are now dead and can't even be compensated.

740
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,281
Rym: Basically this software set a bunch of people to jail for nothing.

741
00:52:53,063 --> 00:52:56,798
Scott: Yeah, whoever made that software should go Get swapped low.

742
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,470
Rym: So, you know we were talking about this before the show.

743
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:13,190
Rym: there's an image that's been making the rounds on the internet that is like a 100% apt to a lot of the problems in the industrialized world today that basically said Computers should never be allowed to make management decisions because computers can never be held accountable for their decisions.

744
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:14,234
Scott: That's true.

745
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:17,148
Rym: That slide that was what from a presentation in the late 70s.

746
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,459
Rym: Yeah, it was an old thing.

747
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:32,703
Rym: I guess we're just incapable of learning lessons You don't say but this kind of story is Extra nuts because I cannot imagine Like I haven't.

748
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:33,947
Rym: I've gone through all the details.

749
00:53:34,008 --> 00:53:36,315
Rym: I don't even know enough about like European or in this case.

750
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:38,000
Rym: I think British law.

751
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:43,258
Rym: How could someone even be convicted when the no money was actually missing?

752
00:53:43,338 --> 00:53:44,665
Rym: like yes Like where's the word?

753
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:45,188
Scott: the money go?

754
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:46,094
Scott: look at my bank account.

755
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:46,919
Scott: There's no money there.

756
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:55,831
Rym: Yeah, like I feel like for all the problems of the American judicial system This particular case feels like it would have been difficult to.

757
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:58,059
Rym: it would have been difficult for this to happen in the?

758
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:08,520
Rym: u.s due to the way our structure like the system of course is coupled with the fact that generally America's doesn't have a good track record of even being able to prosecute technologically advanced crimes.

759
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:17,020
Scott: Yeah, I feel like you know, we think about you know, the the sci-fi cliche, you know minority report or V for Vendetta, right?

760
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,298
Scott: Yeah, by the way is from the country in question here, right?

761
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:25,480
Scott: And you know you this like surveillance society, right?

762
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:26,850
Scott: Which I guess this is part of right.

763
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:41,973
Scott: they had this accounting software was Surveilling the activities of all these employees and then the evidence from that surveillance was used to convict them Even though it wasn't just you know surveillance cameras, which we usually think of And you know, we think of China as like using it intentionally and knowingly right?

764
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:43,679
Scott: It's like you sort of how we characterize them.

765
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:46,712
Scott: It's like yes, they're they're doing 1884 on purpose, right?

766
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,900
Scott: Whereas we sort of characterize, you know, the UK as doing it, right?

767
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:57,593
Scott: They've had cameras all over the place, you know before anyone else right?

768
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,499
Scott: I'll feel it feels like before anyone else.

769
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:13,800
Scott: But it's like it always sort of felt like they weren't doing it in the sort of on Purpose big brothery way, but instead, you know doing it in sort of a not heeding the warnings kind of way.

770
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:20,040
Scott: And I think that that characterization is probably in part racist, right?

771
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,652
Scott: It's like they're doing it just as much on purpose as China.

772
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:25,154
Scott: is what?

773
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:26,800
Scott: what really is the difference between?

774
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:34,845
Scott: You know going, you know, I mean there is a difference, you know, the UK isn't currently to my knowledge Committing a genocide.

775
00:55:34,886 --> 00:55:36,331
Scott: They did all the genocides in the past.

776
00:55:36,392 --> 00:55:38,099
Scott: Where's China's genociding right now?

777
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:43,279
Scott: But how much difference is there really between China and the UK, right?

778
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:48,520
Rym: How do you get to a point to where you have some software that Fujitsu wrote?

779
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:56,828
Rym: That's so buggy that it just means like it reports just wrong numbers and then an entire legal system just sends prosecutors.

780
00:55:57,069 --> 00:56:03,659
Rym: they successfully prosecuted 736 people based on data from this for jitsu software.

781
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:18,530
Scott: This is why we probably Believe, you know at the time they believed that there was widespread, you know Whoever was there believed there was this widespread crime happening.

782
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,201
Scott: and just like people are led to believe that there's like things like widespread voter Fraud.

783
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:26,435
Rym: Yeah, but it's fascinating that you can have this happen when there literally wasn't any crime.

784
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:32,280
Rym: There was no evidence of crime Software but people believe that there is widespread.

785
00:56:33,721 --> 00:56:39,783
Scott: In this case though the government believed the conspiracy instead of the people or maybe the people and the government believed it and then bad Things happen

786
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:41,170
Rym: and it doesn't get a broader for

787
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:48,800
Scott: slightly lucky that you know We were able to at least you know, we had a government that part parts of it believed in parts of it didn't write.

788
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:54,027
Rym: so now we've been talking about this topic on GeekNights for over 16 years.

789
00:56:54,528 --> 00:57:03,850
Rym: the simple fact that Globally no government and no judicial system is capable of interacting with even the most basic of digital crime.

790
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:05,558
Rym: Yes, like.

791
00:57:05,578 --> 00:57:07,829
Rym: they just can't in any way deal with it.

792
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:21,170
Rym: Like either they can't prosecute people who clearly did a crime or they just prosecute random people who didn't commit a crime Like it's just all over the place Mm-hmm In some let's see skipping ahead.

793
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:22,844
Rym: So there's a bunch of news.

794
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:28,230
Rym: you probably saw Elon Musk's stupid tunnel, which is clearly like unsafe and pathetic.

795
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:30,074
Rym: I guess you didn't.

796
00:57:30,094 --> 00:57:34,876
Rym: Scott didn't even notice that it was in the news because there was like a tour of it and they were Like driving cars.

797
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:36,284
Scott: Yeah, I thought I mean I did see.

798
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:37,430
Scott: I thought it was just yeah.

799
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:43,370
Scott: Elon Musk announces another evil scheme and shows off, you know an evil villain presentation yet again.

800
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:47,401
Scott: I didn't think it actually happened Until Rym mentioned that it actually.

801
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:48,750
Scott: yeah, he actually did dig the tunnel.

802
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:49,332
Rym: They drove.

803
00:57:49,393 --> 00:57:56,422
Rym: so they drove that they drove a car through the tunnel and just to summarize you can go read This was dunked on appropriately by people who know better.

804
00:57:56,944 --> 00:58:00,589
Rym: one the tunnels so narrow You probably couldn't even get out of the car if it had a problem.

805
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:04,149
Rym: Two the cars can't self-drive through it as far as anyone is said.

806
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:10,281
Rym: Three if if anything happens in the tunnel, basically everyone in the tunnel dies Like there's no way to get an emergency vehicle in there.

807
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:11,970
Scott: I don't understand what the deal is.

808
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:18,210
Rym: It's just I mean we have like just a tunnel that's shittier than like any of the tunnels from a hundred years ago under Manhattan.

809
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:19,817
Scott: It's like we have tunnels.

810
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,164
Scott: tunnels are not a new invention.

811
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:21,726
Scott: We have them.

812
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:22,530
Scott: We know how to build them.

813
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:30,128
Rym: It's the tech bros who keep saying we can solve the housing crisis by making cheaper to build houses.

814
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:33,903
Rym: like House building is literally the least difficult part.

815
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,670
Scott: We have empty houses.

816
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,910
Scott: There's more empty houses than there are homeless.

817
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,858
Scott: Yeah, like digging the tunnel.

818
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:42,810
Scott: Just buy them the houses give the houses to the people.

819
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:44,502
Scott: It's not a matter of building the house.

820
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,630
Scott: Just give them the house.

821
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,406
Scott: That's already there.

822
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,217
Rym: Same thing with like Elon Musk and his stupid hyperloop.

823
00:58:49,498 --> 00:58:54,150
Rym: digging tunnels is actually one of the things humans are super fucking good at.

824
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:55,815
Rym: We can dig tunnels.

825
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,078
Scott: We have civil engineers.

826
00:58:57,339 --> 00:59:00,950
Rym: Yeah, you know digging the tunnel is not the reason why we don't have enough tunnels.

827
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:03,850
Rym: There is one reason why our governments don't build mass transit.

828
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:10,394
Scott: Yeah, come why don't you just come and take whatever money you spent on that tunnel and give it to us and we'll repair our Tunnel to New Jersey.

829
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:10,976
Scott: Yep.

830
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:16,397
Scott: Not that I want to go to New Jersey or I want to have New Jersey coming here But yeah, probably fix that tunnel.

831
00:59:16,778 --> 00:59:21,865
Rym: granted if the Republicans in New Jersey hadn't blocked it our seven train The subway would have gone to New Jersey.

832
00:59:23,252 --> 00:59:26,733
Rym: Instead it doesn't and now there's no way to make it go there Yep.

833
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:34,150
Rym: Well a minor aside I know we've talked about how you can't get video cards because of these stupid coins and NFTs which are all just scams.

834
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:41,469
Rym: but This these shortages are starting to expand and this is gonna get way worse before it gets better.

835
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,220
Rym: Silicone is getting under short supply.

836
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,090
Rym: chips are getting in short supply.

837
00:59:46,451 --> 01:00:01,149
Rym: We're getting to the point to where multiple car manufacturers have said they're cutting down production of cars Solely because they can't get like the basic chips They need to make these cars and it seems to be solely due to the demand from cryptocurrency.

838
01:00:01,189 --> 01:00:01,550
Rym: bullshit.

839
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:07,970
Rym: Yep I mean Disrupting hospital supplies like this is gonna be a problem.

840
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:13,850
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, this is yet another argument and just in you know in you know, we learned in school, right?

841
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,939
Scott: It's like, uh, you know communism the USSR.

842
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:23,474
Scott: They couldn't manage, you know their own economy, you know by hand Capitalism is not doing much better Right.

843
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,359
Scott: Yeah capitalism.

844
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:25,083
Scott: It's like, okay.

845
01:00:25,123 --> 01:00:32,181
Scott: Well, we'll let the market decide Instead of making the useful shit We actually need because it made that you're making.

846
01:00:32,221 --> 01:00:34,150
Scott: that other shit makes numbers go up by scams.

847
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:35,453
Rym: Market decided.

848
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:44,801
Rym: the best analogy for cryptocurrency at this point is remember in Captain Planet where there'd be a villain who had a machine that Basically just pumped out pollution and generated money.

849
01:00:45,202 --> 01:00:48,154
Rym: That is basically what cryptocurrencies are Pretty much.

850
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:51,410
Rym: Yeah, like it's a machine that just makes it doesn't even generate money.

851
01:00:51,511 --> 01:01:00,390
Scott: It just vacuums up money from suckers From suckers and blows them into the wallet of the evil versus and it burns down rainforests in the process.

852
01:01:01,275 --> 01:01:01,879
Scott: yeah, pretty much.

853
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:10,808
Rym: but like I Think these shortages are just going to get worse and worse and worse for possibly years to come.

854
01:01:10,828 --> 01:01:14,982
Rym: like I Don't think you're gonna be able to build computers soon.

855
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:17,694
Rym: the way this is going like I don't know I've heard.

856
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:20,790
Scott: I've heard some people say it'll last six more months.

857
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,303
Scott: I've heard some people say it'll last into next year.

858
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:24,530
Scott: Well, here's the problem.

859
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,045
Scott: It's gonna have to be hard to prognosticate because there are is.

860
01:01:28,086 --> 01:01:29,050
Scott: that's why no one agrees.

861
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:44,450
Rym: There are legitimate companies who are investing in this shit now Partly because it makes such high returns that that risk is acceptable to them Mmm, which is adding further legitimization which gets even more suckers to think it's gonna be a longer play.

862
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:48,968
Rym: So, I don't know when it's gonna crash.

863
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:53,079
Rym: I Think it's gonna last longer than people expect.

864
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,290
Rym: I think the crash is gonna be way worse than people expect.

865
01:01:56,491 --> 01:01:58,444
Scott: Yeah, the higher you go the farther you fall.

866
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,699
Rym: Yep Anyway, and some others stay down here.

867
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,122
Scott: Trust me.

868
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:02,564
Scott: It's safer.

869
01:02:02,805 --> 01:02:03,730
Rym: This is super fun.

870
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:08,570
Rym: So signal which there are some problems with the signal company that I don't want to get into right now.

871
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,136
Rym: Like they're doing some cryptocurrency now.

872
01:02:10,156 --> 01:02:13,470
Scott: I couldn't understand the know than whatever nonsense was going on with them.

873
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:24,495
Rym: Yeah, but one thing about signal is that it is one of the few Properly end-to-end encrypted networks out there and if you like it like I use it for actually secure communication Like.

874
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:25,707
Rym: that's how I would endorse it.

875
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:38,690
Rym: however, uh signal Did something really cool recently and basically fucked up another company Celebrite who basically exists to hack into like iPhones, right?

876
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:48,403
Scott: So for example there, you know, if you are in the United States mostly but also other countries, right and you commit some crime And let's pretend everything's hunky-dory you committed a crime.

877
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:50,590
Scott: they get a warrant, right?

878
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,251
Scott: Yeah, you know.

879
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:56,730
Rym: they come in and take our iPhone that probably has the all the crime information on it exactly.

880
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,034
Scott: They seize your phone.

881
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,357
Scott: They seize your computers.

882
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:02,185
Scott: They seize all your digital things legally, right?

883
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:04,150
Scott: You you know, they have warrants.

884
01:03:04,272 --> 01:03:05,449
Scott: They're gonna investigate them.

885
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:09,215
Scott: You know the FBI is common right and They need to collect.

886
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:13,630
Scott: basically what they do is they scan all the storage on all of your devices.

887
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:21,222
Scott: that's what they're interested in and to and they're looking at all your files and To see if there's evidence to relate to the crimes you committed.

888
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,230
Scott: they can find things like the web browser history.

889
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:30,154
Scott: You know your documents, you know, whatever right whatever is on your computer your child porn that you shouldn't have because you're right But you're.

890
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:31,428
Scott: this is for criminals, right?

891
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:37,785
Scott: So what they do is they can't just you know, open up windows and start browsing.

892
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:38,227
Scott: who knows?

893
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:44,364
Scott: first of all a Well, maybe then someone could say you made that file you put that child porn there.

894
01:03:44,384 --> 01:03:49,370
Rym: right computer forensics is a difficult Like it's like any other forensics.

895
01:03:49,512 --> 01:03:50,889
Rym: It's method you try to use.

896
01:03:51,472 --> 01:03:54,023
Scott: You try to log in and maybe I have you know my iPhone.

897
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:57,190
Scott: if you try to log in and fail ten times It'll erase itself, right?

898
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:59,189
Scott: You can't just go about it normal way.

899
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:08,109
Rym: think about the old story that no one actually had but everyone dreamed about of the Computer where you hit a button and thermite destroys all your hard drives from the 90s exactly exactly.

900
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:10,335
Scott: So You need to.

901
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:22,029
Scott: if you're gonna collect evidence and submit it in court You need to do it in a court legally approved way which is with certain software that has been approved and you know checked out by the government.

902
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:27,210
Scott: and One of the most pretty much the most popular was a thing called celebrate which is the company makes this thing.

903
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,086
Scott: I think it's an Israeli company and they have software that can help.

904
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:34,398
Scott: law enforcement would buy the software right.

905
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:44,730
Scott: take devices from people and You know extract the the storage the data from the storage devices in a way that is admissible in court legally.

906
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:48,478
Scott: and so what signal did?

907
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:57,483
Scott: is they said hey the celebrate thing itself is You know for being a computer security company that made it isn't so secure is it?

908
01:04:58,025 --> 01:05:04,061
Scott: and they basically put a file On the storage device for celebrate to find.

909
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:10,059
Scott: and when celebrate found that file Celebrate itself was then, you know exploited.

910
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,729
Rym: that is some ghost in the shell fun nonsense right there.

911
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:18,610
Scott: So you could make your computer such that if sella, you know celebrate is insecure.

912
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:31,012
Scott: therefore if you celebrate Comes and tries to read all the data off your hard drive Your hard drive base is a booby trap that catches only celebrate and messes it up if it tries to read your hard drive Signal.

913
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:36,970
Scott: the engineers there created a proof of concept for this that totally worked and that's and they announced it.

914
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:43,750
Rym: Like you go read all this and watch their videos because they also say they found some Apple copyright violations in celebrate software.

915
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:44,988
Scott: I believe it.

916
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:50,210
Rym: They found some MSI installers like digitally signed by Apple and some other nonsense in there.

917
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,349
Rym: The the story is pretty in-depth and you can go as deep into this as you want.

918
01:05:55,012 --> 01:06:02,470
Rym: But I think this is just fascinating because in the end like my opinion on this is that Encryption is necessary.

919
01:06:02,731 --> 01:06:18,814
Rym: Backdoors in encryption are unethical and if a police organization or a government Even if they have a legitimate interest in this information the theoretical They're trying to hack into the terrorist cell phone to figure out where they put the bomb Even in that case.

920
01:06:19,636 --> 01:06:28,570
Rym: I don't think any technology company should in any way be required To make it easy or possible to compromise the security of their devices.

921
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:39,684
Scott: Yeah, if it mean if it happens to be possible, you know on purpose it was never secure in the first place Exactly, but if it's brief you made a really secure device, you should be a allowed to.

922
01:06:39,805 --> 01:06:41,570
Scott: let's say let's forget about computers, right?

923
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:47,132
Scott: Let's say I actually make a lock and that lock is truly a Indestructible.

924
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:49,520
Scott: it's made of adamantium wolverines adamantium.

925
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,086
Scott: You can't break it and be.

926
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:52,230
Scott: it's such a good lock.

927
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,675
Scott: Even lock picking lawyer can't open it.

928
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:56,144
Scott: best lock in the universe unpickable.

929
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:57,830
Scott: Obviously, that's impossible.

930
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,401
Scott: Let's just pretend right that that lock exists and it's.

931
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:04,671
Scott: it's locking a safe and the whole safe is made of adamantium There's.

932
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:05,193
Scott: no you can't.

933
01:07:05,214 --> 01:07:08,188
Rym: there was an episode of the old Superman live-action show that was about this.

934
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:11,428
Scott: actually Yeah, even if you nuke it you won't open, right?

935
01:07:12,371 --> 01:07:17,510
Scott: The only way to open it is legit way to open it, which is a combination that the criminal knows, right?

936
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,238
Scott: It's like well tough shit.

937
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:23,782
Scott: It's like too bad That's you're not opening it.

938
01:07:23,984 --> 01:07:27,837
Rym: Yeah Legitimate interest.

939
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:35,697
Rym: do actual Investigatory work like get a warrant tap the wiretap key loggers Like there's a lot of traditional ways.

940
01:07:35,797 --> 01:07:36,841
Scott: find some other evidence.

941
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:38,910
Scott: if you can't get that evidence find some other evidence.

942
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:44,010
Scott: Yeah, I think this lazy way out of demanding someone, you know open they're safe for you if they don't want to write.

943
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,102
Scott: All right, one thing I got it.

944
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:47,886
Scott: we got to talk about this.

945
01:07:47,986 --> 01:07:52,323
Scott: one news, yep So the Linux kernel, you know, it's an open source project.

946
01:07:52,544 --> 01:07:53,870
Rym: Oh, yeah this one contribute.

947
01:07:55,191 --> 01:07:58,541
Scott: So somebody sent in some patches and the Linux kernel.

948
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:01,350
Scott: people looked at those patches and we're like what the fuck is this nonsense?

949
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:08,290
Scott: And then somebody linked to this published academic paper from the University of Minnesota where what they were researching?

950
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:13,268
Scott: They were researching the idea that hey, what could you?

951
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:19,960
Scott: Submit patches to an open source project Right and get them accepted and merged.

952
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:27,308
Scott: but they also contained, you know security holes right, but the people who were accepting the patches didn't notice.

953
01:08:27,328 --> 01:08:34,850
Scott: and Then you come along later and now exploit the security vulnerability that you got injected into the open source project.

954
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:37,420
Scott: Yeah, because the open source project didn't notice because you were.

955
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,667
Scott: so the patch you sent was so clever, right?

956
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,314
Scott: They're researching like that.

957
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:42,256
Scott: Could this be done?

958
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:43,139
Scott: Can you do it?

959
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:43,680
Scott: Etc.

960
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:46,749
Scott: And there's a whole paper they published about, you know doing this.

961
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:54,769
Scott: So they saw this suspicious patch come in and they noticed that it was from someone at University of Minnesota.

962
01:08:54,790 --> 01:09:00,170
Scott: and Then someone linked to that paper and suddenly the whole kernel is like what are you guys?

963
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,870
Scott: You know what the fuck you doing here trying to see right?

964
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:11,214
Scott: It's like they were trying to research whether you could sneak stuff in and lo and behold they couldn't sneak one past They couldn't get it in there.

965
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:25,202
Scott: So the response of the Linux kernel people, you know, Greg Crowe Hartman mostly was hey Not only are we not accepting your patches the University of Minnesota is no longer allowed to send us any patches We'll just block you right?

966
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:26,229
Scott: We don't care what you send us.

967
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:38,828
Scott: we're not accepting it because you can't be trusted and we're gonna go back through the whole Linux kernel and find anything you ever submitted and We're gonna check it all out and we're gonna remove Most if not all of anything you've ever contributed because you can't be trusted.

968
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:42,518
Rym: and I find it hard to fault their response.

969
01:09:43,381 --> 01:09:46,752
Scott: and they sent them a list and they said if you want to if you want to Undo your band.

970
01:09:46,773 --> 01:09:58,590
Scott: He has a list of things that you can do to undo your band, right and the University of Minnesota The people there they sent an open letter on the kernel mailing list and they said we're sorry we fucked up.

971
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:08,361
Scott: we've learned, you know, basically right that sort of letter yeah, and Greg's response to that was We sent you a list of things you can do to get on band.

972
01:10:08,381 --> 01:10:10,310
Scott: You haven't done the things on the list.

973
01:10:10,894 --> 01:10:11,801
Scott: I don't really give a shit.

974
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:12,969
Scott: what you write in your own letter.

975
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:21,212
Scott: Go fuck yourself do the things on the list or get the fuck out of my face in in so many words much fewer words Than I used.

976
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:22,898
Rym: I'm pretty cool with this letter.

977
01:10:22,938 --> 01:10:33,048
Rym: honestly on one hand like all open source Software has to be vigilant for this kind of thing because clearly other people are gonna try to do this all the time.

978
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:44,138
Scott: Yeah, and actually try to put you have a widely, you know, if you have a project that's not used widely then who's gonna bother Just and try to submit you a pull request.

979
01:10:44,178 --> 01:10:45,903
Scott: That's got some shady biz in it.

980
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:46,485
Scott: Why would they?

981
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:56,716
Scott: that's barely gonna affect anything but Unless you yourself are using it and you're a high-value target on your own, but if you have a popular open source project Yeah, you got to be on the lookout.

982
01:10:56,777 --> 01:11:06,149
Scott: every single patch has to be you know security reviewed in some way To look out for any sort of intent unintentional shady biz or intentional shady biz.

983
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:17,759
Scott: And if you get word right in the community that for example University of Minnesota is submitting shady patches If you're running an open source project, it's public contributions.

984
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,249
Scott: search your commit history for anything of at umn.edu.

985
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:24,464
Scott: I think that's the that might not be the right one.

986
01:11:24,484 --> 01:11:24,966
Scott: Just check it.

987
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:34,730
Rym: Yeah, and If you see any Inspect those patches real closely or revert them, but I guess I don't fault the university for doing this kind of research.

988
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:40,270
Rym: I also don't fault the open source community for deciding to take punitive measures against them.

989
01:11:41,492 --> 01:11:44,843
Rym: It seems like it was a rational like appropriate escalation in this case.

990
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:50,547
Scott: I Think if you do I think they went there about the research right like the wrong way, right?

991
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:54,969
Rym: Research is a debate we could have here.

992
01:11:56,131 --> 01:12:00,370
Scott: It's like it's one thing to be like, yes, this is something that should be researched, right?

993
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:06,636
Scott: You know are you know, what percentage of open source people do have their eyes open and don't is something information We should know right?

994
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:08,649
Scott: we should raise people's awareness about this.

995
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:18,490
Scott: So the open source project maintainers are on the lookout But you shouldn't actually get actual security holes into the Linux kernel that is on all these computers around the world.

996
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:20,335
Rym: Well, I wasn't wasn't clear.

997
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:27,410
Rym: the article I read is if there were vulnerabilities in the specific patches they put forth They think they're you know, regardless.

998
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:29,055
Rym: Also, here's another thing.

999
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,563
Rym: I don't think there's no cry.

1000
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:32,686
Rym: I mean, it's open source software.

1001
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:37,277
Rym: I could submit anything Sure, unless I exploit that.

1002
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:39,244
Scott: but if you're being all you're being underhanded, right?

1003
01:12:39,264 --> 01:12:41,230
Scott: You're lying about what you're submitting, right?

1004
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,662
Rym: You know, yeah, but arguably it's not.

1005
01:12:43,703 --> 01:12:48,850
Scott: it's not illegal to lie It's not illegal to lie, but it's morally wrong.

1006
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:56,674
Rym: But what if the patchy got in and then then the university was able to say look the Linux kernel is easily compromised and we Just compromised it.

1007
01:12:56,934 --> 01:12:57,838
Rym: Here's what we submitted.

1008
01:12:57,918 --> 01:12:58,681
Rym: Please back it out.

1009
01:12:58,741 --> 01:12:59,885
Rym: This is a global crisis now.

1010
01:13:00,447 --> 01:13:01,070
Scott: They didn't do that.

1011
01:13:01,391 --> 01:13:02,977
Scott: Yeah, and also you should.

1012
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:04,363
Scott: you know you you could.

1013
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:10,750
Scott: what you could have done is you could have you know Submitted it seen what the comments were before it got merged and then you would stop it before they merged it.

1014
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,215
Scott: You'd be like, hey, I actually don't merge that.

1015
01:13:12,276 --> 01:13:16,050
Rym: Well, I would say the motive issues of the researchers are irrelevant.

1016
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:17,257
Scott: They've been doing this for years.

1017
01:13:17,297 --> 01:13:18,706
Scott: This isn't a new thing, right?

1018
01:13:18,726 --> 01:13:19,310
Scott: They're going back.

1019
01:13:19,673 --> 01:13:21,490
Rym: I'm saying what the researchers did is irrelevant.

1020
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:24,049
Scott: Let those all those patches sit in there for all these years.

1021
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:34,132
Rym: And the reason I say that is that an open source system is obligated to protect itself and it has done just that Like.

1022
01:13:34,152 --> 01:13:34,955
Rym: here is the.

1023
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:35,999
Rym: you know, we always talk about how.

1024
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,090
Rym: there's no difference between being popular and being denial-of-service.

1025
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,366
Rym: So in this case There's no difference between a hacker trying to fuck with you and some researchers at a university.

1026
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:46,739
Rym: in both cases Your response should be the same.

1027
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:48,389
Rym: It is a threat and you neutralize the threat.

1028
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:50,445
Scott: Yeah, they neutralized it.

1029
01:13:50,546 --> 01:14:00,130
Rym: So Let's see still we've got on pretty long So I think I'll blow through a few things really quickly and then that'll be gone more round up.

1030
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:01,392
Scott: All right, what you get?

1031
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,543
Rym: so a back on cars being shitty.

1032
01:14:05,226 --> 01:14:08,135
Rym: a Tesla crashed Burned for four hours.

1033
01:14:08,196 --> 01:14:12,330
Rym: The fire department was unable to put the fire out and it killed two people in, Texas.

1034
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:19,430
Rym: Upon investigating this charred Ruin of death they discovered that there was no one in the driver's seat.

1035
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:26,084
Rym: the two people who were in the car had told this Tesla to drive and had climbed into the backseat and Then the car killed them.

1036
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,080
Scott: Well a how is a car street-legal if you can't put the fire out.

1037
01:14:31,662 --> 01:14:34,088
Rym: Uh, yeah, that's a big problem with electric cars.

1038
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:40,623
Scott: actually and be Obviously, why was the car able to continue driving when no one is?

1039
01:14:40,783 --> 01:14:48,249
Rym: obviously because Tesla doesn't actually want to enforce the rule that says there has to be a driver sitting in the seat ready to take over at any time.

1040
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:50,258
Scott: because If they did that why you would want?

1041
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,230
Scott: you want news stories about your car crashing and sitting on fire.

1042
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,112
Scott: Well, I think

1043
01:14:54,133 --> 01:15:10,750
Rym: they know that none of the people I was about to use a pejorative term for these people who are buying Tesla's that are self-driving would actually buy them if They couldn't just tell the car to drive because it turns out that self-driving software is not nearly as versatile as they want it to be.

1044
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:14,630
Rym: They probably wouldn't buy the car if they couldn't disable the safety checks.

1045
01:15:15,574 --> 01:15:21,219
Scott: I guess at least it will only kill people who buy Tesla's Oh and Crash into somebody else.

1046
01:15:21,259 --> 01:15:22,586
Scott: That's why it shouldn't be street-legal.

1047
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:37,589
Rym: That's why yep I self-driving car technology is far more advanced than people realize in some regards for like freeway driving Limited types of environments like truck cars or certain certain parking situations automatic parking.

1048
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:51,420
Rym: One could argue that it should be mandated for all those situations but the problem is Even if it is actually better in those circumstances Let's forget all the circumstances where it's obviously not better and we could mandate that every car has it.

1049
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:57,169
Rym: Humans will still misuse that technology and not actually pay attention.

1050
01:15:57,913 --> 01:16:00,042
Scott: We have technology as good as it is.

1051
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,810
Scott: It's still nowhere near good enough.

1052
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:10,450
Scott: It's like light years ahead of human driving in certain situations But it's light years behind where it needs to be to just drive you and you can take a nap.

1053
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:17,233
Rym: I mean there is the problem where we accept the fact that a lot of humans are worse at driving than even like the shitty Tesla self-driving.

1054
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:22,610
Rym: they shouldn't be allowed to drive they shouldn't but in practice they are because our entire society is built around these guys.

1055
01:16:23,216 --> 01:16:26,197
Scott: Yes What you really care about this whole topic?

1056
01:16:26,217 --> 01:16:28,164
Scott: There's another podcast called the war on cars.

1057
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:29,710
Scott: read listen to that podcast instead.

1058
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:37,846
Rym: But it is just very telling that Tesla for all its advanced technology could Trivially detect if there is no one in the front seat.

1059
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:38,490
Rym: and yet it does.

1060
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:50,238
Scott: Yeah even even like a super old like The last car that I was in right had a passenger side airbag and there's a light that would tell you whether the passenger side Airbag was enabled or disabled.

1061
01:16:50,298 --> 01:16:52,104
Scott: I don't know why they had a light for that, but they did.

1062
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:56,776
Rym: dude and me I Drove a car Important and I rented.

1063
01:16:56,957 --> 01:17:01,279
Rym: I rented a super fancy car because they didn't have anything else So they gave me the fancy card.

1064
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,086
Rym: I paid nothing for it.

1065
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:03,976
Rym: Jokes on you.

1066
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:06,730
Rym: I dropped it off in like Leroy, New York.

1067
01:17:06,891 --> 01:17:08,238
Rym: Good luck getting someone to rent it there.

1068
01:17:08,258 --> 01:17:20,510
Rym: the point is thousand dollars a day But this car had stuff in it where while I was driving It would play tones if it detected that I was not sufficiently paying attention to the road.

1069
01:17:20,752 --> 01:17:22,668
Rym: It was looking at my eyes the whole time.

1070
01:17:23,433 --> 01:17:25,203
Scott: But that point is this car is older.

1071
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:31,730
Scott: car would simply Know by the weight of whatever was sitting in the passenger seat whether that airbag should be enabled or disabled.

1072
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:33,215
Scott: Why doesn't the Tesla?

1073
01:17:33,235 --> 01:17:37,930
Scott: I mean, yeah, it can be fooled by someone putting like a bag of rocks in the driver's seat.

1074
01:17:38,037 --> 01:17:40,056
Rym: Yeah But make it make it at least hard to.

1075
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:45,736
Scott: they don't have that and not only do they not have the industry standard very easy Weight sensor.

1076
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:46,321
Scott: that would.

1077
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:47,610
Scott: it could just do it, right?

1078
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,695
Scott: At least it's one more thing.

1079
01:17:48,755 --> 01:17:54,922
Scott: Someone has to do to get the car to drive without a person behind the wheel But they refuse to put it in.

1080
01:17:54,982 --> 01:17:55,547
Scott: it's like fucking.

1081
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,688
Scott: why Why not?

1082
01:17:58,654 --> 01:17:59,880
Scott: The car is already expensive.

1083
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,986
Scott: Just put the thing in the weight sensor and the driver's seat So it won't enable if there's no one sitting there.

1084
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:08,330
Rym: Come on Yep but like if these are the fancy technologically advanced cars.

1085
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:15,750
Rym: Technology already exists to determine if a human being is paying attention to the road and they're not doing that doing basically nothing.

1086
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:22,162
Rym: I think Tesla the company should be directly culpable for basically murder in this case.

1087
01:18:22,924 --> 01:18:37,490
Rym: I Now the humans who died are also culpable for actively Circumventing the safety measures, but yeah, we're lucky that they didn't hurt anyone else and only got themselves those two people.

1088
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,824
Rym: And Tesla the company is also culpable.

1089
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:47,406
Scott: Yes You know and who knows like the burning batteries the you know, the firefighters might have gotten.

1090
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:48,510
Scott: I had to breathe some shit in.

1091
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:56,687
Rym: Firefighters have been saying that electric cars aren't ready for a long time and they have yet to be proven wrong in my mind.

1092
01:18:58,331 --> 01:18:58,914
Scott: Yep, exactly.

1093
01:18:58,974 --> 01:19:00,562
Rym: There's a lot of not to get into it.

1094
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:01,326
Rym: There's a lot of.

1095
01:19:01,406 --> 01:19:05,458
Rym: you know, I grew up My dad was a fireman so like I know how to use the jaws of life.

1096
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:10,616
Rym: jaws of life could kill you if you use them on an electric car and Don't know where you're not allowed to cut.

1097
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:15,088
Rym: some of those wires are in non obvious places with a lot of voltage Yep.

1098
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:18,878
Rym: so Well, this is one more big thing.

1099
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:20,788
Rym: There's so many big things recently to talk about.

1100
01:19:21,471 --> 01:19:28,730
Rym: Roku is currently warning its YouTube TV customers that YouTube TV could just stop working anytime because Google is a monopoly.

1101
01:19:29,212 --> 01:19:33,606
Rym: YouTube is now fighting back saying oh, we're not acting in good faith or in bad faith.

1102
01:19:33,866 --> 01:19:34,970
Rym: You're acting in bad faith.

1103
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:39,090
Rym: This is there's a big fight going on between Google and Roku right now.

1104
01:19:41,392 --> 01:19:43,281
Scott: They're probably both bad in this situation.

1105
01:19:43,342 --> 01:19:44,930
Scott: who knows who's on the right side of things?

1106
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,770
Scott: But the point is is that do not get dedicated streaming device.

1107
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:54,450
Rym: Always live in arbitrary TVs smart TVs.

1108
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:56,799
Scott: they're always limited to whichever app.

1109
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:04,230
Scott: some businesses agree that will let you use the HTPC is the only way you need to get a real computer.

1110
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:10,960
Scott: Even if you don't want to play games, you can just get a Mac Mini Otherwise PC and it will do everything.

1111
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,696
Scott: because every no one has their service not available on Windows.

1112
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:24,670
Scott: right Netflix YouTube TV just straight-up youtube.com Hulu HBO max everything is on just plain old Microsoft.

1113
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:26,735
Rym: Yeah, I do nothing.

1114
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:32,090
Rym: It can't do I worryingly do believe especially considering the computers are not a thing for most people anymore.

1115
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:38,470
Rym: There will come a time when some of these services only have an app and there is no other way to access their content.

1116
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:41,218
Scott: It is possible that that will have.

1117
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:53,119
Rym: I think the death of the desktop PC and the death of the laptop for Non-professional users is going to lead us to that very bad place down the road, but I don't even Right, but even like everyone's phone, right?

1118
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,725
Scott: Cuz some people have iPhones some people enter.

1119
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:56,269
Scott: the common factor is still the web.

1120
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:59,479
Scott: Everyone's got a web app right the web browser.

1121
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,129
Scott: So all these things, you know, you they work on the web.

1122
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:07,770
Scott: So as long as that's remain as long as the web remains the thing then we're okay.

1123
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:12,390
Scott: Yeah, but I remember way back with a web browser to connect to your TV.

1124
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:23,350
Rym: We were trying to watch YouTube videos at a friend's house and they had an app on their streaming device and we found that there Were a lot of YouTube videos mostly ones that had a copyright thing where they were not taken down.

1125
01:21:23,431 --> 01:21:26,977
Rym: But like the monetization was weird Where they just wouldn't show up.

1126
01:21:27,177 --> 01:21:33,017
Scott: if you search for those videos and the streaming ad you went to your phone and you found the Video, but you couldn't find it when using the yup.

1127
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:35,586
Rym: I've run into that many times in my life.

1128
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:42,921
Scott: that specific thing with YouTube Specifically, yep To use a real device for your TV.

1129
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,746
Scott: Don't use any of these roku's or anything.

1130
01:21:44,766 --> 01:22:03,050
Rym: speaking of those roku's and anything you might have seen this a little while ago, but there this is a insider like announcement about some venue technology that Warner Brothers Sony Paramount Visio CBS Universal seemed to have developed together and it is a Set-top streaming device, you know.

1131
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,294
Rym: The thing we just said you shouldn't use.

1132
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:16,208
Rym: but it's killer app is that you can give exclusive special content through it Because it has cameras facing the audience and you have to buy a ticket for every individual human who is in the room watching that thing.

1133
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,329
Rym: This is obviously dystopian bullshit.

1134
01:22:20,212 --> 01:22:28,974
Rym: yeah, it's also not clear if this will actually get made and released to the public because patents on things like this have definitely Come about before.

1135
01:22:29,395 --> 01:22:33,390
Rym: but in practice no one actually made devices that did this ridiculous nonsense.

1136
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:35,098
Rym: But this is just one of those.

1137
01:22:35,178 --> 01:22:37,629
Rym: I got further along than a lot of those other ones.

1138
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:42,670
Scott: No, it's just one of those ideas that people have that make you know executives all horny.

1139
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:47,150
Rym: Well, because the customer is not you the person trying to watch content in your exactly.

1140
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,454
Scott: You don't want this.

1141
01:22:48,474 --> 01:22:52,025
Rym: the customer is like a company that wants to be able to sell pay-per-view.

1142
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:53,670
Rym: where they get to they get a cut.

1143
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:56,558
Scott: Yeah, are you telling a movie executive?

1144
01:22:56,578 --> 01:23:04,530
Scott: hey, you know, we can make a technology where you know If someone shows a movie in their house and there's ten people sitting there will can charge them ten times as much.

1145
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,957
Scott: They're like, oh, yes do that.

1146
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,425
Scott: They just want they're just a greedy guy.

1147
01:23:07,445 --> 01:23:08,270
Rym: You know what they're mad about.

1148
01:23:08,511 --> 01:23:12,242
Rym: Remember way back there was that disastrous round a Rousey fight.

1149
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:18,549
Rym: one friend of ours paid for the PPV And we all watched it like 30 of us on the HTPC.

1150
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:20,575
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

1151
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:26,690
Scott: Um, so that's you know, they're they're excited for that, you know Someone came up with this idea and sold it to them.

1152
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:27,855
Scott: It got money from them.

1153
01:23:28,176 --> 01:23:31,088
Scott: that person now doesn't even care if this thing really comes to be or works.

1154
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:35,610
Scott: They're just like hey, I got rich people to give me money because I had an idea that makes them excited.

1155
01:23:36,072 --> 01:23:44,590
Scott: Right, but ideas that make normal people excited don't get funding and you know They have to actually make it all the way to market first right to get a pile of money.

1156
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:46,570
Scott: Yeah, because that's how our capitalism works.

1157
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:49,438
Scott: So yeah I'm not too worried about this becoming real.

1158
01:23:49,498 --> 01:23:54,637
Scott: and if you look at the history things like divics the DVDs that Disintegrated after you watched them one time or whatever.

1159
01:23:54,657 --> 01:23:56,743
Scott: Yeah, those did not work out very well.

1160
01:23:56,764 --> 01:24:00,532
Rym: divics not to be confused with divics Exactly.

1161
01:24:00,552 --> 01:24:06,190
Rym: I don't think I don't think anyone younger than us has ever even heard of the original divics because it died its rightful death.

1162
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:10,850
Scott: Good, but yeah, they made DVDs and a special DVD players.

1163
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:18,440
Scott: We could watch the movie once and the idea was that like hey, we'll sell people DVDs for cheap But then they can only watch it once and then we will sell more.

1164
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,710
Scott: right is like an idea that made movie executives really excited.

1165
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:23,677
Scott: No consumer wanted that ever.

1166
01:24:24,078 --> 01:24:27,690
Scott: they actually did sell them in circuit city and they were complete bullshit and they failed.

1167
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:31,830
Rym: Everyone I knew who got one got it to hack it in some fashion.

1168
01:24:32,612 --> 01:24:34,659
Scott: Yeah, and this is this is the same kind of idea.

1169
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:37,909
Scott: where it's like if someone actually makes this it will just fail miserably.

1170
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:44,407
Scott: The one Avenue I could see this maybe coming to fruition is not in the home because who?

1171
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:45,570
Scott: no one's gonna buy it, right?

1172
01:24:47,306 --> 01:24:50,901
Scott: is The pay-per-views that happen in bars and such?

1173
01:24:50,941 --> 01:25:00,189
Scott: where right now bars have to buy like these licenses Like special pay-per-view things when they want to show like a boxing match or a Super Bowl or whatever They're in their bar, right?

1174
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,259
Scott: And there's already an existing system around that.

1175
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:12,770
Scott: but if somebody had the ability To count how many people were in the bar and send that information to some home base, right?

1176
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:30,040
Scott: I mean obviously they're already bars and other places that are pirating those that's not going to change Obviously, but the places that are doing it legitimately and are currently buying into the system could be forced to Have some sort of technology not hack it right.

1177
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:39,451
Scott: someone comes to inspect it or who knows what right and then They could get charged more if the bar is more crowded during the Super Bowl than if one person come Yeah,

1178
01:25:39,691 --> 01:25:40,113
Rym: which could

1179
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:44,749
Scott: like actually be advantageous to the bar instead of paying the flat fee based on like their?

1180
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:46,696
Rym: well I'm pretty sure whatever.

1181
01:25:46,736 --> 01:25:49,005
Scott: the only one person came to my bar for the fight.

1182
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:51,053
Scott: I'm not paying you Right, whatever.

1183
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:56,295
Rym: the end of charging the bars would magically be the same or slightly more than what they're paying with The current rates is what I would.

1184
01:25:56,456 --> 01:25:57,520
Scott: probably it wouldn't be too.

1185
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,584
Scott: probably it would not be.

1186
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:04,313
Rym: I just took a class on how to do pricing in the like the current modern world and Yeah, it would cost.

1187
01:26:04,353 --> 01:26:05,697
Rym: the same is what I would suspect.

1188
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:09,650
Scott: but it could also give the the bars perhaps more features, right?

1189
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:10,948
Scott: Like hey, you got a bar.

1190
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:20,523
Rym: We're gonna let you show a movie that came out fucking but we're gonna collect the Demographic information to the people who watched it in your bar and spy on you with surveillance cap.

1191
01:26:20,563 --> 01:26:22,810
Scott: exactly you charge a cover fee.

1192
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:27,950
Scott: We'll count the number of people in your bar and we're gonna take half your cover and we'll know you're not lying about the cover.

1193
01:26:28,051 --> 01:26:32,615
Rym: Now we know the gender race Economic income.

1194
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:37,132
Rym: you can figure out someone so she know what everyone drank the u.s We're gonna change.

1195
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:41,985
Scott: we're gonna see what people are drinking and change the beer ads.

1196
01:26:42,146 --> 01:26:43,630
Scott: live cuz we're even up.

1197
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:46,330
Rym: It's still dystopian like don't get us wrong.

1198
01:26:47,632 --> 01:26:53,010
Scott: But I think that has a more possible chance of happening than the in-home count people.

1199
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,458
Rym: Yeah, so last last news.

1200
01:26:55,498 --> 01:26:56,321
Rym: This is another big one.

1201
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,846
Rym: This is wild type because I'm hungry.

1202
01:26:57,886 --> 01:26:58,508
Scott: I'm hungry, too.

1203
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,015
Rym: It's a food related one.

1204
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:23,570
Rym: This company has been made sell cultivated salmon Like the salmon I would use in sushi on like a nigiri Mm-hmm, and apparently it is pretty much indistinguishable from a real fish but grown entirely in a lab and Should be able to be scaled up to produce sushi grade fish entirely in a lab with no cruelty.

1205
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:26,190
Rym: It's basically chicken knobs for fancy salmon.

1206
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:27,780
Scott: Well, is it?

1207
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:28,525
Scott: what color is it?

1208
01:27:28,787 --> 01:27:30,393
Scott: It's pink Is it so?

1209
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:35,850
Scott: I read a thing recently that talked about how salmon in the ocean right or wherever you get them?

1210
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:40,863
Scott: are Pink because of what they eat which is common for a lot of animals.

1211
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:42,490
Scott: their color changes based on their diet.

1212
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,112
Scott: Yeah, you know.

1213
01:27:44,558 --> 01:27:52,590
Scott: and that the farm salmon the ones where they're just you know Farming salmon and like wherever they farm them right are actually gray because they feed them different food.

1214
01:27:53,218 --> 01:27:54,976
Scott: You know They're not feeding them the natural whatever.

1215
01:27:55,097 --> 01:27:58,290
Scott: and then they dye them pink because who's gonna buy a dark gray salmon?

1216
01:27:58,631 --> 01:28:01,884
Rym: I mean if it tastes the same like it tastes exactly the fucking same.

1217
01:28:01,904 --> 01:28:05,798
Scott: I would buy it but People would go into the grocery stores.

1218
01:28:05,838 --> 01:28:07,023
Scott: a gray sand, you know what.

1219
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:07,867
Rym: there's a sort of aside.

1220
01:28:07,887 --> 01:28:13,650
Rym: the fundamental thing You always have to think about when you talk about the public or public policy is that I never matters.

1221
01:28:14,011 --> 01:28:19,493
Rym: People is a very different demographic from I or you or they Exactly.

1222
01:28:20,156 --> 01:28:20,799
Scott: So they die.

1223
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:27,762
Scott: farm salmon pink to make it, you know That people will buy it if you grow the salmon in a lab.

1224
01:28:28,123 --> 01:28:30,870
Scott: just sell cultivate salmon flesh cells, right?

1225
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:31,628
Scott: They just start growing.

1226
01:28:33,116 --> 01:28:37,780
Scott: You know if they're pink Does that mean that you're feeding them the thing that makes them pink?

1227
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,623
Scott: are they dying it?

1228
01:28:38,924 --> 01:28:40,590
Rym: or the article doesn't talk about how?

1229
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:45,575
Rym: They get the pink color, but it does talk like it talks about the actual flavor Like people have eaten this in trial.

1230
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:46,698
Scott: I taste just like salmon.

1231
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,748
Rym: Yeah, they said it tastes like very clean salmon.

1232
01:28:49,868 --> 01:28:51,454
Rym: In fact That's good.

1233
01:28:51,574 --> 01:28:54,250
Rym: Like it's a little less fishy, but it no mercury and such.

1234
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:04,748
Rym: Yeah I Really look forward because eventually there's an endgame for humans where we literally don't eat meat that came from things with nervous systems again and just think about it if we get what.

1235
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:09,590
Scott: first of all We got to upgrade to get the lab-grown tuna because I would be unbelievable, right?

1236
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,870
Scott: But then - it's like you go get some sushi, right?

1237
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,216
Scott: And it's like all the sushi great salmon.

1238
01:29:13,236 --> 01:29:14,864
Scott: We had to fly this fish across the world.

1239
01:29:14,884 --> 01:29:16,030
Scott: It was all fished yesterday.

1240
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:16,954
Scott: It cost a lot of money.

1241
01:29:16,974 --> 01:29:18,139
Scott: It sucks for fishermen, right?

1242
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:19,706
Scott: But that's a dangerous dirty job.

1243
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:27,520
Scott: Yep That maybe no one should have to do even though it's a lucrative job, but regardless it's like hey We just got a fuck ton of salmon.

1244
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:29,330
Scott: We just grew it and we got shit loads of it.

1245
01:29:29,651 --> 01:29:31,238
Scott: Oh you want to eat a little tiny sushi?

1246
01:29:31,278 --> 01:29:31,841
Scott: No, here you go.

1247
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:33,890
Scott: We're gonna fill the whole fucking boat full of sushi.

1248
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,355
Scott: It's so cheap, right?

1249
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:37,262
Scott: It's like let's go everybody, right?

1250
01:29:37,283 --> 01:29:39,250
Scott: It's like we need to be like, oh, here's your little sushi.

1251
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:39,953
Scott: It's like oh, no.

1252
01:29:39,973 --> 01:29:41,199
Scott: No, here's the big boy.

1253
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,767
Scott: It's like no more hunger.

1254
01:29:42,847 --> 01:29:46,361
Scott: for right Let's say you come in instead of $14 for a little tray.

1255
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:47,846
Scott: It's like $14 of sushi.

1256
01:29:48,107 --> 01:29:50,069
Scott: Holy shit here Here's the whole fucking fish.

1257
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:55,266
Rym: I even I look forward to like make up a new fish and then like that is a new type of.

1258
01:29:55,527 --> 01:30:06,353
Scott: I am really looking forward to invent new animal New flake, you know, it's like, you know, yeah invent new flavors by cooking with new ingredients, but like just invent ingredients Don't exist.

1259
01:30:06,494 --> 01:30:09,626
Scott: I feel like this - yeah, like this is uh, this is the Scott fish.

1260
01:30:09,907 --> 01:30:16,810
Rym: It tastes great It's you know, but like hints of honey on one end like things like seafood like scallops fish like this.

1261
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:23,247
Rym: They seem more suited to lab growing because like the way the texture is like this seems easier to true true.

1262
01:30:23,307 --> 01:30:29,690
Rym: and on the other end Bulk cheap meat like fake beef in bulk is also something we can make it.

1263
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:34,170
Rym: Well, it isn't quite as good as like quote real beef for like a fancy burger or a fancy steak.

1264
01:30:34,432 --> 01:30:36,732
Scott: If you McDonald's it you won't fucking know the difference We got.

1265
01:30:36,772 --> 01:30:40,989
Rym: we got fake meat white castles the other day that has the heme proteins in it.

1266
01:30:41,571 --> 01:30:46,005
Rym: They fucking taste better than they taste more like meat than the actual meat.

1267
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,350
Rym: white castles like for real.

1268
01:30:48,112 --> 01:30:56,257
Scott: So listen, I won't say it tastes more like chicken, but I've been eating the the Gardein fake chicken Tenders, you know once in a while.

1269
01:30:56,338 --> 01:30:59,790
Scott: not not like eating them like constantly, right, but I basically don't eat chicken nuggets.

1270
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,800
Scott: I was like dinosaur meat.

1271
01:31:02,693 --> 01:31:10,587
Scott: Yeah, they don't taste you know, like Chicken right entirely but they taste better that the thing that they taste like.

1272
01:31:10,627 --> 01:31:14,250
Scott: I prefer Rather eat those than eat chicken nuggets.

1273
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:32,329
Rym: Well, especially considering that meat production is one of these single biggest contributing factors to climate change and deforestation in the world The there is an eventual point where we literally as humans do not kill animals for meat and we throw chicky knobs like this in Labs and I really look forward to that day.

1274
01:31:32,952 --> 01:31:36,530
Scott: Apparently you can present it as dystopian, but I don't see it that way.

1275
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:38,929
Scott: I see it as hey look you need to eat protein to eat.

1276
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:44,149
Scott: Let's get the protein in the best way that we can get it and let's make it as delicious as we can make it.

1277
01:31:44,309 --> 01:31:50,379
Scott: make it using my most efficient energy source is possible because Agriculture limit their imagination.

1278
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:52,990
Rym: the agriculture that sustains the meat industry.

1279
01:31:53,391 --> 01:31:57,725
Rym: Itself is a huge contributor of carbon and also requires a lot of oil.

1280
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:03,685
Rym: the way we do it today We've talked about that God like a decade ago on GeekNights, maybe more.

1281
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:04,066
Scott: Mm-hmm.

1282
01:32:05,413 --> 01:32:07,444
Rym: And at that point I'm looking at this picture of the salmon.

1283
01:32:07,525 --> 01:32:08,450
Rym: I gotta eat some food.

1284
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:10,042
Rym: Oh my god, so I think I'm eating.

1285
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:11,170
Rym: tech news roundup.
