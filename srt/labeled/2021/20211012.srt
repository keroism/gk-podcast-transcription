1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,360
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,702
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:13,890
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,294
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:20,370
Rym: Tonight we are talking about the number of players in games.

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,527
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,650
Rym: So I did go into the office today and it's still nice out and also COVID time.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:43,070
Rym: So when that happens, I always bike and I use the city bike because it's easier than going down to the bike room and getting my bike through the security area and taking it up and then get into the office and going through the bike parking area.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,670
Rym: City bike for such a short ride kind of just works.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,550
Rym: But this morning I go down and of course all the bikes are gone in the main dock even though I left early.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,693
Rym: So no trouble.

12
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:56,390
Rym: So I walk around the corner to another dock and there's only two bikes on this dock.

13
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:59,850
Rym: And I look and all the city bikes are gone for some reason in the area.

14
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,138
Scott: So fine.

15
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:05,570
Rym: I go to get one bike and it just like fails.

16
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:07,364
Rym: And now I'm kind of in a hurry.

17
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:07,990
Rym: So crap.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
Rym: So I go get the other bike and it works fine.

19
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,790
Rym: And I start biking and I make it exactly halfway over the bridge.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:24,940
Rym: And then I realize in my haste I left my city bike key in the fucking city bike dock that also has it also has my house key and my Yuba key on it.

21
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:26,879
Scott: Oh no.

22
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:34,260
Rym: So I immediately turn around and I bike as fast as I can on a city bike which thankfully was there.

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,587
Rym: It was mostly downhill.

24
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:35,788
Rym: Yep.

25
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,380
Rym: It was just there in the dock.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,619
Rym: And I think if nothing else what saved me was one.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,719
Scott: The dock was empty so no one was going to go to that dock.

28
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:44,105
Rym: That's it.

29
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,980
Rym: There's two things going on here.

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,700
Rym: One wall thing is if you lose something on the street like it's often just gone in New York you just got to live with that.

31
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:58,800
Rym: But generally the etiquette in New York is if you see something on the street that someone probably lost the best bet is to leave it there.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,240
Rym: Because whoever lost it will probably come back trying to find it and cross its path.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,380
Rym: Unless you're like in a venue where there's like a lost and found or security or something.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:07,841
Scott: Yeah.

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,225
Scott: Subway.

36
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,740
Scott: You can take it to the booth on the subway.

37
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,669
Rym: I have taken things to the booth before.

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,839
Rym: I retrieved something from the booth before.

39
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,280
Rym: But if you find something like on the street like I've seen people's keys just like on the street.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,979
Rym: And usually I just leave them there because I figure whoever it is is going to fucking come back like I did.

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,960
Rym: Imagining in their head the pain in the ass of losing your keys.

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,490
Rym: And it was there and it was fine and I biked back to work.

43
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,358
Rym: and that's the most exciting thing that happened to me today.

44
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,789
Rym: That's all I got.

45
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,513
Rym: My biking bit.

46
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:38,599
Rym: Got any gaming news?

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,706
Scott: Gaming news.

48
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,599
Scott: I mean the Metroid game came out.

49
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,200
Rym: But you got the Diana Jones award.

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,642
Scott: Yeah right.

51
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:50,372
Scott: So the Diana Jones award if you don't know about it.

52
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,400
Scott: I think we've talked about it on the show at least once or twice before.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,916
Scott: We had to.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,562
Scott: This award.

55
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,413
Scott: Yeah it's from like 20 years ago.

56
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,620
Scott: I think it's been around.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,720
Scott: And it's basically this award where they constructed it out of like a piece of wood.

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,939
Scott: A burnt copy of an Indiana Jones RPG.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,779
Scott: Like literally burnt set on fire.

60
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:19,900
Scott: And then encased the remains of the burnt RPG in some sort of like acrylic pyramid thing and stuck it on there.

61
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:25,500
Scott: So it looks like some sort of ancient artifact that Indiana Jones would maybe get somewhere.

62
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:32,280
Scott: And they have a committee that's a somewhat secret committee that just nominates.

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,420
Scott: It announces nominees and then at Gen Con it announces a winner.

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,860
Scott: Literally it's just for excellence in gaming annually and the award can go to anything.

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,265
Scott: It can go to a game.

66
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,913
Scott: It can go to a person.

67
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,540
Scott: It can go to a concept.

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,125
Scott: There was the year that actual play won.

69
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,909
Scott: Board Game Geek won it one time.

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,960
Rym: And in a way a lot of what they do is like how it's gotten.

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,820
Rym: We did a show a long time ago on award shows and awards and like nomination processes and everything.

72
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,439
Rym: This is more than a decade ago.

73
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:12,280
Rym: And we talked a lot about how if we made one we would just pick a bunch of people who we trust and they just fucking decide.

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,040
Rym: And we don't like do any weird drama or have an academy that just doesn't watch movies.

75
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,005
Scott: Dominion won one time.

76
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:20,950
Scott: Nordic LARP.

77
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,259
Scott: Just the concept of Nordic LARP just won once.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,886
Rym: The 2001 winner was Peter Edkison.

79
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,079
Scott: Yeah, the first person.

80
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,860
Rym: Yeah, CEO of Wizards of the Coast.

81
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,833
Scott: The guy who founded Wizard of Watsi.

82
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,920
Scott: Yeah, famous person.

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,240
Scott: Anyway, so this year in 2021, the winner was Casey from Nib Card Games.

84
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,740
Scott: If you don't know about Casey, I was first found out about Casey at the first Unplugged.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,367
Scott: I think there was some sort of.

86
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,820
Scott: I forget exactly what the involvement was, but that's right.

87
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,480
Scott: Somehow learned of his existence.

88
00:04:53,081 --> 00:05:00,500
Scott: He's this dude in Nigeria and basically is like a one man show as far as board games are in Nigeria.

89
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:00,821
Scott: Right.

90
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:11,840
Scott: You can't imagine most of the board game companies in the world are, you know, especially with the supply chain deal, are not, you know, they're not shipping a thousand copies of ticket to ride to Nigeria.

91
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,925
Scott: Right.

92
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:18,280
Scott: So basically this dude, he, A, publishes board games.

93
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:18,966
Scott: Right.

94
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,219
Scott: Designs board games.

95
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:25,580
Scott: He has a board game cafe store place and he runs a convention.

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,500
Scott: He basically does every board game thing that needs to be done all in Nigeria.

97
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,806
Scott: Right.

98
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:37,960
Scott: Pretty much carrying, you know, Nigerian board games on his back over there.

99
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:43,420
Scott: And the Dana Jones Award recognized his excellence, which is very well deserved.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,080
Scott: I would have also chosen Casey from amongst the nominees.

101
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:49,179
Scott: It's a fantastic choice.

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,199
Scott: I follow Casey on Twitter and he tweets a lot of good stuff.

103
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:54,639
Scott: So that's good.

104
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,079
Scott: The second news is a sadder news.

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,660
Scott: The the Diana Jones Award, unlike say, you know, well, like the Stanley Cup.

106
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,920
Rym: I was about to say this is our favorite kind of trophy.

107
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,349
Scott: There's just one.

108
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,660
Scott: They don't keep making new ones.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,940
Scott: They don't have more copies of the Indiana Jones RPG to set on fire.

110
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,459
Rym: So we might need to start sourcing some.

111
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:16,945
Scott: Maybe.

112
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:17,916
Scott: I don't know where you get it from.

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,639
Scott: But anyway, so there's just one of them.

114
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:26,119
Scott: And what they would do is they would just sort of if the person who won it was at Gen Con, they'd be like, here you go.

115
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:30,540
Scott: And if the person who won it, you know, wasn't a Gen Con, they'd like mail it to you, whatever.

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,439
Scott: So you basically get to hold on to it for a year.

117
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:34,638
Scott: They just, you know, just like here, hey, go have it.

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,547
Rym: Yeah, like here.

119
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,839
Rym: Here's here's the Stanley Cup.

120
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,159
Rym: Well, though, with an asterisk that is a little more complicated with the Stanley Cup.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,000
Scott: Yeah.

122
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,100
Scott: So Alex Roberts was the twenty nineteen winner and Alex Roberts had it in Canada.

123
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:56,420
Scott: And the winner in twenty twenty was Black Excellence in Gaming, where they gave the award to like several, like a whole bunch of people all at once.

124
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,799
Scott: So they didn't actually Alex Roberts just held on to the physical object.

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,820
Scott: But at this year, they actually had a Gen Con.

126
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,020
Scott: So there was an attempt to mail the Diana Jones Award.

127
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:14,280
Scott: Alex Roberts went to the Canadian post office and mailed it to one of the, you know, Diana Jones committee people.

128
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,288
Scott: And it did not arrive.

129
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,160
Scott: And there's like no tracking and they don't know where it is.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,679
Rym: It's the way you said that there was an attempt.

131
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,660
Scott: It's probably just gone.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,420
Rym: It's like when we tried to mail that Animal Crossing poster from Australia to our friend.

133
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,379
Scott: Yeah, it's just gone, which is sad.

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,500
Scott: But, you know, the physical award isn't what matters here.

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,080
Scott: Right.

136
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:42,240
Scott: It's not, you know, they can keep awarding the Diana Jones Award without the Diana Jones Award.

137
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:42,960
Scott: Right.

138
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:52,620
Rym: Though, I would love, I hope that at some point, like a decade from now on GeekNights, we cover like, hey, somebody found the Diana Jones trophy.

139
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,507
Scott: Yeah, it'll be some way.

140
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,434
Scott: It's somewhere on Earth.

141
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,280
Scott: It's not like incinerated.

142
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,140
Rym: I highly doubt it is incinerated or crushed or something.

143
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:09,820
Scott: No, but what could happen to it is if it's like really lost in the mail, that eventually the whatever postal service, if it, you know, if they don't deliver it, it might be just trashed or something.

144
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,959
Rym: Or sold off at auction in a lot or something.

145
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,250
Scott: Stolen, you know, someone's just got it.

146
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:17,637
Scott: They know what they knew what it was.

147
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:18,260
Scott: They just got it.

148
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,560
Rym: Some nerd has to make a documentary just about the trophy and like try to track it down and probably fail and make a YouTube video about it.

149
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,380
Scott: It's really hard to find something that's lost in the mail.

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,684
Rym: Yup.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:27,811
Scott: Anyway.

152
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,914
Rym: So, I played the Actraiser Renaissance, the remake.

153
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,078
Rym: I got through most of the film.

154
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,475
Scott: So isn't it just the same as Actraiser 1, only HD?

155
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,760
Rym: Nope.

156
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:44,975
Rym: So I, being the kind of person that I am, and apparently you're the same way, I don't read reviews of games.

157
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:46,920
Rym: I play games myself and I review them.

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,320
Rym: So I did not read anything about the Actraiser remake other than all the stuff around the new soundtrack.

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,185
Scott: I saw the Nintendo Direct really announced it.

160
00:08:55,305 --> 00:09:00,640
Scott: And that looked like it was just an HD remake of the original with also the option to go non-HD.

161
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,361
Scott: Yup.

162
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:13,880
Rym: So I did also that, well, the big news I was focusing on was that because Actraiser on the Super Nintendo had one of the bitchinest scores to like grace the Super Nintendo as a platform.

163
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:15,920
Rym: It was such a good soundtrack.

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:25,120
Rym: And the remake, as we talked about, has a recomposition, like an HD version of that score.

165
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:31,740
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, didn't we already talk about Yuzo Koshiro's comments regarding what he did on this?

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,662
Rym: We talked about that.

167
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,367
Rym: So I figured I was going to play it.

168
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:39,340
Rym: And what I expected was I'll play janky old Actraiser, but I'm just going to revive to the soundtrack.

169
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,886
Rym: Yeah, this is actually, they added stuff.

170
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:45,592
Rym: This is way different than the original Actraiser.

171
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:49,120
Rym: And honestly, it's just better in every possible way.

172
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,219
Scott: Well, how much money is it?

173
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,543
Rym: It's 30 bucks right now.

174
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,900
Rym: I would say it might be worth 30 bucks if and only if you have never played the original Actraiser ever.

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,719
Scott: I think that's most people.

176
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:18,300
Rym: I think it would be worth your while then to try this game out because despite the fact that the town part is not that great and the platforming is also not that great, there still is a dearth of games that have both the town and the side scroll.

177
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,600
Scott: That's true.

178
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,485
Rym: So what's different?

179
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,450
Rym: I'll talk about what's different.

180
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,279
Rym: Because having played it so far, I'm really enjoying it.

181
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,246
Rym: One, they really, like.

182
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,250
Rym: there's characters now.

183
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,418
Rym: Like the angel is a character with a lot of dialogue.

184
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:30,960
Rym: She's really cute.

185
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,680
Rym: You are this super hot god and they have like anime visual novel looking art for everybody.

186
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:41,830
Rym: They added a bunch of characters who are new, who interact with you and the angel.

187
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:46,000
Rym: And they're also heroes that will move into your towns and can be leveled up.

188
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,479
Rym: There's also tower defense of the towns.

189
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,418
Scott: That sounds fun.

190
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:59,240
Rym: The towns will like get attacked and you got to deal with that shit and you can use your god powers just like you do in the normal game, like drop lightning on them and stuff.

191
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,300
Rym: You can direct your town folks like the heroes where to go fight at doing the tower defense game.

192
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,980
Rym: You're building palisades and forts and things and like how much do you fortify your town?

193
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,160
Rym: If you got a lot of forts, that reduces how much the town produces.

194
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Rym: And beyond that, it just has a ton of quality of life improvements that make the town bit a little more complex, like a little meatier.

195
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,831
Rym: There's a little more to chew on when you're playing it.

196
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,380
Rym: It's not just trivial.

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,307
Rym: Because I thought, "Oh whatever, they added a tower defense.

198
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:30,089
Rym: This game's so...".

199
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:30,751
Rym: and then I died.

200
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:31,413
Rym: I was like, "Wait, what?

201
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:32,235
Rym: What?

202
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:32,977
Rym: Game over?

203
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:33,820
Rym: What?".

204
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:37,619
Rym: I actually had to try a little bit in the early tower defense part.

205
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:43,340
Rym: So they added all these extra systems to make the town part not just a nothing game.

206
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Rym: Because as much as I love the original Actraiser for being unique, the town part of the original Actraiser is kind of a nothing game.

207
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:56,680
Rym: It feels good when you first start playing, but there's so little there.

208
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,920
Rym: There are so few mechanics that it just pads out playtime before you go back in and do the side scroller.

209
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:10,600
Rym: In terms of the side scroller, it's pretty much the exact same game, right down to the janky controls.

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,470
Rym: But they added a few more combo-y attacks.

211
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,880
Rym: you can do that make it more fun and more like a modern side scroller.

212
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,360
Rym: And they added a backdash, like Symphony of the Night style, which actually makes it playable.

213
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:32,278
Rym: Unlike the original side scroller, which honestly, good for its time, not good by 21st century standards.

214
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,123
Rym: So, I don't know.

215
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,246
Rym: I'm enjoying it.

216
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:44,039
Rym: I'm going to give it a full review after I beat it because I don't know if it actually gets a lot harder or if more things come in.

217
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,460
Rym: But so far there have been enough changes to where it is a materially different game.

218
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,380
Rym: So speaking of which, how's that Metroid Dread?

219
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,869
Rym: I have not even started it yet.

220
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:59,770
Scott: I mean, the Metroid Dread is a 2D Metroid game, much like Super Metroid.

221
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:05,070
Scott: It's really good, right, in terms of anything you want from a Metroid game.

222
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,373
Scott: The new stuff is exciting.

223
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:21,930
Scott: The only thing is I think other people who aren't me could, and I totally agree, could say that it's the best Metroid.

224
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,422
Scott: It's even, you know, it's at the Super Metroid level.

225
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,869
Scott: And I could see why they would say that.

226
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,160
Scott: It's just that me personally, and this started a huge discussion today with our friends, right, is.

227
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,850
Scott: I'm not personally a fan of, you know, action video games that are Simon Says-y, right?

228
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:51,150
Scott: So, you know, you look at a lot of popular games these days, like in the action genre, like say like the Bayonetta types or the Souls types, right, where you're like doing these Simon Says fights.

229
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,395
Scott: We're like, oh, the bad guy does this animation.

230
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:59,870
Scott: That means at this timing, you push these buttons to roll out of the way, and then you attack.

231
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,150
Rym: That's kind of how, like even Actraiser is like that.

232
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,950
Scott: Yeah, or like you look at say like Breath of the Wild, it's like when you're fighting a Lynel.

233
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,684
Scott: It's like, well, when the Lynel does this attack, you gotta, you know, press A at the right time to counter, right?

234
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,830
Scott: It's like, it's a very Simon Says kind of play, and I feel like I've done a lot of that.

235
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:25,550
Scott: I enjoyed some of it in the past, but these days and for the past several years, I really do not enjoy that, right?

236
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:33,890
Scott: It's like when a game, if a game is entirely that, like just a straight up action game, I just don't play them, even if I might recognize that they're well made.

237
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,292
Scott: And what about how?

238
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:41,289
Rym: most of them, it's Simon Says, but there's multiple patterns you can do that all have this, that will all successfully deal with.

239
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:48,070
Scott: There are a lot of subtle differences between all of the games, yes, and some of them do it better than others.

240
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,526
Scott: You could probably spend days and days and days just talking about that specific, that narrow topic.

241
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,830
Scott: There's so much material there.

242
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,330
Rym: I mean, I'm still working on that panel of just looking at resource loops and threat levels of characters in team based first person shooters.

243
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:05,555
Scott: Yeah, but Simon Says in video games is huge.

244
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:16,110
Scott: It's so huge, it's actually difficult to imagine, like when you think about games without Simon Says, like, oh, the boss doesn't signal what attack he's going to do.

245
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,990
Scott: It sounds like a bad game, right?

246
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,798
Rym: Honestly, they usually are.

247
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,889
Rym: Usually, boss fights and things like that are not fun.

248
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,252
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

249
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:31,850
Scott: But it's just like, you can't think of anything else in between bad game and just, like if I want to play Simon Says, I could play DDR.

250
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,796
Scott: See, I think you're oversimplifying, though.

251
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,080
Rym: It isn't just Simon Says.

252
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,886
Rym: There's a lot of different ways to react to things.

253
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:37,950
Rym: That's just skill.

254
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,389
Rym: Fencing is just Simon Says by that logic.

255
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,744
Rym: Literal real world fencing is just Simon Says by that logic.

256
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:45,890
Rym: You react.

257
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,310
Scott: But a literal real world person doesn't just have like five patterns.

258
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,949
Rym: Yeah, they kind of do.

259
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,416
Scott: They only have five moves.

260
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:54,240
Scott: They don't have any more.

261
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,430
Scott: They do them exactly the same way each time.

262
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,730
Rym: So what, you just want a harder boss that I feel like you would get even more frustrated with if it just acted like a real thing?

263
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,499
Scott: It's not about the frustration, right?

264
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,850
Scott: It's like I beat all these bosses, no problem.

265
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:11,050
Scott: I just don't enjoy the Simon Says pattern boss combat.

266
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,923
Rym: But what pattern do you want, then?

267
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:13,246
Rym: A fight?

268
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,734
Scott: I don't want a pattern.

269
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:18,050
Scott: I want it to be like I'm playing against a person where there is no pattern.

270
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,890
Scott: Like if you're playing a fighting game and the other person is just a person, who knows what the hell they're going to do.

271
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:32,130
Rym: But almost the entire skill of fighting games is reacting to slight movements and frame timing of the other player to then deal with their combos.

272
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,697
Scott: That aspect of fighting games I don't like.

273
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,810
Scott: But the aspect of the other person is a person.

274
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,869
Scott: And it isn't just a loop that says, "Randomly pick from this list of three

275
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:43,110
Scott: things.".

276
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,390
Scott: Alright, now pick from the same list of three things again.

277
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,710
Scott: And once you've taken enough damage, the list of things you can do expands.

278
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,450
Scott: Now pick from this list of things randomly in a loop.

279
00:16:53,130 --> 00:17:01,430
Rym: So the only difference between what you're describing and a real world fight or a morgue is just how many things are on that random list.

280
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,429
Rym: And there aren't that many, even in real world situations.

281
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:06,601
Scott: Regardless, right?

282
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:07,549
Scott: Metroid, Dread.

283
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:11,349
Rym: I don't think you just don't like playing real time games anymore.

284
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:13,670
Scott: I mean, whatever.

285
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,688
Scott: With bosses of any kind.

286
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:26,569
Scott: We can discuss that later, but the point is, compared to other Metroid games, Metroid Dread really goes harder on the action, you know, Simon Says parts.

287
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,890
Scott: Ooh, that makes me excited, actually.

288
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:35,090
Scott: Alright, it's like, not only are the bosses very action game, right?

289
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,549
Scott: If you like those kind of games, which most people do, I'm the weird one.

290
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:46,090
Scott: You'll love the bosses in Metroid Dread because within that, you know, framework, they are excellent, right?

291
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:56,150
Scott: And not only that, but also, you know, in most Metroid games, the regular old enemies that are just around are like, just sort of decoration.

292
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,802
Scott: They usually don't do much, right?

293
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,890
Scott: You just sort of blow them away or clean them up.

294
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,633
Rym: Actuarizer is like that.

295
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,890
Rym: Actuarizer is basically just get to the boss, now there's a really hard boss fight.

296
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:14,510
Scott: In Metroid Dread, even if you, you know, I guess if you get really powered up, then the bad guys in sort of the early areas become really weak.

297
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,110
Scott: But in some of the areas, the bad guys are like actually, I guess until you get the Screw Attack.

298
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,869
Scott: The Screw Attack really lets you mess everyone up big time.

299
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:33,430
Scott: But before you get the Screw Attack, which is very late, you actually, the bad guys are like, yeah, you have to do like a timed hit on the bad guys to counter them to get more energy out of them.

300
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:39,727
Scott: Or there'll be some challenging regular bad guys who are just walking around trying to get somewhere and this guy gets in your way.

301
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,570
Scott: He's just a normal guy.

302
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,269
Rym: You know, I like that because a similar thing happened in, of all games, Final Fantasy IV.

303
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,850
Rym: Where the regular, like in the American game, they kind of nerfed the regular, like they nerfed the bosses and the regular stuff.

304
00:18:55,231 --> 00:19:02,630
Rym: But in the original game, all the regular fights along the way were kind of moderately challenging puzzles or moderately difficult.

305
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,870
Rym: Separate, very different from a lot of earlier Final Fantasy games.

306
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,630
Rym: Like you couldn't just ignore those like regular old fights along the way.

307
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,309
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, if you're not, if you're not me who doesn't like, you know, games, action, video game, right?

308
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:16,530
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:26,230
Scott: Then you might, I would, I would not, you know, disagree or I could completely agree with someone saying that like, yeah, this is like the best Metroid game there is.

310
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,608
Rym: You know what I got to do?

311
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,156
Scott: Even me, right?

312
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,930
Scott: I would probably put it second after Super Metroid and I'm, you know.

313
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:38,450
Rym: I was about to say, I got to go back because I have never actually played the Metroid Prime games.

314
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,530
Scott: Oh, well, you know, those are like in a different category.

315
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,111
Rym: Yeah, I know.

316
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:48,210
Rym: But I got, I have now played them and that's, that's one of my deep, like that's in the backlog near the top.

317
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,669
Scott: You should have played them in college when I did.

318
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,956
Rym: Yeah, but I was busy.

319
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,170
Rym: So I watched you play them and I was mostly playing Counter-Strike.

320
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,761
Scott: Didn't they put them out for the Switch?

321
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:55,810
Scott: I think you get them on Switch, right?

322
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,521
Rym: Yeah, but I just, since I got a Switch, I've been busy.

323
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,429
Rym: I haven't even started Metroid Dread yet.

324
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,430
Rym: I'm not the final boss.

325
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,645
Rym: In fact, I bought it and Actraiser at the same time and then Actraiser finished downloading first.

326
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,070
Rym: That's why I started playing Actraiser.

327
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:21,550
Rym: So, in one last gaming adjacent news, so we already said that we're not going to go to Pac South, not irrespective of COVID, but also for political reasons.

328
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:30,430
Scott: Like, Texas has done so many egregious things that, like, we can't even- We were already going to Texas before, but now we're definitely, it's like way over the line.

329
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,223
Rym: Yeah.

330
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,003
Scott: And it's not, it's not a Bugs Bunny situation where it's like, cross this line, I dare you.

331
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,046
Scott: Alright, I'ma cross it.

332
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,529
Scott: It's like, they cross the line, the end.

333
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,152
Rym: Yup.

334
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,427
Scott: So- You're not drawing another line, that's it.

335
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:51,310
Scott: Well, while the state of Texas has crossed several egregious dangers- So far, they can't even see the line if they turn around and look backwards.

336
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,977
Rym: Like, I will not visit Texas under any circumstances.

337
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,420
Rym: Like, full stop.

338
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,146
Rym: If my job told me I had to go there, I would threaten to quit.

339
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,190
Rym: Like, that is how bad this is.

340
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,262
Scott: The fact the earth is round puts Texas in danger of crossing the line twice.

341
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,630
Scott: Just how far they've gone forward.

342
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:18,410
Rym: Somehow, Texas, like, yesterday crossed a line that might actually prevent PAX South from even being able to happen.

343
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:33,870
Rym: So, the governor of Texas announced that the state has now banned vaccine mandates for any entity that does business in Texas, for both their customers or their employees.

344
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:39,441
Rym: So, the convention center, the Gonzalez-Sell-Whatever Convention Center, cannot require vaccination.

345
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:44,330
Rym: An event in the convention center, like the Penny Arcade Expo, cannot require vaccination.

346
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:55,170
Scott: I guess you could still require it if you're a private non-business, because if you're not a business- Nope, they're covering all private entities.

347
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,078
Scott: Well, you could- your house, right?

348
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,790
Scott: You know, a private place that is not a business.

349
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,290
Rym: But the convention center is not that.

350
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,644
Scott: No, the convention center is not that.

351
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:07,189
Scott: That is correct.

352
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,790
Rym: And considering that, you know, the PAX West happened, we weren't there, but they required a vaccine or a recent COVID test.

353
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:21,470
Rym: We know that Unplugged, coming up, which we won't be at either, has gone further and is requiring absolutely vaccinations and you can't come.

354
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,112
Scott: So- Wait, wait, hold on.

355
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:27,030
Scott: I just want to- this is going to be silly, but I can't not say it, right?

356
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:42,210
Scott: What if there is an industrial facility in Texas where masks are needed for, you know, because this poison gas or something like that, are they not allowed- No, this only blocks vaccination mandates.

357
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:43,769
Scott: Oh, okay.

358
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,846
Rym: Now, there are other state rules that say that nobody has to comply with mask mandates, too.

359
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,110
Rym: That's a whole other line.

360
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,003
Scott: If I have a mask mandate for a non-COVID reason, can I enforce it in Texas?

361
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,430
Scott: Or can people come in and breathe poison gas and die?

362
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:00,637
Rym: I believe the latter based on my reading of all this news.

363
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:02,482
Rym: Like, for real.

364
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:04,145
Rym: It is ridiculous.

365
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:10,430
Scott: But this one- We should open up a poison gas factory in Texas and hire shitty people.

366
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:25,030
Rym: But considering that PAX Unplugged requires vaccination to attend, which, while we're not going to be there as GeekNights, like as attendees playing games or anything like that, it's still, like, I applaud that compared to lesser measures, if they're going to happen at all.

367
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,590
Rym: I can't imagine they would rescind their vaccine requirement just to continue to do a PAX in Texas.

368
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:32,936
Scott: I don't know.

369
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:33,829
Scott: We'll see what happens.

370
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,835
Rym: So, I hope against hope.

371
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:40,970
Rym: there is never again a PAX South in Texas unless Texas becomes a, I don't know, a safe state to visit.

372
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:44,659
Rym: And at this point, we need to start helping people move out.

373
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:48,170
Rym: Like, if anyone wants to move out, we almost need a refugee program to, like, pay people.

374
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,170
Scott: No, we need people to move in to vote.

375
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,610
Rym: Yeah, but you can't say that someone has to move to such a dangerous place to be able to fix that place.

376
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,550
Scott: You gotta privilege people who can vote properly.

377
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,949
Rym: Do you want to move to Texas?

378
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:08,570
Scott: If enough people who were as privileged as I am, who were going to vote and we went together, I would go if it was going to work.

379
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,930
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we could get enough people to commit to that.

380
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,270
Scott: Well, I'm not going to just, you know, just go do it on my own and then say, "Hey guys, follow me," because no one's going to follow me.

381
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:36,030
Rym: In fact, there's other stuff going on right now where, like, banks can't hire employees there and a bunch of big banks can't even, like, they have said they won't underwrite bonds for the state of Texas anymore because Texas also passed a bunch of laws saying it is illegal to not service the gun industry and a bunch of banks don't want to underwrite, like, gun shit.

382
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:37,894
Scott: Okay.

383
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:38,539
Scott: Banks are those?

384
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,130
Scott: because I want to be a customer of those banks.

385
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,409
Rym: Goldman Sachs just said, "Well, we're not going to underwrite any bonds in Texas because...".

386
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,090
Scott: Well, I can't get a checking account at Goldman Sachs, can I?

387
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:53,790
Scott: I mean, if you can get a credit card from Goldman Sachs, the Apple credit card, I don't think you can get a checking account there.

388
00:24:54,432 --> 00:25:02,010
Rym: I cannot envision a world where the Penny Arcade Expo goes back on their vaccine mandate for Texas.

389
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:08,190
Rym: So I predict there will be no PacSouth in January, or if there is a PacSouth, it will not be in Texas.

390
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,405
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

391
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,209
Rym: So check this out.

392
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:27,010
Rym: You ever been on a boat or a ship and there's these big white canisters hanging kind of off the side with a bunch of ropes tied to them?

393
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:31,169
Scott: I've seen those on boats, but I've never been on a boat big enough to have them.

394
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:36,409
Rym: Oh, actually, the Seastrick Ferry to Sandy Hook has them.

395
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,170
Scott: If it has it, I didn't see them on there.

396
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,010
Rym: Yep, they're on the side because whenever I'm on a boat like that, I like looking at them because they're neat and they're complicated.

397
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:47,665
Rym: And what they are are life preservation vessels.

398
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:48,630
Rym: They're basically lifeboats.

399
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,030
Rym: But you might wonder how those things get deployed.

400
00:25:53,451 --> 00:26:02,270
Rym: My Thing of the Day is a sped up video, 36 seconds long, that shows what one of those canisters does if you activate it.

401
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,170
Rym: And all I'm going to say is it is so much more impressive and complicated than you are possibly imagining.

402
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:19,170
Rym: They basically just throw that thing down into the water and magically there is a lifeboat with a cover and a slide and everything just there.

403
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,550
Rym: Like, magically out of nowhere like a Transformer.

404
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,709
Scott: Well, it's better than what Titanic had.

405
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:24,812
Rym: Nothing?

406
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:27,343
Rym: Are you sure you had lifeboats?

407
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:28,810
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

408
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:30,409
Scott: They had some lifeboats.

409
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,715
Rym: They did have a few lifeboats.

410
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,266
Rym: Half of them were on the wrong side of the boat and couldn't be used.

411
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:35,050
Rym: Anyway.

412
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,350
Scott: And they were the kind, I'm pretty sure, with pulleys that you had to lower down, right?

413
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,830
Rym: Yep, they were just literal small boats that had to be lowered down carefully.

414
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,589
Scott: There are still boats that I've seen that still have that kind.

415
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,709
Rym: Yeah, but this is like what a modern lifeboat actually looks like on a real ship.

416
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,955
Scott: Alright, cool.

417
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,385
Scott: Hope you never have to use one of these in a non-training context.

418
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,330
Rym: I was about to say, unless you're being trained or doing it for funsies.

419
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,470
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,813
Scott: Oh, thing of the day.

421
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:12,700
Scott: So, my biological sister, I don't know, some people might be finding this out, is semi-famous?

422
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,480
Scott: I don't know what counts as famous these days, right?

423
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,240
Rym: There was a brief period when GeekNights was more famous than her because she didn't do anything yet because she was younger than us.

424
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,160
Rym: And then she became famous.

425
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,085
Scott: Yeah.

426
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,149
Scott: Some level of fame.

427
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:28,000
Scott: Definitely higher than our level of fame by a significant amount.

428
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Scott: But she worked at Buzzfeed making videos, being in videos, and whatnot.

429
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,183
Scott: She doesn't work there anymore.

430
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,471
Scott: She's doing her own thing, I guess.

431
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,357
Scott: I don't know what's going on out there in California.

432
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:38,080
Scott: That place is crazy.

433
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:45,488
Scott: But she started a Patreon as of yesterday, maybe?

434
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:47,971
Scott: So, yeah.

435
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:54,660
Scott: You can go and check out her arts if you enjoy them and give her money so that she never comes asking me for money.

436
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,507
Scott: I don't think she has money problems.

437
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,574
Scott: She can still afford to live in California.

438
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,480
Scott: I think she's doing okay.

439
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:06,113
Scott: But, you know, when you're on your own, sometimes things don't work out.

440
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,720
Scott: Who knows what's going to be years down the line.

441
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,242
Rym: Her art's cool, too.

442
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:18,560
Rym: If I had to describe it without describing it, it is adjacent to topics discussed in Neon Genesis Evangelion.

443
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,108
Scott: I like the illustration she does.

444
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:25,160
Scott: that reminds me of Eternity from Marvel Comics.

445
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:31,809
Scott: It'll be something all colorful, some colorful cartoon land, but then there's like a spaceman.

446
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:38,580
Scott: A shape of a human-ish shape, but it's just outer space inside of that shape.

447
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,453
Rym: Stylized and psychedelic.

448
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:42,680
Rym: Interesting art.

449
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,948
Scott: Yeah, so she does a lot of stuff over there.

450
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:51,638
Scott: If you're giving GeekNights money, Jesus Christ, go give Sarah Rubin $5 a month.

451
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,959
Rym: Well, I mean, the GeekNights Patreon is giving five of its dollars to Sarah.

452
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,059
Scott: Oh, you can do that?

453
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:04,660
Rym: Yeah, but so the way Patreon works, my Patreon is also GeekNights.

454
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:12,460
Scott: But if you sign up for someone else's Patreon, it will take money that someone else gave to GeekNights and give it to the someone else?

455
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:13,167
Rym: It will.

456
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,059
Rym: It'll take from that.

457
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,377
Scott: It won't charge your credit card every month because I don't have a Patreon that I'm taking money in.

458
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:20,360
Scott: I'm only giving money out.

459
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,747
Scott: So it's charging my credit card every month.

460
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:23,489
Scott: Here's your statement.

461
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:26,720
Scott: Yours takes that money from the listener.

462
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:31,460
Rym: So you could go direct to the source here if you like this art.

463
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:43,940
Scott: So I think if that's the case, if Rym patronizing another Patreon simply redistributes the listeners wealth, you should sign up for so many Patreons.

464
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,480
Scott: Eventually, it evens out to nothing because you don't need the money, right?

465
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,686
Rym: I actually should have a Patreon game.

466
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:57,178
Rym: The problem is all the Patreons I subscribe to, I never even go to any of their content anymore.

467
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:57,659
Rym: I'm too busy.

468
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:07,480
Scott: Oh, see, every morning on my iPad, I open a Patreon app and I scroll through and I see because it's not too many that are posting content that regularly.

469
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:13,780
Rym: A guaranteed video has paused multiple times because they could not provide the guarantee that much.

470
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:22,540
Scott: Most of the people are not posting stuff that frequently, so it's really just a few comics-y things that are really posting a lot of stuff in there.

471
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,417
Scott: And a lot of people also might be posting frequently, but I'm sticking to the $1 tier.

472
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,825
Scott: You have to go to $5 to get actual lots of content.

473
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:43,980
Rym: Sometimes some people I'm a patron of primarily because I want to support their activism specifically, or like the thing that they're doing even if I'm not a fan of that thing personally.

474
00:30:44,300 --> 00:31:01,220
Scott: Well, I mean, I think I am a fan of the thing or the person or the thing the person makes or both, but even if I was getting that feed of all that stuff, it's like I don't like the stuff that much that I needed to consume it daily or weekly even.

475
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,689
Rym: Well, there are marginalized streamers I support, but it's not that I don't watch marginalized streamers.

476
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,533
Rym: It's that I don't watch any streamers.

477
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:12,780
Rym: I don't watch streamers at all, ever, except AGD2.

478
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:29,060
Scott: For example, my recent thing of the day, the Cracking the Cryptic, the Sudoku people, if you sign up for their Patreon, you get extra puzzles and extra videos and it's like, "Whoa, dudes, you put up two YouTube videos a day plus more.

479
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:32,144
Scott: That's already way more Sudoku than I ever

480
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:32,464
Scott: need.".

481
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,711
Scott: Unless that was my primary geekery, I would not need all that stuff.

482
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:44,120
Scott: If I'm going to Patreon you, I'm going to do it at the lowest level because I'm not actually going to consume that much content.

483
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,340
Scott: I would have to sacrifice something else I care about much more because I don't have that time.

484
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:55,494
Rym: So, anyway, in the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which I slowed down.

485
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,260
Rym: I haven't read any since the last GeekNights because of business.

486
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,215
Scott: Well, I got held up by Metroids.

487
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,600
Scott: Yep, so we both got away with it a little bit.

488
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,137
Scott: I'm going to dispose of the Metroids today or tomorrow, I believe.

489
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,665
Rym: And the weather's getting chillier.

490
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:11,272
Rym: It's the time of the year when I can go sit in the park.

491
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,620
Rym: It's a little too cold to do a bike ride, but I'll just sit there and read.

492
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,840
Rym: Anyway, Genji continues to do his thing, but I haven't read it in a week.

493
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,739
Scott: He continues to say the same thing every time?

494
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,900
Rym: Yeah, because, I mean, can you spoil the tale of Genji?

495
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:32,840
Scott: I think that the statute of limitations is over for the first novel ever written by human beings ever.

496
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:40,900
Rym: Also, I dare anyone listening to this podcast, even if I said a specific spoiler about a specific character, to remember which character that was when you encountered them in the book.

497
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:42,444
Rym: Unless it's Genji.

498
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,720
Rym: Or maybe Genji's best friend, that guy.

499
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,083
Scott: Alright, also meta moment.

500
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:55,880
Scott: So, there is/was a GeekNights newsletter that at times has been sent frequently and at times has been sent infrequently.

501
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,541
Rym: It's fantastic.

502
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:02,894
Rym: Scott doesn't like people to praise him or anything we do, but he writes it all.

503
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:04,017
Rym: I don't have anything to do with it.

504
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,140
Rym: It's always been fantastic.

505
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Scott: It's free, unlike Rym, who's charging you for extra work, right?

506
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:19,892
Scott: The GeekNights newsletter was run using a free web service called Tiny Letter, which is basically MailChimp's free mode.

507
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,034
Scott: They have it off to the side.

508
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,696
Scott: They don't think they update it or anything.

509
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:23,777
Scott: It's just been there for years.

510
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,380
Scott: I'm surprised they haven't shut it down.

511
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:31,333
Scott: So, it still exists over there, but I kind of felt uncomfortable with that platform.

512
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,697
Scott: Like, are they just going to delete this?

513
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,120
Scott: Like, what's, you know, right?

514
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:46,478
Scott: So, I went through all the trouble of making a new email template, and I set up a whole new email sending system, all the computer parts and everything, and it seems to work.

515
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:47,240
Scott: I just tested it.

516
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:55,050
Scott: The only issue I think that might exist is that if you use a weird email reader, the emails might look weird.

517
00:33:55,691 --> 00:34:01,920
Scott: So, I copied over all the subscribers, a few hundred of them, right, from the old system to the new system.

518
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,588
Scott: So, if you're already subscribed, don't worry.

519
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,816
Scott: You're just going to get an email whenever I send one.

520
00:34:06,856 --> 00:34:07,760
Scott: I got to write one first.

521
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,051
Scott: And if you're not already subscribed, well, we have a new URL, which I haven't typed anywhere yet.

522
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,632
Scott: So, you're just going to have to listen.

523
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,636
Scott: It's newsletters.frontrowcrew.com.

524
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,199
Scott: Or is it newsletter.frontrowcrew.com?

525
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:22,520
Scott: Hold on.

526
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,703
Rym: Careful.

527
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:25,980
Rym: One of those might go somewhere bad somehow.

528
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,108
Scott: It's newsletter.frontrowcrew.com/subscription/form.

529
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:36,552
Rym: All I can think of is tomorrow.org/blog.

530
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,659
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:38,960
Scott: Okay.

532
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:42,447
Scott: If you put a trailing slash after the form, it's not going to work.

533
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:46,876
Scott: So, that's just because I'm using some open source software.

534
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:47,717
Scott: That's just how it works.

535
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,920
Scott: It's not my fault.

536
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,043
Scott: So, yeah.

537
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:58,080
Scott: If you go there, you can subscribe to the GeekNights newsletter and you'll receive it whenever I eventually send it.

538
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:09,880
Scott: And also, I'm going to find some way to collect the old ones, back them up, back up the new ones, and I'm going to create some sort of more easily browsable archive.

539
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:20,040
Scott: Because otherwise, the only way to browse the archive will be to like find the email that you saved or click the like view on web link at the bottom of the email or something like that.

540
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:30,140
Scott: And I guess the privacy conscious people out there would probably like to know that since I'm hosting this ourselves, you know, there isn't going to be any privacy tracking nonsense.

541
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:40,740
Scott: And also, in the new version of frontrowcrew.com, which is partially underway, I'm basically decided I'm just going to remove all the Google Analytics and all that.

542
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,985
Scott: Just removing all that shit.

543
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:42,789
Scott: We don't need it.

544
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,553
Scott: We don't look at it.

545
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,060
Scott: Why should I bother you with that?

546
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,480
Rym: I barely even look at like the analytics I get from our YouTube channel.

547
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,280
Scott: Yeah.

548
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,886
Scott: So, I'm just going to remove all that nonsense.

549
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:55,220
Scott: We're just going to serve up, you know, a normal quality web page when we get around to it.

550
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,648
Scott: Yeah.

551
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:56,019
Scott: You know what?

552
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:57,766
Rym: It's like the old days.

553
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:00,600
Rym: Here's a website and there's content on this website.

554
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,360
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,349
Scott: We're going to make us a motherfucking website.

556
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:05,940
Scott: So, look forward to that.

557
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:20,220
Scott: And if you know anyone who is really good at web design and HTML CSS parts that could make a motherfucking website that doesn't have a lot of bullshit JavaScript on it, mostly just really good at CSS is what we need.

558
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:26,092
Scott: And let me know because it took me like a long ass time just to make one email template.

559
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:28,760
Scott: If I have to make the whole website, it's going to be tough.

560
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,309
Rym: And before you ask, yes, we'll pay.

561
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,560
Rym: We pay real money when someone works for us.

562
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:33,761
Scott: Yeah.

563
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:36,380
Scott: That Patreon money before it goes to some other patrons.

564
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,520
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,629
Rym: What it actually goes to is like, well, like the new geek guys logos.

566
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:40,752
Rym: We hired a designer.

567
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,337
Rym: We paid them market rates.

568
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:43,440
Rym: That's how we brawl.

569
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:54,660
Rym: Like, we're not going to, if you actually are skilled and you can't talk to Scott and it works out and you make our website for us, you'll be making money comparable to the going like contract rates for that kind of development.

570
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:57,542
Rym: All right.

571
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:59,086
Rym: So we're riffing here.

572
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:05,800
Rym: This is a topic that we might do a panel on in the future.

573
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,501
Rym: Right.

574
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:08,003
Scott: But here's the thing, right?

575
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:17,080
Scott: So this is something that we've talked about in the past somewhat frequently, but always tangentially combined with other topics, not as the topic itself.

576
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,441
Scott: Right.

577
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,806
Scott: So it sort of feels like something we've done, but we haven't.

578
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:26,340
Scott: Secondly, it's something I see people not understand on the Internet with great frequency.

579
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,600
Rym: People don't understand something on the Internet?

580
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,341
Scott: Right.

581
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:32,960
Scott: Looking at you, board game Reddit, you know, number one.

582
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,809
Rym: Ah, board game Reddit, where the most common post is, "Why is this game

583
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,210
Rym: broken?".

584
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,656
Rym: And the first response is, "Because you're not playing it right.

585
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:40,699
Rym: Here's the rule that you got

586
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:40,980
Rym: wrong.".

587
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:41,872
Rym: Yeah.

588
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,320
Rym: Anyway.

589
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,335
Scott: Well, those are just the ones I share with Rym the most.

590
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:46,140
Scott: But anyway.

591
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,841
Rym: Yeah.

592
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:50,773
Rym: No, I saw a discourse the other day on whether or not there is skill in poker.

593
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,140
Rym: This was months ago and it was just like, what?

594
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,120
Rym: Like, like, but the- There's a lot of luck, but yes.

595
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:07,160
Rym: But that's the kind of conversation that is usually like the discourse almost hurts understanding if you try to interact with people online about it.

596
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:08,181
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:08,582
Scott: Anyway.

598
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,266
Scott: And three, right?

599
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:17,074
Scott: The great game developer publisher, Amabelle Holland from Hollenspiel, right?

600
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,536
Scott: Who make a lot of great games.

601
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:21,000
Scott: You should check them out if you haven't already.

602
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:26,771
Scott: They tweeted recently and the tweet was something like there are one player ga-.

603
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,560
Scott: I forget the exact words of the tweet and I haven't been able to find the tweet again because searching Twitter sucks.

604
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:36,239
Scott: There's no easy way to like search tweets that I have liked or anything like that.

605
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:46,017
Scott: But anyway, the tweet was something along the lines of there are one player games, two player games, and there are three plus player games, right?

606
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,640
Scott: There's three different kinds of games.

607
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:53,714
Scott: And they were like, wow, you see, you know, people publish games that are like, yeah, for one to six players.

608
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,760
Scott: And it's like, wow, you made three different games.

609
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,356
Scott: Yeah.

610
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,140
Scott: It's like, you know, what's going on there?

611
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:06,850
Rym: And we've talked about this, like you said, a lot, especially in those panels on like how to win at games or heuristics or any of that stuff.

612
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:11,797
Rym: Like we this is always like under like the baseline of a lot of what we talk about.

613
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,760
Rym: So maybe this can be its own topic.

614
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:14,521
Scott: All right.

615
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:17,647
Scott: So for the people who don't understand, let's break it down.

616
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,769
Scott: So you got.

617
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:25,080
Scott: first of all, you got to divide games into winnable games, the ortho games, as we have borrowed the term.

618
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,340
Rym: Yep.

619
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,282
Rym: And ortho games.

620
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:36,740
Rym: Let's see if I remember the definition of the game where there is a set of players and agreed upon set of rules and a method by which to rank the players at the conclusion of the game.

621
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:37,922
Scott: Yep.

622
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,040
Scott: So it's a. it's a game of winning and losing.

623
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,190
Rym: You can win.

624
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,040
Rym: You can lose.

625
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,488
Scott: Any other kind of game that's not about winning and losing.

626
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,310
Scott: Right.

627
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,120
Scott: So is in another category entirely and is not that pertinent to this conversation.

628
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,065
Scott: So that's playing game.

629
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:59,419
Scott: Dungeons and Dragons, you know, anything else you want to apply the word game to.

630
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:00,161
Rym: Yeah.

631
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:02,267
Scott: Not a competition of winning and losing.

632
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:03,150
Scott: Doesn't?

633
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,293
Scott: we're not talking about those.

634
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:05,937
Scott: We're only talking about the winning and losing game.

635
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:06,720
Scott: So number two.

636
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,126
Scott: OK, so you've got a winning and losing game.

637
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:09,908
Scott: Right.

638
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:10,850
Scott: And there are.

639
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,240
Scott: I guess Rym wants to talk about the special case where there are zero players.

640
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,961
Scott: I don't think that's worth.

641
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:27,960
Rym: So the Wikipedia page, which has had a lot of recent updates and I did not make these updates, actually has a lot of academic citations about the three classes of zero player ortho games.

642
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,420
Scott: OK.

643
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,102
Rym: There is.

644
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:32,827
Rym: what's interesting is this gets into other things we've talked about.

645
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:39,880
Rym: The three categories that are widely considered to be zero player games are one games of pure chance, which.

646
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,244
Scott: Candyland.

647
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,160
Scott: Yeah, I guess you could consider Candyland to be a zero player game.

648
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,749
Rym: Bunko, Snakes and Ladders, Bingo, Roulette.

649
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,596
Scott: You just find out who wins.

650
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:49,098
Scott: That's true.

651
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:49,159
Scott: OK.

652
00:40:50,080 --> 00:41:00,360
Rym: But arguably, if we're talking about games that are ortho games as play, then me and Scott playing one of those games, we're still playing a game with ranking and winners and losers.

653
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,850
Rym: It's just we can't impact the outcome.

654
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,140
Rym: So it's arguable whether or not we're a player with agency.

655
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:11,128
Rym: Number two is interesting because this covers a lot of other games.

656
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:19,220
Rym: I don't know how to engage with this, but there's a lot of academic citations, games that are determined by their initial states.

657
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:26,080
Rym: A game that evolves as determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans is considered a zero player game.

658
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,128
Rym: Conway's Game of Life, Progress Quest, et cetera.

659
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:33,697
Scott: Yeah, I talk about those.

660
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,080
Rym: I don't think why I agree.

661
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,329
Rym: Pure chance is an interesting situation.

662
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,639
Rym: determined by initial state is a lot muddier and I don't think it's worth engaging with.

663
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,690
Scott: That's not something that's not a winning, losing ortho game.

664
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,778
Scott: Conway's, you know, win and lose at Conway's Game of Life.

665
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,289
Rym: Yeah, but players can be ranked.

666
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:51,693
Scott: There are.

667
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,599
Scott: well, can you be ranked at Conway's Game of Life?

668
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,060
Rym: There are.

669
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,080
Rym: I've seen meta rules for Conway's Game of Life to like have multiple colors or multiple boards and see which one evolves and whatever.

670
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,385
Rym: Anyway, it's not your main.

671
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:05,579
Rym: The third category is the one we were just talking about before the show.

672
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:17,420
Rym: AI versus AI games, where all human players have been replaced by AIs, arguably have zero players and the game is more of just an experience watching it play out.

673
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:26,080
Scott: Right, so if you have AlphaGo play against AlphaGo at Go and you just see who, which one of the two computers wins, right?

674
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,393
Scott: It's like you could consider the computers to be players, whatever.

675
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,040
Scott: Yeah, I don't think, you know, whatever.

676
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,565
Rym: And we're not talking about games that are not ortho games.

677
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:44,660
Rym: So arguably it doesn't matter if that's a zero player game because I as a player playing the game cannot win or lose because if I play the game it's no longer a zero player game.

678
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:49,060
Rym: So it's moot and I think we've covered zero player games sufficiently.

679
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,647
Scott: All that is is basically, that's equivalent like running a simulation, right?

680
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:55,372
Scott: So imagine if I ran a weather simulation, right?

681
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:59,480
Scott: It's just going to simulate the weather in a local area, you know, maybe try to predict it.

682
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,909
Scott: And I arbitrarily decide beforehand, thunderstorm is winning and bright and sunny means losing.

683
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,373
Scott: It's like that, so what?

684
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:13,100
Scott: You've made an arbitrary distinction just so that you can classify it as a game instead of a simulation.

685
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:21,440
Rym: I think zero player matters a lot more for non-ortho games, which are, that's such a broad wide topic that we're only going to touch on the idea of a non-ortho game briefly.

686
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,485
Scott: Okay, so ortho game with one player, right?

687
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,007
Scott: We're talking a solo game.

688
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:27,870
Scott: People need to understand this.

689
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:34,360
Scott: All solo ortho games are actually just puzzles, right?

690
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,546
Scott: It's sitting there with a Sudoku and trying to find the answer to the Sudoku.

691
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:47,936
Scott: is the only difference between that and say, playing pandemic by yourself?

692
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:51,140
Scott: is that pandemic has hidden information in it, right?

693
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,265
Scott: So you don't, it's not just like an automatically solved puzzle?

694
00:43:54,385 --> 00:44:02,960
Rym: Arguably no single player game can be by definition an ortho game because you must be able to rank the players.

695
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:06,989
Scott: You're ranking yourself as either win or lose the game.

696
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,874
Scott: The opponent doesn't get a rank.

697
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:10,619
Scott: You rank yourself either yes or no.

698
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,040
Rym: It's a pass.

699
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,712
Rym: Yeah, but ortho games don't say against, they literally say rank the players.

700
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:17,280
Rym: So the player one always has the same rank.

701
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,008
Scott: Regardless of whether it's an ortho game or not, all solo games are puzzles.

702
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:28,380
Scott: Doing the crossword puzzle is effectively the same as playing one favorite board game's solo mode.

703
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,465
Rym: Yeah, playing like the one player variant is increasingly popular.

704
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:41,820
Rym: I think our point would stand that a board game that says one plus players, the one player version is just a different game that uses the same components.

705
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:49,880
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can play, you know, what's a good example of something here?

706
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:55,051
Rym: I mean all the interesting one player game examples I have are not really ortho games.

707
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:57,075
Rym: Like Hades, it's an experience.

708
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,040
Rym: It's an interactive entertainment for one.

709
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:05,400
Rym: I wouldn't even consider Hades to be an ortho game because you're not ranking players against each other.

710
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,940
Scott: Right, well consider this.

711
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,605
Rym: And winning this is a variable scale.

712
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:10,728
Rym: Did you beat the game?

713
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:11,851
Rym: Did you beat all the side quests?

714
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:12,753
Rym: Did you unlock everything?

715
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:13,595
Rym: Did you 100% it?

716
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:15,900
Rym: It's almost not even a relevant conversation.

717
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:19,205
Scott: Right, well you have chess, which is a two player game normally.

718
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:23,112
Scott: But one player chess would be chess puzzles, literally.

719
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:28,040
Scott: You're using the same pieces as chess and the same rules as chess.

720
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,540
Scott: And being good at one player chess puzzles might help you get better at two player chess.

721
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,200
Rym: That's a good point.

722
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:53,420
Scott: But playing one player chess, just here's a board, you know, find the checkmate or whatever, right, in one move, you know, that puzzle, is that activity in and of itself is an entirely different game from two player chess.

723
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:01,460
Scott: Although it shares many, you know, similar rules within it, a puzzle is not the same thing as playing against another person.

724
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,070
Scott: There are two different categories, right, so that's just how it is.

725
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:14,380
Scott: So when people are out there saying like, "Oh, I want a solo mode for this game," right, say you're playing Ticket to Ride.

726
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,719
Rym: Yeah, what you're saying is, "I want a different game that uses the same

727
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:17,940
Rym: components.".

728
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,888
Scott: Yeah, I want a different game, exactly.

729
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,600
Scott: And it's fundamentally not the same thing.

730
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,700
Scott: It's a different activity.

731
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:34,180
Rym: Even more interesting, some tabletop games add like mechanical AIs that will serve the role of a player and follow rules.

732
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,680
Rym: But even then, those things act in a way that is not the same as a real player in most cases.

733
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:44,394
Rym: And if it is the same as a real player, it's just a very simplistic human opponent.

734
00:46:44,474 --> 00:46:46,500
Rym: It's really a two player game and one of them is an AI.

735
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:47,322
Scott: Right.

736
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:50,069
Scott: Well, that goes back to what I was saying about one player pandemic, right?

737
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,600
Scott: The difference being is like, yeah, there's two kinds of one player puzzles.

738
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,632
Scott: There's ones with perfect information and ones without perfect.

739
00:46:57,672 --> 00:46:59,379
Scott: I mean, there's more categories than that.

740
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:13,700
Scott: But the biggest difference is the puzzles that are perfect information, like a Sudoku, and the puzzles with the hidden information, like, you know, pandemic by yourself, because there's a deck of cards that's face down.

741
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,794
Scott: You don't know what order they're in, or you might not even know the contents of that deck, right?

742
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:19,440
Scott: So that would be even more hidden information.

743
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,431
Scott: And the way you approach those puzzles is completely different, you know, but procedurally.

744
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:31,680
Scott: So if you like one kind of puzzle, you might not like the other kind, but they are still both puzzles.

745
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:36,940
Scott: It's a puzzle solving exercise, not a gaming, ortho gaming exercise either way.

746
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:47,120
Rym: Two player is honestly the most interesting space to me because two player games or two team games or races, we'll get into that.

747
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,364
Scott: Yeah, when we say players, we mean sides, right?

748
00:47:50,384 --> 00:48:00,780
Scott: So even if there are like, you know, if you and all of your friends gather around a table and on the table is Klondike Solitaire, and you're all trying to play Klondike together, right?

749
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,689
Scott: Like, oh, you're trying to help spot the right move.

750
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,337
Scott: That's still a one player game.

751
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:05,040
Scott: That's still a puzzle.

752
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,590
Rym: That's why code games can take N players.

753
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,655
Rym: Like how many people can you fit around that table?

754
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:12,320
Rym: Because there's two teams.

755
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:13,962
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,807
Scott: Or, you know, you can ask for help.

757
00:48:15,887 --> 00:48:20,660
Scott: You know, your whole family can sit around a crossword puzzle and try to solve it together or a word search, right?

758
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,085
Scott: Or just playing pandemic by the rules.

759
00:48:24,185 --> 00:48:25,127
Scott: Is that a co-op game?

760
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:27,591
Scott: No, that's a one player game pandemic, right?

761
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:32,260
Scott: And many co-op games are one player games in disguise, right?

762
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:36,069
Scott: They say they're co-op, but actually they're just puzzles hidden information.

763
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:40,300
Scott: Some of them have a trainer mechanic thing, which makes them slightly different.

764
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:44,120
Rym: I almost said bad in most cases, but we've talked about that before.

765
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,710
Scott: And that's why you get the phenomenon known as quarterbacking because you're playing a puzzle.

766
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:54,160
Scott: And obviously if you're solving a puzzle, whoever is the best at solving a puzzle, right?

767
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,748
Scott: The person who knows the most trivia is going to do the most work on the crossword puzzle.

768
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:03,260
Scott: And the other is someone, if a child is there who doesn't know a lot of stuff, they're not going to be able to help that much.

769
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:11,898
Scott: So if you're playing pandemic, which is effectively the same exact activity as five people working on a crossword puzzle together, then it's, it doesn't matter.

770
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,060
Scott: It's not the rules fault.

771
00:49:13,441 --> 00:49:14,663
Scott: It's not the player's fault.

772
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:18,669
Scott: Stop blaming the other people for the fact that the game has a quarterbacking problem.

773
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:24,860
Scott: The game's fault is that it's a one player puzzle trying to pass itself off as a co-op activity.

774
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:33,460
Scott: Co-op, you know, the, the quarterbacking thing is only natural, just like it would be natural with a crossword puzzle because the same activity, right?

775
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:40,096
Scott: But if you play Hanabi, right, which we've talked about a lot, that's not a single player puzzle, right?

776
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:41,620
Scott: That's actually a multiplayer game.

777
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,019
Rym: So also Hanabi doesn't really work with two players.

778
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:47,798
Scott: No, not at all.

779
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,921
Rym: Yep.

780
00:49:48,962 --> 00:49:59,280
Rym: So two player games are so unique and interesting that we did an entire podcast about two player games in 2019 specifically, which I'll link to.

781
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,605
Scott: Two player game is the purest form of game, right?

782
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:07,116
Scott: If you, it's not a puzzle, you're actually competing against another human being or human beings, right?

783
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:08,540
Scott: If it's teams or something.

784
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,600
Scott: But unlike the three plus player games that we're going to talk about next, there's no politics and there's no vote who wins.

785
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:21,431
Rym: I can't like sabotage Scott to let Joey Jojo win.

786
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,273
Rym: There's only Scott.

787
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,997
Rym: I'm always trying to sabotage Scott.

788
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,020
Rym: He's the only person.

789
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,864
Scott: It's two people, right?

790
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:27,666
Scott: Two sides.

791
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:30,334
Scott: And each side says, I'm trying to make me win.

792
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,460
Scott: And the other side says, well, I'm trying to make me win.

793
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:51,220
Scott: And you just test your skills at whatever the game is, whatever skill the game is testing, whether that's fighting in a boxing ring or, you know, running fast or, you know, being good at math or being good at memory or being good with your fingers in a fighting game or being good with your fingers in an RTS.

794
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:55,407
Rym: There's no possibility of king making.

795
00:50:55,627 --> 00:51:00,596
Rym: There's no possibility of a poor player making a weird move that like messes you up.

796
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:03,180
Rym: You're just you're playing against one entity.

797
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:12,440
Scott: Yeah, it's, you know, there could be luck involved, but other than luck that could be in there, it's who, which of the two sides is best, right?

798
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,743
Scott: It's a you're measuring.

799
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:22,380
Scott: It's a true measurement, as true as you're going to have of who of the two sides in the game was better and or luckier at that thing.

800
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:26,720
Scott: At this moment, you get and you get an answer unless there was cheating or something.

801
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,542
Rym: These are some of the asterisk.

802
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:34,430
Rym: These are some of the only games that can have what I would consider formal matchmaking.

803
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:41,740
Rym: that is guaranteed over time with a sufficient quantity of players to accurately rank the real skill of those players.

804
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:58,220
Rym: These are also games that can devolve into nothing games, broken or solved games very easily or devolve to the point to where the skill that's being tested in the end between two advanced players is radically different from what is being tested among novice players.

805
00:51:59,061 --> 00:51:59,181
Scott: Yep.

806
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:08,100
Scott: But yeah, I think the point you made originally is that like, yeah, this is pretty much the only valid category for competitive games, right?

807
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:16,979
Scott: If you want to have a competitive game where you actually put some sort of value on the winning and losing, you're not just declaring a winner or a loser for fun, right?

808
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:23,460
Scott: Because you're playing games, you actually want to like award a trophy or a prize prize money, right?

809
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:32,160
Scott: Or, you know, make someone's entire career based on being good at this game or make important decisions based on the result of the game.

810
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:34,970
Scott: It has to be a two player competitive game.

811
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:36,355
Scott: It can't be any other kind.

812
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:37,520
Scott: It can't be a one player.

813
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,988
Scott: It can't be like you solve the puzzle, right?

814
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:41,172
Scott: It's like, what?

815
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:42,396
Scott: Who cares, right?

816
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,520
Scott: Many people solve the puzzle.

817
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:48,373
Scott: But as soon as you say, oh, well, see, I have two people and see who solved the puzzle faster.

818
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,940
Scott: Oh, well, now we got something, right?

819
00:52:51,522 --> 00:52:53,434
Scott: It's no longer can you solve it.

820
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:54,300
Scott: It's who is faster.

821
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,260
Rym: Now, an interesting sidebar, all games that are non interactive, meaning players cannot affect each other.

822
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:06,220
Rym: They're effectively races that are independent, like a 5K run, for example.

823
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,310
Rym: I can't like shove the person in the lane next to me over.

824
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,140
Rym: Yeah, but then they stop the race and I probably go to jail.

825
00:53:13,662 --> 00:53:19,075
Rym: So basically those games, it literally does not matter how many players they are.

826
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:20,980
Rym: They're the same experience either way.

827
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,300
Scott: But as long as they're not one, if you run a 5K by yourself.

828
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:30,978
Rym: Yeah, I could compete against myself, I guess, but that's not really previous time.

829
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:31,340
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,648
Rym: So in fact, you know what we do in the episode.

831
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:38,120
Rym: we did, I'm going to read the description from it on two player games, because here's what we said.

832
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,943
Rym: It's not on GeekNights.

833
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:43,760
Rym: We consider the unique nature of two player games in a non solitaire, non race game.

834
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,740
Rym: One, two, three, four plus players are radically different experiences.

835
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,260
Rym: Two player games are in a unique and fascinating space.

836
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:55,520
Rym: They devolve into chess, tic-tac-toe or rock, paper, scissors in most tabletop games.

837
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,008
Rym: Three player games are political.

838
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,700
Rym: Four player games are basically the same.

839
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,113
Rym: But two, two is a class of its own.

840
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:02,520
Rym: That's the description for that episode.

841
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Scott: And that's exactly right, because when you have a race, right, you can have any number of players in a race and have it be a valid competition where no one can affect anyone else.

842
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,687
Scott: Everyone is doing a solo activity, right?

843
00:54:14,948 --> 00:54:19,960
Scott: But you're measuring how well everyone did the solo activity against each other.

844
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:27,380
Scott: So everyone ran fast by themselves and then we'll look and see who ran the fastest and that's the winner, right?

845
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,488
Scott: Everyone will do a Sudoku by themselves.

846
00:54:29,508 --> 00:54:32,360
Scott: Whoever solved it the fastest is the winner, right?

847
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:34,412
Scott: The number of players there doesn't matter.

848
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:35,540
Scott: It's a race.

849
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,660
Rym: So imagine a two player race that is interactive, like a foot race where Scott and I are running.

850
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:49,880
Scott: Two player is the only way that you can avoid having a race and have interaction with the other player.

851
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,971
Scott: You actually interact with the other person.

852
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,420
Scott: You hinder them, they hinder you.

853
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:02,340
Scott: You are in each other's space doing things to each other, but you've maintained the value of the competition, you know, the purity of the competition.

854
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,860
Rym: So if Scott and I are having a foot race, just the two of us, and it's interactive, if he trips me, well, he wins most likely.

855
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:18,640
Rym: But in a three player race, if Scott trips me, our slow friend, Joey Jojo is going to win the race, possibly.

856
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:19,621
Scott: Yep.

857
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:27,000
Scott: So yeah, the three plus player games, any game that is three or more players, doesn't matter how many, it could be a million.

858
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,901
Scott: It could be two.

859
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:28,943
Scott: It can't be two.

860
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:31,126
Scott: It could be four, right?

861
00:55:31,186 --> 00:55:40,820
Scott: Any game with three or more players or sides, if there is any way for the players to interact with each other at all, right?

862
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:44,629
Scott: Which could be, you know, direct interaction.

863
00:55:44,649 --> 00:55:45,391
Scott: That's obvious.

864
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:49,320
Scott: Like, oh, you can just play a card that says so and so loses 10 points.

865
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,741
Scott: Yeah.

866
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,689
Scott: Um, you know, but it could be very indirect.

867
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,840
Scott: Like, oh, there's a board with, you know, 10 meeples on it.

868
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:00,931
Scott: And on your turn, you take a meeple from the everyone's taking from the same board.

869
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:04,320
Scott: It's like you're barely interacting with each other, but you're still interacting.

870
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:12,800
Scott: You might choose to take the meeple that helps someone else more than the meeple that helps you the most because it'll hurt them for you to take that meeple.

871
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,483
Scott: And you're sort of indirectly affecting them.

872
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:29,360
Scott: If there's any shared resource, any way for the players actions to have any effect on the other players actions in any way, and there are three or more players, you are playing a political game to some extent.

873
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:31,328
Scott: Some games are more political than others.

874
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,420
Scott: Some games are nothing but political, like diplomacy.

875
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:51,260
Rym: But in the end, if you play a three plus player game of any kind, it will either devolve into a perfectly solved solution where if everyone plays equally, you can predict the winner from the beginning, or it will literally just come down to the politics of the interactions.

876
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,680
Rym: Meaning, well, I hurt Scott a little bit and heared me a little bit, so someone else wins.

877
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:57,781
Scott: Yep.

878
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:17,480
Scott: Now there are cases where the interaction amount, like the amount you can interact is limited by the rules and skill does matter such that someone who is very good can still just win, even if everyone else is trying to gang up on them intentionally, just because they're that much better than the other players.

879
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:21,845
Scott: A good example might be something like PUBG, right?

880
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:33,620
Scott: If someone's just really good at PUBG, they could probably win and be the chicken dinner against 99 Scrubs, even if all the Scrubs were just hunting that one person specifically and not shooting each other.

881
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:42,720
Rym: I have played in Counter-Strike gun games back in the day where everyone knows there's this one motherfucker who is better than everyone else, and everyone tries to gang up on them and it just doesn't matter.

882
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,023
Scott: Yeah, so that is possible.

883
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:51,693
Rym: But if everyone is maximally skilled, then skill no longer matters for those people.

884
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:56,260
Rym: Politics is all that matters, unless the game is solvable at that level.

885
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,300
Scott: Yep.

886
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:03,952
Scott: So all three plus player games have this political element, if there's interaction, whether you like it or not.

887
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:06,597
Scott: And this is where the board game Reddit.

888
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:08,560
Scott: people come into play, right?

889
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:17,494
Scott: You see people and they're playing something that's highly political, like Root or Tigris and Euphrates or something like that, right?

890
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:21,280
Scott: And they're coming in with their two-player nonsense, right?

891
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,597
Scott: And they're like, "How many players do I

892
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:22,699
Scott: need?".

893
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,217
Rym: They're mad that Root is unfair, or "My friend made a bad mistake with the birds and now the cats ran away with the game and that sucks.

894
00:58:29,357 --> 00:58:29,758
Rym: I should have

895
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:29,979
Rym: won.".

896
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,064
Scott: It's like, that is the game.

897
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:35,873
Scott: At three plus players, that is what the game is supposed to be.

898
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:37,357
Scott: That's what it's designed to be.

899
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:38,680
Scott: It's a political game intentionally.

900
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:45,540
Rym: If you don't like the fact that the interactions of the players determine who wins, you don't like games with more than two players.

901
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,039
Scott: Unless they're just races.

902
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,618
Scott: Yep.

903
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,167
Scott: So they do.

904
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:55,320
Scott: let you in the rulebook play two-player Root.

905
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,196
Rym: It's not fun.

906
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,045
Scott: That is A, a bad game, in my opinion, and B, a completely different game.

907
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:10,153
Scott: It is in no way resembles three plus player Root, except in only these surface details of like, "Yeah, these are the actions you can take on the board and

908
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:10,393
Scott: such.".

909
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:23,013
Scott: It's just like a resource-gaining game as opposed to a political game.

910
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,840
Scott: What it takes to win at that game is unrelated.

911
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,386
Scott: I don't even know why they offer it.

912
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,836
Scott: It's like two completely different games with the same box.

913
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:31,900
Scott: Why is it there?

914
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:39,360
Rym: While I could say, and I think you'd agree, there is no formal difference between three and any number larger than three.

915
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,860
Rym: There's no formal differences between any of those games at this point.

916
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:51,080
Rym: But there are soft or informal patterns that we've definitely seen with certain player counts.

917
00:59:51,240 --> 01:00:16,220
Rym: For example, four- and five-player games tend to be very similar to each other, but three-player games very commonly have a very specific pattern where two of the players will get ahead, one of the players falls behind, the player who fell behind is effectively eliminated from the game very early, and the game becomes effectively a two-player game, possibly with the spoiler kingmaker just hanging out in the background.

918
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,869
Scott: Yeah, because there's only three players.

919
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:21,220
Scott: You don't have a lot of political options.

920
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:36,760
Scott: And therefore, no matter what the game is, if you have a three-player political game, only after the early game, only two people are really just going to have a chance to win, no matter how well you design that game.

921
01:00:37,687 --> 01:00:39,260
Scott: Can I think of any examples?

922
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,382
Rym: Here's an example.

923
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:47,099
Rym: If Scott plays a board game with the listeners who aren't crazy about games like we are, like a game Scott's good at.

924
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,002
Rym: So it's Scott and two other listeners.

925
01:00:50,944 --> 01:01:04,221
Rym: If they believe that Scott is better than them at games, it is in their best interest to both attack Scott early to make sure he is effectively eliminated to increase their chances of winning to 50%.

926
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:08,749
Rym: It is almost impossible to avoid that situation in a three-player game mechanically.

927
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:15,960
Rym: Three-player games that don't have this pattern of interaction and aren't races are shockingly rare.

928
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,680
Scott: I think the only other pattern would be just one person runs away with it.

929
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,440
Rym: Yep, which I have also seen in some three-player games.

930
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:33,660
Scott: But for three people to all be in with a good chance of winning towards the end of a three-player game is very unlikely.

931
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:49,760
Rym: Even in high skill, like a three-player Tigris and Euphrates, even with three people who are extremely high skill and possibly even equal in skill to each other, one player is going to, either by chance or by minor politics, be set behind a little bit.

932
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:55,200
Rym: And there's like this negative inverse snowball once you're off the board where you can't get back on the board.

933
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,958
Scott: Yeah, you might even be playing like an 18xx, which is like, you know, probably one of the best three-player type games on a board.

934
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:02,700
Scott: that's a pro, right?

935
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,040
Scott: And it's like, you might be getting late in the game and everyone's like money is pretty close, right?

936
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:15,960
Scott: And it feels like, yeah, this is really close to three players, but really that small difference, whoever, someone is in third place.

937
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,124
Rym: The second to last operating round.

938
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:19,246
Rym: Oh, I'm only behind by $80.

939
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:21,129
Rym: The third to last, the next operating round.

940
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:21,670
Rym: Okay, now I'm behind by $3,000.

941
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:22,492
Rym: Next operating round.

942
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:27,540
Rym: Now I'm behind by $6,000.

943
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:34,770
Scott: It's just, it feels like you have three players who are in the game, which makes, which keeps the fun level up.

944
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:38,255
Scott: But the reality is that two players ran away with the game.

945
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:41,700
Scott: You just didn't tell because the numbers didn't separate that.

946
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,540
Rym: I wonder if I just use some sort of logarithmic or pseudo logarithmic function to look at our value in these games instead of the real number, if that would give me a better sense.

947
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,180
Scott: Yeah, probably.

948
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:52,799
Scott: Probably.

949
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,017
Scott: Depends on which one though.

950
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:09,300
Rym: So, but one thing I would say is that the problem that causes one player to fall behind or one player to steamroll ahead in three-player games, they're both actually just symptoms of the same underlying problem and it really just depends on the politics at the table.

951
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:11,644
Rym: One player running ahead usually happens.

952
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:17,674
Rym: Imagine me and Scott and Joey Jojo Shabbat who are playing a game and Joey Jojo knows that me and Scott are both good at the game.

953
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,320
Rym: Scott and I tend to fuck each other up to the point that Joey Jojo wins.

954
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,365
Scott: Well, yeah, because if you're good, you have no choice.

955
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,810
Scott: You know, one of the other players is also good.

956
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,393
Scott: You have no choice but to attack them.

957
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:33,100
Scott: But let's say you got a three-player game with three strong players, right?

958
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:51,397
Scott: You're still going to be looking at the board and since the game has an interactive political element, right, you're going to calculate at some point, whatever the game is, there'll be some action you can take and you'll recognize, say like Carcassonne, taking points away from someone else is

959
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:51,878
Rym: as

960
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,719
Scott: good as giving points to yourself.

961
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,340
Scott: They're equal.

962
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,666
Scott: So there's going to be a move that you're going to see.

963
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,652
Scott: that will be negative points for someone, right?

964
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:01,795
Scott: Maybe you block someone.

965
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:04,540
Scott: Maybe Rym's working on a castle and I block it, right?

966
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,732
Scott: Well, now it's me and the other person are now ahead and Rym is back.

967
01:04:10,073 --> 01:04:10,655
Scott: It's just natural.

968
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:12,020
Scott: It's just going to happen.

969
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:16,060
Rym: My specific strategy I've used for decades...

970
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:17,639
Scott: Pretend you're losing.

971
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:23,312
Rym: Well, yeah, I do use psychological tricks, but let's assume I'm playing against you where that shit doesn't work.

972
01:04:23,512 --> 01:04:25,878
Rym: Like, people where they can see right through me.

973
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:26,800
Rym: In that case...

974
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,709
Scott: Rym's like, "Oh, I'm done.

975
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:28,557
Scott: I can't win this

976
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:28,758
Scott: now.".

977
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,621
Scott: Ah, fuck this game.

978
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:33,008
Rym: Ah, look at me winning.

979
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,114
Rym: That works so well against people who don't know me.

980
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:36,755
Rym: It's kind of funny.

981
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:39,380
Rym: Anyway, it used to work on all of you, but you figured me out.

982
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:41,503
Rym: So, say I can't pull that shit.

983
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:52,820
Rym: Then my strategy is actually, in most 3-player games, I wait until some other player has taken an action that harms a player on the board who is not me.

984
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,067
Rym: Once that happens, I double down on destroying whoever they hurt a little.

985
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:00,491
Rym: Dog pile on.

986
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:01,873
Rym: Remember the Omega-Thon?

987
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:06,660
Rym: They were playing, like, boom blocks and the first player attacked Green just randomly.

988
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,990
Rym: The second player looked around, laughed, and attacked Green.

989
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,376
Rym: The third player was like, "Oh, well, Green goes

990
01:05:13,396 --> 01:05:13,657
Rym: fourth.".

991
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,060
Rym: Attackin' Green!

992
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:17,843
Rym: So, Green was basically out of the game.

993
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:20,448
Rym: The first player comes around again, they attack Blue.

994
01:05:21,069 --> 01:05:26,480
Rym: Blue was the second player, so Blue attacked them, and the third player actually won the game as a result.

995
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:40,640
Scott: So, the thing to remember here is that all 3+ player games that aren't races have a political element and are therefore inherently different from a 2-player game.

996
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,489
Scott: You cannot go into such a game expecting to win because you were the best.

997
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:50,377
Scott: You could play the best and lose because people might vote for you to lose, and it's a vote-who-wins game.

998
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:51,680
Scott: That is what the game is.

999
01:05:52,123 --> 01:05:54,280
Scott: If you don't like that, don't play those games.

1000
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:00,980
Rym: Even better, the skill of being good at a game like that involves trying to manage the politics.

1001
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,519
Scott: Yes, indeed.

1002
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,561
Rym: Like, for real.

1003
01:06:04,102 --> 01:06:05,024
Rym: Best with your friends.

1004
01:06:05,806 --> 01:06:06,808
Rym: Act like you're losing.

1005
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:07,810
Rym: Psychology.

1006
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,600
Rym: Do things in-game to protect you from politics if that is an option in the particular game you're playing.

1007
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:21,660
Scott: One final note, because I mentioned PUBG before, is that when N becomes large, nothing fundamentally changes.

1008
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:39,040
Scott: As Rym said before, the principles mathematically are the same, but there is a soft difference with very large numbers of players, like a PUBG, in that you're only really able to directly interact with people who are near you.

1009
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:43,500
Scott: You can't interact with everyone in the game.

1010
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,007
Rym: I'm stuck in a firefight with the eight people who landed kind of near me.

1011
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:50,092
Rym: Meanwhile, Scott's on the other side of the island.

1012
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:53,940
Rym: It might be all the shitty people are on the other side of the island, and I'm just boned.

1013
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,301
Rym: Right.

1014
01:06:54,882 --> 01:07:02,540
Scott: So, even though it is fundamentally a vote-who-wins game, think about something like Tetris 99 on the Switch, right?

1015
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,785
Scott: Yeah, you are choosing who to attack.

1016
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:08,918
Scott: There is a vote-who-wins element there that ultimately determines a lot.

1017
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:12,940
Rym: More players dilutes the effect of politics.

1018
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,021
Scott: Exactly.

1019
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:17,747
Scott: It dilutes the effect of politics until the latest stages of the game.

1020
01:07:18,328 --> 01:07:25,520
Scott: Therefore, it ends up being not entirely a race, but more, it goes back to being a race, right?

1021
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:35,780
Scott: It's like, yeah, if you play Tetris 99, at the end of the game, you're going to be left with, usually, most of the time, the people who are the best at Tetris, as if you had a Tetris race.

1022
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:40,250
Scott: And then, amongst those people, they will have some sort of competition.

1023
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:44,280
Scott: that is a combination of Tetris skill and politics together.

1024
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:56,460
Scott: The other thing that happens- The politics are still present in the early game, but they're so weak, because there's so many players, you know, and- You almost have to bring enough skill to the table to be able to play the politics game at the end.

1025
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,926
Scott: Like, if someone sucked at Tetris, they're just really bad at it.

1026
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:08,740
Scott: Even if all 98 other players voted for that person to win and didn't attack them, they would probably just die on their own, right?

1027
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:15,349
Scott: And even if someone was amazing at Tetris, and all 98 other players voted to take them out, right?

1028
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:22,500
Scott: You can't coordinate that kind of attack, but if you could, you still might not take them out unless some of the other 98 players were good enough.

1029
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:27,540
Scott: Because that player is so good, they'll just be able to clear if the attack isn't strong enough.

1030
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:34,033
Rym: The other thing going on with larger player counts, and again, this is all informal patterns, not formal patterns.

1031
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:35,617
Rym: They're not hard distinctions.

1032
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,207
Rym: Is that the more players there are, the more likely it is.

1033
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:44,840
Rym: there is a broader gradient of player skill, which leads to dynamics.

1034
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:53,120
Rym: Like, in a three-player game, it's unlikely that I will be able to, like, farm the actions of the worst player to better myself in a meaningful way.

1035
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,048
Rym: But if there's 100 players, there's probably 10 bad players.

1036
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:01,399
Rym: I can go, like, in a deathmatch with 100 players, like a Quake deathmatch that somehow has 100 players.

1037
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:14,640
Rym: My skill, the skill in a deathmatch with 100 players, like Quake 1, would be to find bad players and kill them as quickly as possible, and just let good players kill you so you can get back to killing bad players.

1038
01:09:15,103 --> 01:09:16,654
Rym: Like, dynamics can be different.

1039
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:17,439
Scott: Local equilibrium can happen.

1040
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,386
Scott: A lot of that depends on the specific rules of the game, right?

1041
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:24,256
Scott: Something like PUBG, where when you kill someone, you get their stuff, right?

1042
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,660
Scott: That matters a lot, right?

1043
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,529
Scott: Something like Quake, where you instantly respawn, so dying is not that big a deal, right?

1044
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,720
Scott: Chasing someone for a minute and not getting any frags would be worse than just dying.

1045
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,568
Rym: But here's what I'd say.

1046
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:49,979
Scott: Small player counts-- But another game where you can't really farm people so much, where there's no benefit to attacking weak players, that doesn't give you a benefit for that, well, then that goes away.

1047
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:50,421
Rym: Yep.

1048
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,423
Rym: So think of it this way.

1049
01:09:51,783 --> 01:10:00,020
Rym: Small player counts, generally, the actual specifics of the game don't matter that much.

1050
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,480
Rym: That pattern we talked about comes through almost no matter what the mechanics are in a 3-player game.

1051
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:16,920
Rym: But in a 10-player game versus a 20-player game, there's more nuanced or complex patterns that can emerge that rely more heavily on the specifics of those individual games.

1052
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:21,520
Rym: It's a lot harder to generalize about play patterns with higher player counts.

1053
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:33,640
Rym: And we've already gone over an hour, so there's no way we can even begin to talk about player counts in non-Ortho games, which I think there is a topic there, but that's another hour.

1054
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:41,757
Scott: The point is, stop complaining or saying wrong things when it comes to, "Oh, this game has a 1-player version, 2-player version, 3-player

1055
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:42,038
Scott: version.".

1056
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,279
Rym: Those are three different games.

1057
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:52,220
Scott: That those are three different games, and that there are inherent properties of those games that you have to accept, whether you like them or not.

1058
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:59,419
Scott: So if you don't like them, recognize that and just don't play them instead of saying something wrong like, "I don't like root because it's

1059
01:10:59,479 --> 01:10:59,960
Scott: politics.".

1060
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,431
Scott: It's like, yeah, don't play root.

1061
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:04,500
Rym: Go play chess or Eitan or something.

1062
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:06,578
Scott: Yeah, just don't play that then.

1063
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:10,495
Scott: Don't come ask, "How do I play root

1064
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:10,979
Scott: solo?".

1065
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:19,620
Scott: It's like, I'm sure you could take some of the rules of root and make a puzzle out of them, but that's not playing root.

1066
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,959
Scott: Playing root is a political activity.

1067
01:11:21,482 --> 01:11:21,548
Rym: Yep.

1068
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,359
Scott: You need three or more people.

1069
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,627
Rym: Or to play against AIs, but guess what?

1070
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:28,860
Rym: The AIs, even if it's random, they'll be randomly political.

1071
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,348
Scott: Yeah, and also it's a puzzle.

1072
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,514
Scott: It just looks like a book.

1073
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:32,856
Scott: Anyway.

1074
01:11:38,925 --> 01:11:41,060
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1075
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:46,200
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1076
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,600
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1077
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,520
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1078
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,280
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1079
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,796
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1080
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,100
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1081
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:10,220
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1082
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:41,380
Rym: And a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1083
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:45,480
Rym: So yeah, Bike Nights happens as often as it happens.

1084
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,060
Rym: We'll probably do another episode on non-Ortho games on this topic.

1085
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:50,978
Rym: I think we can make a panel out of it.

1086
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:54,100
Rym: But anyway, for now, I'll tell you a secret.

1087
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,020
Rym: There's a tiny chance I might show up at PAX Unplugged without Scott.

1088
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:58,766
Rym: Not to attend.

1089
01:12:58,826 --> 01:13:00,480
Rym: Like, I'm not going to be there playing games or anything.

1090
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,640
Rym: But I might roll in just to do a panel or two and then peace out.

1091
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,339
Rym: So stay tuned on that.

1092
01:13:05,884 --> 01:13:07,539
Rym: I don't know how Scott's even going to feel about that.

1093
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,914
Rym: And he never listens to the show, so he won't know.

1094
01:13:09,975 --> 01:13:10,619
Rym: Only you will know.

1095
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:12,280
Rym: We'll see if it even happens.

1096
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:38,098
Rym: But anyway, for now, I leave you with... [beatboxing].
