00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,612
Rym: It's Wednesday September 8th 2021.

2
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,735
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,624
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:16,790
Rym: We are talking about the Superman.

5
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,047
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:24,386
Scott: Well who designed it?

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:24,848
Scott: who does not?

8
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:26,094
Scott: who designed these fucking knees?

9
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:27,380
Scott: what garbage yeah?

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,819
Rym: Hey, if you're talking about the knees I have some concerns around the upper and lower back while we're at it.

11
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:35,848
Scott: Why are we standing?

12
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:40,079
Scott: if we just didn't stand up straight we'd be all right Yeah, but standing up straight does have some benefits.

13
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:41,904
Scott: Reaching high shit.

14
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:43,751
Scott: all right you can just reach.

15
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,880
Scott: stand up straight when you got to reach high shit, then go back down.

16
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,859
Scott: Yeah, why you got to stay up there?

17
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:56,992
Rym: So years ago I was having a problem with my left knee Biking which had been a problem that occurred off and on my entire life.

18
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:57,875
Rym: like it would come and go.

19
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:07,312
Scott: and yeah lots of people Have biking knee problems, and we usually say either gear too high gear too low seat too high seat too low right always something like that Back.

20
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:19,579
Rym: I did originally fix that problem by going to a bike shop and sitting down with an expert who sized my bike to the right height and Watch me pedal and then fucked with it, and then like and he was like okay You probably won't have any knee problems again.

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:36,460
Rym: And if you do then raise it up a half a centimeter or down a half a centimeter and see if it goes away Like from this and it disappeared like no knee problems, but then I started biking a lot And Especially last summer over COVID like I started biking centuries like pretty regularly.

22
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:42,272
Rym: That's a hundred miles if you're not like bike people just call it a century for Reasons you can imagine like.

23
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:43,560
Rym: it's a nice way to say it.

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,051
Scott: But a lot of people a lot of people try to be like a bike to metric century.

25
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:55,217
Rym: Yeah, I Biked a Gregorian century anyway, so uh my knee problems came and went.

26
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:59,459
Rym: but eventually I got to a point where I was having a slightly different knee problem.

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,480
Rym: and Physical therapists, there's two different ways to go with that particular knee problem.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:24,179
Rym: It's the problem where like the front inner part of your knee or the top of the patella hurts and basically they either say You've got to put less pressure on your down strokes or in running do shorter strides because it's caused primarily by Stressing that upper part of the patella like the pressure of striking the ground or pushing hard with the pedal.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:37,860
Rym: so Mm-hmm, but it can also be caused if your muscles are imbalanced and that is often the case with people who cycle But don't do any other sports or people who run but don't do any other sports.

30
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:43,693
Rym: basically anyone who does One very narrow type of sport is at risk for these kinds of knee issues.

31
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:50,520
Rym: if you do that sport a lot because you'll over Develop the specific muscles that do those things and the rest of your muscles are weak.

32
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,049
Rym: So eventually those muscles get too strong and start pulling.

33
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,197
Scott: I don't understand how that happens cuz I'm pretty sure it's like.

34
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:58,108
Scott: doesn't cycling use Every single leg.

35
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,657
Scott: Oh, no, not even what other leg muscle is there.

36
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:07,240
Rym: so I Solved this problem and I did talk to doctors like this was advice.

37
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:23,151
Rym: But this advice and I got I cannot stress this enough does not apply to you or any random person Unless you talk to a doctor because this is only a concern for people who have extremely overdeveloped muscles, but basically Instead of slowing down or changing my biking because my form was good.

38
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:37,580
Rym: I started running a lot more and Weight training a lot more I ramped up all the other leg Exercises I do and that actually made all my knee problems go away a hundred percent of them just gone.

39
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,276
Rym: My knees just feel great all the time.

40
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:55,880
Rym: so what happened to me when we did our century last weekend is The knee problem came back a little bit and I looked at my Strava history and I realized something I Was running the same amount I'd been running but I was actually biking a lot more than I had been previously.

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,800
Rym: So it's not just bike a lot but also do some running.

42
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:07,080
Rym: It's if I bike more I have to increase the other exercises by a proportionate amount or the problem will come back.

43
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:15,420
Rym: so the experiment I did was Increasing my running while taking a break from biking and then starting the biking again.

44
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,637
Rym: And so far it seems like increasing the running has made all problems go away.

45
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:29,636
Scott: So I don't have any knee pains, but what I do have is this has been this way for Many years is you know, I'll wake up in the morning, right?

46
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:30,580
Scott: I'll start biking.

47
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:45,897
Scott: It's like when I first start biking like the immediate start like I'm rolling and rolling like less than a block distance Like my kneecaps will be like, oh we're doing something and they'll go like click click and they're like snap into place And then that's it.

48
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:53,120
Scott: It's like if you know if I wake up and I didn't do anything Or even if like, you know, even if I start biking a little later than the early morning, right?

49
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,040
Scott: It's like the start of biking.

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,980
Scott: But you know, it's like my leg is like not in bike mode and then it like you can feel my knees are like what?

51
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:07,616
Scott: Click There's a noticeable Clicking of some kind and then they're like, okay, you can bike forever.

52
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:08,139
Scott: now, we're done.

53
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:12,476
Scott: It's like there's some sort of mode shift or gear change in the knee zone.

54
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:18,395
Rym: So it is Likely, but again, I would recommend you talk to a physical therapist or your doctor at some point.

55
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:19,018
Scott: that doesn't hurt.

56
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:19,540
Scott: It's not from.

57
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:35,081
Rym: It could be causing a minor cartilage damage or joint damage before it clicks and It could potentially be prevented entirely if you cross-trained a little though I know you probably don't want to cross-train a little Hmm.

58
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,933
Scott: I did find I think we talked about this last time right.

59
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,308
Scott: the one exercise other than biking That's actually fun is jump rope.

60
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,863
Scott: Oh, yeah jump also swimming, but swimming is a lot harder Oh my.

61
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:54,589
Rym: so the other thing I noticed was I Just because between went we went to the shore for that private beach house And I also went to that lake house for a family thing.

62
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,440
Rym: So I had two weeks of swimming almost every day.

63
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,354
Rym: Oh Did that put me in like preternaturally a book like good shape?

64
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,540
Scott: I but not if it's not like lap swimming.

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,088
Scott: It's just you know hanging out in the water.

66
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:08,992
Rym: No, I was swimming.

67
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,500
Rym: you weren't hanging out with me in the water.

68
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,306
Rym: I was swimming back and forth in the waves.

69
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,772
Rym: Like I was doing laughs in the water.

70
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,136
Rym: Yeah, but I was.

71
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:20,509
Rym: But I actually lost three pounds on that Wildwood trip.

72
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:24,280
Rym: Hmm, and I think it was solely from all that swimming.

73
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:29,769
Scott: Anyway Got some anime something's hard to do you gotta.

74
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:30,511
Rym: oh, yes.

75
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,774
Rym: So the thing is I'll run 13 miles.

76
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:38,215
Rym: No problem I'll bike a hundred miles and just be a little sore at the end swimming like 40 yards.

77
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,091
Scott: I'm fucking done I well not that I'm talking about.

78
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,220
Scott: you have to have money to swim.

79
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,142
Rym: It's it's hard, but even if you have money swimming is just so much harder than any other exercise I do Like.

80
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:49,864
Rym: as much.

81
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:54,820
Rym: as athletic as I am I cannot swim that far effectively without being completely exhausted.

82
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,027
Scott: I mean Olympic people don't swim that far either.

83
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:00,720
Scott: No, it's like hundred meter five foot, you know, how many meters right?

84
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:01,262
Scott: It's not.

85
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:03,933
Scott: it's not like I swim 60 miles like I'm biking 60.

86
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,064
Scott: Yeah What's the long.

87
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:10,540
Scott: I don't know what the what's the longest swimming event in the Olympics in the Olympics?

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,637
Rym: I don't know, but I had a boss who would swim the English Channel for fun like every now and then.

89
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,204
Scott: yeah They do it slowly.

90
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,449
Rym: Oh, yeah, super slow.

91
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,357
Rym: Like he was really into like ocean swimming.

92
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,567
Scott: marathon Swimming is only ten kilometers in open water.

93
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:26,097
Rym: Okay, that ten swimming ten kilometers terrifies me.

94
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,429
Rym: running ten kilometers I wouldn't even break a sweat.

95
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:29,600
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

96
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,057
Scott: Is that people in general even you know endurance long-distance swimming people don't swim that far.

97
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:40,570
Rym: In fact, it takes me about 40 40 ish minutes to run ten kilometers.

98
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:41,474
Scott: Yeah, we're not.

99
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,840
Scott: I mean that they would be like, you know How long is the fish walking race, right?

100
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:50,151
Scott: Yeah It's like two inches and then you can who can flop right.

101
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,640
Scott: flop flop flop flop flop and then yeah.

102
00:07:53,141 --> 00:08:03,460
Rym: So in some animation anime news, I'll start with a geek bite on that Harley Quinn show Which I'm gonna say is fantastic, but with some caveats, it's not for everyone.

103
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:05,292
Scott: Which what is it on?

104
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:13,400
Rym: Uh So I I must admit that I don't know because I am watching it on my NAS.

105
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:17,509
Rym: Okay, and I click buttons and it appears on my NAS.

106
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,893
Rym: Oh, it's on HBO max.

107
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:19,214
Rym: Okay.

108
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:21,320
Scott: Oh, I have HBO max now.

109
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:26,160
Rym: Oh, uh, so it looks like it was somewhere else but is officially moved to HBO max permanently.

110
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,829
Rym: So I'm gonna can't?

111
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,820
Scott: I'm gonna cancel Netflix soon ish.

112
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Scott: But HBO max right now has the most stuff that I want to see and I want to watch the wizard city.

113
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,597
Scott: So I just got it.

114
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:42,279
Scott: You know Instead of canceling and then signing up I signed up and then I'll cancel like in a week.

115
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:50,895
Rym: HBO max is honestly killing it in terms of getting the catalog of stuff that at least me and Scott Personally want to watch at least at this moment.

116
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:51,940
Scott: I'm sure I'll burn.

117
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:52,762
Scott: The

118
00:08:52,802 --> 00:09:33,075
Rym: problem is the cycle is Netflix has a bunch of stuff that I already finished and the further seasons of those things are not out yet Mmm, but Harley Quinn, I think you might actually like honestly like I think you might enjoy it What I would say having watched a whole bunch of it I've loved the entire first season which I won't spoil anything, but the difference between Harley Quinn then considered compared to say like betas as a superhero supervillain DC Universe show is That Harley Quinn surprised me at a lot of points by just killing a major character Making a radical change to the DC Universe just doing something nutso and then the next episode.

119
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:34,819
Rym: Yeah, that's the universe.

120
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,614
Rym: now It's just not so like Superman's gone, you know, it's some non Canon cartoons.

121
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:41,200
Scott: they can just do it.

122
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,300
Rym: That's what makes it good.

123
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:50,990
Rym: The fact that this show doesn't give a shit about the Canon of the rest of DC is Actually, the only thing that made me like it.

124
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:56,256
Scott: I think like that is though, you know, there's like, you know There's like 10 bajillion DC and Marvel things just like that.

125
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,080
Scott: They do that all the time.

126
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,747
Scott: Alternate that table steaks.

127
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,920
Rym: what I like about this one is that it's it's learned.

128
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:14,480
Rym: The show seems to have learned and informed itself from other Superhero or superhero adjacent things that were popular or that did well or that at least tickled my personal fancy.

129
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:22,960
Rym: I'm confident that the people who write this show are Extreme fans of the venture brothers because they seem to have used it as their style guide.

130
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,728
Scott: You didn't even bother to look up who they were.

131
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:30,330
Rym: Oh, no, I'm just talking about it from a perspective of What the show is like and whether or not you will like it.

132
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,625
Rym: are you the listener will like it because I want to a Review later.

133
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:41,018
Rym: I'll do it with Emily if you don't ever watch it, but Basically, it's from the perspective of the villains like it's Harley Quinn.

134
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:41,520
Rym: It's her show.

135
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,220
Rym: She's the main character, but it's set as they're kind of just millennial dipshits doing their thing.

136
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,951
Rym: But they are still just super villains.

137
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,900
Rym: and all the super villains are there in the universe.

138
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,472
Rym: Like Lex Luthor is there Superman's just there.

139
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,899
Rym: Batman shows up all the time.

140
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:06,259
Rym: I'm not gonna say it's a deconstruction because that is a term that a lot of weaves are Really misusing lately to the point that I almost don't want to use it for a while and hope they forget about it.

141
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:14,380
Rym: But what it is is it it is making fun of the DC Universe more so than earnestly exploring the DC Universe.

142
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:26,007
Rym: Yet by making fun of the DC Universe It is a more earnest exploration of these characters than most DC things have ever been in my opinion Caveat I don't like that many DC things.

143
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,255
Rym: So take that with a grain of salt if you're a DC fan.

144
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Scott: I Look up the people who made this show and there isn't too much interesting things about them and nothing they have credits for is interesting.

145
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:40,756
Rym: So it does have an all-star voice acting cast and I will say that.

146
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,496
Scott: Oh, yeah the voice actors I know I can see who they are, but I'm not like.

147
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:43,839
Scott: I was like.

148
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:46,163
Rym: There was like.

149
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,070
Rym: there was a character the first episode I was like.

150
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,940
Rym: that is that Jason fucking Alexander.

151
00:11:51,081 --> 00:12:01,620
Rym: It was it was him it is and the funniest thing is it's basically him playing himself But it's him playing himself as in it's George Costanza as this character effectively.

152
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:08,320
Scott: Yeah, the person who wrote it is is Justin Halpern Patrick Schumacher and Dean Laurie.

153
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,064
Scott: Yeah, but it's like.

154
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:13,566
Scott: I look I click on Justin Halpern on Wikipedia and it's like, okay Who is Justin Halpern?

155
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,920
Scott: a full-time writer for Maxim magazine online?

156
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:18,743
Scott: It's like.

157
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:19,967
Rym: well see that's why.

158
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:27,111
Scott: so it's like show this show the way it's Completed the book shit My dad says the way it's like.

159
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,820
Scott: and also a TV show named shit.

160
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,170
Scott: My dad says it's like his second book.

161
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,280
Scott: I suck at girls like who the hell is this guy?

162
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,781
Scott: Why do I?

163
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:34,183
Rym: so?

164
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:48,139
Rym: the way that she was put together is that it's probably a lot more like The Simpsons in that the team is what made it and it's very hard to point at any one person who is responsible for Like the show being good or bad or whatever.

165
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,628
Rym: Like there's a writer's room.

166
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:51,954
Rym: There's a bunch of editors.

167
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,060
Rym: I think the editors have a lot.

168
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:59,696
Scott: It seems like it seemed if you look at the Wikipedia It's pretty much this guy and his two and his his friends his two friends wrote did.

169
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:06,360
Rym: most of the are pretty much Responsible for the show, but there's a team of four editors who as far as I can tell have a heavy influence on the show.

170
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,532
Rym: But basically the voice acting is top-notch.

171
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:11,299
Rym: The show is extremely funny.

172
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:22,143
Rym: It is true to the villains and it takes it does a lot and it really Breaks the rest of the DC Universe and it is a serial plot that just advances Like.

173
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:27,180
Rym: I really don't want to spoil anything other than there's a point where the bad guys win and then Gotham's just fucked.

174
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:31,996
Rym: Here's what Gotham's like if Batman's gone and Superman's gone and guess what?

175
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:32,980
Rym: It sucks.

176
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,400
Rym: Hey, I find this show funny enough to where I'm basically watching it as fast as I can.

177
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,970
Rym: I really look forward to watching the third season.

178
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:57,670
Rym: I've only watched the first two seasons so far and If you enjoy the venture brothers and you're worried that you won't get a lot more of it This is not as funny or good as the venture brothers But it is very much along the same lines Just not as polished as the venture brothers like.

179
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:08,064
Rym: it's almost the same kind of story just using DC intellectual property instead of a homegrown intellectual property and the editing and the writing is just not as Polished as the venture brothers.

180
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,231
Rym: So you need more venture brothers.

181
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:10,933
Rym: This is your show.

182
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:17,650
Rym: if you don't like the DC Universe this might be your DC show to watch and I really enjoy it.

183
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:29,378
Rym: It is also full disclosure Extremely violence and the violence is juxtaposed by the fact that no one in the show Canonically cares at all about that violence.

184
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,125
Scott: hmm Also, it's an HBO.

185
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,574
Scott: So it has to either be violent or sexy or both.

186
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:36,076
Scott: Right?

187
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:42,840
Scott: Yep, or it has to be Which usually involves violent sex in both.

188
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,888
Scott: Yeah, but HBO do.

189
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,293
Rym: it's also they like.

190
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:52,199
Rym: King Shark is not a character I ever expected to have anything interesting going on with and yet he's one of the best characters in this show.

191
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,030
Scott: Well, that's the Suicide Squad.

192
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,775
Scott: Yeah the shark.

193
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:55,359
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:59,728
Rym: So in some other news There's more Lupin coming.

195
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,820
Rym: I think we might have mentioned this briefly at some point.

196
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:19,105
Scott: They seem to now be in this groove, you know where they're regular, you know It's like there was a few Lupin TV series and then there was a long break where there was just you know And specials here and there and then you know, there was the Fujiko Mina whatever but seems like you know recently ish And I had didn't look it up.

197
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,210
Scott: I don't know exactly what year.

198
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,285
Scott: it's probably longer ago than my memory tells me We should go.

199
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,200
Rym: Mina came out when we were living in Beacon.

200
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:39,213
Scott: Yeah, right, but it's like it seems like you know in the past few years which again I'm not gonna try to guess what year because I'm probably gonna guess wrong and it's probably longer ago than I think.

201
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,140
Scott: but they came out with Lupin series.

202
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,784
Scott: Four five, I think.

203
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:48,480
Scott: four and I think there's a gap between three and four was like very large in years wise.

204
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:54,660
Scott: But since four, I think it's like four five six is the new one six, I think or seven.

205
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:58,765
Rym: Yeah, Lupin the third part six six.

206
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:11,952
Scott: so I think it's like four or five six, they're like boom boom boom and I haven't seen them but all the indications are that they're all you know High-level well, very good Lupin pretty much of them.

207
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:15,537
Scott: every once I just have to figure out where they are So I can watch them.

208
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,087
Rym: I probably will starting with would you go Mina?

209
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:26,137
Rym: pretty much every Lupin thing that's come out since then has been a top-tier Lupin and a top-tier just animated thing.

210
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:26,700
Rym: to be honest.

211
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:36,355
Scott: It feels like there was some sort of turning point where like the loop someone was looking at the Lupin status quo and they're like Okay, Lupin is just sort of in this rut of doing his thing over and over right?

212
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,800
Scott: Let's we got a choice.

213
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:45,637
Scott: We can either put a kid put a sock in it be like, all right That's enough or we can you know Give it another go and it seems like they gave it another go and it's working out and they're just.

214
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:51,339
Scott: you know We're right like you're a Lupin fan Fueled the Lupin and it's still going at full speed.

215
00:16:51,641 --> 00:17:04,064
Rym: But the other thing interesting now I just got clear because I see him credited as a writer but also as a guest writer like it's not and maybe as a producer role, but Mamoru she is.

216
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:07,755
Rym: this is attached to Lupin the third part six in this article.

217
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,419
Rym: He is credited as a writer.

218
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,448
Scott: Yeah, I think he's working on it to some extent.

219
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,295
Rym: Yep, but okay.

220
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,520
Rym: He is a guest writer.

221
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,688
Rym: It looks like there's some other guest writers.

222
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,940
Rym: So like there's a mystery novelist who's popular?

223
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,132
Scott: Taku Ashibi there might be one episode per person.

224
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:27,183
Rym: kind of deal might be something like that, which honestly Intrigues me.

225
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:27,987
Rym: that's exciting.

226
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:31,340
Scott: do a little do a little upon anthology series in season six here.

227
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,267
Rym: Yeah, there's a note in this anime news network article that oh, she was at some point in the past involved in a Unnamed Lupin the third film.

228
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,154
Rym: that never like it never got made.

229
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,519
Rym: It just got canned for some reason.

230
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,859
Rym: and The thing I'm most excited about is if oh, she's doing anything.

231
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:56,654
Rym: in my personal opinion everything oh, she is interacted with this animated has been good and everything goes Well.

232
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,127
Rym: At least has been interesting to me.

233
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:12,105
Rym: anything he's been associated with that has been live-action has been a fart noise generally, I Don't know what he's done.

234
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,055
Rym: recently I kind of ignored him for several.

235
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,020
Scott: Oh, she is not.

236
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:22,512
Scott: Oh, she is interesting in that he is not someone who's like You know putting out solid gold every season out.

237
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,540
Scott: that is not the hand of Midas, right?

238
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,208
Scott: The Midas touch where it's like everything he produces amazing.

239
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,437
Scott: He has this touch where everything he produces is Mamoru.

240
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:32,918
Scott: She's yeah I think you can tell that he made it

241
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,026
Rym: That I thought

242
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:51,913
Scott: even if he makes something that's a stinker right which is not infrequent You watch it and if you like the Mamoru Oh, she flavor It's sort of like Okay, this isn't great, but I can still taste the Mamoru.

243
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:52,756
Scott: Oh, she spice.

244
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,920
Scott: How often can you taste that?

245
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:54,968
Scott: I like that spice.

246
00:18:55,613 --> 00:19:02,520
Scott: up to a point Yeah, but you took that spice and just slapped it on a sad piece of chicken breast or whatever.

247
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,718
Rym: Yeah, like the thing he was like, I don't know.

248
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:09,580
Rym: the stuff He was best at were old animated shows in my opinion.

249
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,226
Scott: But again, he does.

250
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,699
Scott: I think he he has this thing where he just doesn't want to.

251
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Rym: You know, you look at someone like you like if guy Richie was like, you know, what?

252
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,009
Rym: I don't really like making heist movies.

253
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,995
Rym: I'm gonna make a right.

254
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:21,800
Rym: I'm all rom-coms.

255
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,124
Scott: You see certain people.

256
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:30,636
Scott: they have a thing that they're good at and it's like they just keep doing that thing and people are like Hey, you're so one-note and it's like I'm really good at playing that note.

257
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:31,380
Scott: It's making me money.

258
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,123
Scott: What's the problem?

259
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,108
Scott: and you look at Mamoru.

260
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:35,980
Scott: Oh, she and it's like ghost in the shell Pat LeBourg.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,666
Scott: It's like whoa, just make like a hunt.

262
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,196
Scott: make make more of those until the end of time, please.

263
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:42,564
Scott: and he's like nah That's I'm tired of that.

264
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,953
Scott: It's like no just make ten more Pat LeBourg's please.

265
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:47,678
Scott: That's all the kind of anime.

266
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:48,160
Scott: I want to see.

267
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:53,839
Scott: Oh, I promise if you make more I won't watch any other anime, so I'll just watch only those.

268
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:55,828
Scott: No, I wasn't do it.

269
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,180
Scott: He goes and make some other nonsense.

270
00:19:57,244 --> 00:20:04,974
Rym: Yeah So basically your takeaway is if you haven't been watching Lupin stuff since before the the Fujiko mean a show me Help me figure out where we can watch.

271
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,130
Scott: Yeah My thing is a funimation.

272
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,220
Rym: Maybe I mean the last Lupin thing We both watched and reviewed on GeekNights was the 3d CG one, which was also fantastic.

273
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:16,890
Scott: Yeah, pretty good that was.

274
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,873
Rym: that was a. that was an upper-tier Lupin Irrespective of how it was made or anything else around it and I did enjoy that.

275
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:30,821
Rym: it got it aged into Lupin lore a little bit, but it didn't take it too far Lupin.

276
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:34,812
Scott: the third part for English dub is on Prime.

277
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,038
Scott: I don't know if there's a sub though.

278
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:44,935
Rym: Nah And in some other news the of the final with a big asterisk next to it.

279
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:49,748
Rym: adventure time or at least the final Adventure time distant lands wizard city did come out.

280
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,275
Scott: there might be more distant lands, but this is the final.

281
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:53,318
Scott: I'd already announced.

282
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,880
Rym: distant lands Yeah, and there's that Fiona and cake thing come.

283
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:07,319
Rym: I'm pretty sure as I posited way back that they might just trickle out adventure time content forever As well, I mean as long as people still watch it and care about it.

284
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,432
Scott: Yes They'll still keep making it to some extent.

285
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,640
Scott: But yeah, I watch the wizard city.

286
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:23,400
Scott: I'm not gonna say anything about the wizard city, except something happens in it that made me Specifically very won't upset other people necessarily, but it made me specifically very very upset and unhappy.

287
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:27,294
Scott: But then do not miss the post credit scene.

288
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,949
Scott: There is a very brief We're talking seconds long, right?

289
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:31,873
Scott: Just a few seconds.

290
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,319
Scott: post credit scene.

291
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,329
Scott: essential post credit scene redeemed Redeemed all and erased all unhappiness.

292
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:43,240
Rym: So that's like the opposite of the alien 9. post credit scene.

293
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,453
Scott: Do not miss the post credit scene.

294
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:49,159
Scott: It is Maybe even the best part of the wizard city.

295
00:21:51,942 --> 00:22:01,419
Rym: I'm just glad that they in the show like in the universe of adventure time Tried to do everything they could to let peppermint butler become what he was before the thing happened.

296
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,392
Rym: Mmm, I like that just as a character note on the over.

297
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:06,813
Scott: watch it.

298
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:07,937
Rym: No, I didn't watch it yet.

299
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:08,739
Rym: Okay?

300
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,908
Scott: Well, you should watch it before you say things like that.

301
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:14,800
Rym: Ah, I mean sending him to wizard school.

302
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,242
Rym: That's just.

303
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:17,732
Rym: that's as good as you're gonna do in terms of you should.

304
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:19,539
Scott: you should watch it before you say things like.

305
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,327
Scott: that Is all I'm saying.

306
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:21,400
Scott: cuz you're way off.

307
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:30,520
Scott: I was I was thinking the same thing you were thinking when I read the description, but the nature of peppermint butler's Status is not what you were thinking.

308
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,260
Scott: It is which is I I thought the same as you based on the how he ended up the last time we saw him.

309
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:42,830
Scott: But our thinking was wrong or at least they made our thinking wrong With what they have done in wizard city.

310
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,559
Rym: So interesting that imply anyway.

311
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:49,795
Rym: Well, we'll review it fully probably after we review those Evangelion movies now that they're all out.

312
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:50,718
Scott: Yep.

313
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:51,380
Scott: I saw them all.

314
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,352
Rym: Yep, all I've seen all of them pretty.

315
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,599
Scott: maybe I'll watch them all again.

316
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:58,159
Rym: I I have an urge to watch the original show again.

317
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:02,180
Rym: That's one of them the shows I've seen the most times of any anime show.

318
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,083
Scott: Well, you should.

319
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:06,236
Scott: I would recommend if you're gonna do that nothing wrong with doing that.

320
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:13,040
Scott: I might do that too, but The Movies the rebuild movies, right?

321
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,980
Scott: Regardless of how good that even if they whether you think they stink or whether you think they're better than the TV show doesn't matter.

322
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:33,612
Scott: In my opinion one interesting feature of them is that by their existence they original TV show is better Because these rebuild things just I just are there.

323
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:43,549
Scott: so you should watch them first Because then when you if you go back and watch the TV show again It will just be better than it was the last time you saw it.

324
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:53,370
Rym: Thing is that that original event I still remember the first time I saw the original Evangelion and I stand by it being one of the best animated things ever made.

325
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,829
Scott: Well, it'll be even better if you watch the rebuild movies Even if you hate them.

326
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:03,965
Scott: even if you hate the rebuild movies if you just watch them and then go back to the TV show the TV show will be better than otherwise be.

327
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:15,561
Rym: So in one little brief news We knew from Ken and from basically what anyone who has seen this movie has said so far That Bell Mamoru hosted his latest stuff.

328
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,450
Rym: Opus is gonna be fantastic.

329
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,979
Rym: But we have yet another piece of evidence gonna be.

330
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,421
Scott: it's out.

331
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,850
Rym: So it is is yes, but we have not seen it yet.

332
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:27,470
Rym: No, it's not clear when or how we'll see it since I don't think we're going to theaters anytime soon.

333
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,279
Scott: It's gonna be in theaters here soon.

334
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:38,350
Scott: I think tickets went on sale maybe today even To go see it at the Walter Reed theater, which is where we last saw Satoshi khan in person over by Lincoln Center.

335
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:44,550
Scott: but Yeah, I'm not gonna go to some movie theater and risk my life for a movie no matter how good the movie is.

336
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,996
Scott: I'm not gonna die to see it.

337
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:46,538
Scott: Literally.

338
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,390
Scott: Yeah, right only metaphorically am I dying to see it?

339
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,735
Rym: So so it's been.

340
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,290
Scott: we're gonna have to wait until it is safe to see it in a theater or at home.

341
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:59,744
Rym: So it's been in Japanese theaters for eight weeks now and yep in its eighth week.

342
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,870
Rym: It is still the number two movie.

343
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:03,636
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not like.

344
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,169
Scott: I don't know what movies have come along to try to unseat it.

345
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:11,225
Scott: But you know still being the number two movie after eight weeks is pretty, you know significant.

346
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:14,038
Rym: that's not common Generally granted.

347
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:26,846
Rym: I don't know a lot about how Jeff like To see if it's getting up there, you know in terms of like your name levels of Because last I looked at stats for American theaters generally American.

348
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:30,828
Rym: in America movies Disappear after a couple weeks like even if they're great.

349
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,980
Scott: Yeah, I think I think your name is basically the current like bar.

350
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,966
Scott: right for an anime movie in Japan.

351
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:38,049
Scott: that you're the high bar.

352
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,889
Scott: I don't you see how close it gets to that bar to judge.

353
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,337
Scott: You know how well it's doing.

354
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,804
Scott: spirited away was the previous bar, but your name broke it.

355
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:50,215
Rym: So yeah, but I am Very excited to see that movie.

356
00:25:50,255 --> 00:26:00,334
Scott: However, and whenever I see it, but not gonna and also, you know not having seen Belle Obviously, but having seen your name and knowing what I know about Belle I think I will.

357
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:07,990
Scott: my guess is that I will like Belle more than your name Regardless of whether Belle beats it out at the box office at some point in the future.

358
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,487
Rym: So some other little news.

359
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,610
Rym: Keiichi Ararai has What a new manga coming, right?

360
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:24,918
Scott: so Keiichi Ararai is the person who brought us Nichijou and Helvetica standard and the two mangas that come.

361
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:35,390
Scott: yeah those two mangas combined made the Nichijou TV show and Then we did an episode on the manga city, which I'm still reading and I only ever read the first volume.

362
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,061
Rym: I should borrow that from you and read the rest.

363
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,470
Scott: city is almost done.

364
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,580
Scott: I think it is done, but there's 13 volumes.

365
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,604
Scott: I have 11 of them.

366
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:44,390
Scott: So I'm waiting for two more maybe.

367
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,045
Scott: And that's the end of city like it's gonna end.

368
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:47,246
Scott: end.

369
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:53,450
Scott: And they put out a mysterious announcement, which is not so mysterious.

370
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:59,855
Scott: It's clearly the new manga that is being started by Keiichi Ararai coming very soon But we know nothing about it.

371
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:00,477
Scott: Other than that.

372
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:02,182
Scott: Yes, they're making a new manga.

373
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,228
Scott: So I'm gonna be all over that.

374
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:14,871
Scott: So hey Your eyeballs on the comic order form for the remaining volumes of city in English and the first volume of whatever the hell's coming Next

375
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,628
Rym: kind of figure out where I can watch Nichijou cuz it hasn't been on crunchyroll for a long time and I can't actually

376
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:23,853
Scott: find animation Pirate Bay.

377
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:24,815
Rym: I just googled.

378
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,018
Rym: Where can I watch Nichijou?

379
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:26,619
Rym: legally?

380
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:32,579
Rym: and Crunchyroll is still the top result despite the fact that it has been on crunchyroll for years.

381
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:38,068
Scott: Streaming is what I'm gonna type in Nichijou my ordinary life watch on crunchyroll.

382
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:39,572
Scott: Yeah, it's not there.

383
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:41,296
Rym: obvious might be on Funimation.

384
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:42,720
Scott: where to watch Nichijou?

385
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:43,771
Rym: It's on Funimation.

386
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,358
Rym: I found it there.

387
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,019
Rym: Okay, you gotta pay for the premium Funimation to watch it.

388
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:49,502
Scott: Okay.

389
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:50,163
Rym: All right.

390
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:50,624
Rym: There we go.

391
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,526
Rym: But anyway things Of the day.

392
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:14,100
Rym: so, uh, this is a very short Twitter video but it is just someone used a deep fake algorithm to Replace an actor in the famous movie pretty woman with Willem Dafoe instead.

393
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:27,160
Rym: It's not the character you expected to be and or maybe it is I mean I assume if you if you know me then you a hundred percent assume that this is replacing Julia Roberts and not Richard Gere like.

394
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,216
Rym: But this movie not worth watching in a modern era.

395
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,180
Rym: a lot of problems in it.

396
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,754
Rym: I would say I haven't seen it since I was in like high school.

397
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:36,900
Scott: I never saw it.

398
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,386
Scott: I just but you couldn't not know.

399
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,538
Rym: it existed in 1990 when I was a little kid like in the 90s.

400
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,713
Rym: the one thing I took away from this movie was why is George Costanza in it?

401
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,660
Scott: because I didn't even know he was in it.

402
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,243
Scott: Cuz I never saw.

403
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:55,735
Rym: I only ever saw the poster and I knew the song Alexander in anything except Seinfeld and duck man up to that point.

404
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:04,736
Scott: Yeah, pretty much but You know, it's like I. you couldn't escape knowing that the movie existed, but I never saw it Not even I think even parts of it.

405
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:07,419
Scott: So I can't even tell you one scene.

406
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:11,500
Scott: But this I assume the two I assume the two famous people kiss the end.

407
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:20,700
Rym: Replacing an actor with another actor via deep fakes is a what I would consider a fully approved use case for deep fake technology.

408
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,781
Scott: Yeah, I mean we see you know This is the.

409
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:24,608
Scott: I'm sure it's been done before.

410
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:32,278
Scott: but this is the first time that I've actually heard of Verified instance of someone going through and doing the whole fucking movie, right?

411
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:35,110
Rym: It's like usually Actually do the entire movie.

412
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,659
Rym: They did a bunch of scenes together.

413
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:45,960
Scott: Okay, well the whole movie would probably Honestly, this is enough because I was gonna say I was like, oh someone did the whole movie why that's sort of unnecessary.

414
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,388
Scott: No one's actually gonna watch that.

415
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:50,544
Scott: you can get your point across with just a few scenes Right, I guess.

416
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:51,990
Scott: Okay, they did just to do a few.

417
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:56,448
Rym: see I feel like if they did the whole movie I might watch it, but that's me.

418
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,635
Rym: Yeah, why I'm MV.

419
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,000
Scott: Did they do you think the voice also?

420
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,700
Rym: No, it's just really Roberts voice which actually works and makes it funnier.

421
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:07,660
Scott: It could work, but it would also be funnier to to do the voice.

422
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:12,639
Rym: Yeah, I think it would be equally funny but differently funny if it was also Willem Dafoe's voice.

423
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:14,799
Rym: Mmm, somebody got.

424
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:22,760
Scott: So, yeah, you know everyone these days, you know, even though I guess it's it's already out of style.

425
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:28,040
Scott: Right given the rate at which you know fashion and music trendiness moves.

426
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:37,486
Scott: You know, we love that vaporwave type style and that vaporwave type style is usually embodied in 90s computer interfaces.

427
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:46,320
Scott: Yeah and VHS and cassette tapes right and the art style they're upon.

428
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,195
Scott: Yeah, so here's a website that I didn't know about.

429
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,060
Scott: I don't know how old it is.

430
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,300
Scott: It could be really old and I just didn't discover it till recently or maybe this possible.

431
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,910
Scott: This is a thing of the day so long ago.

432
00:30:55,951 --> 00:31:17,660
Scott: I don't remember but it's tape deck org and all it is is a website that collects JPEGs of blank cassette tapes Of all brands, you know makes models so that you can peruse them Right and you can search by brand running time the material of the tape and color.

433
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,487
Scott: Alright, and you can.

434
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,600
Scott: maybe there was a particular kind of tape that you had.

435
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:32,198
Scott: I learned from this that the blank cassette tapes that I had were Sony HF 90s with the yellow red orange Stripe on the sticker that were clear and see-through.

436
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:39,639
Scott: And also I learned that the most stylish possible cassette tape is the Memorex DBS.

437
00:31:40,443 --> 00:31:41,448
Scott: So and you can just go in.

438
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:43,620
Scott: you know cassette tapes are not like rare even blank ones.

439
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,592
Scott: You can just go on eBay and buy some you know cassette tapes if you want.

440
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,640
Rym: Yeah, it's far from complete.

441
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:54,320
Rym: There's a lot of things missing from this still like Obviously because there's a lot of different cassettes out there.

442
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,479
Scott: There's a lot but if you have some you can submit them.

443
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,071
Scott: If there's any that you didn't you know don't have any sure.

444
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,080
Rym: I got rid of every cassette tape I ever owned.

445
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,028
Scott: I don't think I have any left anywhere.

446
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:14,500
Scott: Not least not here, but if you For some reason want to be nostalgic and use cassette tapes There are still some record labels producing them in limited quantities for new releases and things like that.

447
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,446
Rym: You can also just make your own.

448
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,810
Rym: just record whatever you want.

449
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:18,773
Rym: on to cassettes.

450
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,820
Scott: Yeah, you can buy some blank ones on eBay.

451
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,391
Scott: I looked on eBay for the Memorex DBS ones that look better.

452
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:28,818
Scott: the cooler the high the good styling ones Yeah, and there was like it was like three pack completely sealed 12 bucks.

453
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,167
Rym: They're like whatever plus late-stage like the like once you got the the fancy metal tapes like the good tapes at the end of the run of cassettes.

454
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:44,017
Rym: they are So much better than even the best possible vinyl, and yeah, they're about CD quality.

455
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:48,491
Scott: actually yeah They're not they're not bad But you know based on how I don't know if they denature over time.

456
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,539
Scott: even if they're blank or anything they definitely do.

457
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:56,780
Scott: Yeah, the only thing I want to warn people of is that if you're gonna get a kiss you got to get a cassette player.

458
00:32:57,402 --> 00:33:00,311
Scott: You got to make sure your heads on the cassette player are clean.

459
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:02,357
Scott: all right that everything's all you that you're.

460
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:06,630
Scott: you know everything's well Lubricated so it spins at the right speed of the motor and everything.

461
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:12,650
Rym: you also have to make sure your cassette deck supports the specific Formulation of the tape you're using.

462
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:24,815
Scott: there's different types of cassettes And the most important thing if you're gonna get into cassette tape usage for some nostalgic reason Doby and our noise reduction is an essential feature.

463
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:32,040
Scott: you need to make sure Right that all you have all those ducks in a row regarding noise reduction or else it just gonna sell garbage.

464
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:33,426
Rym: It's a little more complicated.

465
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:40,560
Rym: you had the tape has a particular kind of noise reduction And then the deck has a way to use that noise reduction if those are not.

466
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,825
Scott: What I'm saying though is a lot.

467
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:48,251
Scott: if you go out and try to buy like a tape deck these days a lot of them just like don't have the Dolby noise reduction.

468
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:53,229
Scott: that is the most common and standard noise reduction and Everything's gonna sound like ass.

469
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:53,873
Scott: you want to buy.

470
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:54,839
Scott: maybe buy an old one.

471
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:59,853
Scott: If you can't like buy like a really high quality one That's old like the same thing I do for cameras.

472
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,739
Scott: right we're like I buy.

473
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:12,335
Scott: You know the most like what camera was an absolute fucking professional using in 1990. it's like yeah, it's a really old film camera, but guess what it was top of the line then.

474
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,684
Scott: so it's still really good I'm gonna link to.

475
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:30,639
Scott: I'll put a third thing of the day in there instead of buying a Shitty cassette deck made in the year 2021 going by like the ultra rich person hi-fi cassette deck from 1990 when Pretty Woman was in movie theaters, and that'll be way better.

476
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,080
Rym: So I'll link to a third thing of the day that might be relevant if this peaked your fancy.

477
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,380
Rym: It's a techmoan video.

478
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:48,491
Rym: I don't use them as in the day because I've used them much in the past but this is about a half hour long and it will tell you the full deal on all the different kinds of tapes and the Dolby and everything.

479
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:55,840
Rym: and if you watch this video You will know More than you need to know about tapes and you will be able to do whatever you want to do with tapes with no problems.

480
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,408
Scott: This video is much like much like vinyl.

481
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:02,620
Scott: don't go down the tape road because you think it's gonna sound better because it's not.

482
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:03,805
Scott: It's just for fun.

483
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,500
Scott: That's the reason to go down the tape road and also the aesthetics of the tape are cool.

484
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,167
Rym: So all right.

485
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:12,520
Rym: so in the meta moment the geeks book club book is the tale of Genji.

486
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,266
Rym: I have not read.

487
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,582
Rym: I read some yesterday Oh, I didn't read any in the last week, but I did read a bunch up until the previous GeekNights Mmm.

488
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,166
Rym: Yep.

489
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:25,839
Scott: It's the first novel read it the first novel ever in the history of humans.

490
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:28,510
Rym: So, uh, it's pretty good.

491
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,200
Rym: I said this a bunch of times.

492
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,938
Rym: I'll just say it one more time if you're reading it with us We're gonna finish it in the next month or two because we're actually reading it now.

493
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:46,894
Rym: but do not like try to get too precious about knowing exactly what happened and Exactly who everyone is and when we actually have an episode on this.

494
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:52,214
Scott: I'm gonna say so much stuff That's like, you know, oh that is gonna be so many realizations and wrongnesses.

495
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,398
Scott: It's gonna be like, yeah.

496
00:35:53,458 --> 00:36:01,960
Rym: Oh my god I I usually frame things by like Who is what kind of person was Genji trying to have sex with in that chapter?

497
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,789
Rym: And that is how I remember like what that chapter was.

498
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,535
Scott: Oh that person from that chapter.

499
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:07,860
Scott: was that person from a different show?

500
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,382
Rym: I lose track.

501
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:12,075
Scott: I'm pretty sure the say I booked the book now calls them something different.

502
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,159
Rym: that I'm pretty sure.

503
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:18,560
Rym: I Am thinking that the same person is multiple people in a few of these instances.

504
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:23,414
Scott: Or yeah, or there's you know, yeah, but vice versa.

505
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,076
Rym: It's pretty good.

506
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:25,180
Rym: I picked the next book club book.

507
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:26,571
Rym: It'll probably be a pretty quick read.

508
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,639
Rym: I'm pretty excited to read it.

509
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:37,494
Scott: I am excited to make up when we are eventually done with this to make up for the debacle Which is partially pandemic induced debacle of taking several years to read one book.

510
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:38,957
Scott: I am going.

511
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:40,020
Scott: I've already decided.

512
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:52,197
Scott: For the foreseeable future all Selected books will be of the nature that will end quickly Right the kind that you know will want to read and won't be that long and such.

513
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:56,162
Scott: so yep Otherwise our let me one book in three years But then we'll.

514
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:03,290
Scott: basically what I'll do is I'll we'll read so many books so fast until the book rate Evens out again.

515
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:09,371
Rym: Yeah, so Otherwise our most recent packs panel Atari game design is just on YouTube.

516
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,133
Rym: You can just watch it.

517
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:12,400
Rym: PAX West happened this past weekend.

518
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:23,220
Rym: We were not there, but as the listener pointed out in the last stream I at least have been to since 2008 every packs that Gabe has also been to.

519
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:31,680
Rym: Okay, cuz he stopped going to the PAX Australia's and he also didn't go to this one and he's done As a measuring stick for anything.

520
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,379
Rym: Measuring stick for that one very specific metric.

521
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,071
Rym: Beyond that check out our forum our live stream.

522
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:39,894
Rym: There's a chat there.

523
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,520
Rym: There's all this different stuff.

524
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:46,673
Rym: just type GeekNights into the internet, and you'll find all our crap and I'll get right into it with soups.

525
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:53,670
Rym: So full disclosure I'm not a big fan of really DC anything like.

526
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:58,800
Rym: I like Batman and Batman adjacent things And I appreciate Superman.

527
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:12,992
Rym: I've seen a bunch of Superman things much like Superman like spider-man is one of those characters that just Everyone like in America, everyone knows Superman's deal, even if they have never read a comic book in their life Just like everyone knows spider-man's deal.

528
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:19,035
Scott: I Think the thing with Superman is that the actual story of Superman, right?

529
00:38:19,356 --> 00:38:22,105
Scott: It's a story of Immigration, right?

530
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:26,020
Scott: It's a story of you know, even though he's a white dude, right?

531
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,004
Scott: He's like an alien.

532
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,450
Scott: come to earth, right?

533
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:35,533
Scott: It's a story of you know You know like a guy who's you know, so powerful, right?

534
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,058
Scott: It's like but yet is good, right?

535
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,595
Scott: You get this are like this, you know benevolent God situation going on right?

536
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:44,464
Scott: It's like there's so many angles You know.

537
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,500
Scott: you could talk about them for like a hundred years, right?

538
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,555
Scott: You could talk about the people, you know, Simon Schuster made Superman right.

539
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:50,580
Scott: all this stuff going on.

540
00:38:52,776 --> 00:39:04,720
Scott: But The actual most that I have read or watched Actual Superman media right end up not actually going down those roads.

541
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,227
Rym: Yep, that is my main complaint with Superman is that most Superman stories don't tell the stories.

542
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:17,260
Rym: I am interested in about an Individual very powerful person who wants to do good in a cruel and evil world.

543
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:36,315
Scott: Right, it's like, you know you see, you know, some of them do right, you know some of them do but it's like when I was a kid the Superman that I actually I think probably still to this day the Superman that I have consumed the most is That Lois and Clark Superman TV show because we my family watched that.

544
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:39,086
Scott: it was on like 8 o'clock Like I forget what day.

545
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:39,890
Rym: Oh my god.

546
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:40,956
Rym: We watched that too.

547
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:41,378
Rym: I liked it.

548
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:46,480
Scott: Okay Yeah, I mean, I remember it being okay, but it was pretty much just.

549
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:56,189
Scott: You know 90s TV level, you know Sikkami kind of show right?

550
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:57,052
Scott: It didn't dart.

551
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:59,620
Scott: It didn't dig deep on any plots, right?

552
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,051
Scott: It was like, oh no, there's some danger.

553
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:10,667
Rym: He fights it Which to be fair like a lot of Batman media like even B test which I love was also like that.

554
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:19,255
Rym: it just had a lot of style and occasional very brilliant episodes and like Did more but it didn't really interrogate the Batman in the way that I like.

555
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:20,539
Rym: the Batman interrogated, right?

556
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,943
Scott: But eat that's true.

557
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:27,040
Scott: But you know while the Batman has much to interrogate Superman has way more to interrogate.

558
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,390
Rym: Yeah, anybody see I am a living God among humans.

559
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,845
Rym: I hide my identity, but I'm still just one, dude I can't just fix the world.

560
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:41,679
Scott: this journalism aspect that goes on in Superman, right only so often gets explored.

561
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:44,716
Scott: You know just so much going on there.

562
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:55,172
Scott: but when it does get explored right when there is a Take on Superman right that actually goes down those roads.

563
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,020
Scott: It's like it's like so good, right?

564
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,682
Scott: I mean we already.

565
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:03,780
Scott: we've already did an episode super long ago about you know, Frank Miller's got his issues.

566
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,848
Scott: But in the Dark Knight Returns, it's like there's like even though Superman is like this shiny You know sun is shining good guy.

567
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,240
Scott: It's like there's like this absolute terror, right?

568
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:24,540
Scott: It's almost like a Lovecraftian terror Like if Superman is coming because it's like it's like God is coming like you're gonna get Moses gonna see the fucking burning bush Yeah, holy shit.

569
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:31,362
Scott: And then it's just like, you know There's something going on and it's like you see how you see like a blur and like the bad guys are gone Right.

570
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:32,085
Scott: It's like the end.

571
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:33,793
Scott: It's like he just took care of it like that.

572
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,139
Scott: Yeah, there's none of that.

573
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:37,005
Rym: Plays with that.

574
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:37,970
Rym: there's a couple episode.

575
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:38,493
Rym: We're like super.

576
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:44,354
Rym: if Superman shows up It's just over like whatever was happening is over when Superman shows up.

577
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:46,100
Scott: That's how it's supposed to be.

578
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,702
Scott: There are too many.

579
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:54,900
Scott: you watch most Superman stuff like the old the super old public domain Superman cartoons and it's like, you know I guess that was when he couldn't even fly this way.

580
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,693
Scott: He could only jump and stuff really high.

581
00:41:56,773 --> 00:42:04,780
Scott: but he just you know He's punching out like bank robbers and mad scientists like it's like one punch to Superman and their head explodes, bro.

582
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,611
Scott: It's like they never flies to the moon or some shit.

583
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:19,567
Scott: It's like it doesn't beat up dudes like spider-man does Right, it's it's led, you know Saitama level here right when you get involved with yeah You can't be punching other human beings.

584
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:21,233
Scott: They'll just indeed build their good.

585
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,818
Scott: They'll be ribs all over the place.

586
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:27,410
Scott: Yeah Rib tips or whatever.

587
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,545
Rym: the other super that I actually saw way more of is the old black and white TV show because it was On late at night.

588
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:34,216
Scott: I never watched that.

589
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:49,379
Rym: I watched a lot of that show and the only episode I have specific memories of because they were they were almost all almost every one of that old show like the episodes were just here's a very particular very zoomed in tiny problem that Superman is trying to solve.

590
00:42:49,399 --> 00:43:04,904
Rym: and the one I remember is some dude committed some crime and He locked himself in an extremely like thick safe until the statute of limitations would run out and Superman couldn't get in.

591
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:06,769
Scott: so man can get in.

592
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:07,351
Scott: so that's no.

593
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,657
Rym: so the plot was Superman couldn't get in.

594
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:12,888
Rym: it was too much for even Superman to get in.

595
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,828
Rym: so he learned some technique to Change the atoms in his own body.

596
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,737
Rym: Thanks to his superpowers in the Sun to walk through walls.

597
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:29,379
Rym: So he starts walking through the wall of this giant safe to get in to arrest this dude.

598
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:36,082
Rym: and The dude psychs him out by being like yeah, but what if you don't Rematerialize?

599
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:38,252
Rym: is this is real dangerous what you're doing.

600
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:43,609
Rym: So Superman gives up and Superman then solves this problem with his.

601
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,435
Rym: in that show massive intellect.

602
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:45,956
Scott: wouldn't.

603
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,230
Scott: wouldn't the guy Suffocate in the safe.

604
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:49,441
Rym: Oh, he had a way to get air There.

605
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:49,943
Rym: was they like they?

606
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:52,878
Rym: this was this very much make just pump gas in there.

607
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:56,060
Rym: Uh Superman wasn't evil enough to do something like that.

608
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,649
Rym: In the end they just fucked.

609
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,760
Rym: they made the clock inside the safe move a little faster.

610
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:05,678
Rym: So he came out five minutes before the 20 years was up and then Superman just arrested him.

611
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:07,687
Scott: That's oh my god.

612
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:08,432
Scott: That's ridiculous.

613
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,560
Rym: That's what that show was like.

614
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:12,439
Scott: That's awful.

615
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,585
Scott: In some ways it's clear.

616
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:22,767
Scott: in some ways it's clever right but in other ways it's like, you know That's the.

617
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:24,380
Scott: you got Superman right there.

618
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:27,030
Scott: Don't need to miss the app you have and you what.

619
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,155
Scott: Superman has nothing to do with that.

620
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:30,042
Scott: if you saw it's an Indiana Jones Situation.

621
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:30,323
Scott: we're like.

622
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:32,533
Scott: he contributed nothing to the solution.

623
00:44:33,216 --> 00:44:38,490
Scott: He came up with the idea See, I guess maybe there were.

624
00:44:38,872 --> 00:44:41,180
Rym: there was another one where I remember he had to use this.

625
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:45,387
Rym: He had to use his heat vision to save the day but he was still Clark Kent.

626
00:44:45,788 --> 00:44:47,716
Rym: so he couldn't do it because it would melt his glasses.

627
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:48,399
Rym: every would know.

628
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:52,380
Rym: and In the end his he almost solved everything with a clever idea.

629
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:00,550
Rym: The clever idea was he removed the lenses from his frames to be able to do the thing without melting them though for the one Time he needed to do it the end.

630
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:00,992
Rym: Mm-hmm.

631
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:01,937
Scott: Okay.

632
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:03,945
Scott: Yeah That's the other right.

633
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,980
Scott: So that's I think that's also, you know, where some of the corniness comes from right?

634
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,808
Scott: It's like you have this good aspect of.

635
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:18,840
Scott: you know, he was raised by humans Right and you had is that connection to humanity right parents even though they're not his real parents his biological parents.

636
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,253
Scott: They're his real parents not biological right his biological parents and from whatever alien.

637
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:25,239
Scott: Yeah, Krypton, whatever, right?

638
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,859
Scott: So you have the adoption story, right?

639
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:38,862
Rym: Yeah, you get a found family story around that like the connections he makes cuz he doesn't have any biological family left anywhere in the Universe.

640
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:39,385
Scott: and I don't know.

641
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,319
Scott: Clark Kent was the original secret identity, but it effectively set the the template for everyone else's secret identity who came later.

642
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:52,818
Scott: It was modeled after the Superman secret identity.

643
00:45:53,401 --> 00:46:05,849
Scott: So and but the thing is that actual no matter how good an interpretation of Superman you're watching The secret identity part if it's in play because sometimes it's not in play if you're watching super friends It's like he's just always Superman.

644
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,648
Rym: He doesn't or just no can't in that Can't off on his own and then separately.

645
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:16,352
Rym: just he's in the Justice League base Just talking to people sometimes like he's just right.

646
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:20,285
Rym: He's just one of the x-men effectively Yeah, it's like.

647
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:23,099
Scott: why do you even need the super friends if Superman is there?

648
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:25,794
Scott: Why do you still have any of these twins?

649
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:26,500
Scott: What are they contribute?

650
00:46:28,582 --> 00:46:29,125
Scott: The flash.

651
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,413
Scott: what's what's the point of the flash?

652
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:34,911
Scott: Superman can go fast and He's like the Superman is the flash plus more things.

653
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,820
Scott: Why do you why is the flash should just retire?

654
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:46,620
Rym: I guess because of all those aspects like the wholesome nature like he grew up in a humble Family and he learned to connect with humans, but also he's a living God on this earth.

655
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:52,460
Rym: But his powers are very limited within the bounds of like what other superheroes can do in the expanded DC Universe.

656
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:59,968
Rym: I like the stories where Superman is the only super thing Mmm, like or like like.

657
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:00,590
Rym: imagine.

658
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:06,679
Rym: Superman versus famine is a way more interesting story than Superman versus I don't know doomsday.

659
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:13,697
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean you think the number one Superman villain is Lex Luthor right who I don't know.

660
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:14,740
Scott: I'll guess over time.

661
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,685
Scott: You know if you read certain comics has superpowers, but at least nominally Lex lit the basic.

662
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:23,674
Scott: Lex Luthor is Justin is just you know, Ellen Musk right?

663
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,460
Scott: Ellen Musk is literally Lex Luthor.

664
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,208
Scott: It's a rich dude who's up to no good.

665
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:32,180
Scott: Yeah, just want you know, it's just evil, you know and runs a business.

666
00:47:32,722 --> 00:47:37,480
Scott: So it's really, you know Superman versus you know industry and capitalism, right?

667
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:37,881
Scott: That's the.

668
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:46,616
Scott: and metaphorically the story there is really good But the way it plays off it's like if there was a Superman and those an Ellen Musk.

669
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:49,129
Scott: Superman could just The end.

670
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,532
Scott: right.

671
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:50,297
Scott: why it's like.

672
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:55,557
Scott: But it's like, you know, it took a while before the you know, Lex Luthor found out about kryptonite.

673
00:47:55,617 --> 00:48:00,474
Scott: somehow Superman could just taken care of it at any time before that the end.

674
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:01,960
Scott: Why did why did this happen?

675
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:03,385
Scott: Makes no sense.

676
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:04,832
Scott: It's just silly.

677
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:05,655
Scott: so it was like this.

678
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:12,159
Scott: these metaphors Right because of the structure of the story and the personality and whatnot.

679
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:25,879
Scott: The the good metaphors and the good stories told the Superman can't escape those sort of corny Ham-fisted plot holes and various things when they try to keep the story down to earth, right?

680
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,466
Scott: and So depending on which Superman you read a lot of times It's like, you know, it's.

681
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:36,903
Scott: it's hard to digest as someone with it with a brain from the year 2020.

682
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:43,701
Rym: There is well one of the later Superman cartoons one of the more recent ones there is that they do do a really good take on Lex Luthor and they cuz like.

683
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:52,676
Rym: the long roundabout story is basically that Lex Luthor is so Fucked up in evil and Ellen Muskie that he cannot.

684
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:58,417
Rym: his main thing Is that he thinks Superman is an evil threat and always.

685
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:02,471
Scott: that's always been true Similar to JJ and Jamison, y'all spider-man only.

686
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:06,279
Scott: but JJ isn't actually evil He's just sort of like, you know.

687
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,847
Rym: But that show resolves that like.

688
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:20,919
Rym: the big plot of that show is eventually something happens and Lex Luthor Gets Superman's powers for a little while and I think there's been some comics where you know, Luther gets magic or other.

689
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:23,528
Rym: I mean, I'm pretty sure but I don't cry.

690
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:26,600
Scott: sometimes he swears like sometimes he wears like some sort of you know mech suit.

691
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,433
Scott: He's almost like an Iron Man situation, which is also very Ellen Muskie thing.

692
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:35,217
Rym: I don't like Batman I don't know which Superman thing.

693
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:35,640
Scott: I don't know

694
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,831
Rym: Because I've never read Superman comics

695
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:45,521
Scott: but it's gonna be some, you know There's gonna be some listener who knows the real deal is gonna be like, oh my god, you're so wrong about this but I'll

696
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:54,054
Rym: link to it because there's really good scene where Lex Luthor like sees everything and realizes that Superman was actually earnestly a good guy.

697
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,835
Scott: Hmm well there is you know, that's another good angle to put on Superman.

698
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:11,830
Scott: that is not often put is Even though he's a good guy right if you believe in Democracy and you believe in you know human self-determination.

699
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,929
Scott: Right Mistakes right.

700
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:25,340
Scott: even if Superman exists Right even for him to do good is Still tyrannical, right?

701
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,337
Scott: It's like there is no.

702
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:37,120
Scott: It's like even if you have a government and you vote for a president and everyone's there's an army and the army obeys the president's Orders, it's like even a Superman is just chilling at home in Kansas.

703
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,700
Scott: Everyone is effectively, you know in principle obeying Superman's orders.

704
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:47,680
Scott: Right, because if you weren't obeying his orders, he could just take the army and throw into the Sun.

705
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:56,170
Scott: So the fact that he doesn't do that or he hasn't done that means you are obeying him Even if he hasn't even opened his mouth, right just in principle.

706
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,500
Scott: the fact that he right so by his existence.

707
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:02,224
Scott: It's like there is no democracy There is no freedom.

708
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:09,439
Scott: as long as he's just there as if he's standing there doing nothing You all your freedom is in principle lost.

709
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:14,372
Scott: So if you believe in freedom, even if you trust Superman is a good person, you know.

710
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:28,160
Scott: If you believe in freedom as a principle because you're a libertarian or something You therefore must advocate for his destruction or exile or something to keep him in check.

711
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,740
Scott: You're not the government like like the president has to have kryptonite or something.

712
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:48,431
Rym: Well, I see that if you are not some libertarian dipshit and you actually believe in a bork nuanced concept of freedom Then freedom from becomes equally important as to freedom to write and freedom from Lex Luthor Or freedom from poverty.

713
00:51:48,753 --> 00:52:00,465
Rym: the Superman would be Morally justified in taking extreme actions to end poverty because unlike any human there is no consequence He could suffer and no risk He would have to take.

714
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:05,940
Rym: the risk would be to all the people around him or him making a poor decision But he's not risking anything himself.

715
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,103
Scott: Yeah there.

716
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:12,480
Scott: Well, I haven't read or heard of a Superman story where he does anything like that.

717
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,999
Scott: It's like he's from a farm.

718
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,203
Scott: It's like he could.

719
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:20,316
Scott: Superman could fly into space go to a planet where no one lives.

720
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:26,998
Scott: That is it like arable Plant enough food for like everyone forever and personally deliver it and end all.

721
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:28,988
Scott: and you know He could and you could see like, you know what?

722
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:30,879
Scott: We don't need any more shipping boats or airplanes.

723
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:32,910
Scott: I'm going to personally ship everything.

724
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,619
Scott: It'll take me five minutes every morning.

725
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,853
Scott: Right to ship all goods on earth with no climate change consequences.

726
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,860
Scott: No fossil fuels or anything, right?

727
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:45,775
Scott: Everyone who needs anything shipped just put an order in the supercomputer and I'll do it tomorrow.

728
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:46,778
Scott: every you know at 9 a.m.

729
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,289
Scott: Whatever right, but he never does anything fucking like that.

730
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,600
Scott: All right, maybe someone wrote that story, but I haven't seen it.

731
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:03,056
Scott: But that's a far cry from the original Superman who could just jump really high and punch really hard Sure, but yeah, I guess I guess the flying Superman has to come into play for that.

732
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,200
Scott: The original Superman didn't fly.

733
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,006
Rym: Yeah, well, there's there's a. the thing is the.

734
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:10,380
Rym: how powerful Superman is is a wide varies a lot.

735
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:17,198
Rym: Yeah, it literally ranges from I can jump high and punch things - I'm a literal living God composed primarily of energy.

736
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:22,340
Scott: at this point Well, I think you know at some points it's like in different stories different universes.

737
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,760
Scott: His power is different and also within a single universe his power will wax and wane over course of events, right?

738
00:53:30,842 --> 00:53:34,400
Scott: And it's also, you know the connect, you know, they'll always have some sort of explanation, right?

739
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,989
Scott: It's like oh, he's got to be near the Sun.

740
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,497
Scott: So he'll go to some other planet.

741
00:53:37,537 --> 00:53:38,040
Scott: He'll be weaker.

742
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,267
Scott: They're different.

743
00:53:39,308 --> 00:53:41,340
Rym: so I guess he just has to be near any yellow Sun.

744
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,406
Rym: There's a lot of them out there right.

745
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,718
Scott: and then kryptonite which is just really corny.

746
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:48,035
Scott: It's like he's near a particular rock.

747
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:48,417
Scott: Therefore.

748
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:48,820
Scott: He's weak.

749
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,624
Scott: It's like what it's.

750
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:52,880
Scott: you know, I'm sure they explained how the kryptonite works at some point, but I don't care.

751
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,480
Scott: It's really, you know, I guess kryptonite became a coined term which in and of itself means like, you know a weakness.

752
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:04,558
Scott: It's like you could be like, oh, that's my kryptonite and that's really my Contribution.

753
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:18,500
Scott: Yeah, it's a good contribution to the lexicon of the English language, but as a plot device, it's like really it's like you just needed something Something gives like you couldn't think of anything else, you know, and it's stuck, right?

754
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,270
Scott: It's still we're stuck with as Superman's.

755
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:29,579
Rym: now the other kind of story I enjoy quite a bit is when they Superman is basically just a modern-day Herakles too powerful for his own good.

756
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:38,338
Rym: and Even if he does if he does the right thing or the wrong thing The consequences of anything he does are just bigger than what a normal person would do.

757
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:49,178
Rym: yet He is not powerful enough to always do the right thing or make a big change so that die like this if you haven't read all the stories of Herakles or Hercules?

758
00:54:49,298 --> 00:54:57,980
Rym: if you're If you don't know what you're talking about He fucks up a lot and it's more a tragic story than a hero story.

759
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,700
Scott: Well, yes, there's a lot of Superman story.

760
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,222
Scott: I think it's just.

761
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:03,589
Scott: that's just not Superman, but it's all.

762
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:10,079
Scott: the superheroes have this sort of same story But Superman more so because his power level is greater.

763
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:14,720
Scott: All right, and you know, he came earlier in that it's like, okay, you're Superman.

764
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:18,095
Scott: Someone's falling off a building the old classic right.

765
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,019
Scott: Superman's gonna catch him.

766
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:25,447
Scott: if Superman doesn't catch him then Isn't that equivalent?

767
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,385
Scott: Superman could have caught him at basically no cost Because you're Superman.

768
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:37,513
Scott: if Superman lets him at the ground or is too busy or whatever That's equivalent to Superman throwing them off the building, right?

769
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:38,216
Scott: It's like you make.

770
00:55:38,236 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott: you made that happen effectively.

771
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,740
Scott: You could have stopped it and chose not to that edges into your trolley.

772
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,703
Scott: Your power is.

773
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:45,548
Scott: your power is so high.

774
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,677
Scott: you were responsible for catching them and didn't right.

775
00:55:48,778 --> 00:56:02,972
Scott: you killed, you know It's like and that moral, you know, Superman being a good person would feel right responsible for that You know and other superheroes would probably have the same thing When you have more so much more power, but

776
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:08,210
Rym: if you want to explore that idea, that's literally just the trolley problem You're better off just watching The Good Place than a Superman story,

777
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:08,913
Scott: right?

778
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,307
Scott: But Superman, you know, so old Relative to the other superheroes, right?

779
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:13,890
Scott: You got to remember.

780
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,560
Scott: it's like there were the history of comics.

781
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,737
Scott: It's like comics were romance stories horror stories, mostly Westerns, right some sci-fi stuff.

782
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:32,080
Scott: and then you get here Stuff Yeah, then you had you know, the comics code coming in and being like no no No, all this stuff is too inappropriate for the children's right?

783
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:41,233
Scott: We can't be having that, you know cracking down in the comics and then it's like yeah There were superhero stories around but Superman action comics number one.

784
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,940
Scott: It's like when that come came out, right?

785
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,106
Scott: That's like okay.

786
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:45,951
Scott: We got something.

787
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:51,660
Scott: it obeys the comics code It's appropriate for the children and it's a smash hit right, you know?

788
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,974
Scott: Because we don't have our you know Westerns and whatnot anymore which are not appropriate for the kids or at least not like.

789
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,387
Scott: we use not the Westerns like we used to Have and that started.

790
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,437
Scott: all the other superheroes stuff came after that right?

791
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:04,340
Scott: There's no Superman.

792
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:05,968
Scott: Spider-man wasn't until the 60s.

793
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:16,541
Scott: Yeah way after Superman Batman was years later - everyone came after super one was what 1938.

794
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,689
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's old shit.

795
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:21,239
Rym: Yeah, that's pre World War two.

796
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:23,982
Scott: Yep Really old.

797
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:26,829
Scott: Yeah, Captain America was coming to punch Nazis.

798
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:27,951
Scott: It's like Superman.

799
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,457
Scott: there weren't even Nazis when there was a Superman.

800
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,444
Scott: Yeah He was.

801
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:35,879
Scott: he was doing his super biz before then just fighting mad scientists and whatnot.

802
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:44,977
Rym: Yeah, whatever, you know and I won't uh, I won't belabor this point But one of my favorite portrayals of Superman still is in the Frank Miller Batman dark.

803
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:47,525
Scott: We talked about that already But we did.

804
00:57:47,565 --> 00:58:05,679
Rym: the episode we did on that comic is worth listening to if you're interested in this conversation because we talked about Superman a lot in that episode because Superman despite how few appearances he has in that comic is Like is such an overbearing presence when he appears on the page.

805
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:19,380
Scott: Yeah, so the last thing is so, you know, not everyone, you know You can like tell a Superman story legally because you got to have the license He's still owned even though certain things are so old the public domain like the old cartoons.

806
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:23,460
Scott: You can't just go making a Superman comic on your own and sell it for money, right?

807
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:37,920
Scott: But a lot of you know, the Superman's powers flying strength, you know laser eyeball, right freeze breath Those all became like the template for other superheroes because you just gave him the same powers or almost the same powers, right?

808
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,460
Scott: It's like oh, you know, you got a bunch of heroes flying around together right punching real hard or a super strength, whatever.

809
00:58:45,043 --> 00:59:01,458
Scott: So what you have seen is even if Superman himself doesn't officially Tell the kinds of stories that I would like to see from Superman at least often enough You do see a lot of times other people writing superhero stories with a superhero.

810
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:04,147
Scott: That is Effectively fucking Superman.

811
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,776
Scott: right they fly they punch hard.

812
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:08,100
Scott: They're basically invincible.

813
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:15,680
Scott: They just have a big like are on their chest maybe Yeah, or something like that and they just tell a story that could have been a Superman story.

814
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:16,583
Scott: But isn't?

815
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:18,229
Scott: it's in some other person

816
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:30,926
Rym: that is actually the legacy of Superman that I am the most Invested in the people who take the long shadow of Superman and tell the story of a Superman themselves Not the canonical Superman, you

817
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,660
Scott: know, I mean people do that with Superman to miniseries alternate universes and whatnot.

818
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:46,784
Scott: But one one that comes to mind that I like a lot which isn't the greatest But I have it and I've read it all is there was a series called rising stars and in it There's a bunch of superheroes.

819
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,869
Scott: But one of them is Superman.

820
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,752
Scott: ish, right?

821
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:55,599
Scott: It's sort of Superman Captain America ish type of character and spoilers for rising stars.

822
00:59:57,002 --> 01:00:04,700
Scott: He goes around the whole world and just takes Like all the nuclear weapons on earth from every country just yoinks him and throws him and gets rid of him.

823
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:05,563
Scott: It's just like fuck.

824
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:06,266
Scott: That's it.

825
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:07,732
Scott: I forced nuclear dearmament.

826
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:08,575
Scott: right deal with it.

827
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:09,338
Scott: Um, what are you gonna?

828
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:09,820
Scott: just stop me?

829
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,318
Scott: You know, I can't stop me with the nuke.

830
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:16,075
Scott: I'm effectively scary and he just fucking does it and it's like.

831
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:18,044
Scott: that's the shit I love to see.

832
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:20,976
Scott: right that sort of stuff that you know.

833
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:25,198
Scott: Superman Occasionally does stuff like that but not often enough.

834
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,627
Rym: Harley Quinn actually does it there.

835
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:33,909
Rym: Superman take is interesting too because when he shows up he not only is all-powerful But he also like doesn't show up when he should.

836
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,659
Scott: and well, that's that's what Saitama does.

837
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:42,599
Rym: Yeah But he's very much portrayed as I like, you know, you could be doing a lot more buddy.

838
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:48,480
Scott: Listen, well, I think the other well, it depends on which DC, you know, if you're going DC Universe stuff, right?

839
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,434
Scott: It's like a lot of times Superman is dealing with even bigger problems in outer space.

840
01:00:52,534 --> 01:00:53,236
Scott: Hmm, right?

841
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:56,126
Scott: It's like yeah There's people falling off buildings.

842
01:00:56,166 --> 01:01:04,247
Scott: There's a there's a mad scientist doing a crime or you know, see the you know Something like that, but it's like bro Asteroid is gonna like hit the earth.

843
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:06,640
Scott: Superman is you know, he can't just do that instantly.

844
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,380
Scott: Okay, it takes him at least a little time to go fly out there push the asteroid right onto some different orbit.

845
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,221
Rym: I guess so It's.

846
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:20,660
Rym: I've never really read or engaged with much Superman not doing like very mundane earth stuff.

847
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:30,400
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you read, you know, a lot of that like crisis infinite earths Like he's just doing outer space dealing with all kinds of outer space like time shit, right?

848
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:39,339
Scott: Making sure the fabric of the universe doesn't fall apart right, you know dealing with that sort of god-tier, you know threats Right cuz who else is gonna do it?

849
01:01:41,342 --> 01:01:46,740
Scott: Batman is not dealing with that shit Even though they end up in DC finding some way for him to help with that kind of stuff.

850
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:53,400
Rym: Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of DC Universe stuff is predicated on the concept of how do we cram Batman in here?

851
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:55,603
Rym: So this will sell Sometimes.

852
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:56,714
Scott: but you know, it's like.

853
01:01:56,734 --> 01:02:02,099
Scott: yeah The flash just runs fast, even though sometimes they find a way that for the flash to help with it, too.

854
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:08,266
Scott: But yeah, I know what other DC, you know, I guess there's like plastic man I was like, you know, we're Harley Quinn.

855
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:11,217
Scott: Harley Quinn isn't gonna stop the space-time riff from ending the unit.

856
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:15,370
Rym: Oh in fact Spoilers Gotham gets fucking destroyed at the end of the first season.

857
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:15,872
Rym: Let's just like

858
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:17,639
Scott: if one of the you know

859
01:02:19,982 --> 01:02:22,699
Rym: Cool now I get to hang out in a wrecked city fuck y'all, right

860
01:02:23,502 --> 01:02:33,798
Scott: If there's some DC villain going around not like the Joker but like Darkseid or some nonsense like yeah Only Superman's gonna be on the level to do anything about that.

861
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:43,285
Rym: Yeah So I'm gonna read a lot because the other thing about Superman's personality is all that the attributes we have talked about Really did come later.

862
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:47,900
Rym: in the earliest days Superman was quote rough and aggressive.

863
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:52,662
Rym: He often used excessive force and terror against criminals and on occasions Yeah, he was just.

864
01:02:52,742 --> 01:02:56,195
Scott: it was like a you know, like a mean Dick Tracy kind of like you.

865
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:59,878
Rym: look at the early concept designs And he's this kind of just jolly looking dude.

866
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,645
Scott: Yeah, he just was really strong.

867
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:03,828
Scott: Yeah, and no one.

868
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:08,420
Rym: he was bulletproof and the comics code actually forced the change in his personality.

869
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:16,220
Rym: hmm So you only had a couple years of mean killing Superman and then he turned into the boy the Blue Wonder Boy Scout.

870
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:19,700
Scott: I mean you only had a little while of gun Batman.

871
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,348
Scott: Yeah And it was just a detective.

872
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:30,380
Scott: and then and then all the way in the future Batman's got a kryptonite gun But no regular yeah, then the the censors turned him into corny old Adam West Batman.

873
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,992
Scott: Yeah, because the cod the Silver Age Batman is a lot like that.

874
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:35,115
Scott: Adam West TV show.

875
01:03:35,155 --> 01:03:36,520
Scott: all corny, right?

876
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:43,667
Scott: It's all this, you know wacky and whatever you see like those really silly like memes made with up like, you know Cutouts from a Batman comic.

877
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:46,120
Scott: that's what it's from Silver Age Batman for sure.

878
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:55,020
Rym: I appreciate this moment where uh Harley Quinn literally challenges Batman or father Superman to a fight and in response is just he laughs slightly and then he leaves.

879
01:03:56,621 --> 01:03:59,950
Scott: Mmm, and you know Silver Age Superman comics, right?

880
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,655
Scott: We're sort of like equally silly.

881
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:06,578
Scott: you ever see those ones where it's like You know, like what's it called?

882
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,100
Scott: This where it's like, oh, you know, it comes it there's like all those comedic ones that come.

883
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,071
Scott: I can't find any of them on the internet right now.

884
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:18,125
Rym: Yeah, I Read a lot of those Because they're corny.

885
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:22,018
Scott: Yeah, that's why you just see them as memes on you know, the internet, right?

886
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,547
Scott: Yeah here Oh, like, you know, here we go Superman.

887
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:26,314
Scott: How can here we go Superman?

888
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:34,340
Scott: it from July number 218 it cost 15 cents right and on the comic you've got a shocked Superman.

889
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:41,360
Scott: You've got a woman who says who's pointing at a little superboy who's flying and the woman says how can you deny?

890
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,425
Scott: I'm your wife Superman.

891
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:45,060
Scott: You signed our marriage certificate and there's your super son.

892
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,599
Scott: Why did you leave us see daddy me fly just like you?

893
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,447
Scott: Featuring Superman's secret past right?

894
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:54,077
Scott: It's like that's Silver Age biz right there.

895
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:54,839
Scott: That is not.

896
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:56,959
Rym: Well, what do you get into like crypto?

897
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:09,419
Scott: All that stuff that is all Silver Age stuff that you know, that's what happens when you're an old superhero No matter what you are No matter what your story is.

898
01:05:10,122 --> 01:05:15,800
Scott: Any superhero that was around in those days went through those that corny storytelling trend of the Silver Age.

899
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:24,268
Scott: It's like this dude's a god and you're threatening him with like, you know some daytime talk show Who's the who's the baby daddy shit?

900
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:24,951
Scott: It's like what.

901
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:27,140
Scott: but on another why does he even care?

902
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,800
Rym: You can argue that that is a lot like like look at old Greek gods again.

903
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:43,280
Rym: It's just a ridiculous talk show drama nonsense baby mama drama constantly Mm-hmm, and the gods care a lot about this for some reason Yep, so maybe Superman cared a lot about it in that era.

904
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:52,195
Rym: I think we don't have to worry about the the poison pill of Trying to make a canonically consistent Superman because trying to make can it's not possible.

905
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:57,440
Rym: trying to make cannons out of any Large thing is just an exercise in like nerd futility.

906
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:12,040
Scott: So, yeah, yeah, you know I do like the it's you know Because of those core features of the story that are good You know to explore and it's like you could explore them endlessly.

907
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,886
Scott: Right this you meant.

908
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:18,519
Scott: it it's possible to keep Superman like around and relevant even to this day.

909
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:23,019
Scott: But I you know, I think it's simply the company that owns it.

910
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:30,040
Scott: Right not wanting to like, you know go down those roads because they're too, you know serious and heavy biz.

911
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:32,939
Scott: To go down those roads is why?

912
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:39,156
Scott: You know, you don't see you know, the like DC movies killing it the way the Marvel movies are killing it.

913
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:42,266
Scott: Mm-hmm You know cuz Marvel has always.

914
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:49,974
Scott: you know, there are the godlike figures in Marvel are all in outer space pretty much You don't have to write and they're usually a threat.

915
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:51,300
Scott: They're not usually your main hero.

916
01:06:51,562 --> 01:06:57,820
Rym: Your main heroes are always people in New York who just live there And for a lot of reasons, they kind of just keep the x-men off to the side.

917
01:06:59,022 --> 01:07:02,817
Scott: But even the x-men are just you know, they're mutants but they're they're still human they're now.

918
01:07:02,837 --> 01:07:03,440
Rym: they're not God.

919
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,963
Rym: Cyclops could be taken out by a bullet if someone was careful Right.

920
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:09,309
Scott: I mean almost every.

921
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:12,122
Scott: if Superman came to the Marvel Universe It's like who.

922
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:15,494
Scott: anyone who lives on earth is pretty much not gonna fuck with them, right?

923
01:07:15,976 --> 01:07:17,060
Scott: Is there any Marvel?

924
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,394
Scott: I would are some but not any major not any major ones.

925
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:29,419
Scott: You know, we're taking out any of the psychic characters Maybe but you know Thor level right is a Thor level character That's true.

926
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:38,193
Scott: But you know what keeps Thor right from being Superman in the Marvel Universe is that you know There's other gods in Asgard right?

927
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:39,199
Scott: It's like Odin's there.

928
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,682
Scott: It's like.

929
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:44,573
Scott: it's not like Thor is the number one dude, right Superman is.

930
01:07:44,613 --> 01:07:47,080
Scott: that is the top dog right in the DC Universe.

931
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:47,341
Scott: There's.

932
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,567
Scott: no it's not like there's some other.

933
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,994
Scott: there are but there aren't.

934
01:07:52,154 --> 01:08:00,280
Scott: effectively there's not like name one Name someone who's more who's more important some decent only if you're someone who's not a DC Comics nerd name one.

935
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,745
Rym: Yeah, that's a better way to put it.

936
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:06,199
Scott: Yeah, but yeah name one name one that someone on the street knows who they are.

937
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:18,800
Rym: I think the important thing to just take away from Superman is just that There's so much media that you don't need to think about like oh I like Superman or I don't like Superman or just Superman is a kind of story.

938
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:31,399
Rym: It's almost like a modern folklore that is so pervasive in the end in our storytelling today that the echoes of Superman are in All this other media and the echoes of Superman in just how we talk about things.

939
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:36,930
Rym: Like you said using the word kryptonite That is the most fascinating thing about Superman far more.

940
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,720
Rym: So than most of the stories told about him specifically.

941
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:56,938
Scott: Yeah, even somebody who's like, you know Never in their whole life watched or read or any Superman thing ever Right, even some kid right who's just just in elementary school will know what you mean if you say something something's kryptonite.

942
01:08:57,118 --> 01:09:04,305
Scott: Yeah So Everyone sees the S in that shape thing, you know It's might as well be a coke.

943
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:08,359
Rym: there are exactly two cool S's and everyone in America has seen both of them.

944
