1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,689
Rym: It's Thursday, August 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:10,051
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,942
Scott: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,288
Rym: - And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:17,080
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about natural disasters.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,757
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,220
Rym: So, uh, right, we are about to do the show on time.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,280
Rym: You know, we haven't done a lot of shows lately because a bunch of, you know, travel and personal stuff we were doing.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,140
Scott: - But this is-- - And no shows next week either.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,045
Rym: Yup, next week.

11
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,785
Rym: So, uh, we won't be doing regular-- Which isn't out of the ordinary.

12
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,540
Scott: 'cause there is a PAX West next week, not that we'll be at it.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,082
Scott: - Yeah.

14
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:38,579
Scott: - But we wouldn't have done shows next week normally.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Rym: But we were delayed doing the show today because I came home to find a copyright strike on our channel.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:59,740
Rym: Which isn't that, like, copyright shit comes at us all the time, but it's worth noting that 100% of the bogus copyright things that have come to our channel in the history of our YouTube channel have been for anime.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,472
Rym: Nothing else ever gets copied.

18
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:03,860
Rym: It's only anime stuff.

19
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:11,840
Rym: But in this case, it was an audio-only livestream review, like the live show where we reviewed Cells at Work.

20
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,240
Rym: And the copyright strike, not a claim, but a full-on strike, was for nothing.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,220
Rym: It was for, like, a still screenshot from the show while we reviewed it.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
Scott: Which is absolutely fair use to put up a still image from a thing that you're reviewing, right?

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:43,140
Scott: No, what I find, I'm pretty sure, so if you look on my channel, the only anime thing I've ever posted on my YouTube channel is the episodes where we did the Judge Anime by its cover, which contained still images from many anime.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:55,060
Rym: - Oh, the Judge Anime from its cover from Anime Boston, and pretty much every anime review we've ever done, they have, not strikes, but they all have Sony or someone has monetized your video on them.

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,080
Scott: - Oh, I don't know, I haven't checked to see if that's the case.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,586
Rym: - Every anime panel we've ever done has that.

27
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,960
Rym: The Judge Animes from the few conventions, we did them have that.

28
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:10,000
Rym: Every episode of our entire show has that, and nothing else on the channel has that.

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,889
Scott: - Let me just check here.

30
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:12,735
Scott: Content...

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:24,500
Rym: - But I guess that was annoying, so I actually had to deal with all the copyright strike stuff, because the problem is, even though it's clear, fair use, there's basically no upside for us to actually fight it.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Rym: - The actual answer here is that you basically just shouldn't ever do anime stuff on YouTube ever, because there's literally no upside for you.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,860
Scott: - So the seven Judge Anime by its cover videos that I have on YouTube have no restrictions, no nothing whatsoever.

34
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:48,500
Scott: They're 100% clean, even though they contain many images from anime, but those images are in a box in the top corner.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Scott: They're not like a full screen, you know, I don't think I did too many full screen images, if any.

36
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,760
Scott: And also, I didn't put the names of any of the anime, I don't think...

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:08,459
Rym: - See, that's the key, because the videos that are getting these strikes have the name of an anime somewhere in the description, and it seems like we know, because Nintendo does this too.

38
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,200
Rym: Anime companies are just like, they do literal illegal things with copyright, but there's no recourse.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,646
Scott: - I'm pretty confident.

40
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:28,580
Scott: what they're doing is they just go on YouTube and they search, in this case, they search for cells at work, right, a show that they own the rights to, and they just select select all and push claim, they don't actually watch the videos or anything.

41
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:52,946
Scott: And I think, you know, they could, you know, with, you know, obviously there's the perfect system, what they should do, right, but I think a minor change that they could make that would solve a lot of this would simply to be, when someone makes a manual claim like this, they should have to put in the time codes of the part of the video where the thing is and write down in text what the thing is in that time code that they're claiming against.

42
00:03:52,966 --> 00:04:00,393
Scott: Like, ah, there's a screenshot of our copyrighted cells at work character at one minute and 20 seconds, right, it's just, that's it.

43
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:15,936
Scott: And if they, if we just require that minimum level and verify that they're not just faking that, right, just put like the minimum verification so they don't just like put one minute on every single, put the same time code on all of them without actually looking, force them to watch the videos, at least.

44
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:23,330
Scott: If they're forced to watch the videos, they can't just search for cells at work and click claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, right, that would become too onerous.

45
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,418
Scott: They would actually have to watch them all.

46
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:37,706
Scott: And if that was the case, they would have to, you know, or they would be focusing on the ones that were clearly easy to violate, be like, hey, this is literally an episode of our show that has been uploaded in its entirety,

47
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:38,329
Rym: just

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:05:00,717
Scott: the whole, you know, they don't have to click a time code, they can just click, say, whole video, it's our show, next, right, whereas for our video, which, you know, a video that's fair use is a lot, it can be a lot harder, you know, they're going to skip right over when they see just two talking heads there, right, they're not going to waste their time watching an hour of GeekNights to figure out where the the screenshot is up for, right,

49
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:06,320
Rym: yeah, because this one in particular was manually created, meaning it wasn't YouTube flagging it, they went and found it.

50
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:17,903
Scott: They let you know if it was like the automatic system that, you know, listens for music and finds a violation versus a human being whose job it is to search and click on things to find copyright violations,

51
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:18,787
Rym: but I guess that's

52
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,233
Scott: nice of them, they do let you know that.

53
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:24,611
Rym: They do, but I mean, obviously the only actual solution to this is the U.S.

54
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:31,860
Rym: Congress has to pass laws that radically reform copyright in fundamental ways and real protections for fair use, but that's not going to happen ever.

55
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:43,597
Scott: So in somewhat related, you know, news, Twitch is now just on their own voluntarily, giving people who are banned from Twitch more information about why they were banned.

56
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:49,482
Scott: It's not like, you know, to the level that it needs to be, but that is a, I think that is a positive step in the right direction.

57
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,271
Scott: It's like, we've banned you, right, why did we ban you?

58
00:05:52,331 --> 00:06:05,561
Scott: You violated this rule and it was, you were streaming on this day, you know, at this time, this is where you broke the rule, this is just any explanation whatsoever, as opposed to you have violated our terms of service, you're banned.

59
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,606
Scott: the end, right?

60
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:19,807
Scott: Just a little bit of, you know, it's not full habeas corpus, right, which is not necessary, but it's, you know, along those same lines of, right, if you're going to try some, if you're going to punish someone, you have to tell them what they're being punished for, that core principle,

61
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,293
Rym: but I guess

62
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:32,691
Scott: it would be good if there was a law, probably won't be for many, if not for a long time, if ever, that, yeah, if you ban someone from your service, you kind of have to explain why,

63
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:33,654
Rym: right, you know?

64
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:43,720
Rym: But basically, because people don't want to risk their entire channel being deleted, they have no choice but to just accept these things and just let these companies take down their videos, give them strikes, etc.

65
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:57,432
Scott: I think what we could do, what I would recommend people do is, you know, if you're a nerd doing anime content specifically, and, you know, you have a channel like, you know, Rims, which has mixed stuff, make a separate channel for your anime bits.

66
00:06:57,452 --> 00:07:04,524
Rym: Yep, because, like I said, this is something we've, I've talked about this in public and in many other places, but we haven't really talked about it a lot in GeekNights.

67
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:12,535
Rym: This is the reason we, as GeekNights, do not make a lot of anime content, like, we kind of, it is, it is a major reason, it is not the reason.

68
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,504
Rym: Well, it's significant reason.

69
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:19,422
Rym: It is the reason I have not made more antenna videos, because we would make more.

70
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:26,105
Rym: I have actually, like, had lawyers write things to keep some of those antenna videos up, and it's just not worth the hassle.

71
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:29,961
Scott: Like, I've never- We would make more than we do, if not for this.

72
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:36,810
Rym: Well, like, JudgeAnimePad's cover is super fun to make, and honestly, doing panels and anime cons is also super fun, but, like, here's the subtle thing.

73
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:46,323
Rym: If we go to a PAX, or a MAGFest, or, like, any other, any non-anime convention, and we do a panel, we can video that panel and put it on YouTube.

74
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,493
Rym: We cannot put any anime panels on YouTube.

75
00:07:49,854 --> 00:08:00,674
Scott: We can do that, as long as we do an anime panel that involves only us talking, with no screenshots, and no audio, or any content from the anime whatsoever, and don't do any of the fun, awesome types of anime panels.

76
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:06,577
Scott: And then do not mention the names of any anime titles in our title or description on YouTube.

77
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,868
Scott: Simply say, like, I judge anime by its cover, right?

78
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:23,175
Scott: Do not include the names of any anime that would come into search, and don't put any videos or screenshots in the content of the panel, or, if you do, at the anime con, put the videos into your panel.

79
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:26,486
Scott: When you do the YouTube, edit them out, so that they're not there, right?

80
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:38,407
Scott: Put, like, a, you know, be like, you know, just put, like, a black box over it, and mute the audio, and put a subtitle that's, like, the opener to whatever is playing at this time, right?

81
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:51,422
Rym: But without that mixed media, I find that anime panels, especially at the level, like, the kinds of content that, like, we would like to watch, and that people like to see at cons, that's, that pretty much removes the things people actually want to see.

82
00:08:51,462 --> 00:09:02,283
Rym: Like, it does remove, yeah, you, like, for example, the most popular anime thing we ever did was, like, well, at cons at least, were the anime openers from around the world type panels.

83
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:02,926
Scott: You can't do that.

84
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,052
Scott: You absolutely can't do that.

85
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,439
Scott: You absolutely cannot do.

86
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:16,294
Scott: Which sucks, because that content is, but that, but that is a great content, but it is literally just playing someone else's stuff that someone else made, right?

87
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,080
Scott: It's not something that we made.

88
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,186
Rym: With transformative commentary, though, it is clear.

89
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:24,160
Rym: It does have trans, I'm not, I'm not arguing against that.

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,630
Rym: Yeah, all I'm saying is that that panel, as presented, is clear, like, unambiguous fair use.

91
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:38,188
Scott: Sure, I'm not if you actually have something to say.

92
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,693
Rym: Oh, so here's another example.

93
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:44,772
Scott: We could make a panel that's, like, you know, the history of some such-and-such.

94
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,489
Scott: You know what panel, like, our gaming panels with slides and text and, you know.

95
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,374
Rym: You know what panel we did?

96
00:09:49,394 --> 00:10:07,025
Rym: It was at one of the last Anime Bostons we went to that actually got, like, one of the biggest audiences we ever had in a room at an anime con was when we did that analyzing anime panel where we talked about Utena, and we, and the like 20 seconds,

97
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,030
Scott: and then we

98
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,752
Rym: spent 20 minutes talking about the allegory and the symbolism and, like, look, there's one cat, now there's two cats.

99
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,498
Rym: Look at this frame of animation.

100
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:18,442
Rym: What's going on here?

101
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,895
Rym: That is compelling content, and you literally can't put that anywhere.

102
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,384
Rym: It's just not worth the hassle.

103
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,032
Scott: You could remove the two minutes of clip from it.

104
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,400
Scott: Don't put the word Utena in the title.

105
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:44,220
Scott: Put, like, analyzing a cool anime from the early 90s and your title, and then you would put a link to, like, you know, to say, "Hey, yeah, this clip that you should watch here is Utena episode three.

106
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,092
Scott: Start watching it, you know, the third minute to the sixth

107
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:47,394
Scott: minute.".

108
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,142
Rym: Yeah, but you see what's going on here.

109
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,975
Rym: That is all a hassle, and that is why the end result of all this.

110
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,925
Scott: I'm not saying it's not a hassle, but you can do it.

111
00:10:54,066 --> 00:11:04,447
Rym: But I'm saying the end result of that, just because I've never said this out on GeekNights, is that that kind of shit is why I don't even bother doing any anime shit other than reviews on the podcast.

112
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:05,731
Rym: Like, I gave up.

113
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,018
Rym: I made one AMV, never making one again, etc.

114
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,849
Scott: Just don't, just, you know, do anime.

115
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,676
Scott: Figure out something that you have.

116
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:19,426
Scott: If you have something to say about anime, if you have a lot of knowledge about anime, you shouldn't need to actually show the anime, right?

117
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:26,280
Scott: It's like if you take a Siskel and Ebert episode, right, and you just, you know, on that show, if you've ever watched Siskel and Ebert, they're both dead now, right?

118
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:33,847
Scott: If you've ever watched that old show where they do movie reviews, they do show clips from the movie in that TV show.

119
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:45,852
Scott: But if you edit out the parts with the clips from the movie, the parts that are just Siskel and Ebert chatting with each other are sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong, but that's a show on its own.

120
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,836
Scott: You don't need the clips.

121
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:50,709
Rym: But without the mixed media, it is far less compelling and a lot fewer people watch.

122
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:55,465
Scott: It is indeed, but you could just upload the talking part only.

123
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,475
Scott: You could do it and then they wouldn't come after you.

124
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,430
Rym: Yeah, but I'd say that defeats the purpose and ain't worth the effort.

125
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,034
Rym: So there's a lot of reasons why you're never going to see more of those Utena episodes.

126
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:17,507
Rym: Like, I'm just never even going to bother making that kind of content because that show, without showing a clip on the screen or a screenshot, there's no way to have the kind of conversation we're having because we're saying things like, "Look who's in the background in this

127
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:17,968
Rym: scene.".

128
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,284
Rym: So if you wondered why the Utena show is dead, that's pretty much it.

129
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:29,004
Rym: Some other news that a normal, more traditional GeekNights' met a open-y bit.

130
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,995
Rym: I biked home from work because I go to the office occasionally.

131
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:33,420
Scott: Have I made the news yet?

132
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:34,864
Rym: No.

133
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:35,969
Scott: We're already going long here.

134
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:36,270
Scott: Let's go.

135
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,511
Scott: I'm hungry.

136
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:39,182
Rym: We always go long because we don't do that many shows lately.

137
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,270
Rym: We also don't talk except during the show.

138
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,595
Rym: You don't need to talk about this.

139
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,100
Scott: Let's skip to the news.

140
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,502
Rym: No, no, no.

141
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,608
Rym: Because this is my news too.

142
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:46,553
Rym: This leads into my news.

143
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,579
Scott: Oh, it's also your news.

144
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:47,840
Scott: Okay.

145
00:12:48,040 --> 00:13:03,080
Rym: So biking home today, one is like 100 degrees and two, I encountered the worst car traffic I have literally ever seen or experienced in Manhattan in the entirety of my life today.

146
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:13,210
Rym: More gridlock than I have ever seen to the point that it was blocking bike lanes and it actually made my commute on a bike take almost 15 more minutes.

147
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:19,311
Rym: And for context, that is more than 100% increase from how long it normally takes me to bike home.

148
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,557
Scott: I don't think the U.N.

149
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:22,285
Scott: is in session right now.

150
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:22,686
Rym: Nope.

151
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,895
Scott: I think that's the worst I saw was when the U.N.

152
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:25,618
Scott: was in session.

153
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,502
Rym: This was worse than that.

154
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:31,022
Scott: It was only in certain areas because that, you know, in the detour zones that it was super bad.

155
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,367
Rym: This was worse than that.

156
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:47,608
Rym: And when I got home, I saw an article in the Boston Globe, which is my news, and it basically said that as of now, car traffic has reached or exceeded all the pre-COVID levels everywhere in America.

157
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:58,773
Rym: And it's very notable that as this has happened, one, New York City, and there's other articles about this that aren't my news, traffic here is actually the worst it's ever been in New York City history right now.

158
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:00,580
Rym: Just generally.

159
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:14,281
Rym: And air quality is at historic lows because the only time the air quality was ever good in New York was that brief window during the terrifying heights of the COVID pandemic when nobody was driving.

160
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:20,120
Scott: Cars have just- There were times, there was a time when air quality was good in New York.

161
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,345
Rym: Oh yeah, before the car existed.

162
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,756
Scott: No, it was- And before industry moved here.

163
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:26,980
Scott: Steam engines.

164
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,334
Scott: No, before then there were still horses and cows.

165
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,901
Scott: It's before then, before any white people came here.

166
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:34,283
Rym: That's why.

167
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,460
Scott: But what's interesting is that- It didn't stink until the white people came.

168
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,763
Scott: Pissed all over it.

169
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:48,925
Rym: The car traffic seems to be the cause of the far majority of the like human recognizable pollution in the air here.

170
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,488
Scott: In this area, yes.

171
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:56,522
Scott: The biggest polluting thing in New York City is cars followed probably by power plants.

172
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,588
Scott: But it's so hard to- I'm guessing.

173
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:07,937
Rym: It's so weird to remember that year recently where New York City just smelled like the world as opposed to smelling like pollution.

174
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,264
Rym: And now it smells like pollution again.

175
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,230
Rym: The air quality is bullshit.

176
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:18,470
Scott: Which leads right into my news that maybe with a new governor we could get the congestion pricing.

177
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,692
Rym: Finally.

178
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:25,471
Scott: So I don't know how if where listeners are or how much they know about what happens in New York.

179
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,054
Rym: But you know what?

180
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,440
Rym: New York news is global news.

181
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,492
Scott: Sure, what country you're in, if you even understand.

182
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,542
Scott: New York is a state, right?

183
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:44,317
Scott: We're in the United States, but we still have a governor who is not the governor in the, you know, Britain pirate sense of governor, but is a governor as in effectively the president of New York.

184
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:49,796
Scott: It's like you're the executive, you know, chief in the state government, right?

185
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,704
Scott: The state, not New York City, right?

186
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,032
Scott: The whole state includes Rochester, Albany.

187
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,320
Scott: In fact, the capital is Albany.

188
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,463
Scott: New York isn't even the freaking capital of the state, even though the governor hangs out in the city most of the time.

189
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:04,870
Rym: People only go to Albany when it's time to do- Not that the governor listens to anything anyone in the city gives a shit about.

190
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:05,711
Scott: No.

191
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:12,370
Scott: But anyway, so the governor of New York has been Andrew Cuomo for quite a long time.

192
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:19,796
Scott: His father was a governor previously, not the immediately previous governor, but, you know, a governor a while ago.

193
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:22,830
Rym: He pretty much- He was well respected generally.

194
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,739
Rym: No, not the current one, his father.

195
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,684
Rym: Oh, okay.

196
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:34,463
Scott: Cuomo won basically on, you know, name recognition, which is very powerful in elections.

197
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:40,087
Scott: And also because, you know, when you're a Democrat in New York, you got to get elected by the entire state.

198
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:54,642
Scott: So even though maybe a lot of, you know, farther left people in parts of the city, as we could see with our mayor election, a lot of the city is, you know, center or, you know, even by some, you know, depending on where your scale is, conservative Democrats.

199
00:16:54,682 --> 00:17:01,664
Rym: But if you go upstate, it's like, it is just like, I got guns and sail away.

200
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,168
Scott: So Republicans can't possibly win.

201
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:08,989
Scott: There's no chance for them in New York state, but conservative, if you're a conservative Democrat, right?

202
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,122
Scott: Then, yeah, you have a, you know, someone like the president of the US.

203
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:20,936
Rym: Because the entirety of the state outside of New York city will vote for that person in the primary and New York city will split across all the progressive candidates.

204
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,325
Scott: And also that person.

205
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:23,626
Scott: Yep.

206
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,674
Rym: And thus that person will always win the primary.

207
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,883
Scott: But no one's been- There hasn't been anyone.

208
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:36,272
Scott: There just isn't a person in New York who has had the character, whatever, as a state figure to run against him and have any chance.

209
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:41,996
Scott: So it's like, even people like me reluctantly kept voting for this guy because what the fuck are you going to do?

210
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,243
Scott: Well, it's no chance.

211
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,395
Rym: Like, you know, who runs against the Democrat in governor races in New York?

212
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:47,537
Rym: Literal Nazis.

213
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:54,157
Scott: So he's been the governor, even though basically everyone votes for him.

214
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,745
Scott: And then it's just like, you know, we hate you.

215
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:57,172
Scott: I voted for you, but I hate you.

216
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,823
Scott: But there was no choice because the other guy's way worse.

217
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,196
Scott: There's no- So he's been governor.

218
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,871
Scott: He's been doing all sorts of evil shit the whole time he's been governor, right?

219
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,880
Scott: People forget that in the olden days, right?

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:15,892
Scott: Years ago, there was like this anti, you know, this group they formed, it was like a commission to find corruption in the state government.

221
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:19,690
Scott: And they actually found one of his friends was super corrupt and put him in jail.

222
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,191
Scott: Right?

223
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:20,772
Scott: What's his name?

224
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,000
Scott: What's that guy's name?

225
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,363
Rym: I forget.

226
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,608
Scott: What was the stupid guy's name?

227
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,272
Rym: I mean, Spitzer.

228
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:30,334
Rym: There's so many.

229
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:30,855
Scott: No, no, no.

230
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:31,617
Scott: That's older.

231
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,381
Scott: Anyway.

232
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:36,428
Scott: Oh, Skelos, right?

233
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:38,351
Scott: Sheldon Silver, right?

234
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:39,694
Scott: And Skelos.

235
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:41,839
Rym: I forgot all about that.

236
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:42,781
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,423
Scott: All those guys.

238
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:49,378
Scott: So basically that anti-corruption commission had a name.

239
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:53,893
Scott: I forget its name, but it was going after it was started to look into Cuomo, right?

240
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,264
Scott: It was looking into all the other state level people.

241
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,329
Scott: It started to look into him.

242
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:58,614
Rym: So we shut it down.

243
00:18:59,356 --> 00:18:59,758
Rym: Nope.

244
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,464
Rym: No more anti-corruption thing.

245
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,692
Scott: He's like, yeah, we found the corrupt people.

246
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,154
Scott: We're good.

247
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,086
Scott: It's like, it's like he could have been done with that.

248
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:07,508
Scott: Right.

249
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,833
Scott: But he, he survived that.

250
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,143
Scott: And he basically survived a whole bunch of other shit.

251
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,794
Scott: Uh, you know, during the COVID times, right?

252
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,765
Scott: He's, he put in a big show of looking good, right?

253
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,494
Scott: Not like the Florida governor looking bad.

254
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:26,265
Scott: He looked like he was, you know, he made it appear that he had his shit under control and was, you know, doing a better job than the other governors.

255
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:27,854
Scott: that turned out to be a facade.

256
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,549
Scott: When you look at the nursing home shit, that could have been the end of him.

257
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,829
Rym: The worst part is he was still doing better than most of the governors anyway.

258
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,082
Scott: He was the whole IDC thing.

259
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,149
Scott: People don't know about that.

260
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:50,144
Scott: Or basically he, you know, he had Democrats who voted with Republicans that were like on his side in the state legislatures that he didn't have to move to the left.

261
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,211
Scott: And then we voted them all out mostly.

262
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,856
Scott: So that undid that business.

263
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:03,323
Scott: Um, but yeah, so now finally what we finally undid him is like 10th scandal is that he was a sex pest.

264
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:04,867
Scott: No surprise to anybody.

265
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:08,679
Scott: You could just, you could tell by the guy's personality that he's that kind of person.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,124
Scott: He'll just grab some asses.

267
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:15,400
Scott: Um, but he got called out by some very brave women who came forth.

268
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,371
Scott: Uh, and we, the attorney general came down on him.

269
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:23,843
Scott: Uh, and now he's finally was forced to resign, which is great.

270
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:32,291
Rym: Uh, and even, even better, it's sad that this is what it took, but, uh, there's so many other things we could have made him.

271
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,263
Rym: Now we have the first woman governor in the history of New York state.

272
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:35,484
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:41,568
Scott: So the new governor who was the person who was the deputy or, uh, Lieutenant governor, right.

274
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:47,241
Scott: You know, she's going to be governor and I guess in a couple of weeks, less than two weeks, she already now she's going to run for reelection when the cycle comes up.

275
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:47,341
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:51,477
Scott: So Kathy Hochul from Buffalo, interesting thing, right?

277
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,842
Scott: So what do you make of her?

278
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:53,183
Scott: Right.

279
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:54,548
Scott: Well, obviously better than Cuomo.

280
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,095
Scott: She's not grabbing any asses, right?

281
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:03,493
Rym: So that like Zephyr Teachout is like still too far right for me in terms of the governor.

282
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:10,939
Scott: Um, but yeah, she, Kathy Hochul is interesting because she is, you know, probably too far to the right for us.

283
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,252
Scott: She used to be even further right than she is now.

284
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:14,773
Scott: Right.

285
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:24,830
Scott: It's like, she used to be like, you know, almost Republican, basically she has moved significantly to the left, but basically it's an improvement, but it's not enough of an improvement.

286
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:48,408
Scott: Uh, the good news is that when we get to the primaries, right, where she'll have to try to, you know, actually be elected, um, as, you know, governor instead of just, she was elected Lieutenant governor, but you know, whatever, um, you know, she's going to be running against, you know, uh, Jumaane Williams, who she beat in the primary last time.

287
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:51,996
Rym: So, but Jumaane's power only grows.

288
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,062
Scott: Jumaane's power has grown.

289
00:21:54,082 --> 00:22:08,039
Scott: Uh, however, the person who took Cuomo down, Letitia James, also highly likely to run for governor and Hochul may have a very difficult time beating Letitia James.

290
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:20,017
Scott: So we'll see, you know, for me to choose between, it's weird because for me to choose between Tish and Jumaane, that's a tough choice for me, but apparently they don't like each other.

291
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:28,150
Scott: It's like, they're not big, they're not exactly friends, even though they, they were the past, you know, the current and former city advocates in New York city.

292
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:40,532
Rym: But hopefully if we don't like each other, unless we, unless the state votes to get rid of the rank choice thing, uh, the primary, but the primary for governor is still going to be not ranked right.

293
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:44,469
Scott: It's because it's not as, it's only as the rank choice is only a city thing.

294
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:52,095
Scott: So it'll be a difficult situation there come that time, um, which may advantage Hochul, depending on who's in and who's out.

295
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,435
Scott: Uh, but also what will be interesting to see is, uh, in a couple of weeks, right.

296
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:01,447
Scott: Or Hochul is going to have to appoint a lieutenant governor.

297
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:05,097
Scott: So that's going to be interesting, whoever that is.

298
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:10,979
Rym: Um, and in one last little news that is actually really relevant of all the COVID things going on.

299
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,874
Rym: One thing that's very important and I want to bring it up briefly.

300
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,902
Rym: We're not going to get into this in depth.

301
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:28,469
Rym: We want to get into the main bit, but, uh, for the future of things getting, looking better, the U S military, the Pentagon is going to require all service members to get the COVID vaccine, uh, basically within a month.

302
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:29,731
Scott: Good.

303
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,477
Rym: That's a huge deal.

304
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:38,899
Scott: Does that only include, does that only include people who are like straight up enlisted slash officers?

305
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:43,415
Scott: So it doesn't include like private company guy who's working on the boat.

306
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:46,189
Scott: He's not actually in the Navy, but he's just, he's on the Navy boat.

307
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,025
Rym: We don't know for sure because the official like thing is not out yet.

308
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:51,692
Rym: We don't know exactly who's covered.

309
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,642
Rym: We do know active service members are covered.

310
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:54,788
Rym: We also know, I don't

311
00:23:54,808 --> 00:24:16,130
Scott: know if people realize like just how many like private citizens who work for private companies are like on military bases, on boats, provide, you know, the food service workers are not, you know, I guess sometimes they might be people who are in the military, but a lot of times it's like, that's a company they're hiring to do food service or, you know, whatever.

312
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,477
Rym: Here's why I want to highlight this.

313
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:23,404
Rym: federal employees, but there's a bunch of other news is like a whole bunch of universities are requiring the vaccine.

314
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,134
Rym: And so far all the whack jobs more and more

315
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:32,006
Scott: places are basically saying, if you're not vaccine, you can't, or at least have a fake proof that we, you know, we're going to try to verify

316
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,565
Rym: those nut jobs who tried to sue their university saying they didn't want to get the vaccine.

317
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:38,500
Rym: The court just smacked them down and said, Nope, there's universities rules.

318
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,002
Rym: Fuck you.

319
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:48,402
Scott: But I think the big thing, that's the big thing that there's a rude awakening for a lot of those anti-vax people is, you know, they try to fake the religious exemption.

320
00:24:48,984 --> 00:25:01,755
Scott: And if you try to fake the religious exemption, when it comes right down to it, they're going to check to see if you got any other vaccines, which you probably, and it's like the only way you can fly, even if you're lying about your religion, right?

321
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,525
Scott: You're an atheist or whatever, right?

322
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:11,492
Scott: Even if you're lying about it, it's like, if they see that you've had another vaccination, then it's, it's to your, your, that's it.

323
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:21,609
Rym: I'm not a lawyer, but the way this has been described to me by lawyers in the past was vaguely that the government cannot litigate whether or not your religion is real.

324
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:23,739
Rym: Like, obviously that's just the way the U S is.

325
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,236
Rym: They can't be like, Nope, you made up, you made up the flying spaghetti monster.

326
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:27,819
Rym: That doesn't count.

327
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,462
Rym: They can't do that.

328
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,010
Rym: That's why Scientology exists.

329
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:41,450
Rym: But what they can do is say that if there's an exception or anything in the law, the thing they can litigate and test is whether or not the belief you profess is quote, sincerely held,

330
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:43,056
Scott: meaning if they

331
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:47,312
Rym: can show evidence that you're insincere, then they can tell you to go fuck yourself.

332
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:48,717
Scott: That's right.

333
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,991
Scott: So like, for example, let's say a Jew, I'll talk about Jews since I am one.

334
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:52,714
Scott: That's fair, right?

335
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:54,341
Scott: Says, Oh, work.

336
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,948
Scott: You gotta let me leave early on Friday.

337
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,258
Scott: I'm a, I'm a very religious Jew, right?

338
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,708
Scott: They say, okay, leave, you know, Shabbos leave.

339
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:01,451
Scott: That's what you do, right?

340
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,213
Scott: This that's normal.

341
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:08,917
Scott: Um, and then, you know, you bring in pulled pork sandwich for lunch into the office, right?

342
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:17,646
Scott: Obviously we're not talking about situations like spying on you, trying to find out, you know, they're suspicious that, no, we're talking, you bring the pulled pork right into the office and you chow down and they see you doing that.

343
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:21,877
Scott: They can be like, uh, so you can come in on Friday.

344
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,748
Rym: It's like, yeah, maybe it is what I gather.

345
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,854
Rym: it might come down to that specific stricture.

346
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:36,763
Rym: So it, those two might be unrelated, but if say you went on a bunch of vacations, like you did, you didn't do the Shabbos thing consistently.

347
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:38,991
Rym: That's also true, right?

348
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:45,208
Scott: It's like your boss happens to run into you on Saturday at fucking Disney world.

349
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:53,290
Scott: It's like, and you're, you're lighting a fire and making two loops and eating the pulled pork sandwich.

350
00:26:55,254 --> 00:27:00,590
Rym: It's like, you know, is that is the, uh, the Scott Pilgrim movie or like chicken parm isn't vegan.

351
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:10,062
Rym: No, but, uh, but anyway, to get it before the reason I bring this up, here's why I think the military thing for active service members is important.

352
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:12,052
Rym: And it's not something you would think of.

353
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:17,856
Rym: There are two things that people are not talking about with this that I think are way more interesting than the.

354
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,561
Rym: we're getting a bunch of people vaccinated.

355
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:25,823
Rym: One, the people in the military, their choice is not, well, I just won't get the vaccine.

356
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:30,378
Rym: It is either you get the vaccine or you are dishonorably discharged.

357
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,642
Scott: Yeah.

358
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:35,314
Scott: Or you could, um, try to find another way to get discharged in time.

359
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:35,775
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:40,211
Scott: You could try to get some other legitimate excuse to get out, which is not easy.

361
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:45,130
Rym: Dishonorable discharge from the U S military is almost like an anti recommendation.

362
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,039
Rym: The military is basically saying, fuck this piece of shit.

363
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:49,604
Scott: Yeah.

364
00:27:49,684 --> 00:28:06,503
Scott: Basically if you get one of those, um, in, in the United States, then if you try to, after that, if you try to apply for a job and you put military on your resume, any employers, HR department is going to, you know, make like this, they just contact the military to get your, your service record.

365
00:28:06,564 --> 00:28:07,769
Scott: It's just standard practice.

366
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,922
Scott: Like you put a college and they get your transcript, same thing.

367
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:16,713
Scott: And if they see a dishonorable discharge there, you're basically that they can absolutely discriminate and not hire you because of that easily.

368
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:20,408
Scott: And I've, you're very hard time getting a job basically anywhere.

369
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,626
Scott: If you have that also, let's say you say, okay, I won't put military on my resume.

370
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:28,179
Scott: First of all, you're gonna have a shit resume because he got high school diploma followed by nothing.

371
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:40,310
Scott: Um, and second of all, uh, they could do a background check, which is normal for not all employers, but many, and they'll know that you were in the military and they'll find the dishonorable discharge.

372
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,081
Scott: Doesn't be like the first thing they fucking find when they look you up.

373
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,851
Scott: Um, and then they won't hire you.

374
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:53,439
Scott: So, so here's why it's like, it's basically get a vaccine or have a hard time finding a job for a long time.

375
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:53,700
Scott: So

376
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:10,044
Rym: here's why I think that is very interesting because there's already some evidence that a lot of people who are very publicly against the vaccine, if their choice is the vaccine or their job, they suddenly just very quietly get the vaccine and shut up low or they stay loud, but they get the vaccine.

377
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:10,886
Rym: And I don't care.

378
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:13,456
Rym: if they get, as long as they get the vaccine, I do not care.

379
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,345
Rym: Otherwise I just want people to get that shot.

380
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:23,558
Scott: Now, this is what I'm about to say is obviously a very simplistic, generalized thinking that clearly is not a model for the world, right?

381
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,900
Scott: It's a broad generalization, but you know, the image of this that I see is that there's some people, right?

382
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:33,828
Scott: People with, with logic and reason, right?

383
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,082
Scott: Um, and they respond to logic and reason and carrot, right?

384
00:29:38,162 --> 00:29:39,045
Scott: It's like, right.

385
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:47,994
Scott: And then, you know, and if you look Democrats, people on the left, right, we tend to be like anti punishment, anti prison, right?

386
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:54,099
Scott: We tend to be people who like, you know, look at people like water protectors who were like, they believe they're doing the right thing.

387
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,447
Scott: They'll go to prison for it.

388
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:55,929
Scott: Right.

389
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,299
Scott: You know, Gandhi's and Martin Luther Kings, right?

390
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,475
Scott: People punishment does not, you know, change their mind, right?

391
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:08,596
Scott: And they're the same people who don't believe in punishment of people that it's wrong, that it doesn't help.

392
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:09,399
Scott: Right.

393
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,983
Scott: But meanwhile, on the right, you have people who very much believe in punishing others, right?

394
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,890
Scott: And they're like, yeah, you gotta punish people.

395
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,696
Scott: That's what gets people's behavior to change.

396
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:25,253
Scott: And yet they are also people whose behavior changes with punishment.

397
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:28,162
Scott: So they respond, they respond to stick.

398
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:39,959
Scott: So the people who don't respond to stick tend to not, there tends to be a correlation with people who they don't believe in using the stick to coax behavior out of other people.

399
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,965
Scott: And they also don't respond.

400
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:47,042
Rym: You stick somehow came to the thing, the thing I'm actually going to say.

401
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,711
Rym: you came to it from a similar angle, right?

402
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:53,807
Scott: People who believe in using the stick as a motivational tool, right?

403
00:30:53,868 --> 00:31:00,190
Scott: Punish people to change the behavior of other human beings are people who themselves respond to stick.

404
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:08,271
Scott: So what we need to do is if what I'm saying in general is true, then I think it's starting to happen.

405
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:09,758
Scott: is we start with vaccine.

406
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,733
Scott: We started with carrot and it's like, we got all the carrot people, right?

407
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:18,848
Scott: It's like, if those people respond to stick, give them the stick, right?

408
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:19,711
Scott: You believe, right?

409
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:25,231
Scott: It's like, if that's true that some people respond to one thing and some people respond to the other.

410
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:29,670
Scott: There isn't one way to motivate all humans to, you know, behave a certain way.

411
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,284
Scott: Go to each person and customize the way you motivate them.

412
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:37,563
Scott: Oh, you're not going to get a vaccine, but you will if I threatened to beat the shit out of you.

413
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:38,306
Scott: Guess what?

414
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:40,135
Scott: You're a person who responds to beatings.

415
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:41,099
Scott: You get beatings.

416
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:50,219
Scott: So if you don't behave, so you're a person who doesn't respond to beatings, I could beat you to kingdom come and you still would sit at the counter and wall greens anyway, because you believe it's right.

417
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:51,667
Scott: No beatings for you.

418
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:52,190
Scott: They don't work.

419
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,025
Scott: Instead, we're going to, you know, do something else.

420
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:55,990
Rym: Give you civil rights.

421
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,712
Scott: Exactly.

422
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,279
Scott: So we're going to give you what you want.

423
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,489
Rym: For the last thing I'll say on this.

424
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:02,312
Scott: That's all you respond to.

425
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,427
Rym: The reason I brought this news up is it's one level higher than that.

426
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,473
Rym: The US military, and I don't want to give, this could be a whole show, but we got to move on to the rest of the show tonight.

427
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:13,586
Scott: Well, the military only uses, well, they use metals.

428
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:14,270
Scott: I guess they have carrots.

429
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,133
Rym: Yeah, there's carrots there.

430
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:16,658
Rym: But here's my thinking.

431
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,933
Rym: I have a hypothesis and I'm really invested in this.

432
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,080
Rym: Like, I want to see if this pans out.

433
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:33,553
Rym: The US military has a problem in that not the majority, but there is a significant white supremacist presence within the US military for a lot of reasons.

434
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:34,858
Rym: There's a lot of...

435
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,015
Scott: I mean, it's, I think it's slightly, I think from what I've seen, it's lower than in the police.

436
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,003
Rym: Oh, definitely lower than in the police.

437
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:44,214
Scott: It's still a shockingly large percentage.

438
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:51,141
Scott: It's just not like 50%, you know, I don't know what the percent is, but it's not a tiny percentage, like one, and it's not 50.

439
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,226
Scott: It's somewhere in the middle.

440
00:32:52,246 --> 00:33:04,283
Rym: So that is like, like step one, like assumption one, that there is a white supremacist problem within the US military, a subset of the US military, are dangerous white supremacists.

441
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,407
Scott: That's an absolute fact.

442
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:05,708
Scott: Yep.

443
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,778
Rym: So let's assume another thing that we also know is true.

444
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:24,350
Rym: The overlap between people who affirmatively resist the vaccine for conspiracy reasons and people who are white supremacists, that Venn diagram starts to approach a circle far more so than other types of Venn diagrams in this space.

445
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:27,903
Scott: It's not a perfect circle, but it's approaching one indeed, yes.

446
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:29,550
Scott: Very strong correlation.

447
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,985
Rym: For white supremacists in the US military then, one of two things is going to happen.

448
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:43,754
Rym: Either they believe this stuff so much that they'll accept the dishonorable discharge and there will be fewer white supremacists in the military.

449
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,118
Rym: Not zero, but fewer.

450
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:52,182
Rym: Or the white supremacists want to remain in the military so much, they'll get the goddamn vaccine.

451
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:52,784
Rym: And guess what?

452
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,154
Rym: Fine, at least you got the vaccine.

453
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:58,950
Rym: One of the things you're doing shilly in your life is less likely to kill someone.

454
00:33:59,592 --> 00:33:59,853
Scott: Yeah, right.

455
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:02,447
Scott: If you want to kill other people, you have to kill them, you know.

456
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,219
Scott: You gotta kill them with guns and systemic oppression.

457
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,150
Rym: You can't kill them by spreading COVID to them without a vaccine.

458
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,030
Rym: So that is the thing that I think is interesting here.

459
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,576
Scott: It's a positive thing for sure.

460
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:24,634
Scott: And I think in general, I think that more places in our society, it's like, yeah, people are going to fake their vaccination record and some places aren't going to check as strongly as others.

461
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:34,223
Scott: But yeah, the more places that say, "No vax, not allowed to come in, period," I think that is probably sufficient.

462
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:40,762
Scott: stick that will get us, I don't think it's going to get us 99% vaccinated, but it's going to get us well over the line.

463
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:47,443
Scott: I think, just guessing, half the resisting people would probably be convinced by that eventually.

464
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,152
Scott: As soon as they wanted to do something.

465
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:52,721
Rym: Half of them get the vaccine and the other half get a stick.

466
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:54,286
Scott: Maybe.

467
00:34:54,947 --> 00:35:07,505
Scott: Well, the stick they get is, you're going to either have to get a fake thing or you're going to have... And I think put in some sort of a punishment for people who are using a fake or faking it.

468
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,007
Rym: Oh yeah.

469
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:14,212
Rym: Well, if an outbreak happens and you're part of it and it's shown that you faked your vaccine, that should be a felony.

470
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:16,781
Scott: Yeah, a felony is fine.

471
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,707
Scott: There should be a severe punishment for faking it.

472
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:22,199
Scott: But I don't think we should go around trying to find people faking it.

473
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:22,721
Rym: It's not like...

474
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,273
Scott: No cops standing at bars checking everyone who comes in.

475
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:28,455
Scott: None of that nonsense.

476
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,509
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

477
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,667
Rym: So we're laying blades in the dark pretty regularly through this whole quarantine.

478
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:41,531
Rym: I fucking love that system.

479
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,153
Rym: We keep playing it.

480
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:47,890
Rym: And we interact with a lot of cults for a lot of reasons.

481
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,415
Rym: We're doing a lot of cult stuff lately.

482
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,145
Rym: So what I have here, my thing of the day.

483
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:57,781
Rym: This is a Warhammer themed, but it doesn't matter that it's Warhammer.

484
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,951
Rym: Warhammer happens to be a good avenue for this.

485
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,781
Rym: This is a cult random name generator.

486
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:14,927
Rym: And every single time you click generate cult name, solid fucking gold comes out of this generator.

487
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:15,550
Rym: Let's see right now.

488
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,677
Rym: The Sons of the Insatiable Twilight.

489
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,846
Rym: The Covenant of the Baleful Onsop.

490
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,353
Rym: The Descenders of the Perfect Sigil.

491
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,964
Scott: The Fraternity... Is it always the something of the something?

492
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:27,345
Scott: Yeah.

493
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,452
Rym: The Fraternity of Conquering Pleasure.

494
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,939
Rym: The Legion of the Nubile Beasts.

495
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:33,904
Scott: The Nubile Beasts?

496
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:40,026
Rym: So yeah, our blades in the dark game, every cult we encounter is just the next click in this name generator.

497
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:40,910
Rym: And it is delightful.

498
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,771
Scott: Okay.

499
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,316
Rym: So what do you got?

500
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:50,259
Scott: So there is a human being who is an amazing person that doesn't get thought of or spoken about as much as they deserve.

501
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:51,523
Scott: And that person is Mr.

502
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:51,563
Scott: T.

503
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,436
Rym: Weirdly such a fixture in my childhood, Mr.

504
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:55,696
Rym: T.

505
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:56,358
Scott: Mr.

506
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:57,682
Scott: T was big in the 80s.

507
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,410
Scott: And then, you know, was still around.

508
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,574
Scott: He's still around today.

509
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:02,116
Scott: He's alive.

510
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,907
Scott: But yeah, Nod is not as popular now.

511
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:05,450
Scott: He's also old.

512
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,298
Scott: But he was a big deal in the 80s.

513
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,894
Scott: If any, you know, for example, I mean, you look at this video, that's my thing of the day, which is Mr.

514
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:14,461
Scott: T on Letterman in 1982.

515
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,227
Scott: This was, I was zero or one.

516
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:20,161
Scott: I wasn't even one yet when this, or even when this, when Mr.

517
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:20,944
Scott: T was on Letterman.

518
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:21,868
Scott: So this was the height of Mr.

519
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,593
Scott: T. This was Rocky.

520
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,937
Scott: Was it three that Mr.

521
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,418
Scott: T was in?

522
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:26,261
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:29,168
Scott: Um, as a Rocky three was coming out.

524
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:32,197
Scott: What's a Rocky three is as old as me and Mr.

525
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:37,173
Scott: T was on Letterman promoting Rocky three in that same year that I was born.

526
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,961
Scott: And that's what this thing of the day video is.

527
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:40,166
Scott: So if Mr.

528
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:44,042
Scott: T was at his peak when I was born, of course, he's only really going to be a fixture in the childhood.

529
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:50,405
Scott: He wasn't able to remain a prominent public figure longer than, you know, 10, 20, right?

530
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,973
Rym: I don't think people younger than us know.

531
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:56,766
Rym: I don't think people a generation younger than us really even know who he is.

532
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,541
Rym: Maybe they know one quote, but don't actually know like why.

533
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,484
Scott: I pity the fool.

534
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:02,227
Scott: Everyone knows that.

535
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:02,629
Scott: Yep.

536
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,516
Rym: Everyone knows that even if they don't know where it came from.

537
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:05,680
Scott: Yeah, but Mr.

538
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,334
Scott: T is a fascinating, amazing, and incredible person.

539
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:18,387
Scott: And you can really, you know, see, this is like, you can see what he was like that, like, this is what, like, he was just becoming more famous, like at this time.

540
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:25,272
Scott: And you can see in this video, why he was able to become famous, like the, how the kind of person he was right.

541
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:28,041
Scott: Um, allowed him to achieve fame.

542
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:34,296
Scott: Uh, and yeah, I highly recommend, you know, I guess, you know, this was before fricking, uh, a team, right.

543
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:35,318
Scott: He wasn't on that yet.

544
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:43,094
Rym: Um, so yeah, you can, uh, a team ran from 1983 to 1987.

545
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:43,294
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:48,712
Scott: He, the a team didn't exist when he, when this thing of the day video was recorded.

547
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:51,099
Rym: God, this was a long time ago.

548
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,225
Scott: I'm just as old as us.

549
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:53,386
Scott: Yeah.

550
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,857
Rym: So in the meta moment, uh, we got no cons.

551
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,843
Rym: Like we're not going to PAX for obvious reasons.

552
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:03,142
Rym: Uh, in fact, we're specifically not going to PAX because it's too soon for conventions.

553
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:07,320
Rym: Uh, but we'll see how things go for future conventions after this upcoming PAX West.

554
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:13,886
Rym: The panel we did at the most recent PAX online is just on YouTube with slides, Atari game design.

555
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:14,569
Rym: You can just watch it.

556
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,688
Rym: The GeekNights book club book remains the tale of Genji, uh, to do a brief checkpoint.

557
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:20,913
Rym: Cause I'm powering through.

558
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,940
Scott: I'm about a little over a percent.

559
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,811
Rym: I'm about, I'm approaching a third of the way through.

560
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:26,796
Rym: I'm like 31.

561
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,444
Scott: Let me check my Kindle percentage.

562
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:29,991
Scott: Cause I actually haven't read in a little while.

563
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:30,493
Rym: Yeah.

564
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,522
Scott: But, uh, I might have to catch up.

565
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:39,066
Rym: You might have to, but, uh, to checkpoint, cause you know, the last few episodes I said, look, I can just kind of sleep.

566
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:40,151
Scott: I'm only, I'm only 19%.

567
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:52,180
Rym: Oh, so, uh, now that I'm a little further, uh, the, the pedo thing just keeps that, that just bunny drops all the way through the rest of the stupid book.

568
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,742
Rym: 100%.

569
00:39:52,742 --> 00:40:02,138
Rym: And, uh, too, now that, you know, there's the, there's the incident where a ghost kills someone, he is banging in a haunted mansion.

570
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:03,985
Rym: Like that happens pretty early on actually.

571
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:11,492
Rym: But, uh, it is very clear in retrospect, like getting further into the book that his every Genji has malaria.

572
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:14,622
Rym: He probably got malaria during that bit.

573
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:19,018
Rym: And cause you know, the people in that household were sick and then the woman died.

574
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:23,094
Rym: And then later he's seeing the wise man in the woods because he has recurring fevers.

575
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:24,800
Rym: Malaria was happy.

576
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,068
Rym: Like malaria was a thing in hand area.

577
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:30,180
Scott: I knew he was sick, but I didn't realize it was malaria specifically.

578
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,755
Rym: fevers that would come and go throughout the rest of his life.

579
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:34,539
Rym: It keeps coming up.

580
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,706
Scott: So I know that.

581
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,946
Scott: I just didn't know that, that I just didn't recognize it as malaria until you just said something.

582
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:39,107
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,357
Rym: Like I just, I sort of, did you look, did you look that up?

584
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:41,578
Rym: Nope.

585
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,944
Rym: It just suddenly clicked.

586
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:46,178
Rym: when yet again, he's having fevers and isn't feeling well.

587
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:48,247
Rym: Just like, well, huh, that makes sense.

588
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:53,528
Rym: And also all the people who died in that house with the ghost and everything, probably also just malaria.

589
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,696
Rym: It seems that just seems to fit.

590
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:57,764
Scott: How come he hasn't died of it yet?

591
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:58,988
Scott: A lot of people live with malaria.

592
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,715
Rym: Like you can just survive.

593
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:03,687
Rym: And also he's only like 18 at that point.

594
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,369
Scott: Oh, that's true.

595
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,212
Scott: He's still kind of young.

596
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:05,473
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:05,855
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:10,070
Rym: Like he is, he is now about 20 as far as I've gotten in the book.

599
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:28,623
Rym: Like it moves pretty slow, but the only thing I'm struggling with, like the thing that I have the most trouble with reading this book, as I get further and further along, I'm used to a lot of the conventions that uses, but what I'm struggling with is how there will be like multiple paragraphs that are covering a span of like 10 seconds.

600
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:35,769
Rym: And then the next paragraph will be someone saying a line, but it is like a month later in a different place.

601
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:36,931
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,600
Rym: And there was no transition whatsoever.

603
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,152
Rym: And it's almost like, wait, who, when did this guy show up?

604
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,618
Rym: Oh no, no, it's a month later.

605
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:44,980
Rym: Okay.

606
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,302
Rym: Okay.

607
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:45,824
Rym: Whatever.

608
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,049
Rym: I guess I see what's going on now.

609
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,777
Scott: Like it slows down.

610
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:51,924
Scott: It's like describe a scene in detail.

611
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:56,801
Scott: Like, ah, they're at the festival and so dances and then so-and-so dances and then so-and-so dances.

612
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:57,605
Scott: really well.

613
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,127
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:03,309
Scott: So, and so the other people do a shitty dance and then it's like his excellency has something to say to Genji.

615
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,199
Rym: It's like his excellency was not at this party.

616
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,962
Scott: What the fuck?

617
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:06,143
Scott: Right.

618
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:06,686
Scott: Right.

619
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:14,580
Scott: And then it's like, you know, it slows down to detail on something and then it's like, all right, the next part of our story is, yeah, you know, Genji's off to it.

620
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,503
Scott: It's like, what?

621
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,952
Rym: But it doesn't ever say the next part of our story.

622
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:21,966
Rym: It's just the next, the next line someone says is months later.

623
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:22,709
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,076
Scott: And then you restart the paragraph.

625
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:24,397
Rym: Yeah.

626
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,503
Rym: And you're like, oh, okay.

627
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:26,650
Rym: I think I see what's going on here.

628
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:32,512
Rym: I'm glad the chapters all have a little bit like, here's, who's in the chapter and roughly how old Genji is.

629
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:33,496
Scott: Yep.

630
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:35,583
Rym: Without that, I was just lost.

631
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:40,319
Scott: That's why you need this edition, the full unabridged, you know, uh, edition.

632
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:48,455
Rym: I mean, from what I've got, like, even if you're reading it in the original Japanese, it's such archaic Japanese that it would be like us trying to read early middle English.

633
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:56,208
Scott: I mean, Emily who, you know, speaks and reads Japanese, you know, way, I guess, is she technically, I don't know what counts as fluency, right?

634
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:57,353
Scott: She passed the test thing, right?

635
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,257
Rym: She's close.

636
00:42:58,899 --> 00:42:59,120
Scott: Yeah.

637
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:08,277
Scott: She says it's like, if you're, if you speak English, but you try to read Shakespeare, it's like, yeah, you read it, but you know, it's not, uh, it's not so straightforward, right?

638
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:08,438
Rym: Yeah.

639
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:15,968
Rym: I get the impression that Shakespeare is pretty easy to read relative to modern English compared to reading Heian era court Japanese.

640
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:16,169
Scott: Right.

641
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:21,634
Scott: But it's, I'm sure, I think it's, I think it probably is harder than us reading Shakespeare, but it's still the same idea.

642
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:23,622
Scott: It's, it's your, it's your language.

643
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:33,964
Scott: You know, those you've seen those words, but you read the sentence and your brain doesn't actually create an image of what the sentence means and you have to, you know, like for, you know, consciously force it.

644
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:39,064
Scott: But also it's like the difference between just breathing unconsciously and breathing on purpose.

645
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:45,309
Rym: But also, you know, Genji, it's easy to say like, wow, Genji just like cries all the time because there's so many.

646
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:50,286
Rym: you see where he just like, and then he spent the next three days crying and nothing else.

647
00:43:50,968 --> 00:43:55,980
Rym: But, uh, got to remember he's like 17.

648
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,124
Rym: So that kind of tracks.

649
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,970
Rym: He's just this weepy teenager.

650
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:00,491
Scott: Yeah.

651
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:02,377
Rym: All right.

652
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:03,561
Rym: Let's get into the main bit.

653
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:09,761
Rym: Let's just dive right in because, uh, climate change plays real obviously, but, uh, what's

654
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:16,301
Scott: happening is the biggest one, but there are other things causing an increase of natural disasters of

655
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:16,983
Rym: all kinds

656
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:19,710
Scott: around the entire globe, but this has

657
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,933
Rym: accelerated significantly like to a degree that it is notable and this needs to be talked about more.

658
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:37,564
Scott: And even if, even if, even if, even if environmentalists take over the whole world, right tomorrow, there is to some extent, nothing we can do.

659
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,590
Scott: It's going to continue for a while.

660
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,032
Rym: Yup.

661
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:44,150
Rym: The conversation, uh, and again, the snowball is already rolling down the hill.

662
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,439
Scott: Our goal is now to slow the snowball, right?

663
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:57,491
Rym: Our goal is to prevent the worst future while simultaneously not preventing current harms and near future harms so much as mitigating those harms.

664
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:02,644
Rym: Mitigation is the best we can do for the decades to come.

665
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,775
Scott: A lot of people use inevitability like, Oh, yup.

666
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:08,470
Scott: There's nothing we can do about that at this point as an excuse to give up.

667
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:09,152
Scott: Nope.

668
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:09,474
Scott: Nope.

669
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:09,694
Rym: Nope.

670
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,003
Rym: Cause if we do nothing, this gets bad.

671
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:12,686
Rym: Even worse.

672
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:13,750
Rym: Like here's the difference.

673
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,999
Rym: Say, uh, you know, there's that YouTube video where the guy burns down his entire house in a live state as a water in the ceiling.

674
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,969
Scott: And it's like, well, I can't afford to fix the roof.

675
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,316
Scott: Might as well just let it leak.

676
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,630
Scott: And then the roof collapses on you and you're, you're crushed.

677
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,182
Scott: It's like, well, you could have at least put a bucket under it, right?

678
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:31,216
Scott: Or like put a piece of plastic on the roof or something.

679
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:31,819
Scott: Yup.

680
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:37,521
Rym: So, uh, what we're going to talk about today is not that so much as the natural disasters themselves.

681
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:40,372
Rym: And I guess what we're defining is the natural disaster.

682
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:43,100
Rym: climate and weather disasters count.

683
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:56,746
Rym: I, even though they are ostensibly, especially currently pretty much directly caused by humans, but that is different from like an industrial disaster or a dam like collapsing where often they are combined.

684
00:45:56,806 --> 00:45:57,890
Scott: often they're combined, right?

685
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:04,255
Scott: One can cause the other, uh, you know, like an earthquake messing up your nuclear power plant, Japan or something like that.

686
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:14,368
Rym: But, uh, we're going to focus on like a natural disaster where there was not a discrete human cause in a direct immediate causal chain.

687
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:14,669
Rym: Right.

688
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:23,209
Scott: Well, the first natural disaster that I, at least the one I have the most experience with personally in my life is the hurricane, which if you live in the other side of the world is a cyclone.

689
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,107
Scott: It's just a huge ass fucking storm that spins its way over everything with crazy winds and rain.

690
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:31,059
Rym: Um, I grew up in hurricane Alec.

691
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,841
Rym: I grew up in a, in a tornado place where tornadoes that caused serious damage happen often.

692
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:37,404
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,709
Scott: But you didn't experience hurricanes.

694
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,212
Scott: I don't know.

695
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:40,135
Rym: Didn't experience hurricanes.

696
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:41,903
Rym: I am in my own life.

697
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:44,354
Scott: I am Sandy was the only hurricane you experienced.

698
00:46:44,656 --> 00:46:45,038
Rym: Uh, yeah.

699
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,813
Rym: Cause the other hurricanes that hit New York, we were actually out of town during them.

700
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:48,595
Scott: Okay.

701
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:52,929
Scott: So I experienced hurricane Andrew and some other ones.

702
00:46:52,969 --> 00:47:01,646
Scott: I forget the name of basically in the nineties, you know, late eighties, early nineties, Connecticut, there were hurricanes that, you know, hit us in Connecticut.

703
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,119
Scott: And I remember the, the most damage I remember is most like trees coming down.

704
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:10,637
Scott: Uh, there was a, we had like a little shed that we would like put a lawnmower in.

705
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:12,683
Scott: It just got like blown away.

706
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:16,919
Scott: Um, I remember what during one hurricane might've been Andrew.

707
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,516
Scott: I think, uh, the neighbors across the street, obviously couldn't go to the store.

708
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,926
Scott: Uh, I put on a raincoat and I brought them.

709
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:24,211
Scott: I forget it was eggs or sugar.

710
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:24,853
Scott: I had to care.

711
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:25,375
Scott: Right.

712
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:30,469
Scott: Um, and it was basically like the wind was like pushing me.

713
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:33,661
Scott: I couldn't, it was hard to walk across the street cause of being pushed by wind.

714
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:37,334
Scott: Uh, and also there was so much rain.

715
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:43,054
Scott: It was like basically someone was hitting you, like shooting a fire hose and aiming at you on purpose.

716
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:50,367
Scott: Um, but it's interesting that wasn't even, and it wasn't even like at the level of, I could, I could see, I was able to successfully walk across the street.

717
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:56,752
Scott: It was not the level of like, you know, an even stronger hurricane would like just knock, you know, trees over.

718
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:57,174
Scott: Right.

719
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:00,405
Scott: Trees weren't coming down then, but it was still that bad.

720
00:48:00,606 --> 00:48:05,589
Rym: It's interesting that, you know, you're living in Connecticut and then New York, me living in Michigan and then New York.

721
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:14,317
Rym: We just happened to have, for a lot of reasons, lived in places that have relatively few and relatively rare natural disasters.

722
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:25,596
Scott: Well, I was born in these places, but then choosing, I, once I was able to choose where I lived, uh, I intentionally chose to live in places with few natural disasters.

723
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:29,369
Scott: It wasn't the only factor, but it was a significant factor.

724
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:39,664
Scott: I, you know, if, if there weren't earthquakes and mudslides and fires in California, I may have been willing to go work over there.

725
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:42,634
Scott: in Silicon Valley, you know, before I hated the culture there.

726
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:44,903
Rym: And before I realized there's no mass transit over there.

727
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,148
Rym: Yeah.

728
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:50,572
Scott: I wasn't thinking about, but that, I wasn't thinking about the culture or the mass transit in the early two- Me either.

729
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:53,885
Rym: When I was young, like LA and New York were two big cities.

730
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,541
Rym: And now that I'm older, I realized that one is a hellscape and one is amazing.

731
00:48:58,124 --> 00:48:58,285
Scott: Right.

732
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:08,861
Scott: So when I, when I graduated college at that time, the natural disasters were like probably on the pro-con scale, like enough to tip the scale away from California.

733
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:12,756
Scott: Nowadays, they're just one of many things tipping the scale away from California.

734
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:17,194
Rym: You know, my family has been in the United, like on this continent for a very long time.

735
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,140
Rym: Like some of them were pre-revolution.

736
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:27,868
Rym: And the fam, the entire family converged from a lot, moving around all over to eventually be in the Midwest.

737
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:35,296
Rym: Partly because, like we know some family history, that region has very few natural disasters and is extremely stable and safe.

738
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,460
Scott: Yeah.

739
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,769
Scott: I don't know why so many people keep going to Florida.

740
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:48,378
Rym: Like Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Ontario, like that area is honestly one of the safest places in the entire earth from natural disasters.

741
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:50,925
Rym: Like literally no joke, no exaggeration.

742
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,421
Rym: It'll be interesting as climate change accelerates natural disasters.

743
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:56,084
Rym: What happens?

744
00:49:56,486 --> 00:50:05,091
Rym: because Detroit and Chicago and Buffalo and Toronto end up being the biggest cities that are in the safest zone on earth.

745
00:50:06,014 --> 00:50:10,387
Scott: Yeah, but they're on the great lakes, but the great lakes are very safe.

746
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:15,266
Rym: The great lakes, not only are they very safe, but they are a supply of fresh water.

747
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:17,857
Rym: They're one of the largest, fresh water on earth.

748
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:18,660
Scott: Yup.

749
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:23,321
Scott: And the, the, the question though is, you know, obviously, you know, the melting ice caps, right?

750
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:24,306
Scott: But that's in the ocean.

751
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:25,552
Scott: That's not in the lake, right?

752
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:29,668
Scott: But that water, you know, can make it to the lake eventually, right?

753
00:50:29,688 --> 00:50:38,826
Rym: If water, water will evolve with the great while the great lakes due to like the lock systems, like not to go too deep into the hydrology of it, they can be drained at a whim.

754
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:43,181
Rym: If they were, if they were rising to somewhere, you just drain it to the ocean.

755
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:44,665
Scott: Sure.

756
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:45,086
Scott: There's a way.

757
00:50:45,107 --> 00:50:48,037
Rym: No, there's canals and blocks and shit.

758
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:52,253
Scott: I'm just saying it's like, you know, it's not a hundred percent perfect, right?

759
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:56,772
Scott: There could be depending on, you know, the rate of water level rising, right?

760
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:59,726
Scott: On the coast there, it definitely won't be as bad as on the coast.

761
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:03,806
Rym: Historically, the lakes were shrinking because of climate change, but now weather patterns.

762
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:07,104
Scott: that also gives you, that also gives you some time to, you know, some space there.

763
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:08,432
Rym: No, but a weather pattern shifted.

764
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:16,250
Rym: And honestly, because it would be easy to drain them compared to fill them, the fact that they're, oh no, I'm just saying the fact that I'm agreeing, it's pretty safe.

765
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,320
Scott: I'm just saying there's climate change continues.

766
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:28,126
Scott: that safety barrier, which will keep them safer than ocean coast places for quite a while will eventually also fall.

767
00:51:28,707 --> 00:51:28,948
Rym: Oh yeah.

768
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:37,698
Scott: But I'm saying for the foreseeable, like even like many, they have a much longer safe headway before it's just a flood than New York does.

769
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:41,997
Rym: Like that, if things get bad and the coast collapse, honestly, I go back to Michigan.

770
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:48,048
Rym: Like that's, again, I have the privilege of being able to just travel and escape things, but I mean, I can just, well, you gotta, you gotta get out here somehow.

771
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:48,370
Rym: Yeah.

772
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,319
Scott: But in terms of- Everyone's gonna go somewhere.

773
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,959
Scott: But also- Nothing stops me, I don't have family in Michigan, but it doesn't stop me from going to Michigan.

774
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:54,160
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:56,452
Scott: But in terms of- Not that I want to go there.

776
00:51:56,573 --> 00:52:03,830
Rym: But in terms of like that aspect, like dealing with natural disasters, one thing that, and this is, this is like coming from a position of extreme luck and privilege.

777
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:18,710
Rym: Every natural disaster I've ever experienced in my, for my personal interactions in day-to-day life, they were positive or enjoyable because they didn't actually affect me materially.

778
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:20,132
Scott: Yeah.

779
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:22,842
Scott: That is an interesting thing to experience.

780
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:32,694
Rym: Like hurricane Sandy, to be really honest, knowing what like the horrors that were happening in my own day-to-day life, it was just a really nice break from work.

781
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,782
Rym: Uh, it was interesting weather.

782
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:38,095
Rym: I went biking around in a city that was completely shut down.

783
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:43,014
Rym: Like everything I did on a day-to-day basis was just novel, interesting, and fun.

784
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:48,194
Rym: So it's weird to think back and like, oh yeah, I could almost be nostalgic for hurricane Sandy.

785
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:53,853
Scott: Well, I mean, think about, you know, the, the, the most awesome of natural disasters, right?

786
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:55,279
Scott: The volcano eruption, right?

787
00:52:55,842 --> 00:53:09,369
Scott: And the volcano eruption is like the perfect illustration of the duality in that if you live at the bottom of the volcano and your whole, you know, society is now burned away, that's the worst thing ever, right?

788
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:13,503
Scott: It's like, nothing worse can happen than volcano on your house, right?

789
00:53:13,564 --> 00:53:18,400
Scott: I did know what natural disasters worse than that asteroid hitting your house.

790
00:53:19,383 --> 00:53:24,160
Scott: No, cause you would, that would be a faster and swifter death than the volcano, right?

791
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:25,424
Scott: Volcano is terrifying.

792
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:28,819
Rym: It's like, you know, the pyroclastic, whatever would kill you pretty much instantly.

793
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:31,854
Scott: Like I would rather have a tornado hit my house than a volcano hit my house.

794
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:32,616
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:34,322
Scott: Right.

796
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:35,245
Rym: No tornado.

797
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:39,101
Rym: You'd probably survive in the rubble and then die days later of, of a thirst.

798
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:39,864
Scott: It depends.

799
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:40,467
Scott: It depends.

800
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:41,694
Scott: But at least I'm hiding in the basement.

801
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:43,869
Scott: Whenever the volcano comes, you'll hide in the basement from volcano.

802
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:52,074
Scott: So, but if you are just far away from the volcano watching it, it's just, you know, it pollutes the sky.

803
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,923
Scott: Um, but it's like, it's just kind of awesome.

804
00:53:55,505 --> 00:54:00,848
Scott: And you know, when it's, people will go up to erupting volcanoes and like check out the lava geologists and shit.

805
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:02,636
Scott: And it's like, you watch it in videos.

806
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:04,224
Scott: It's like totally cool, right?

807
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,630
Scott: It's like this awesome neat thing.

808
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:08,703
Scott: As long as it's not hitting a person.

809
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:16,129
Rym: Like when I was a kid, when I was in middle school, there was a blizzard, like a, like a dangerous, like super huge blizzard in Michigan.

810
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:21,169
Scott: Like it I don't know if blizzard really comes into the, I guess maybe because it's where I live.

811
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:22,675
Scott: There's so many nor'easters and blizzards.

812
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:26,128
Scott: It doesn't feel like it's natural disaster.

813
00:54:26,148 --> 00:54:28,361
Rym: That's actually because the listener was talking about this in the chat too.

814
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:29,549
Scott: It's a weather, a weather event.

815
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:48,577
Rym: People who live in the Midwest and the East coast, like at like New York and Boston and places like that, blizzards, we barely treat as natural disasters because there is so much infrastructure, knowledge, expertise, skill, and just being used to shit about blizzards that if six feet of snow come down, we just fucking deal with it.

816
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:52,472
Rym: But meanwhile, go even a little bit south to like Georgia.

817
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:58,869
Rym: And if there is a quarter inch of snow, hundreds die and things are shut down for weeks.

818
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:08,316
Rym: But when I was a kid in Michigan in the middle school, there was a blizzard so bad that parts like Southeast Michigan shut down.

819
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:09,460
Rym: Like that is a big deal.

820
00:55:09,861 --> 00:55:13,395
Rym: We had seven-ish feet of snow on our house.

821
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:15,322
Rym: Like we had, we could not get out.

822
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:18,053
Rym: We had to get out the second window and then dig out the front door.

823
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:20,342
Rym: And you know what my kid memory is?

824
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:21,887
Rym: No school for two weeks.

825
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:22,329
Rym: Fuck you.

826
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:26,105
Rym: Coupled with I'm going to go out and explore all day.

827
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:27,170
Rym: This is going to be awesome.

828
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:32,970
Rym: And then I'm going to sled from the roof to the street.

829
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:34,391
Scott: Yeah.

830
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:36,781
Rym: Actually my parents did not let me do that.

831
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:39,834
Rym: To this day, I'm disappointed that they would not let me do that.

832
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:42,188
Scott: Did you at least jump out the window into the seven feet of snow?

833
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:42,430
Scott: Oh yeah.

834
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:43,493
Rym: Even better.

835
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:46,467
Rym: I went out hiking through this, through the woods and everything.

836
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:47,191
Rym: It was such a good time.

837
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,398
Scott: Well, how could you even see the woods?

838
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:49,364
Scott: Wouldn't it just be snow?

839
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:51,053
Rym: Woods are way taller than seven feet.

840
00:55:51,073 --> 00:55:51,736
Scott: You had to dig.

841
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:53,464
Scott: You had to dig to walk, right?

842
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:55,834
Rym: I just, when I got put on snowshoes and went out.

843
00:55:56,578 --> 00:55:56,939
Scott: Oh, you what?

844
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,064
Scott: You stood on top of it all.

845
00:55:58,124 --> 00:55:58,406
Rym: Oh yeah.

846
00:55:58,426 --> 00:56:00,817
Scott: Cause again, Sierra seven feet in the air.

847
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:01,862
Rym: I'm an outdoor type person.

848
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,128
Rym: My family's been outdoors.

849
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:05,960
Scott: You weren't, you weren't at ground level digging seven feet.

850
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,266
Scott: You were seven feet up walking.

851
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:08,290
Rym: I'm a Michigander.

852
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:11,226
Rym: If there's snow, I have snowshoes that I'm walking on top of it.

853
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:11,990
Rym: Cause I'm not stupid.

854
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,561
Scott: We didn't have snowshoe, but okay.

855
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:15,767
Scott: But that makes a lot more sense.

856
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:17,896
Scott: I thought you were like, I thought you're digging a tunnel.

857
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:30,344
Rym: That was a dangerous situation because that is a place where people do not prepare for a blizzard shutting things down because even once every century level blizzards can be mitigated very quickly.

858
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:33,215
Rym: And this blizzard was bad enough where we could not mitigate it quickly.

859
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:35,362
Rym: So no one was prepared for it.

860
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:40,138
Rym: But even at that time in my life, it was just a really pleasant week.

861
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:43,273
Rym: I didn't have to deal with any of the problems of the natural disaster.

862
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:44,057
Rym: I just enjoyed it.

863
00:56:44,078 --> 00:56:44,982
Rym: Right.

864
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,254
Scott: Well, I mean, think about, you know, I mentioned earthquake, right?

865
00:56:47,294 --> 00:56:50,027
Scott: In California, the buildings are designed around earthquake.

866
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:52,137
Scott: They have all sorts of earthquake protections on them.

867
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,216
Scott: So it's like, if an earthquake happens there, it's like, it's still going to damage.

868
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:57,201
Scott: It's not great.

869
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:57,643
Scott: Right.

870
00:56:57,824 --> 00:57:02,298
Scott: You know, there's a certain level of, at least if it's above a certain severity level.

871
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:02,700
Scott: Right.

872
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:06,271
Scott: But you know, the buildings aren't going to like.

873
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:12,077
Scott: the big skyscrapers are very unlikely to just like fall down and cause, you know, Godzilla level destruction.

874
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:13,725
Rym: But if a real earthquake hit New York.

875
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:21,816
Scott: If you had a big, if you had a big earthquake in New York city where the buildings are not designed for earthquake, we are in deep shit.

876
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:22,880
Rym: Yeah.

877
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:39,421
Rym: Years ago, when there was that, that really, really minor earthquake that slightly shook New York, like a tiny bit, the buildings here swayed so much that people like, I was on the street and I did not feel the earthquake, but suddenly out of nowhere, people started yelling and running out of the subway.

878
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:44,041
Rym: And I saw people running out of buildings and all I'm thinking is what the fuck is going on?

879
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:44,986
Rym: What the fuck is going on?

880
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:55,450
Rym: Because I had no context for that because the buildings are so not earthquake ready and so old that if you're like on the 16th or 20th floor of one of these like hundred year old New York buildings,

881
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:58,139
Scott: and you'll feel it, it amplifies

882
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,810
Rym: enough to where people started running and yelling.

883
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:02,132
Scott: Yup.

884
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:04,119
Scott: So that's the thing.

885
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:04,500
Rym: Yeah.

886
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,022
Scott: Let's see.

887
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:10,477
Scott: So we covered, we covered about volcano, hurricane, tornado, earthquake.

888
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:22,532
Scott: I guess there's sort of the, the, the thing that goes with earthquake, which is tsunami, which goes with, which goes with flood, flood really accompanies like almost everything.

889
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:31,367
Scott: It's like, you know, so many disasters are water related and like, you know, even something, even if you're far away from the ocean, like tornado can cause flood.

890
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:35,442
Scott: If it breaks a water main or a dam breaks or, you know, it's like.

891
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:37,570
Scott: floods are just like the, the, like everything.

892
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,157
Scott: they're all, all over the place.

893
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,531
Scott: Flood is actually even in the, even in the desert, you get flash flood.

894
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:51,864
Rym: Flood is actually one of the few natural disasters I actually have a like kind of specific plan, like continuously plan around in my actual life.

895
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:55,317
Scott: No matter where you are, you got to worry about flood situations.

896
00:58:55,418 --> 00:59:00,903
Rym: Even if you live in the desert, like flash floods are actually way more dangerous in dry places than they are in wet places.

897
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:02,492
Scott: And I think they're getting more common as well.

898
00:59:02,512 --> 00:59:03,014
Rym: They are.

899
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:06,410
Scott: I'm noticing that the flooding in New York city has definitely gotten worse.

900
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:09,238
Rym: We talked about this in real life.

901
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,726
Rym: We didn't talk about it on the show.

902
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,755
Rym: So there's a thing that happened during COVID.

903
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:20,762
Rym: New York city has this thing that's not common in a lot of places called alternate side parking, but it is in, it is a thing in other places.

904
00:59:21,063 --> 00:59:29,594
Rym: Meaning on a few, a few days a week where if you're parked on certain streets, you got to move your car to the other side of the street.

905
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:31,623
Rym: And then the next day you got to move it back.

906
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:33,532
Rym: Like you can't leave your car somewhere.

907
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:34,135
Scott: Right.

908
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:39,601
Scott: It's like, it's like between these hours, right from eight in the morning to one, you can't park on the left side of the street today.

909
00:59:39,862 --> 00:59:43,438
Scott: And then tomorrow same hours, but you can't park on the right side of the street.

910
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:51,737
Rym: Now, naive people and car people have made an argument for a long time that these rules are archaic and they're just to discourage street parking, which is not true.

911
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:52,501
Rym: Those rules.

912
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:55,174
Scott: If we wanted to discourage street parking, we would just charge for it everywhere.

913
00:59:55,315 --> 01:00:04,957
Rym: Those rules actually came from the New York city's like ancient, like it was a different organization at the time, but basically the department of sanitation and human welfare type stuff.

914
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:05,258
Rym: Right.

915
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:07,992
Rym: Because the only reason they do it is so they can sweep the streets.

916
01:00:08,374 --> 01:00:11,350
Rym: And the reason they sweep the streets is so the streets aren't filled with garbage.

917
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:12,493
Scott: Right.

918
01:00:12,513 --> 01:00:14,926
Scott: So it's like, you might think, Oh, well just cleanliness, right?

919
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:16,293
Scott: We just want to keep the city clean.

920
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:20,472
Scott: We need you to move your car so we can clean the curb and all the filth that's piled up in the curb.

921
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:21,094
Scott: That's true.

922
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:27,416
Scott: It is for that reason, but it's also because when filth piles up on the street, it blocks all the drains.

923
01:00:27,496 --> 01:00:27,737
Scott: Yup.

924
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:36,210
Rym: So during COVID that causes floods, the city decided to alternate street parking from twice a week to once a week and car people were really happy.

925
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:40,325
Rym: So they decided to keep it that way permanently because car people were happy.

926
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:44,400
Rym: And it turns out that is why we had so much flash flooding in New York now.

927
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:49,802
Scott: That's true, but there was even before COVID the, the, the flooding has been getting worse.

928
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:50,947
Rym: It was getting worse.

929
01:00:51,128 --> 01:00:55,248
Rym: And then it went beyond the tipping point way earlier because we're not sweeping the streets twice a week.

930
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:55,831
Scott: We pushed it.

931
01:00:55,851 --> 01:01:02,797
Scott: We pushed it a little harder by not sweeping enough, but the point is we're getting rained on harder, more rain, right?

932
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,003
Scott: The river, the sea is rising on us.

933
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:08,374
Scott: You know, and flooding is going to be a thing here.

934
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,905
Scott: If you live near the water, New York city is an island.

935
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:12,311
Scott: Manhattan's an island, at least

936
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:36,047
Rym: like, you know, you've got to like, my advice to you is you have to internalize the fact that for the rest of your life, even if we do everything right and things get better and we like correct this course as a species, which I'm, I'm hopeful we will, nothing is going to prevent the next decade of your life from being weird and there being more natural disasters, like more enough to where you have to start preparing for things that you have never had to worry about before.

937
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:37,431
Scott: Right.

938
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:39,303
Scott: Cause you think, Oh, up on a mountain, I won't get flood.

939
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:39,545
Scott: Yeah.

940
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,595
Scott: Up on the mountain where you'll get mudslide instead.

941
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:42,117
Rym: Right.

942
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,928
Scott: It's like, Oh, well I'm, uh, I'm out here.

943
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:48,509
Scott: And you know, it's like, well, you know, in the, in the woods, there'll be a fire in the woods.

944
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:51,100
Scott: Like, look at again, the West coast or everything's on fire.

945
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:57,423
Rym: Uh, at this point, I believe that is the second largest wildfire in the recorded history of North America.

946
01:01:57,985 --> 01:01:59,751
Scott: But Greece and Turkey are on fire.

947
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:02,663
Scott: You don't think about those as places with crazy forests.

948
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:03,566
Scott: It's super bad.

949
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:06,798
Rym: Like Turkey is, the nation of Turkey is on fire.

950
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:10,092
Rym: It's barely even making the news because of all the other disasters happening.

951
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:10,835
Rym: Good.

952
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:12,783
Rym: Look at what's happening in Turkey right now.

953
01:02:12,883 --> 01:02:14,128
Rym: It is terrifying.

954
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:15,895
Rym: And I saw that the best tweet.

955
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:17,019
Scott: Greece is the same thing.

956
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:33,334
Rym: The tweet that encapsulated this so well was like, it basically said, I'm paraphrasing climate change means that you'll be watching natural disasters on your phone with increasing, increasing frequency until eventually you're going to be the one recording it on your phone.

957
01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:35,803
Rym: And that's how it's going to go.

958
01:02:36,205 --> 01:02:38,593
Rym: No amount of money and privilege will protect you from this.

959
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:39,637
Scott: Yeah.

960
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:45,779
Scott: There's, I mean, it's like, you know, no, even if you're like, I can't imagine you're Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, right?

961
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,933
Scott: It's like, and that there's nowhere you can run or hide from natural disaster.

962
01:02:51,953 --> 01:02:52,936
Rym: What can you possibly do?

963
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,365
Scott: You live on a boat.

964
01:02:56,465 --> 01:02:57,310
Scott: That's not going to do it.

965
01:02:57,351 --> 01:02:58,820
Scott: Hurricane will come and knock your boat over.

966
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,691
Rym: Now the two, because we've gone on long enough for the show, every show goes long because we don't talk to each other that much in real life right now.

967
01:03:04,812 --> 01:03:06,641
Rym: So this is when we like get everything out.

968
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:07,243
Rym: that's pent up.

969
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,046
Scott: We'll fix that.

970
01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:08,930
Scott: We'll fix that next week.

971
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:17,106
Rym: But next week I feel like a dam is just going to like burst out of my brain of me saying weird shit that I've been bottling up for two years or a year and a half.

972
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:24,488
Rym: But anyway, so I guess the two big takeaways to end this is one, don't like catastrophize and doom and gloom.

973
01:03:24,529 --> 01:03:27,819
Rym: Like don't go overboard planning and preparing.

974
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:29,024
Rym: Like there's a line.

975
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,610
Scott: Do not be, do not be a prepper.

976
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:35,245
Scott: So for example, New York city actually has, what's it called?

977
01:03:35,446 --> 01:03:36,452
Rym: Well, we have the evacuation.

978
01:03:36,472 --> 01:03:38,242
Scott: There's like a whole, no, there's a whole department.

979
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:38,704
Scott: Oh yeah.

980
01:03:39,346 --> 01:03:43,442
Rym: Well, New York city actually is very well prepared to deal with natural disasters.

981
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:48,363
Rym: Like there are, there are contingency plans that can be triggered that are surprisingly well thought out.

982
01:03:48,403 --> 01:03:51,413
Rym: Like there are ways to evacuate New York city.

983
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:56,210
Rym: Think about that for a second, what the scale of that kind of thing would mean.

984
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,924
Scott: That is the New York city, like department of emergency management.

985
01:03:59,964 --> 01:04:05,042
Scott: It's like a whole thing specifically for emergency management in New York city, a whole department.

986
01:04:05,464 --> 01:04:07,930
Scott: And you can go and they have websites and they have all these tools.

987
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:17,384
Scott: Like can follow them and get informed and they'll, you know, they help you out with like basically everything, right?

988
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:21,959
Scott: So, um, and it's, and it's not, you know, prepper level in the woods stuff.

989
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:23,605
Scott: It's common sense stuff, right?

990
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:35,228
Scott: Everything from like check your fricking smoke detector to if you, you know, what flood zone is your house in and where will you evacuate to and how will you know if it's time to evacuate and you know, whatnot.

991
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:42,078
Scott: So whenever, wherever you live, I don't know how your government or whatever handles those things, but there's going to be something.

992
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:48,480
Scott: If you have this enough technology to hear a podcast, you have some sort of emergency management, something.

993
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:56,807
Rym: Go learn what the deal is so that if anything goes wrong and like there's a disaster, you know what to expect and how much help could arrive when.

994
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:57,949
Rym: Right.

995
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:02,120
Scott: And learn the reasonable level of stuff.

996
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:03,767
Scott: that what you need to know, right?

997
01:05:03,787 --> 01:05:05,877
Scott: Be, you know, don't go overboard, right?

998
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:08,669
Rym: Like I'll give you an territory.

999
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:09,271
Scott: You don't need that.

1000
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,316
Rym: You want to know what my prep is?

1001
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:11,901
Rym: Cause I can explain it very succinctly.

1002
01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:18,820
Rym: I have plans like real plans to survive, escape and deal with natural disasters.

1003
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:21,565
Rym: only as far as could.

1004
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:32,440
Rym: I get far enough away from New York city within about a day to where it's not a problem anymore and anything where that would not save me, I do not worry about.

1005
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:33,943
Scott: Hmm.

1006
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:34,143
Scott: Yeah.

1007
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:38,542
Scott: It's like if there's a nuke, which is not a natural disaster and it's a natural disaster.

1008
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:41,798
Scott: Um, but it's like, well, there's nothing I can really do about that.

1009
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:43,284
Rym: Well, depends on what kind of.

1010
01:05:43,385 --> 01:05:48,066
Rym: actually, if it's a, if it's a non-thermonuclear nuke, they're, they're very specific.

1011
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,051
Scott: You get the idea.

1012
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:53,733
Scott: If I'm in like the incineration zone, it's like, I just call people and say, you know, I love you.

1013
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:55,320
Scott: I'm going to die until the phone stops.

1014
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:08,891
Rym: But, uh, but, but I guess what I've, what I've changed about those plans in the last year, specifically because of the acceleration of climate change related natural disasters, is I've added something to that plan that I never worried about before.

1015
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:18,423
Rym: Being able to act, to get fresh water that is safe to drink for myself within a hundred miles of New York city if the water supply stops.

1016
01:06:19,626 --> 01:06:23,437
Scott: Oh, I just have, I just have water like, you know, in bottles.

1017
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:28,298
Rym: So you want, actually I have, I have some extra life straws now if you want one to keep as a backup.

1018
01:06:28,399 --> 01:06:30,626
Scott: I mean, I don't think that's going to be necessary, right?

1019
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:43,092
Scott: The water, the amount of water that I have in my fridge at any given time, if that's not enough water to get probably me and a few other people away from the disaster, right?

1020
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:44,519
Scott: It's like, well, we're not going to get away.

1021
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,176
Rym: Well, what I would say is you need, this is, this is my personal assessment.

1022
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:52,012
Rym: If you're less athletic, you need more probably, or you need to go read some other expert things.

1023
01:06:52,053 --> 01:07:07,880
Rym: But my rule for myself and Emily, like together, because we hike a lot, is I would have at minimum one liter of water per person per, I don't know, 10 miles of difficult travel that would be necessary to escape.

1024
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,359
Scott: I guess that depends if I can, if the disaster has prevented bicycling.

1025
01:07:12,379 --> 01:07:13,383
Rym: Yeah, because here's the thing.

1026
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:23,238
Rym: In a disaster, you need to understand that cars don't work anymore and bikes that are not mountain bikes often might not work anymore either.

1027
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:38,263
Rym: It depends on the disaster, but even traveling by foot, one, most people cannot travel more than 10 miles on foot in America without suffering effectively a casualty incident, meaning they cannot walk further after that.

1028
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:40,432
Rym: For reasons, it's too much to get into.

1029
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:45,195
Rym: That's an old New Yorkers, New Yorkers can walk for the Yorkers can, but the average American cannot.

1030
01:07:45,236 --> 01:07:46,100
Rym: This was something terrifying.

1031
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,640
Rym: I learned from America's, this is all declassified military stuff in the fifties.

1032
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:59,094
Rym: The US government had a thing where they were looking at what would happen if a city got nuked and they were looking at old baby nukes, not modern thermo nukes.

1033
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:08,752
Rym: And they identified that the primary source of casualties would be that the average American could not walk five miles without suffering an event that incapacitated them.

1034
01:08:09,053 --> 01:08:10,658
Rym: And the event was blisters.

1035
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:16,929
Scott: Even without the nuke, if you just got someone out of their house and be like, Hey, walk five miles, five mile, let's walk five miles right now.

1036
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,657
Scott: Let's go walk five miles nonstop.

1037
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:19,180
Rym: They couldn't do it.

1038
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:19,340
Rym: Yep.

1039
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:24,243
Rym: It is because blisters caused by the fact that most Americans do not walk that much in their daily lives.

1040
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:26,835
Rym: Like it's, it's just a really terrifying calculus.

1041
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:39,640
Rym: So the military and the US government made plans around the fact that a huge number of casualties, like unsavable, incapacitated, immobile people would occur even if they just asked everyone to walk 10 miles away from a place.

1042
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:43,229
Rym: So, yeah.

1043
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:49,609
Scott: So I guess that's, that's a reasonable thing you can do, actually, if you're worried about natural disasters of any kind.

1044
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:49,850
Rym: Yeah.

1045
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,573
Rym: Walk more.

1046
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:57,037
Scott: Is just, you know, make your body more fit as, you know, you don't have to become athlete fit.

1047
01:08:57,058 --> 01:08:57,982
Rym: You don't have to be like me.

1048
01:08:58,002 --> 01:09:01,200
Rym: You don't, don't run a half marathon every weekend or something stupid like that.

1049
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:06,674
Rym: Just be able to walk over the course of an entire day, 10 miles.

1050
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:07,636
Scott: Right.

1051
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,245
Scott: You should be able to walk 10 miles in a day.

1052
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:11,669
Rym: Like eight or nine hours of walking.

1053
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:14,960
Scott: Not unsupplied, not fast walking.

1054
01:09:16,242 --> 01:09:23,104
Scott: Throughout the course of the day with resting, eating, drinking, you know, you don't have to carry a heavy load with you.

1055
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:23,886
Scott: Right.

1056
01:09:23,907 --> 01:09:30,104
Scott: Just within a 24 hour period, you have covered 10 miles of distance on your own two feet.

1057
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:30,907
Scott: Right.

1058
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:34,475
Scott: If you can do that, then you can evacuate.

1059
01:09:34,877 --> 01:09:35,118
Scott: Right.

1060
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,827
Scott: Even if, you know, all this is really bad news.

1061
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:41,801
Rym: And that is the kind of thing that is prudent to do now, because.

1062
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:42,564
Scott: In fair weather.

1063
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:43,669
Scott: In fair weather.

1064
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:47,143
Rym: One, walking enough to be able to do that will be super good for you.

1065
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:53,745
Rym: And two, that is something that you can, that is not a skill or an ability you can gain quickly.

1066
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:58,243
Rym: You can't be like, well, I'm going to go buy the ability to walk 10 miles tomorrow.

1067
01:09:58,283 --> 01:09:59,650
Rym: Like, no, you got to work at it a little bit.

1068
01:09:59,670 --> 01:09:59,771
Rym: Right.

1069
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,420
Scott: You could buy a gas mask tomorrow.

1070
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,828
Scott: You could buy a water filter tomorrow.

1071
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:03,974
Scott: You could buy a boat tomorrow.

1072
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,020
Scott: You could buy a life vest.

1073
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,628
Rym: You can't buy the ability to walk 10 miles tomorrow.

1074
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,113
Scott: Exactly.

1075
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,520
Scott: You can buy a flashlight tomorrow.

1076
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:12,985
Rym: Yep.

1077
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:16,400
Rym: And if you're really paranoid, again, don't go, don't be a prepper.

1078
01:10:17,141 --> 01:10:18,827
Scott: If you're really paranoid, don't be.

1079
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:19,128
Scott: Yeah.

1080
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:42,595
Rym: But the maximum planning I think anyone should do for this kind of thing in America, at least, is have the kind of stuff that people who go backpacking and camping have and know how to use it with a bare bare minimum of competence and be able to camp and make your way on your own for maybe a day, like a day.

1081
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:43,197
Rym: Yeah.

1082
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:44,883
Scott: Even that's kind of too far.

1083
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,610
Scott: It's like you need water.

1084
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:49,200
Scott: You need something to keep you above the water.

1085
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:55,221
Rym: You know, you know how hard it is to carry enough water for a person without a camelback or an equivalent.

1086
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,628
Rym: It's actually really hard for humans to do that.

1087
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:00,597
Scott: I'm just saying you have water, right?

1088
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:06,340
Scott: Even if it's just like just a gallon of Poland spring in the closet, you know, whatever.

1089
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:06,941
Scott: Right.

1090
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:12,641
Scott: You know, you don't need like, oh, I need to, if you're not camping, don't go buy like a camping stove.

1091
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:13,444
Scott: Right.

1092
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:16,755
Scott: Or don't go buy like, you know, some fancy tent.

1093
01:11:16,795 --> 01:11:20,227
Rym: But like a LifeStraw, they're like 10 bucks and you know what they let you do?

1094
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:25,888
Rym: Just stick this straw into any source of non-salt water out in the wild that is totally safe to drink.

1095
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,594
Scott: It doesn't work on salt water?

1096
01:11:27,734 --> 01:11:40,130
Rym: No, you know, you salt water, nobody who is not already an expert in survival shit should even consider any possible means of getting drinkable water from salt water.

1097
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,777
Scott: Just that is not worth your effort.

1098
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,531
Scott: Oh man, I, that reminds me, we'll just end the show on this.

1099
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,740
Scott: I think this will be my thing of the day.

1100
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,379
Scott: So I guess you can google it in the future if you want to watch it before it becomes my thing of the day.

1101
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:52,884
Scott: This dude did a YouTube video.

1102
01:11:53,365 --> 01:12:00,502
Scott: He went on a nuclear submarine and he showed two different ways.

1103
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:02,408
Scott: Well, they had that, yes.

1104
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:06,922
Scott: But he showed the two different ways they make oxygen and the machines that do it.

1105
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:09,710
Scott: Well, machines in quotes.

1106
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:11,175
Rym: I think I know.

1107
01:12:11,195 --> 01:12:15,012
Scott: He also discussed the desalinization and where they get the, you know, water from and stuff.

1108
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:16,259
Rym: It actually reminds me, I'll leave.

1109
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:17,768
Scott: Because they need water to get oxygen.

1110
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:18,714
Rym: So I'll leave you with this.

1111
01:12:18,754 --> 01:12:20,242
Rym: This is like the light because it's a related thing.

1112
01:12:20,262 --> 01:12:20,704
Rym: that's cool.

1113
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:26,171
Rym: You know the tragedy of the HMS Terror and the HMS Erebus where everyone went crazy and died in the Arctic?

1114
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:27,116
Rym: We've talked about it before.

1115
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:27,720
Rym: We read the book.

1116
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,249
Rym: So they all went crazy because of lead poisoning.

1117
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:35,923
Rym: The lead poisoning was because they, the boats, were very modern.

1118
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:53,943
Rym: They had steam power so they could go through the water and they saved a shitload of space by not having to carry water because the steam could be used to, the steam system also desalinated salt water because they needed to be able to desalinate it to run the steam engine.

1119
01:12:54,285 --> 01:12:56,878
Scott: So it's a lot easier to desalinate when you have a nuclear power plant.

1120
01:12:56,918 --> 01:12:57,340
Rym: Exactly.

1121
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,660
Rym: Because the only reason that was a bad idea was that the entire thing was made out of lead.

1122
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,121
Scott: Yeah.

1123
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:04,227
Scott: Oh, we have a nuclear reactor.

1124
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:06,580
Scott: Oh, well we can desalinate all the water we want, can't we?

1125
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,792
Scott: As long as your desalination machine keeps working.

1126
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:19,893
Rym: Yeah, that's kind of the cool thing about nuclear reactors is that once one's going, like especially one in like a naval nuclear reactor, you put fuel in one of those and they just run for 10 to 20 years.

1127
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:25,560
Scott: So it's like, yeah, it's like as long as all this shit works and doesn't break, it's like, it's pretty great.

1128
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,612
Scott: So you know who's really safe from natural disasters?

1129
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:29,738
Scott: Nuclear submarines.

1130
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:35,969
Rym: Why do you think there's a lot of dystopian sci-fi stories where the last humans on earth are the people manning nuclear submarines hiding under the Arctic?

1131
01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:39,384
Scott: Usually I think the story these days is space station people.

1132
01:13:39,445 --> 01:13:40,449
Rym: Yeah, I've seen that too.

1133
01:13:41,514 --> 01:13:41,694
Scott: Yeah.

1134
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:42,136
Scott: All right.

1135
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:42,920
Rym: I think we're good.

1136
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:43,824
Scott: Oh, there should be one.

1137
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:45,029
Scott: Someone should make one.

1138
01:13:45,049 --> 01:13:49,708
Scott: So I actually just watched one of those Netflix's I watched was about that.

1139
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:51,273
Scott: It was about like the world ends.

1140
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:56,655
Scott: It seems to be nuclear war that ended the world and this one dude left up in the Arctic, right?

1141
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:59,707
Scott: And he's, he's the last, everyone like evacuated the Arctic base except for him.

1142
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:02,256
Scott: Um, and he tries to communicate.

1143
01:14:02,296 --> 01:14:04,103
Scott: It's, it's a George Clooney thing.

1144
01:14:04,263 --> 01:14:05,267
Scott: He's like, he directed it.

1145
01:14:05,428 --> 01:14:06,773
Scott: He's the star of it, right?

1146
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:07,115
Scott: Everything.

1147
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:15,723
Scott: And he communicates with this space mission that is returning from a Jupiter moon that is suitable, that is suitable for human life.

1148
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:17,972
Scott: And he's basically trying to tell them, don't come back.

1149
01:14:18,313 --> 01:14:21,465
Scott: Uh, cause he's like, you're the last ones alive.

1150
01:14:22,187 --> 01:14:29,052
Scott: Um, but you just made me think it's like, Hey, you could tell that same story where it's space station and nuclear sub.

1151
01:14:29,393 --> 01:14:30,598
Scott: best friends are still alive.

1152
01:14:30,618 --> 01:14:33,111
Rym: Pretty sure that story has been written multiple times.

1153
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,062
Rym: If we actually look for it and they communicate with each other.

1154
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:35,525
Scott: Right.

1155
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:36,774
Rym: I've read one a long time ago.

1156
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:50,147
Rym: I don't know what it was called, but it was basically all the, all the great power, like the U S the UK, France, like all the countries that had nuclear submarines, all the people who manned all those submarines, like the Soviet union, everyone were the only people left.

1157
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:53,702
Rym: And they slowly, they're all like, yeah, why even be enemies?

1158
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:57,382
Rym: If everyone else is dead, let's all just meet somewhere and figure out how to rebuild society.

1159
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:58,184
Rym: Oh shit.

1160
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:00,190
Rym: It's only men because militaries are sexist.

1161
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,551
Rym: The end.

1162
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:03,560
Rym: It was a really good story.

1163
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,745
Rym: I don't remember what it was called.

1164
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:05,911
Rym: It was short.

1165
01:15:06,272 --> 01:15:06,774
Rym: It was not.

1166
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:08,020
Scott: Are there, are there women?

1167
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:14,364
Rym: I mean, we have no many, I don't believe there is any country where women are allowed to serve on nuclear submarines.

1168
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:17,416
Scott: There has never been a woman serving on a nuclear submarine.

1169
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:18,803
Rym: I don't believe so.

1170
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:20,814
Scott: There weren't any in the video I watched on you.

1171
01:15:20,894 --> 01:15:21,639
Scott: Oh, this is my thing of the day.

1172
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:23,687
Rym: I don't believe so, but I'm not sure.

1173
01:15:23,707 --> 01:15:26,276
Scott: What if they made an all woman nuclear submarine?

1174
01:15:26,316 --> 01:15:32,322
Scott: That would be awesome and we should, wouldn't we like win all the wars with that, that they would like, they would never lose.

1175
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,991
Scott: Like, all right, I'm going to go.

1176
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:41,005
Scott: You should want to know of the things on Netflix that I've watched that we could do a good show on.

1177
01:15:42,148 --> 01:15:47,183
Scott: There's a, the platform, it's a, it's a movie in Spanish, like Spain, Spanish.

1178
01:15:47,946 --> 01:15:49,049
Scott: It's a Netflix exclusive.

1179
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:54,064
Scott: So it's, you know, go watch the platform so we could get a Thursday show out of it.

1180
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:55,910
Scott: I will.

1181
01:15:57,235 --> 01:15:57,455
Rym: All right.

1182
01:15:57,576 --> 01:15:57,796
Rym: All right.

1183
01:15:57,957 --> 01:15:58,318
Rym: I'm going to go.

1184
01:15:58,338 --> 01:15:59,742
Scott: There's a TV show called the platform.

1185
01:15:59,783 --> 01:16:03,072
Scott: It's not that one movie called the platform.

1186
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:03,914
Scott: Okay.

1187
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:05,579
Rym: All right.

01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:06,040
Rym: Food time.

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1198
01:16:41,030 --> 01:17:00,920
Rym: And before I read the list of Patrion patrons who want me to say their name on the show, I will let you all know if you didn't notice, if you're a patron that I have pause the Patrion collections for the upcoming month, primarily because we're skipping so many shows due to travel and stuff in August that I feel like we'll pause it a little bit.

1199
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,412
Rym: Like you're not getting the normal GeekNights experience, but don't worry.

1200
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:13,029
Rym: After next week, not this week, but next week, then the following week, we're pretty much going to be back on the normal GeekNights schedule for the foreseeable future.

1203
01:17:42,727 --> 01:17:49,828
Rym: And now, tonight, the last show we'll do before our week away, I leave you with, sun.

Scott: take a deep breath.
