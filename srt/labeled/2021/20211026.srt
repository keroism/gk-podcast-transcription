1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,178
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:10,599
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:14,890
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,235
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:20,030
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Splitgate, its portal, and an FPS.

6
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,309
Rym: Deathmatch-y game.

7
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:25,227
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:44,830
Rym: So, uh, right around the beginning of quarantine, when we had to record GeekNights remotely, like fully remotely, as opposed to doing it in person, I didn't have like all the kind of equipment I needed, so I kind of just made do, but I eventually bought that backdrop and I got better lighting and I could sort of set everything up to do this pretty permanently.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:55,710
Rym: One of the things I bought way back then was the shittiest possible LED USB powered ring light, like the $8 one that was just on Amazon.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,175
Scott: That's what I got right here.

11
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,030
Scott: that's making my face look like, you know, the white sun.

12
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,368
Rym: That's what I got pointing at me right here.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,030
Rym: I used to use it over the webcam, but over time I moved it to the side because I rearranged the lighting.

14
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,010
Scott: Mine has a thing for the webcam to go in the middle of it, so it's actually ring lighting properly.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,950
Rym: Mine has that too, but I sit far enough away from my webcam and I'm lit from different angles anyway to where it's kind of moot.

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,110
Rym: So I moved it to the side to be like the spotlight.

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,289
Scott: It's also, you know, the sun, the earth is tilting backwards to the incorrect position, so it's getting dark now.

18
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,389
Scott: Whereas normally it would not be dark right now.

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,240
Rym: Oh, if it weren't for the rainstorm and everything, I often have to worry about.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,070
Rym: the sun comes directly in about three quarters of the way through GeekNights.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,590
Scott: Because of the time of year, also with my south facing window, it's like late in the day if it's not cloudy.

22
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:47,590
Scott: This is the time of year where the sun just comes right in the window.

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:55,190
Scott: It's like, ah, why don't you, if you're going to shoot me in the face with your bright lights, the part of you that I hate, at least make it warm, the part of you that I enjoy.

24
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,183
Scott: Nope, cold and sun in your face.

25
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,169
Scott: That's the worst convo.

26
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:08,590
Rym: So today, that ring light, the switch mechanism that controls all of its options just broke and it stuck permanently on.

27
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,029
Scott: Can't you just unplug it and plug it in?

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,107
Rym: Oh yeah, I can unplug it and plug it in, but because I was using that little control box, I actually have the USB.

29
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,289
Rym: It's not plugged into my computer because I'm just powering it.

30
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:29,550
Rym: It's actually run all the way down behind my desk and plugged into my power strip because my power strip, which is mounted to my desk, has a line of USB power slots.

31
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:39,770
Scott: Actually, so the outlets in this apartment, like a handful of them have USB in the outlet and I tested it and they totally work.

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:48,110
Scott: And there's two of them happen to be behind my desk and the ring light is one of the only things to use those because I don't trust them that much.

33
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:55,470
Rym: Yeah, so I bought power strips that I can actually screw them to the bottom of my desk so I can keep all the cables out of the way.

34
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,745
Scott: I got the cage thingy.

35
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,509
Rym: I'm gonna get a cage too, I think.

36
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,829
Rym: Anyway, so right now, all day, this ring light's been permanently on unless I climb back there and unplug it.

37
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,379
Rym: So I just ordered a new, much better solution.

38
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,949
Rym: I'm just gonna throw this thing away because it's falling apart in other ways too.

39
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,909
Rym: The clamp is starting to not clamp that well.

40
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:17,469
Rym: The clamps.

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,246
Rym: Yeah, these clamps that I've been using to clamp this ring light for two years.

42
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:21,930
Scott: That clamp?

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,449
Rym: So in some news that I was about to say only Rym cares about, but apparently other people care.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:40,710
Rym: Advanced Wars, the coming remake, which remember is counting US releases because there's a bunch of Advanced Wars in Japan that honestly we do not need here in the US.

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,030
Rym: They are categorically inferior to the Advanced Wars.

46
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,149
Scott: I've tried to play a lot of those Famicom Wars, Game Boy Wars.

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,129
Rym: They're just not as good.

48
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:57,710
Scott: Using my emulation and such, and pretty much anything older than Advanced Wars 1, it's like you really don't need to play it.

49
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,590
Rym: They're just not as good.

50
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,990
Rym: Imagine a game that's just less fun and less polished.

51
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,566
Scott: It's a turn-based game, but you don't need to play it.

52
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,549
Rym: If you want to play what those old ones are like, play, oh god, what was it called, Desert Commander or something on the NES?

53
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,221
Scott: It's basically the same series, I think.

54
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,410
Rym: So anyway, this is Advanced Wars 1 and 2, which were the first two Advanced Wars that we got in the US for real.

55
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,090
Rym: And they were both fantastic games that are very different from each other, but neither one replaces the other.

56
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,070
Rym: They are both good on their own, and they're both worth playing independently of each other.

57
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,510
Rym: They were getting this remake, they're being remastered and remade just to work on the Switch.

58
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,376
Rym: That whole project is delayed.

59
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,601
Rym: They're launching in Q2 2022 now.

60
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,130
Rym: It's probably good, because I actually plan to stream these games heavily.

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,130
Rym: I even set up the pipeline and the video capture to do it from the Switch.

62
00:04:55,331 --> 00:05:00,450
Rym: But I don't really have time for that shit right now, so it's kind of good that I got some delay before I start streaming these games.

63
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:10,759
Scott: So apparently Desert Commander in Japan, known as Desert Fox Tanks Colon Tank Strategy, does look a lot like Famicom Wars.

64
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:17,770
Scott: However, it is not in the same series as Famicom Wars and not made by the same company or anything.

65
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:29,967
Rym: What's fascinating is they're almost identical games, but what I would say is that that game feels very similar to the first two Game Boy Advance Wars.

66
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,990
Rym: that never made it to the US, just in how they play and the kinds of strategies you employ.

67
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:36,909
Rym: All of them had super broken APCs.

68
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,810
Rym: But yeah, this game's just delayed significantly, and like I said, I'm pretty fine with that.

69
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,129
Scott: Oh, so there was a Super Famicom Wars for the SNES that might be worth playing.

70
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:49,510
Scott: That one.

71
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,780
Rym: Ooh, I've never tried that one.

72
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,970
Rym: I tried the Game Boy ones and a couple other ones.

73
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,719
Rym: I've never played one that was SNES.

74
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:57,790
Rym: Now I'm a little curious.

75
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,590
Rym: So anyway, some other slightly bigger news.

76
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:09,170
Rym: As you know, Activision Blizzard is a troubled company filled with a significant number of dangerous people.

77
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,701
Rym: We've talked about this.

78
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:11,529
Rym: You can read about it.

79
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,550
Rym: Activision Blizzard is not unique in this regard.

80
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:28,170
Rym: Very similar stories have happened about Ubisoft, and pretty much every AAA studio has stories like this, though Blizzard and Ubisoft seem to have the most egregious of them that we know of, that I'm remembering recently.

81
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,310
Rym: The bar's low, is what I'm saying, for AAA studios.

82
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:48,430
Rym: So in that backdrop, despite the fact that Blizzard stock is way up because Call of Duty is selling fine and none of this stuff seems to have impacted game sales at all, they are canceling BlizzCon completely.

83
00:06:49,141 --> 00:07:00,230
Rym: They issued a statement saying that there's no future date planned, they're not rescheduling it, it's just cancelled, and they're going to reinvent what BlizzCon is before it returns.

84
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,190
Scott: Well, I mean, that's not a surprise, because what was BlizzCon, right?

85
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,650
Scott: BlizzCon was just a very few things, right?

86
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,730
Scott: It was an esports event, right?

87
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:22,890
Scott: And a lot of their esports action has taken a hit, and even when their drama was barely starting, a lot of the people that were getting laid off there were esports people.

88
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:28,989
Rym: Or people were just quitting who were the ones who were instrumental in the success of their esports up to that point.

89
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:38,548
Scott: So other than Overwatch League, it really feels like that esports as a whole over there has sort of been neglected.

90
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:47,170
Scott: It's not like they're not doing it anymore, but they used to be all in on it, and they've been less so as time has gone on.

91
00:07:47,432 --> 00:08:10,028
Rym: I have anecdotal, now full disclosure, this is an anecdotal of one person and my very limited feed, but what I can say is that in my media feeds over the last year or so, how often Hearthstone was talked about went from this baseline level of there'd be some chatter on a nearly daily basis to "I never see anyone talking about Hearthstone

92
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:10,210
Rym: anymore.".

93
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,609
Scott: That's because I was playing it, and then I stopped playing it, and that's why the amount you heard about it went down.

94
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,070
Rym: But you were not the only person I followed who would talk about Hearthstone, to be clear.

95
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,890
Rym: But I do think that is a factor.

96
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,290
Scott: That's probably the most significant factor.

97
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:32,890
Scott: So the other thing BlizzCon is for is for basically announcing your shit with your panels, right?

98
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,211
Scott: But A, the only thing they got coming is Diablo 4.

99
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:54,369
Scott: B, they just relaunched a bunch of stuff, because Activision Blizzard is one big umbrella, Losing so many people, a lot of their stuff is getting delayed, not coming, so they don't have as much to announce.

100
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:03,708
Scott: And a lot of the people who are probably involved in the running of BlizzCon, it's losing people disrupted, probably, the event itself.

101
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,625
Scott: So it's like, why spend all the money to have this thing, plus pandemic's not over, even if it's online only.

102
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,270
Scott: There's no purpose to this event.

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,910
Scott: Let's not spend our money on nothing and come back if we're going to have a convention.

104
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,750
Scott: Not every company has their own convention.

105
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,205
Scott: There's no UbisoftCon.

106
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:29,930
Scott: that I'm aware of.

107
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:36,710
Rym: A lot of companies have a game-specific event, usually because of esports, or because it's a very, very well-known property.

108
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,969
Scott: I guess QuakeCon, does that still exist?

109
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:39,154
Rym: I assume so.

110
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:42,610
Rym: I mean, I only go to PAXes and MagFests, so what do I know?

111
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,270
Scott: I don't know anything.

112
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:55,890
Rym: Or they'll either use existing generic gaming conferences, they'll have a game-specific thing usually around an esport, but the franchise company-type event?

113
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:05,090
Rym: I feel like the Nintendo Direct is how you do that in the modern world, or the Tim Apple Roadshow is how you do that in the modern world.

114
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:18,990
Scott: Yeah, Blizzard, to my knowledge, I've never seen them do that, so they could just have an Activision Blizzard Direct equivalent where they come out with a fancy keynote-type video every once in a while to announce their new shit on a regular basis.

115
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,470
Scott: And that marketing strategy seems to work, actually.

116
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:25,133
Scott: And you know what?

117
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:35,969
Scott: I actually kind of like that marketing strategy, even though I hate ads, because it's not an ad that comes and interrupts you.

118
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,470
Scott: It's not an ad that's on something.

119
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,110
Rym: Well, it's an ad that I seek out.

120
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,469
Rym: I go to Tim Apple and I say, "Tim, tell me about your

121
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,670
Rym: shit.".

122
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,030
Scott: Right, exactly.

123
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:54,829
Scott: It's an ad, but there's in no way intrudes into your life in any way unless you purposefully go to watch it.

124
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,620
Scott: They don't try to shove it at you in any way.

125
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,405
Scott: And as an ad, it's not like a car ad.

126
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:09,609
Scott: that's trying to use psychology and repetition and all the advertising marketing techniques to get in your head.

127
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:11,241
Scott: All of those, right?

128
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:20,588
Scott: The Apple ones, with their magical, life-changing "get an Apple Watch so you don't die" stuff, they do a little bit of that.

129
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:25,470
Rym: At least I'm there like, "Yes, I do want to know what's up with Apple.

130
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,236
Rym: Sell it to

131
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:26,378
Rym: me.".

132
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:30,809
Scott: But yeah, it's mostly just, "Here are our new products.

133
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,487
Scott: Here's what they do.

134
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,770
Scott: You didn't even have to watch this.

135
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,490
Scott: You could have just read an article summary afterwards.

136
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,208
Scott: The end.

137
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,130
Scott: And we're going to do this again when we have more products to announce.

138
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,087
Scott: And if you don't care about our products, you wouldn't be even watching this right now in the first

139
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:48,369
Scott: place.".

140
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:54,160
Scott: So it's like, if you're a company, and even if I had my way, "Ban all ads on Earth,".

141
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,949
Scott: companies still need to announce their products somehow.

142
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:02,679
Scott: If you make something, you need to tell everyone, "Hey, I made this thing.

143
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:02,963
Scott: It's for

144
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:03,288
Scott: sale.".

145
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,159
Rym: But you know what this is?

146
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,050
Rym: This is one hand.

147
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,370
Rym: Old-style advertising that was in the early days before people did it.

148
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,510
Rym: the way they do it today, it was often just, "Here's a product.

149
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,290
Rym: It almost reads like a press release.

150
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,601
Rym: Here are all of its features.

151
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,470
Rym: Here's its price.

152
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,780
Rym: Here's how to find out

153
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:18,921
Rym: more.".

154
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:24,309
Scott: A Nintendo Direct is literally just like, "Here are the games coming out soon.

155
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,421
Scott: Let us show you them.

156
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:25,947
Scott: This one.

157
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,237
Scott: Also this one.

158
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:27,746
Scott: Check out this

159
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:27,929
Scott: one.".

160
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:46,590
Rym: But I think another thing that happens here, especially with an event like BlizzCon, gaming events like this tend to, once they get going, it's hard to start a new one, but once you've got one going, momentum almost can carry it forward with surprisingly little surprise or additional costs.

161
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:58,170
Rym: The incremental cost of making another PAX or another BlizzCon is so little compared to the cost of making the first one that it's easy to just keep going.

162
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:12,845
Scott: Once you have attendance, getting the attendance is hard, but once you have attendance, let's say you get an event and a thousand people show up, you have close to a thousand people who, if you have that event again next year, will show up.

163
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:15,990
Rym: It can't just be the attendance.

164
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:23,426
Rym: You also have the production pipeline, the system and bureaucracy that causes the event to actually occur.

165
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,103
Rym: Because some events have attendance and not logistics, and that is how you get a DashCon.

166
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:35,730
Scott: We talk about that all the time with anything that you want to do in the world.

167
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:40,310
Scott: You can do a thing by hand and handcraft a thing, but then that's it.

168
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,008
Scott: You did it once.

169
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,389
Scott: Alternatively, you can create a machine that makes the thing.

170
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,349
Scott: If you build a machine that runs a convention, that convention is just going to keep happening.

171
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:55,669
Scott: If you, on your own, make a convention happen with your will, you might do it.

172
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,650
Scott: You can't repeat that without hurting yourself.

173
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:05,990
Rym: In fact, we low-key would hurt ourselves dealing with the lack of logistics at certain conventions in the past.

174
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:14,770
Scott: If you want to make a movie, you could grab a camera and your friends sweat blood and tears and make a movie.

175
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:16,284
Scott: A lot of people have done it.

176
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:24,549
Scott: But if you make a movie studio, and you get it off the ground, which is the hard part, it'll just keep making movies.

177
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:28,890
Scott: As long as it makes a successful movie, it'll make another one.

178
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,310
Scott: It'll just keep getting contracts to make more movies.

179
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,589
Rym: It's that very powerful idea that the most valuable thing you can make is the machine that makes the machine, not the machine itself.

180
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,890
Rym: But the other thing that happens is once that ball's rolling, it has that momentum.

181
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:50,450
Rym: If you want to change something significant about your event, the risks are nearly infinite.

182
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,607
Rym: Imagine if PAX wanted to radically change some aspect of PAX.

183
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,270
Rym: How will the attendees react?

184
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,629
Rym: How will the logistics go?

185
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,929
Rym: Who do we need to involve?

186
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,909
Rym: We have less than a year to make this change because the last PAX just happened.

187
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:13,989
Scott: But anyway, Blizzard had a machine that made Blizzcons and they intentionally turned it off, at least temporarily, and we'll see what comes of that.

188
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,004
Rym: But it's the perfect time to do that.

189
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:21,370
Rym: if you're a company and a convention can't survive multiple separate disasters simultaneously.

190
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,036
Rym: There's so many things that make Blizzcon a bad idea.

191
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,763
Rym: It's literally the perfect time to just pause long enough to take that machine and try to rework it.

192
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,770
Rym: So we'll see what comes of it.

193
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,390
Rym: We'll also see what comes of the ongoing litigation around Activision Blizzard.

194
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:42,110
Rym: And I cannot stress enough, don't pretend that this is the only bad guy company out there, all these AAA game studios.

195
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,486
Scott: Every single one of them is the same, right?

196
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,082
Scott: Is it a company that makes AAA games?

197
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:48,617
Scott: Yes.

198
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,530
Scott: Then I assume it is guilty of all the same crimes as Activision Blizzard.

199
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:52,995
Rym: Yep.

200
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,935
Rym: So got a little, little news here.

201
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:59,076
Rym: I don't know why this was news, but it popped up in my feed from two different sources.

202
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:00,854
Rym: So I thought this was funny.

203
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:12,790
Rym: Multiple sources have confirmed that you can't use, quote, "rumble packs" or other accessories, unquote, with the new Switch-compatible N64 wireless controller.

204
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,070
Scott: That makes no sense, because the N64 wireless controller that you... So just so people are aware of what this is, right?

205
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:26,554
Scott: So if you get a Switch, you get Joy-Cons, or you can buy a Switch Pro controller, or you can buy a third-party controller, right?

206
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,090
Scott: Those are pretty much your options.

207
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:36,959
Scott: But if you pay for Nintendo Switch online service, right, you get those NES, SNES, and now if you pay even more, N64 games.

208
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:42,499
Scott: So they will sell you, if you have the service already, they will sell you an NES controller.

209
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:43,108
Scott: I have one.

210
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:57,342
Scott: And it's literally just a wireless NES controller, just like the ones from back in the day, but it works with your Switch with Bluetooth immediately and perfectly, and you can pretty much use it for the NES game thing, right?

211
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,414
Scott: It's not too useful.

212
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,880
Scott: You could try to play a Switch game with it, but it doesn't have enough buttons.

213
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:04,148
Scott: And they also sell a Super Nintendo one that does the same thing.

214
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:07,118
Scott: And now they sell an N64 one that does the same thing.

215
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,738
Scott: It's an N64 controller, except it's wireless and works with your Switch.

216
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:11,869
Scott: It's sold separately.

217
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,955
Scott: There you go.

218
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:19,498
Scott: Why would you want to use a rumble pack with it when it has rumble built in?

219
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,136
Scott: It's a modern controller.

220
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,450
Scott: It has its own fucking rumble.

221
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,829
Scott: It doesn't need a rumble pack.

222
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:33,037
Rym: And if you didn't think that was obvious, why would Nintendo in the year 2021 manufacture a new controller that didn't just use a standard rumble pack built into it?

223
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:43,500
Scott: And why would they bother to go through the hassle of making it compatible with rumble packs from the late 90s when almost no one fucking has one of those things?

224
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,410
Scott: Never mind.

225
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,729
Rym: What the fuck else do you think you're gonna plug into that thing?

226
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:59,198
Scott: And if it didn't have rumble in it, and it required people to get a rumble pack, and they weren't manufacturing new rumble packs, who the fuck would go- there'd be a run on old rumble packs, who the fuck would go and buy- get those.

227
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:07,502
Rym: But like what, are you gonna plug- are you gonna plug that like weird memory card into it, thinking you can transfer a save game from the Switch port, and like a real N64?

228
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:13,421
Rym: Like, what would- what does anyone involved in these stories think was going to happen?

229
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,086
Scott: Someone just asked a really foolish question.

230
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:25,039
Scott: It's like you know, if you really want to use an N64 controller to play the games on the Switch, the N64 games, go ahead and buy this thing, 'cause that's what it does.

231
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:25,444
Scott: Yeah.

232
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,885
Scott: Um, just don't ask nonsense questions.

233
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:28,612
Rym: I love how.

234
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:31,641
Rym: the first comment on this article is, "I was hoping to have double

235
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,044
Rym: rumble.".

236
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:33,685
Scott: Double rumble?

237
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:33,950
Scott: Okay.

238
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:39,261
Scott: I could- I could go with that, but if you want double rumble, just get the- the rez, you know, the famous rez thing.

239
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:39,849
Rym: Yep.

240
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:49,049
Rym: And uh, one last little news, uh, so, the new Switch, the OLED Switch came out, and so far, it seems like outside of Japan, it's not actually selling that well.

241
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,589
Rym: Probably because everyone who wanted a Switch already has a Switch that works fine, is my guess.

242
00:18:55,953 --> 00:19:09,285
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, and even so, a lot of people who might buy a Switch, right, will go to the store, look at the Switches, and if you're not like a nerd, what do you care, fucking OLED for extra- it's extra money, right?

243
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:13,408
Scott: And you can't fucking tell the difference unless you're a huge nerd who knows what OLED is.

244
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:18,780
Scott: Um, so if you're giving it to a kid, why- why the fuck would you pay for the OLED ones?

245
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,123
Scott: You know, it still doesn't make- the old one is still there.

246
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:32,536
Scott: So, you know, it's- it- for the OLED, you want to eat into sales of the old one, you need, A, people who broke a Switch, like if my Switch broke, I'd probably buy the OLED one, right?

247
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:35,022
Scott: But, most people, who knows?

248
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:42,194
Scott: Or, extreme nerds who care a lot, and use their Switch a lot, and are way into it, will like, upgrade to that new one.

249
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:47,407
Rym: Yeah, but like, Nintendo's stock was down a little, and a lot of people were saying, "Oh, this is a miss from Nintendo,".

250
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,989
Rym: or like, "Hey, turns out people didn't care about the OLED,".

251
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,890
Rym: and everyone's forgetting.

252
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:58,134
Rym: They did not- like, Nintendo very clearly did not make this as, like, an upgrade to an existing, perfectly good Switch.

253
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:04,359
Scott: Right, it's not- it's not a fumble like with the new 3DS, where like, yeah, there were hardly any games, right?

254
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:14,075
Rym: This is just more like, alright, we're gonna use a better, more modern production pipeline to make an incrementally better product, instead of maintaining the pipeline that made the old one.

255
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,270
Rym: They're probably either saving money, or have better margins, there's a lot of reasons why they manufacture this.

256
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,636
Scott: Hardware has chipped, you know, new chips are out, you know, the world has changed, these parts are cheaper, right?

257
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:44,515
Scott: It's, you know, let's make this, you know, let's change our stuff at the factory, and we're gonna have to produce Switches differently, for reasons at factories, so now we're producing this Switch instead, hey, let's take advantage of that and market it as an upgraded thing because, yeah, we're using a different screen in there, you know.

258
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,377
Scott: It's not like.

259
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:51,105
Scott: they went out and they said, "Ah, this is our strategy to make more money, we're gonna make this OLED Switch,

260
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:51,509
Scott: yeah!".

261
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:54,017
Scott: That wasn't the start of the, right?

262
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:54,485
Scott: That was the-.

263
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:02,189
Rym: If anything, I think it speaks to Nintendo's strength, that they are committing to a long lifespan for the extremely popular Nintendo Switch.

264
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:12,489
Rym: So, anyone who says this is bad news for Nintendo or for Nintendo gamers, is probably the same kind of person who thought that this was gonna be a 4K Switch.

265
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,829
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

266
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:32,463
Rym: So, this is a video of a match between Peru and Alemanias of Germany, and this is the Balloon World Cup.

267
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:45,680
Rym: If you've never played the game Balloon, it is one of the rare games, it's a sport, and it's a game and a sport, that has, it's one of the rare instances of having absolutely perfect rules where I would change nothing.

268
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,867
Scott: It is a game where you have two people and everyone just knows the rules as soon as they're born.

269
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:52,644
Scott: Yeah, like, every kid plays this.

270
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,949
Scott: You don't even need to be told the rules, you just know them.

271
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:59,940
Rym: In fact, if you watch this video, I defy you to make it more than five.

272
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:08,769
Rym: let's see, exactly, 'cause including every possible edge case, you will not make it more than three seconds into this video without knowing literally every rule to this game.

273
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:16,352
Rym: The game is, there's a balloon, not filled with helium, just filled with regular old air, and you hit it.

274
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:22,607
Rym: If it touches the ground, before your opponent hits it, you win, or you get a point.

275
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,900
Rym: And, you just try to keep this balloon in the air as long as possible.

276
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:33,840
Scott: This game is- And you alternate taking turns, hitting the balloon, and I don't know what happens if it pops, according to the rules.

277
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:35,199
Rym: I do also not know what happens if it pops.

278
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,950
Scott: I could look it up, though.

279
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:41,560
Rym: The rule we used as kids was whoever touched it last loses if it pops.

280
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,913
Scott: Could be.

281
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:44,980
Scott: Okay, acceptable rule.

282
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:50,438
Rym: The other rule that might not be super obvious is you can't interfere with the other person.

283
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,519
Scott: It's not a contact sport.

284
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,433
Rym: But you can hit this thing anywhere.

285
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:58,179
Scott: Yeah, sure.

286
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,046
Rym: So, I would love to see this just straight up be the omega-thon finale.

287
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,166
Scott: I guess you also can't, like, grab the balloon, right?

288
00:23:04,187 --> 00:23:05,499
Scott: You have to strike it.

289
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,085
Rym: Well, I mean, volleyball has rules like that.

290
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:17,499
Rym: A lot of sports have rules where you can't carry, even tennis, you can't carry the ball in your racket, even though- Basketball pretends to have rules like that.

291
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,086
Scott: I will admit- Soccer does, too.

292
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:26,993
Rym: I'm gonna admit right now, I have cheated a little bit at ping pong in the past.

293
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,694
Rym: I was real good at doing a carry so fast that no one could see.

294
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:31,299
Rym: that's what I did.

295
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,208
Rym: I think if you went to real ping pong, you would be- Oh, yeah, they would catch me, but at a bar or something, no one would ever see that.

296
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,359
Scott: Yeah, drunken people, though.

297
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:42,758
Scott: Would that even help you, though, at ping pong?

298
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:55,998
Rym: Yeah, because what I can do, especially if it works against someone who's moving slow, is I can basically swing the racket around to catch the ball, push it forward, but while it's still in contact, rotate, and then push it down.

299
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,844
Rym: I basically do a straight, almost a straight down slam.

300
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,259
Rym: that doesn't look like it's gonna be a slam until the last second.

301
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,280
Rym: It's of dubious legality.

302
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:08,499
Rym: So, what do you got?

303
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:10,489
Scott: What do I have?

304
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,591
Scott: So, we may have used this YouTube channel before as a thing of the day.

305
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:18,732
Scott: They have lots of experts in various things and ask them questions, right?

306
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:21,014
Scott: Or have Twitter come and ask them questions.

307
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,518
Scott: I think there was a CIA guy on there sometime or something, right?

308
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:43,217
Scott: However, a video appeared, thanks to YouTube recommendations, from this wired tech support channel, and this time, the expert person was a poison expert, and it's like, "Whoa, I'm actually gonna find out for real about

309
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:43,540
Scott: poison.".

310
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:47,239
Scott: And, yeah, you find out for real about poison.

311
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:52,310
Scott: Some of the information is sort of obvious and basic stuff that you know.

312
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:56,840
Scott: isn't that fascinating, but some of the information is very fascinating.

313
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:05,076
Scott: And there were also many myths debunked or bunked, I guess would be the opposite term.

314
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:22,400
Scott: you know, I guess watching this video, you could I guess, you know, if you're very unlucky, this information in this video could help you or someone nearby you survive poisoning.

315
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,200
Scott: Or fall to poisoning.

316
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,669
Scott: Please don't poison anybody for real, but only joke about poisoning people like I do.

317
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,539
Scott: You'll never actually poison anybody.

318
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:37,466
Rym: Yeah, stay away when a weird girl tries to give you shaved ice as well.

319
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:44,252
Scott: One spoiler, I guess, is this person did answer one question exactly the same way.

320
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,284
Scott: I would have answered it.

321
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:50,271
Scott: They were asked, effectively, the question was, "How do I tell the poison mushroom from the real

322
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:50,675
Scott: mushroom?".

323
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:54,980
Scott: And my brain started saying, "If it's at the grocery

324
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:55,868
Scott: store.".

325
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:02,914
Scott: And then the woman said in the video, "If it's at the grocery store, it's a safe mushroom to eat.

326
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,353
Scott: Otherwise, don't eat

327
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:04,498
Scott: it.".

328
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,084
Scott: Did I say this

329
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:21,939
Rym: on GeekNights or just say it to you, but when we were hiking, me and Emily were hiking a few weeks ago, we passed a couple arguing in Russian, and the dude was holding up a big mushroom that he'd clearly picked, and it looked like he was arguing that they could eat it, and the woman was arguing with him that that is a terrible idea and trying to get him to throw it away.

330
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:23,960
Scott: Do not eat the mushroom.

331
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,637
Scott: Is that mushroom from the grocery store?

332
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:26,939
Scott: No?

333
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,750
Scott: Should you eat the mushroom?

334
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,138
Scott: Those questions have the same answer at all times.

335
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:39,122
Rym: There is no, I mean, I'm glad there are people who exist who we trust to do this.

336
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:46,920
Rym: for grocery stores, because I, there is no amount of research, study, and training I would do where I would personally eat a mushroom I picked under any circumstances.

337
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,930
Scott: Well, the mushrooms, also, the mushrooms at the grocery store are not harvested from the forest, right?

338
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,475
Scott: Some of them are.

339
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,929
Scott: At least, not where you live.

340
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,840
Scott: Not where we're here, right?

341
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,994
Scott: They're from a mushroom growing place that's growing them.

342
00:26:58,055 --> 00:26:58,340
Rym: No!

343
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:01,830
Rym: A lot more mushrooms than you expect.

344
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,195
Rym: Not like creminis or anything, but like, I get a lot of mushrooms from Fresh Direct and from the grocery store that are foraged.

345
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,596
Scott: Mmm, how do you know?

346
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,674
Rym: They're specifically foraged.

347
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,140
Rym: A lot of mushrooms can't be grown in mushroom groweries.

348
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,340
Rym: I don't know what the term is for that kind of place.

349
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,440
Scott: That doesn't seem possible.

350
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Scott: I could figure out a way.

351
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:31,080
Rym: There was just a SciShow episode on this like, a few months ago, talking about all the unfarmables that, basically, there are a bunch of foods, many of them are mushrooms.

352
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:36,418
Rym: You could be infinitely rich if you could figure out how to grow these as opposed to foraging them.

353
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,572
Scott: Just take one that already exists and shit all its spores all over some dirt.

354
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:43,340
Rym: Oh yeah, guess what?

355
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,653
Rym: Turns out that doesn't work.

356
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:50,497
Rym: Some of these only grow in a particular kind of tree that's beyond a certain age that only grows in certain soil and weird crap like that.

357
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,839
Scott: So get that tree in that soil and buy that land.

358
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:55,883
Rym: Oh, yeah.

359
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,259
Rym: If it were that easy, a lot of these things would be a lot cheaper, but they're not.

360
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:01,946
Scott: Anyway.

361
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:11,480
Rym: Anyway, I do not trust mushrooms foraged by anyone other than an expert via a large commercial pipeline with lots of liability involved.

362
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:13,032
Scott: Yeah.

363
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:13,805
Scott: Poison is cool.

364
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,038
Scott: Let's move on.

365
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:21,300
Rym: So, uh, yeah, in the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which I have paused to read the first volume of a manga.

366
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:23,298
Rym: Stay tuned.

367
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:28,458
Rym: But, uh, the tale of Genji, as Genji just continues to sleepwalk and/or fuck his way through life.

368
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:30,755
Rym: It's the first novel.

369
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,719
Scott: You're gonna say that same thing every time there.

370
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,620
Rym: I mean, unless we talk about specific instances of it, which we should say for the book club book episode.

371
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:48,211
Scott: Uh, I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to basically, you know, as I'm reading, I'm trying to take a note just like, you know, there's what, 50-something chapters.

372
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:52,310
Scott: I'm basically trying to write, like, one sentence for each chapter.

373
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,638
Rym: That's a real good idea for a book like this.

374
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:56,414
Rym: Like, that's where the ghost killed a girl.

375
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,474
Rym: That's where he had sex with the wrong woman.

376
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,620
Rym: That's the other time he had sex with the wrong woman.

377
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,232
Scott: That's where so-and-so died.

378
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:03,778
Scott: That's where a bunch of people died.

379
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,848
Rym: But, uh, yeah, otherwise, our last panel is still just on YouTube.

380
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:10,739
Rym: It's our game design.

381
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:15,871
Rym: It'll always be on YouTube, but I guess you should watch it because we spend a lot of time making it.

382
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:21,179
Rym: Stay tuned for, I guess, Q2 2022 when I'll start streaming Advance Wars.

383
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:25,280
Rym: And, uh, yeah, we found someone to help us build our website.

384
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:32,920
Rym: So, if you were thinking about applying to that job, you can hold off for the time being unless things go horribly wrong in the near future.

385
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:36,351
Scott: I guess that's not impossible, but it doesn't seem likely.

386
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,173
Scott: We're gonna make some progress here.

387
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:42,269
Scott: I actually, if you go to, you can proof that I've worked on this, right?

388
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,848
Scott: You can go to beta.frontrowcrew.com, and you'll see the words beta.frontrowcrew.com there.

389
00:29:49,564 --> 00:30:03,217
Scott: Uh, which I know isn't exciting, but there is actually a complex, yeah, there is actually a complex back end of technology with databases and such and whatnot behind that single tiny HTML file.

390
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,397
Scott: So, progress has been made.

391
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,245
Rym: Wait, I'm gonna break the law in red states.

392
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:09,235
Rym: I'm gonna view page source.

393
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:09,740
Rym: Oh, look at that.

394
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,488
Rym: Some HTML.

395
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:11,340
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:17,419
Scott: And if you go to newsletter.frontrowcrew.com, there is a live, new newsletter platform.

397
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,620
Scott: Uh, I switched us over from tiny letter, and I'll finish writing a newsletter at some point.

398
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,248
Scott: Who knows?

399
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:24,979
Scott: This year?

400
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,240
Rym: Scott writes good newsletters.

401
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:28,143
Scott: A year?

402
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:28,447
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,064
Scott: Never?

404
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:33,679
Scott: But I just move it over to a new platform and then never use it?

405
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,460
Rym: Hey, but every now and then one comes out.

406
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,166
Rym: They're always good.

407
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:37,620
Scott: But it's live.

408
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,284
Scott: There's a thing.

409
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:38,831
Scott: I did that.

410
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:39,580
Scott: I did something.

411
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:40,044
Scott: Yeah.

412
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:40,916
Scott: That wasn't shit talk.

413
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,579
Scott: I successfully moved it to a new platform, so.

414
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,558
Rym: So, let's get right into it.

415
00:30:46,700 --> 00:31:02,443
Rym: Splitgate is basically a free to play multiplayer first person shooter deathmatch++, because it has a lot of modes, crossed with Portal the game, where you can throw two portals anywhere in the world with constraints and just move between them.

416
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:03,251
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:07,300
Scott: So, in Portal the game came out in a long time ago already.

418
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:08,627
Scott: Yeah.

419
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:15,093
Scott: When that game came out, everyone, the obvious thought was well, obviously.

420
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:15,840
Scott: 2007.

421
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,140
Rym: GeekNights had been running for less than two years.

422
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:20,907
Scott: So, the same year that we came out basically.

423
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:30,140
Scott: So, when that came out, the obvious thought was, oh, obviously, you're going to make a multiplayer FPS, where everyone also has a portal gun and a gun gun.

424
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:31,168
Scott: That's all I wanted.

425
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,997
Scott: That's such a brain dead thing, right?

426
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:40,826
Scott: Because Portal and Portal 2 were obviously just puzzle platform FPSs with no gun, no shooting and killing really.

427
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:52,200
Scott: And they even teased heavily that Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 episode 2, 3, whatever it was going to be, 3, I get the episode.

428
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:52,935
Scott: that never came out.

429
00:31:54,303 --> 00:32:04,059
Scott: It was heavily implied that that would be a single player FPS, where you had a portal gun, presumably also the gravity gun, and gun guns.

430
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,546
Scott: But, of course, that never came to be.

431
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:10,893
Scott: And probably will never come to be.

432
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:16,766
Scott: So, this obvious idea for an amazing multiplayer game was just out there for free.

433
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,948
Scott: Anyone could do it at any time.

434
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:22,608
Scott: I believe there may have been prior attempts to do it.

435
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:31,535
Scott: But, until now, with the release of Splitgate, no one has, this is like the biggest, most for real attempt there has been.

436
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:36,825
Scott: It is a multiplayer FPS, where you have the portal gun, and you have gun guns.

437
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,503
Scott: And you shoot the other team.

438
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:46,586
Rym: Now, part of this might have been that the technology that drove Portal did not scale well to multiple players.

439
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:47,555
Rym: It was designed...

440
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:48,464
Scott: It could have been done.

441
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,616
Scott: There had to be a way.

442
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,711
Rym: I think it would have been a significant rewrite to make that happen.

443
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,296
Scott: Regardless...

444
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:10,000
Rym: The other thing is, Portal, the portals themselves were, while the technology that made that happen were cool, the real magic of Portal was the insane amount of detail that went into the puzzles and the environments to make the portals fun and interesting.

445
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:18,819
Rym: And, I just imagine the game design challenge of making it that polished for the multiplayer experience, especially a deathmatching multiplayer experience.

446
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:23,961
Scott: You never need to make it... I think that's the flawed thinking, right?

447
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:27,074
Scott: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough, right?

448
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:34,267
Scott: It's like, you could have just taken fucking Quake Deathmatch, not changed a damn thing, other than, oh yeah, there's a portal gun now in addition to the other guns.

449
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:36,993
Rym: And then just watch how people play it and see what happens and iterate from there.

450
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,369
Scott: Yeah, just fucking go for it, right?

451
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,099
Scott: It's like, come on.

452
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,525
Rym: I mean, how did Quake Deathmatch evolve?

453
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:46,457
Rym: They just made it, they threw it out there, and then they iterated on it as people fucked with it and enjoyed it.

454
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:49,080
Scott: So, Splitgate, what's the deal with Splitgate?

455
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:58,719
Scott: So, in Splitgate, the portal gun, the most important part, the way it works is you have two different buttons for the two different portals, right?

456
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:00,392
Scott: Just like regular Portal.

457
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:02,331
Scott: There are only some surfaces.

458
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,553
Scott: you can put them on, just like regular Portal.

459
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:09,444
Scott: You can see through the portal to the other side only if it's your portal.

460
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:17,120
Scott: You can't see through other people's portals, but you can walk through them assuming they're linked up and not just a half portal with no other end to them.

461
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,503
Rym: Yep, like you can throw one of your portals somewhere and then just not throw the other one until you're ready.

462
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:24,391
Scott: Or someone could erase one end.

463
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,179
Scott: We'll talk about that.

464
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,543
Scott: You can walk through the portal.

465
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,068
Scott: You can shoot through the portal.

466
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,149
Scott: Even if it's not yours, you can shoot through it.

467
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,956
Scott: You might not be able to see what the hell you're shooting on the other side.

468
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:38,230
Scott: You might be wasting ammo, but you can shoot through it.

469
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:58,652
Scott: So, for example, you can put one of your portals way high up in the level and put another one in a tiny room where you're hiding and now you can snipe at the whole level from a tiny room and if someone wants to shoot you, they can come find you or they can just shoot in this portal that's prominently above the whole level and that they can see bullets coming out of and killing their friend.

470
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:00,653
Rym: And that you're probably standing right in front of.

471
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:01,846
Rym: Your head's just right there.

472
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:04,076
Scott: Yeah, if they shoot at the portal, they're gonna hit you.

473
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:07,200
Scott: So, it's not that great.

474
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:11,927
Scott: It works, but it's not some unbeatable camping strat, right?

475
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:15,180
Scott: And then, as I mentioned, you can get rid of portals.

476
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Scott: There's a grenade you have and the grenade doesn't hurt anybody, sadly.

477
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:24,433
Scott: But if you throw a grenade at a portal, whether it's yours or someone else's, it erases it.

478
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,020
Rym: And you can really wing these things.

479
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:28,980
Rym: You can wing that grenade all across the mat.

480
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,308
Scott: Yeah, kinda.

481
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,079
Scott: A little bit.

482
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:35,260
Scott: But, you know, it's like if someone's running away from you and there's a portal, they're running towards the portal.

483
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,660
Scott: just throw the grenade, they'll just bump into the wall and then you shoot them, right?

484
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:40,279
Scott: That kind of thing happens.

485
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,633
Rym: So, this game is pretty fun.

486
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:45,584
Rym: Like, we've been playing it.

487
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,038
Rym: Not a ton, but we've been playing it.

488
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:53,039
Rym: And, like Scott said, it's not perfect, but it does what we thought it would do.

489
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,979
Rym: It is an FPS where you're just doing multiplayer competitive with a million different modes with portals.

490
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,210
Scott: But, you have a little jetpack.

491
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:05,200
Scott: It's not like the tribes jetpack, but it's a little like a double jump.

492
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,358
Scott: It's like double jump plus, right?

493
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Rym: But that's not in every mode either.

494
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:15,159
Rym: The interesting thing about this game is that it has a million, million, million modes.

495
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,896
Scott: Way more modes.

496
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,604
Scott: I think rather than try to figure out which mode was the best mode, they're just like, let's put in all the modes.

497
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:26,533
Scott: Let people vote and decide which mode they want to play.

498
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:27,808
Scott: Well, you know the story behind this game?

499
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,010
Rym: Because I think it's one oh four seven games.

500
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,908
Rym: It's a pretty small shop.

501
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,480
Rym: They made the original game with no funding.

502
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:36,680
Rym: Just by themselves.

503
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,006
Rym: And then they put a demo out.

504
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:42,453
Rym: People liked it.

505
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:47,825
Rym: They announced actually over the summer that it was going to be indefinitely in a beta state.

506
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,060
Rym: And they're basically tweaking it constantly as far as we can see, even now.

507
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:54,058
Rym: There's a significant update that just happened.

508
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,927
Scott: Definitely feels like it's sort of in that Rocket League category.

509
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,452
Scott: It's obviously not as popular and big as Rocket League.

510
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:05,492
Scott: And I don't think it's as fresh and amazing as Rocket League.

511
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:15,428
Scott: So I don't know if it deserves that amount of popularity, but it's that multiplayer competitive game that has some uniqueness and isn't AAA amazingness.

512
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,478
Scott: But if you load it up and start playing it, it's like, wow, this is a really polished kind of game here.

513
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,679
Scott: It's really got something going on.

514
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,345
Rym: I guess it's almost got too much going on.

515
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:28,487
Rym: that isn't the game itself.

516
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:35,020
Rym: So this game is a modern game, meaning it has a ton of cosmetic crap.

517
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:41,134
Rym: It has all these different ways to level up your character and your stats and all this nonsense.

518
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:43,879
Rym: It has quick play and competitive and a million modes.

519
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:54,931
Rym: But whereas AAA first person shooters tend to refine those down to a limited number of ladders and a limited number of modes, this is still just a proliferation of a million, million things.

520
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,399
Rym: And two, it is free to play.

521
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,666
Rym: Completely free.

522
00:37:58,687 --> 00:37:59,596
Rym: You can just play it.

523
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:04,559
Rym: And as far as I can see, there's nothing you have to pay for that matters.

524
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:06,792
Scott: Yeah, they are not.

525
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:08,679
Scott: It's not pay to win, so that's good.

526
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,732
Scott: If it was, I wouldn't play it.

527
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:11,216
Rym: Not at all.

528
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:12,710
Rym: Wouldn't have even considered touching it.

529
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,419
Scott: But if you want to pay, there are a lot of ways you can give them money.

530
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:25,319
Scott: I haven't even looked at how many different currencies and different ways you can earn points and XPs and currencies and things.

531
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:36,065
Scott: And you can spend them on getting skins for your character, for your guns, just all kinds of things that you can skin up all over the place.

532
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:39,720
Scott: So much cosmetic microtransactions.

533
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,159
Scott: You're just like Team Fortress 2 with the hats, right?

534
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,980
Rym: It got to the point to where I consciously decided I won't even click on that stuff because clicking around it was almost too confusing.

535
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,598
Rym: There's just so much in there.

536
00:38:53,905 --> 00:39:03,562
Scott: Half of the main menu screen, almost all the buttons on there have something to do with rewards or XP or skins or gun skins.

537
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:06,900
Rym: Oh my god, every time we finish a match, it's like, you got three achievements.

538
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,029
Rym: Here's three different beaters that all filled up.

539
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:11,606
Scott: Here's four different sets of stats.

540
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,979
Scott: Next, next, next, next, play again.

541
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:14,399
Scott: I'm ignoring all that biz.

542
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,979
Scott: I kept myself in the default skin.

543
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:23,040
Scott: I did try to figure out enough just to collect XP rewards.

544
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:36,251
Scott: because this is the annoying thing about this, is that this XP, obviously, which is like your ranking, how good you are, you're used for matchmaking, and like most games, that's separate from XP.

545
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,879
Scott: you just always get for playing.

546
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:46,500
Scott: And the XP you always get for playing, it doesn't unlock anything that helps you win, but it does unlock more game modes.

547
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,326
Scott: You can't just load this up for the first time and immediately play a competitive match in certain modes, right?

548
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:59,387
Scott: You have to play enough and you just get the free XP just by playing, you know, spending money.

549
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:01,669
Scott: I don't know if you can even buy XP.

550
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,740
Scott: Maybe you can, probably.

551
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,184
Scott: I don't know.

552
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:07,912
Scott: But there are certain modes you won't be able to play until you've played enough.

553
00:40:07,932 --> 00:40:09,608
Scott: And then you can play all the modes.

554
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:12,035
Rym: Game designers, I beg you, stop doing that.

555
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,811
Rym: Just stop it.

556
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,409
Rym: I cannot deal with it.

557
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:16,700
Rym: Not a fan of that.

558
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:21,306
Rym: Even Smash was annoying that I had to do something to get all the basic characters.

559
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,044
Scott: Yeah, unlocking all the characters is like, I don't need that.

560
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:38,132
Rym: You can have your other unlocking like all the other like weird modes where people are going to collect a million me's and hats and things, like sure, whatever, but don't gate core game behind arbitrary leveling and especially not pay to win type stuff.

561
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:44,899
Scott: Yeah, I recently got to level 10 and I think that that basically unlocked almost all the things for me.

562
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,112
Scott: I can now like choose all the game modes and stuff, which I couldn't do before.

563
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:48,456
Scott: Yep.

564
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:50,457
Scott: So I think level 10 is where you get everything.

565
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:58,920
Scott: So and there's another, there is a gotcha thing where like you can get crates or like gift boxes or something and open those up and the skins and shit in there.

566
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,479
Scott: They take so long to open.

567
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:02,860
Scott: I haven't even tried to open them.

568
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:09,364
Rym: You have to like do this portal thing for each one that take, it takes minimum like 15 or 20 seconds to open each one.

569
00:41:10,274 --> 00:41:12,720
Scott: Oh, but yeah, I basically just did what you were doing with Overwatch.

570
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,889
Scott: I haven't opened any of them.

571
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,413
Scott: I get them and I don't open them.

572
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:36,534
Scott: You know, but I mean, I think that that's a common thing that games with loot boxes or crates do because they're trying to emulate the feeling, you know, you get from opening like a pack of baseball cards and like being amazed and, you know, even if you're getting ones you already have, right, it's still this up and down emotional casino-like rollercoaster.

573
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:42,616
Scott: And while I'd say, so that's why you don't want to make it an instant process, a computer could just instantly do it, right?

574
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:48,413
Scott: You want to have an animation and a presentation of like you're opening the thing, what's inside?

575
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:50,499
Scott: First up, this skin.

576
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,665
Scott: Case in point.

577
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,440
Scott: This skin you already have.

578
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,714
Rym: When I did the charity stream.

579
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:57,524
Scott: A moldy old piece of bubblegum that you're not going to eat.

580
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:09,752
Rym: When I did that charity stream because you all donated a ton of money to the Democrats and I agreed to open every one of those fucking loot boxes I had in Overwatch live on stream, it took hours and at one point I just left a book propped on my space bar and walked

581
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:10,039
Scott: away.

582
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:27,505
Rym: But on one hand it feels like gaming is so saturated with this stuff that it would lose all of its power to the point that if I even see a loot box in any game I almost like, I have this opposite reaction of I don't want to engage with it because I just feel annoyed that it even exists.

583
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,525
Rym: I'm so used to it being everywhere.

584
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:30,435
Rym: But on the

585
00:42:30,496 --> 00:42:49,139
Scott: other hand if all of gaming, tabletop, video game everything, was only the kind of games that we like competitive skill games there were just the number of people, the size of the gaming industry as a whole would be like this tiny fraction of what it is now.

586
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:58,517
Rym: We can have lots of fun games in this broad ecosystem that are not that, but they shouldn't have to all have the same fucking addictive gotcha mechanic in them.

587
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,271
Scott: Right, so let's, now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the actual game, the split game.

588
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,200
Rym: There's too many modes to talk about all of them, but we can talk a lot about.

589
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,333
Scott: I don't even know all the modes because unlock them all.

590
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:10,938
Scott: So first things.

591
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:19,159
Rym: first there's a small number of weapons and there doesn't appear to be significant like spread, like it's like it's a lot like older FPS's.

592
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,128
Scott: It doesn't feel like there's spread, it feels very halo-y in terms of the way the weapons work.

593
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,399
Rym: You can just click on heads from across the map and it pretty much just works.

594
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:36,598
Scott: Yeah, for example, we can't determine whether a sniper rifle is more accurate when you zoom in or zooming in just lets you zoom in.

595
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,637
Rym: I find I was getting more kills and also I was more effective with the sniper rifle if I never zoomed in.

596
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,080
Scott: Because you save the time, sometimes you save the time not having to zoom, but sometimes the guy's really far away.

597
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,000
Scott: So that's, you know, the sniper rifle basically kills in one shot.

598
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,803
Scott: There is, my favorite weapon is the plasma rifle, which is a lot like the one from Doom.

599
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,369
Rym: I like that, the assault rifle, the AR.

600
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,226
Scott: It's okay, it's pretty good.

601
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,498
Scott: There's an SMG that I barely ever get to use.

602
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:11,439
Scott: There's a nice like three round burst kind of, you know, rifle that you can get.

603
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:22,819
Rym: Yep, but the fun part about these weapons is they're very old style FPS and it's sort of just like hit scan, like click and it happens, but you have very limited ammo in most modes.

604
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,760
Rym: So you're not just spraying all the time.

605
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,799
Scott: Some of the modes you basically can keep getting more weapons.

606
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:33,200
Scott: And if you die, you get ammo again and weapons again, so it's not a big deal.

607
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:39,925
Scott: But if you're not dying a lot, if you're living a long time, then ammo can become a concern because you've fired it all.

608
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:47,440
Rym: But the way damage works, and again, we're generalizing a lot because every mode has a lot of like very specific changes.

609
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,800
Rym: Some of them are radically different from other modes, but generally, if you get shot, you don't die.

610
00:44:53,242 --> 00:45:01,911
Rym: It's like the modern FPS construct of a cooldown, where you get hit, you get hit, you take damage, and if you take enough damage in a short enough span of time, you die.

611
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:03,264
Rym: So if you're under fire...

612
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:04,740
Scott: It doesn't take a lot, right?

613
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,940
Scott: A headshot from a sniper rifle will kill you.

614
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,574
Scott: The assault rifle, okay, digga digga digga digga, you're dead, right?

615
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:17,040
Rym: But if you like tag someone a couple times from a distance with like the SMG, they might make it to cover before you tag them the last time.

616
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,118
Rym: that actually finishes them off.

617
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:20,200
Scott: And then they'll get their health back, eventually.

618
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,096
Scott: There's some sort of like automatic, just there's no health packs or anything.

619
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:26,315
Scott: There's no healing, medkits, bandages.

620
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:36,840
Scott: It's like if you're not in a fight, if you run away successfully, you know, you go through a portal, use your jetpack, you just get away, your health will just sort of come back, and then you'll be good as new.

621
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:57,159
Rym: I like this a lot for this game in particular, because if you have a game like Overwatch, like a team-based FPS that's more goal-oriented and more focused, the concept of health that runs out and needs to be refilled is a way to control the ebb and flow of like the game, and like offensive/defensive zones, that kind of thing.

622
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:04,859
Rym: Old school FPSs would have the health as a, this is a finite resource you have to manage, the more damage you take, the more likely it is to die.

623
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:10,898
Rym: This, the way Splitgate does this specifically, gives you this very specific feeling.

624
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:20,759
Rym: You know in a movie, or you play certain FPSs where suddenly you come under fire from a sniper, and there's that moment where you're trying to figure out where the sniper's coming from, like where are they?

625
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,848
Rym: That feeling happens constantly in this game.

626
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:26,111
Rym: You're doing your thing, and you get tagged.

627
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,807
Rym: You've got like two seconds, maybe less, to figure out where that shot came from, or you're dead.

628
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:44,318
Rym: So, the game is a lot of run and gun, cover your friend while they run to cover, put a portal somewhere to cover yourself from behind, figure out where the sniper is, figure out how to corner them.

629
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:49,506
Rym: It's a feeling that I rarely get in competitive FPSs.

630
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:57,120
Rym: Like, PUBG, you can get that feeling sometimes, but this game is just that feeling distilled of taking fire, where's the sniper?

631
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,129
Scott: Yep.

632
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,179
Scott: So let's talk about just a few of the modes, right?

633
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:10,269
Scott: So there's a shoddy sniper mode, where just everyone has shoddy and sniper from the start, and then you, so you have a close range weapon and a long range weapon.

634
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,945
Scott: You have two teams, just get to 50 kills, I think, to win.

635
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:14,674
Rym: Something like that.

636
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:15,079
Scott: For your team.

637
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:16,250
Scott: I like the team game.

638
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,604
Scott: It's almost all of them are team games.

639
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:26,854
Scott: There's the ball one, where there's a ball, and if you grab the ball, and as long as your team is holding the ball, your team is getting points.

640
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:29,060
Rym: We had an A+ strategy for that one.

641
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:36,777
Rym: We get the ball, we don't run into this tiny room on the one map we were playing, and we just hide in there with shotguns running in circles until the match ran out.

642
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:37,040
Rym: Yeah.

643
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:39,646
Scott: They know where you are because there's like a little beacon on you.

644
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,616
Rym: Yeah, but it's like a blender of shotguns if they actually try to come in.

645
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,464
Scott: Yeah, well, and you can portal away if you have to, right?

646
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:45,929
Scott: Yep.

647
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:55,220
Scott: So there's that one, and when you're holding the ball, you can only do a melee attack with the ball, but it's a one-hit kill, so you can get a lot of kills with the ball.

648
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,574
Scott: I got five ball kills on one map.

649
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,151
Scott: What other modes were there?

650
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:04,139
Scott: There's like regular just mode, just, you know, death matchy kind of mode.

651
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:09,860
Scott: There was a king of the hill type mode where your team is a zone.

652
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:20,180
Scott: You stand in the zone, and as long as only members of your team are in the zone and enemies are not standing in it, you're gaining accumulating points, and then the zone moves occasionally.

653
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:22,299
Scott: It's like a king of the hill thing.

654
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:31,475
Scott: There's just all kinds of variants on team-based modes that aren't necessarily like, you know, the catch of the flag style, right?

655
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:38,264
Rym: So in terms of the feel of actually playing, the game is pretty slow in a good way.

656
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:39,720
Rym: Like, you don't move that fast.

657
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,526
Rym: You can run.

658
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:45,010
Scott: It's not as fast as Quake, but it's a little faster than Counter-Strike, I'd say.

659
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:59,438
Rym: Oh yeah, it's definitely faster than Counter-Strike, and the portals are interesting because in our experience so far, there's like a good chunk of the player base barely uses the portals and just seems to play like an FPS.

660
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,258
Scott: It depends on a lot of things.

661
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:12,669
Rym: The map, the mode, your team, your own skill, how used to these portals you are, because they can be as disorienting as you expect them to be.

662
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:12,790
Rym: Right.

663
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:21,821
Scott: Sometimes the portal can help you and not hurt you or hurt you and not help you, and sometimes the map is just like, "Yeah, I want to use portals, but there aren't any of

664
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:21,942
Scott: them.".

665
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:34,979
Scott: You can only use them on certain surfaces, so it's like if there don't happen to be portal surfaces in the spot that's going to help you, it's like you have a jetpack and it's like, just go, right?

666
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,640
Scott: Why mess around with these portals?

667
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:46,168
Rym: We definitely see, like, barely use the portals and you kind of just, you just see where they are, portal behind them somewhere, and just shoot them, and that just works every time.

668
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:47,905
Rym: 100% of the time, it just works.

669
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:51,096
Scott: So times the portals do work, right?

670
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:54,948
Scott: Like, I already discussed the portal camping scenario, right?

671
00:49:55,192 --> 00:50:03,860
Scott: Long range movements, like sometimes on the big open maps, you can see a portal surface on the other side of the map, and you can just cross the entire map in a split second.

672
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,119
Scott: That's very useful.

673
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,275
Scott: You know, portal in, like, the ceiling, right?

674
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:12,892
Scott: You can, like, put one up there, and then, like, put one in the side, right?

675
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:19,960
Scott: And then come down from the top, stuff like that, to reach high up areas, because, you know, you can fall out the top one, you still have the jetpack, right?

676
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,043
Scott: So you can, you know, reach some places with those.

677
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:25,114
Scott: So you're chasing someone, right?

678
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:30,446
Scott: So you could, for example, you can see through your own portals, but the enemy can't see through them.

679
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:33,416
Scott: So you leave a portal somewhere, right?

680
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:37,720
Scott: And then shoot one while you're running, run into the portal, and turn around.

681
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:46,405
Scott: Now you can see the enemy, if he's gonna come through that portal, you see him coming at you, and he can't, he's looking at a black wall, he doesn't know what's on the other side.

682
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:54,388
Scott: So you, it's sort of like a, you know, if you're just in a normal FPS, running from someone, they would just slowly murder you from behind until you died.

683
00:50:54,812 --> 00:51:00,309
Scott: Here, you can use the portal as like a little break to be like, oh, and turn around and shoot him, right?

684
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,539
Scott: Which you couldn't do in Quake, really.

685
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:13,399
Rym: And watches the videos, I've seen people do really clever stuff when they're good at this game, like, throw a portal down when someone's right behind them while they're running, and the person falls into the portal.

686
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:18,632
Scott: Yeah, and if you put your other portal, say, above a pit of death, Yeah.

687
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:18,960
Scott: Right?

688
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:24,838
Scott: If they happen to walk across the portal's surface floor, and you make them fall into it, oopsie.

689
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,869
Rym: Yeah, but I guess the end result of all this portal stuff is that there's like, there are three, like, very clear clades of players.

690
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:36,380
Rym: There's the console players, who just are terrible, like, pretty much categorically.

691
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:44,619
Rym: The people who are pretty good at, like, playing FPSs competently, and using portals a little bit, like, they use the portals, but not, like, That's us.

692
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:49,928
Rym: We're relying primarily on our FPS skills, and we're sort of using the portals as best we can.

693
00:51:50,493 --> 00:51:52,960
Rym: And then there's the people where the portal is their primary weapon.

694
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:56,397
Rym: That is how they fight, and they're invincible gods to people like us.

695
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:05,482
Scott: Well, I think there's also people where they're just very good at FPSs, and they'll just, you know, this game is headshot central, so they're just clicking on heads.

696
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,199
Scott: You basically never really see them.

697
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,099
Scott: You just die if they see you, right?

698
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:10,938
Scott: The end, so.

699
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:11,642
Rym: Yep.

700
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:12,636
Scott: So, uh,

701
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:29,420
Rym: there's such a wide gulf of skill, and a wide gulf of how people play, yet, to this game's credit, the three, like, the three of us playing a bunch, just going into random quick play, like, not really thinking about it that much, we're matched with people that are around our level.

702
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:37,504
Rym: It's not like Star Wars, where we're always matched against people who are infinitely better than us, or That's because there's no one else at our level playing Star Wars.

703
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:40,839
Rym: I think we are literally the worst players in Star Wars Squadrons.

704
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,000
Scott: Anyone worse than us is not playing.

705
00:52:43,283 --> 00:52:46,960
Rym: Yeah, they've given up, or they've never heard of an X-Wing.

706
00:52:50,631 --> 00:53:02,938
Rym: So, but, the fact that just clicking quick play, and jumping into a game, is pretty fun, is a very high praise for a game like this, because it's very easy for an FPS.

707
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:11,585
Scott: It costs nothing, zero dollars, it's a somewhat unique experience, if you've been playing all the other normal style FPSs, it's a little bit different.

708
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:17,625
Rym: To get good at the portals, though, you would have to play this game a lot, and memorize maps, like, for real.

709
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:26,880
Scott: Yep, I mean, I've memorized some of the maps a bit, but not to the extent where, like, you know, I have this sort of, like, portal forethought, or, you know, whatever.

710
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:35,099
Rym: Yeah, I mostly throw in portals, either in a panic, or very thoughtfully, like, I see there's someone up there, I'm gonna put a portal behind them.

711
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:52,537
Scott: Yeah, sometimes like that, you know, and sometimes what I'll do is, if I spawn in this portal surfaces, I'll just put one portal there, and then, when I'm out in the map, I'll just, if there's a situation, I'll throw out the second portal, and basically go back to the spawn instantly, right?

712
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:56,814
Scott: Just to have that place to go to, regardless of where it is.

713
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:19,468
Rym: I've noticed you and me both are very non-dynamic with the portals, like, I'll put one in a place that's good, like a sniping spot, or I'll put one way up, like, behind myself somewhere, so I, like, so, and then I put the second one in front of me on a wall near where I'm sniping, so I'm sniping from somewhere on the map, but I can look through the portal and see everything around me behind myself to see if anyone's sneaking up on me,

714
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:20,074
Scott: and it's,

715
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:21,104
Rym: yeah, moderately

716
00:54:21,144 --> 00:54:21,387
Scott: effective.

717
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:30,516
Scott: I tend to use, yeah, I tend to use the portals, you know, 'cause any FPS that's multiplayer, right, is sort of walk around, walk around, walk around, engage, engage, engage, right?

718
00:54:30,557 --> 00:54:48,312
Scott: There's the walk around part, and the engage part, and I tend to be using the portals a lot during the walk around part, but once I'm in the engage part, I pretty much only am using portals that are, like, there already, I'm not, like, reaching for the portal gun while I'm engaging with the enemy, I'm reaching for the gun gun.

719
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:55,000
Rym: If I pull, if I throw a portal while I'm engaging with the enemy, it's probably because I'm losing this fight, and I'm trying to get away desperately.

720
00:54:56,043 --> 00:55:05,080
Scott: Right, or, you know, I, somehow, you know, the rare instance where I think of it in advance, I go to engage with portal intent already prepared, right?

721
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,809
Scott: I can't, I don't have the instinct to in the middle of a battle, be like, "Portal, portal,

722
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:10,032
Scott: go!"

723
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:10,154
Scott: Right?

724
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,516
Rym: Though, in our last game, I started doing something that this game facilitates.

725
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:53,199
Rym: that's real fun, that I haven't done since, like, old, old multiplayer, like, Quake mod FPSs, like, that had grappling guns and stuff, where I started using portals, chaotically, just to move around unpredictably and quickly, like, I'm running, I just throw a portal to the side, I run further, I throw a portal somewhere else, I jump in it, or I don't, I'm just throwing portals and jumping through them a lot to lose people, or to obfuscate where I am, or just to kind of randomize where I am, but I'm not thinking about where it'll leave me, I'm just thinking about creating chaos and reacting to what I see on the screen as a result of that chaos.

726
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:10,409
Scott: Yeah, it becomes very, you know, if you start portaling in the middle of combat, it gets very disorienting, and yes, that can be used against you, you get disoriented and you die, but you can also use it to your advantage, disorient the enemy, either you don't die, or maybe you get really lucky and you kill them.

727
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,934
Rym: Yep, like, I got real lucky once, I threw a portal.

728
00:56:12,975 --> 00:56:21,119
Scott: To do that, but to do that with some sort of intent, where, like, you planned it that way, is next level, I will never reach that level.

729
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:33,978
Rym: Yeah, I got killed by someone where, literally, they, like, threw a portal and jumped off a ledge, and I go over the ledge to look down, and they fell through the portal, popped up out of a different portal into the air, and shot me from above.

730
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,778
Rym: I am incapable of that kind of forethought in this game so far.

731
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,002
Scott: No.

732
00:56:40,548 --> 00:57:04,779
Scott: So, yeah, if you are looking for an FPS that's different, and, you know, you don't want to pay to win, and you don't want to pay anything, I mean, if this game costs money just to play, like, it was a $50 game, even if it didn't have any microtransactions, it was just a $50 game, I don't think I would say to pay $50, but for $0, and, yeah, there's microtransaction bullshit, but it's all skins.

733
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,689
Scott: It's all skins, there's no pay to win.

734
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:16,326
Scott: Try it out, see if you like it, if you like it, keep playing it, if you don't, delete it, but I think it's worth installing.

735
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:18,892
Rym: Well, you know what it feels like, like, actually playing it?

736
00:57:19,316 --> 00:58:02,509
Rym: A lot like the early days of natural selection, in that the game was changing, not in terms of, like, the engagement and the style, but early NS was really rough around the edges, and they kept making changes to that game, like, just constant evolution and changes, and this game feels like it's in that state where it'll keep getting updates, they'll keep refining it, and the people who are playing it will, like, how they engage with the game is gonna drive how it evolves, so it's got a small enough player base to where you'll be able to sort of follow this game and grow, so if you like it, I bet by this time next year, it'll still be around, it might not be a runaway hit, but if it survives and it's still around, I'll bet it'll evolve significantly and just be way better.

737
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,820
Scott: Well, now I just want to play natural selection again, so...

738
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:10,490
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I was trying to avoid that thought, but that thought came in as soon as I said those words.

739
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,300
Scott: Well, I'm installing it right now, we'll see if anyone's still playing it.

740
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:15,400
Rym: NS2, I assume, you don't want to go all the way back?

741
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,132
Scott: I don't know, I don't think anyone's playing that.

742
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:18,377
Rym: Yeah.

743
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:25,953
Rym: I mean, I do, I miss, but with a lowercase m, the old days were matches for like an hour long and I would just build a wall of OCs.

744
00:58:28,224 --> 00:58:34,258
Scott: If I could go back and play that game as it was right now, I would enjoy playing that game right now.

745
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:39,569
Rym: Building a wall of OCs and just hiding behind them, jumping around was fun, but also stupid.

746
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:44,055
Scott: I'm in the mood to play NS1 right now if it was a full batch of players and whatnot.

747
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,145
Rym: God dammit, I am too.

748
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:46,519
Rym: I feel like we're only gonna be able to.

749
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,406
Rym: I feel like playing Quake 1 is the closest to that nostalgic experience we can get right now.

750
00:58:51,427 --> 00:59:02,560
Scott: But also, even if I were to play you know, NS2 right now, and there were players, they're probably just all gonna come and fade and chop my head off instantly and I'm gonna be useless.

751
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,133
Rym: Yeah, we gotta play with our people so we can all be bad together.

752
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:06,760
Scott: We don't have enough people.

753
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:07,424
Rym: I know.

754
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:08,031
Rym: We don't have enough people.

755
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,860
Rym: The eternal conundrum.

756
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:12,071
Rym: If you want to play Splitgate with us, just hang out in the Discord.

757
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:15,107
Rym: I'll totally play it with you because I enjoy it.

758
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,832
Rym: I feel like I'll play it once or twice a week.

759
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,957
Scott: You know, I'm not like, this isn't a game that I'm actively playing.

760
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:24,055
Scott: I'm not sitting down and being like, "Oh, time to play

761
00:59:24,096 --> 00:59:24,499
Scott: Splitgate.".

762
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,633
Scott: But it's a game where some friends are like, "Hey, let's play

763
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:27,916
Scott: Splitgate."

764
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:29,289
Scott: And I'm like, "Okay, I'll play

765
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:29,390
Scott: it.".

766
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,228
Rym: Like Overwatch, I play every day.

767
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:32,520
Rym: I sit down like, "It's Overwatch

768
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:32,884
Rym: time.".

769
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:37,007
Rym: I'm not doing that with Splitgate, but me and the Scots will play this when we feel it.

770
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:41,700
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I would ever play Splitgate on my own on purpose.

771
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:42,887
Rym: Nah.

772
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:50,691
Rym: But I would like to play not just with people I know on the same team, but against a team that is also people I know.

773
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:54,840
Rym: Because that is the purest, most fun in all FPSs, in my opinion.

774
00:59:56,281 --> 01:00:04,911
Rym: I just think back to those lands with Quake 1 at a Magfest where everyone is in the land, so all the opponents are in the same physical room as you.

775
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:05,779
Rym: That's good biz.

776
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,291
Rym: But yeah, Splitgate.

777
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:07,779
Rym: Super fun.

778
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,688
Rym: It's worth playing.

779
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,254
Rym: It'll cost you nothing but your time to try this thing out.

780
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,053
Rym: It even runs on consoles, guys.

781
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,790
Rym: Like, you can just play it.

782
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,460
Scott: The end.

783
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,090
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

784
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:26,419
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

785
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:31,630
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

786
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,601
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

787
01:00:34,743 --> 01:00:39,269
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

788
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:42,842
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

789
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,150
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

790
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:50,270
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

791
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:58,483
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Egee, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, a bunch of people who don't really want me to say

792
01:00:58,523 --> 01:00:58,969
Scott: their names,

793
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:15,549
Rym: Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Shaiai85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell, Taylor Braun, TheIronFront, YouHoldTheKeyToMyHeart, and a whole bunch of people who actually, for real, do not want me to say their names.

794
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:22,869
Rym: And now, tonight, I leave you simply with... Okay, we're gonna open it up with a little improv.

795
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,770
Scott: Somebody shout out a location.

796
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,756
Rym: This castle.

797
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,097
Scott: Okay, how about an occupation?

798
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,430
Rym: Usurper of the throne.

799
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:32,217
Rym: I think I heard usurper of the throne.

800
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:34,031
Rym: Now finally I need an object.

801
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:34,572
Scott: Here.

802
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:47,154
Scott: Wait a minute.

803
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:48,650
Rym: I didn't use that much poison.
