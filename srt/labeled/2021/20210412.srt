1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,671
Rym:  It's Monday, April 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:12,167
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,530
Scott:  I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,710
Rym:  And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,530
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about laptops and tablets.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,209
Scott:  Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:32,140
Scott:  All right, so since I'm working at home, I got this desk layout that I've been, you know, pretty okay with for the whole time where I got my left monitor.

8
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,800
Scott: I got my right monitor.

9
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,220
Scott: They're both on my desktop, right?

10
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:36,499
Scott: But you know, they're Dell ultra sharps.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,680
Scott: They got all kinds of connectors.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,012
Scott:  Yeah.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Scott:  You can do picture in picture.

14
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:40,399
Scott: You can do all sorts of nonsense.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:50,040
Scott: So what I do is I got my work laptop over here on the right, and then I have an HDMI cable from that into the right-hand monitor.

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,319
Scott: So the right-hand monitor is getting a display port from the desktop and an HDMI from the work laptop so I can switch it.

17
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:08,160
Scott: So if it's during work days, you know, I'll have one monitor for personal on the left and two for work on the right, and then I'll just switch it back to two personal when work is done, right, and close the work laptop.

18
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:14,380
Scott: So the problem is obviously the work laptop, they didn't buy me that Microsoft Surface I wanted.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,335
Scott: So it has a keyboard and a track pad that take up a bunch of desk space.

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,075
Rym:  Ah.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,540
Scott:  But I don't want to use that keyboard and track pad.

22
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,500
Scott: I want to use my real mouse and keyboard no matter what.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,040
Scott: So there's this cool thing called Mouse Without Borders.

24
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,340
Scott: It's a Microsoft product.

25
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:29,816
Scott: It's free.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,019
Scott:  That's a good name.

27
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:33,140
Rym: That's a good name.

28
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:48,860
Scott: If you have all Windows computers, obviously not if you have any Macs or Linux computers, but all Windows computers, and you don't want to do a KVM thing, right, basically you can connect as many computers as you want with Mouse Without Borders.

29
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:55,900
Scott: Obviously these computers would be very chill with each other 'cause they're basically giving administrator access to each other, right?

30
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,740
Scott: So do it in a closed, secure place, right?

31
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:14,840
Scott: And what happens is basically one computer has the mouse and keyboard, and what you tell it, yeah, when I move the mouse to the edge of the window, right, to the edge of the screen, it just moves right onto the other screen of the other computer, and it's like they were the same computer.

32
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:24,138
Scott: And then the keyboard will send its key presses too, whichever computer the mouse is currently going to, right?

33
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:33,580
Scott: So it's pretty good 'cause I can just use this one mouse and keyboard, control two computers as if they were one computer with three screens, do my work, do my personal stuff.

34
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:35,100
Scott: It's very convenient, it works great.

35
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:37,388
Scott: It's not 100% perfect, but it is 99% perfect.

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:48,599
Rym:  The solution I used back when I lived in a house when we were in Beacon was I just had two sets of keyboards and mice that were both great on a gigantic desk.

37
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,620
Scott:  Yeah, but I don't wanna move, you know, even though my desk, anyway.

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Rym:  Well, I had the gigantic L, the L desk, the luxury that you don't wanna have in a New York City apartment.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,198
Scott:  And plus you can copy and paste from one to the other, you can do all kinds, all kinds, you can, you know, you can't drag a window, but you can.

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,579
Rym:  I think the problem is I would just try to drag windows all the time.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,058
Rym: I think that would happen.

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,200
Scott:  I haven't had that problem.

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,659
Scott: So anyway, obviously the way this works is over the network, right?

44
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,160
Scott: Obvious.

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,040
Scott: So, you know, being on a LAN here, it's not a problem.

46
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,060
Scott: It's super speedy.

47
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,940
Scott: If you tried to do this over a not LAN, it might be an issue.

48
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:28,999
Scott: The work laptop is on wifi, the desktop is plugged in with an ethernet cable to the router.

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,380
Rym:  Oh, direct to the router.

50
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:33,439
Rym: I got nothing plugged directly into my router except two switches.

51
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:37,420
Scott:  No, I'm using up all the ports on the router, all four.

52
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,030
Scott:  I've always,

53
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:56,240
Rym: it's not a thing now, like this is just me being old and also already having switches, but in the old days, routers, you usually would get better performance on your network if you only, if you connected all your devices to a switch and connected that to a router, because routers had a lot of weird problems and multiplexing issues in ancient times.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,740
Scott:  The router just has a switch in it, - That is not a thing anymore.

55
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:01,060
Rym: You can just plug everything into a router.

56
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,699
Rym: You only need a switch if you have a big network.

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:12,600
Scott:  Right, so what I've noticed, right, and this is how I know I'm not losing my hearing as much as I think I might be 'cause I'm old.

58
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,548
Scott: I obviously lost some.

59
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:24,076
Scott: 'cause I'm old, right, but haven't lost that much because out of my, well, I noticed when I moved the mouse over, 'cause the mouse is directly connected to my desktop, right, my personal one.

60
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:42,077
Scott: When the mouse goes over to the work computer, I can hear in my left ear this high-pitched noise like dee dee dee dee dee dee, kind of like sort of-ish, right, almost like a scratching, like a high-pitched scratching, like almost like there's a modem in the other room making a phone call, something like that, right?

61
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:48,760
Scott: And I hear the noise when I move the mouse on the other screen.

62
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:56,120
Scott: If I don't move the mouse, there's no noise, but like if I move the mouse, I can hear it go pfft like as I'm moving it and it stops immediately.

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Scott:  And I have confirmed with people that Mouse Without Borders, absolutely, when you move it, when you move the mouse on a non-local computer, when you move the mouse cursor, it basically sends a huge burst of very small packets.

64
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,259
Scott: So it's almost definitely, right, the noise is coming from the router, it's just to the left of me, right?

65
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:27,500
Scott: So this burst of like a many, many, many tiny packets going from my desktop to the laptop is making this noise.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,260
Scott: Clearly, there is no other explanation.

67
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,300
Rym:  But is the noise coming from the router?

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,300
Scott:  Yes, it's coming from the router.

69
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,105
Scott:  'Cause when

70
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:56,420
Rym: I had that happen, I had a very similar thing happen, like spookily, but it was on a laptop, it was actually on my old Fujitsu Lifebook, but what would happen was if the room was really quiet and I moved the mouse using the trackpad, I could hear a very tiny electrical noise that came out of the speakers that coincided with every pixel the mouse moved.

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,697
Scott:  This isn't that.

72
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:03,240
Scott: So I'm pretty sure, right now, if I'm wrong, I might be about to waste some money.

73
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,060
Rym:  I mean, you could solve this, just do a PCAP and like see what's going on.

74
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,559
Rym: Are there retransmissions or something?

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,800
Scott:  Well, no, no, it's working as function.

76
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:18,119
Scott: Mouse Without Borders, when you move the mouse on a non-remote computer, especially a high DPI mouse, it sends lots and lots of small packets quickly.

77
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:27,800
Scott: And it doesn't matter if they're being lost or retried or whatever, there's a lot of them, it's supposed to be sending a lot of them, so you have good mouse resolution.

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,500
Rym:  Yup, 'cause to your point, that whole product would be literally worthless if there was any amount of perceptible lag in the mouse.

79
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,898
Scott:  Yeah, it feels like you're using the mouse locally, right, you have no idea.

80
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,720
Rym:  Now I have flashbacks to when you could put like old Quake games in LAN mode, where you would assume you were on a fast network and just send a lot more telemetry.

81
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Scott:  The point is, if I just send a lot of packets to the router and a lot of tiny, really tiny ones to the router, it makes a noise, right?

82
00:06:53,081 --> 00:07:02,292
Scott: So the question is, is the noise coming from, in the router hardware, right, 'cause it has no moving parts, is it coming from just--.

83
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
Rym:  The burst of Wi-Fi is what I would guess.

84
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,418
Scott:  Ethernet cable side or the Wi-Fi side?

85
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,000
Scott: And my guess, what you said, is my same guess, I feel it's coming from the radio side, right?

86
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:21,899
Scott: So my thinking, 'cause like I said, my router is all full up of cables, there's all four holes are filled, I gotta get a switch to add more holes.

87
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:41,173
Scott: If I get a switch and plug the laptop into that switch, instead of using Wi-Fi on the laptop, that should be, I guess, maybe improve network performance a tiny bit, not noticeable for anything I do on the work laptop, but maybe make the noise go away, which

88
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:41,877
Rym: would be nice.

89
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,556
Rym:  I like having a fully switched wired network in the house anyway, just for things like, especially if I have devices hitting the NAS.

90
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,639
Scott:  A fully switched wired network in the house.

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,879
Rym:  Except you're also connecting some things by Wi-Fi.

92
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,080
Rym: Only phones get Wi-Fi.

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,120
Scott:  Yeah, they're far away, or they're phones.

94
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,080
Rym:  Or actually, other than our phones and tablets, the only thing that's on the Wi-Fi normally is the printer.

95
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,519
Rym: That way I can just put it in a different room and not worry about it.

96
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:10,780
Scott: I wasn't gonna run a cable to-- - My printer, it connects with a USB cable to the NAS.

97
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,457
Rym:  Ah, I got a fancy office color laser printer.

98
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:22,119
Rym: Which is now too big to fit in the spot and I used to be putting it in when I rearranged the room, so it's in a temporary home.

99
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:26,740
Rym: It's a printer that's really big on a table that's too small for it and it's really funny looking.

100
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Scott:  Yeah, I just think about getting a switch, maybe it will, even though I only need one more hole, that's really annoying.

101
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,520
Scott: I gotta get like a five port switch to add one more hole.

102
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,600
Scott:  I mean, at that point-- - And only two things will be plugged into the switch.

103
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,778
Rym:  At that point, I don't know, get a 16 port just in case, like the incremental cost is basically zero.

104
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,479
Scott:  There's nowhere to put that, there's nowhere to put that.

105
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,479
Rym:  What, I just gotta mount it on my desk?

106
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:48,698
Scott: Not putting that on my desk.

107
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,120
Scott: (laughing) Yeah, but you know, hopefully that will make the noise go away.

108
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,600
Scott: Of course, it's such a minor noise, like it only bothers me, I don't know if anyone else could even hear it.

109
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,479
Rym:  I mean, one thing I know is that I'm still the kind of person, though I haven't tested this a lot lately, 'cause COVID, like I don't go anywhere.

110
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:13,079
Rym: If someone somehow has a CRT and turns it on, anywhere within like a hundred yards of me, I'm just like, there it is, over there, someone turned on a TV.

111
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:21,979
Scott:  I got rid of the CRT from my Apple II GS, and I got a video card, basically, an HDMI output card that goes in there.

112
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,248
Scott:  Oh.

113
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Scott:  You know, less authentic, but-- - Way more convenient.

114
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,719
Scott:  Yeah, it takes up a lot less room.

115
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:40,680
Rym:  I was randomly, I was curating some old photos and looking for stuff, and I found a photo of my desk from like Beacon, and even that late, I had still a gigantic CRT on that desk.

116
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:44,240
Rym: You can see the desk like bowing down in the middle of the week.

117
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,180
Scott:  When we moved to Beacon in '05, we bought a TV, and it was not an LCD TV.

118
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,500
Rym:  Well, I got some fun things.

119
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,520
Rym: I pulled up the dates, prices, and specs of every laptop I've ever owned for part of the show.

120
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:04,360
Rym: It's, I feel really old today, looking at those specs, 'cause I remember how excited I was for that Fujitsu Lifebook.

121
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,440
Scott:  Yeah, it was good.

122
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,059
Scott:  It was good.

123
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:08,940
Rym: I bought it 'cause you had the previous version.

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,040
Rym: that was great, and Steve, our friend Steve, had a Fujitsu.

125
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,779
Scott:  The one you bought was less great.

126
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,220
Rym:  It was less great because you couldn't replace the optical drive with just extra battery like you could.

127
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,820
Scott:  Yeah, you didn't have the special tiny one.

128
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,800
Rym:  Yeah, 'cause I didn't need the optical drive most of the time.

129
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,460
Rym: You know what I needed?

130
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:28,140
Rym: More battery.

131
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,319
Scott:  Yep.

132
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,020
Rym:  Anyway, so in the news, it's sad to say, this happens a lot.

133
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,960
Rym: The news is that it's happening again, and it's happening relatively quickly, but capitalism destroys data.

134
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,659
Rym: That is a problem that has not been dealt with yet.

135
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:55,320
Rym: And archive.org, and there's a lot of places that really try to protect this data, but the liberty of Alexandria is about to be burned down.

136
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,398
Rym: Yahoo Answers is being destroyed forever on May 4th, which is not that long from now.

137
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,917
Scott:  Yeah, even a platform that is not great, not-- - Humans made data.

138
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,820
Rym: They made complexity.

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,738
Rym: That data is a non-zero value, and the incremental cost of storing it for the future is basically zero.

140
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:23,219
Scott:  Yep, but keeping the service online, maintaining it in the future, right?

141
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:27,000
Scott: It means you had to defend, you had to provide for security.

142
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,920
Scott: You had to provide power to keep the servers online.

143
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,999
Rym:  We had to do work to make the old GeekNights Forum continue to exist online, and even now it actually has the problems that someday we gotta fix.

144
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
Rym: Like, you can't search it easily.

145
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,120
Rym: The search just doesn't work.

146
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
Rym: There's errors if you try to use the search.

147
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,899
Scott:  Oh, great.

148
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,439
Rym:  It's been that way for like five years, so don't sweat it too much.

149
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,877
Scott:  The point is, keeping stuff online is work.

150
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:54,979
Scott: It costs money.

151
00:11:55,402 --> 00:12:00,519
Scott: If you're not making money from it and you're a capitalist enterprise, you just shut it down.

152
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,419
Scott: It's real easy.

153
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,820
Scott: Now you don't have to worry about it anymore.

154
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,739
Scott: It's the easiest thing, but you are now denying that to the rest of the world.

155
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:11,380
Scott: And yeah, you could just take like a backup of the data and release that, right?

156
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:13,740
Scott: Okay, whoever wants to back this up, here you go.

157
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,500
Scott: Here's our backups.

158
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:17,615
Scott: But that requires work, right?

159
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:28,699
Scott: That you're not gonna make any profit from doing that work, of cleaning up the data, removing data that you shouldn't be sending out there, privacy, security, et cetera, right?

160
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:29,852
Scott:  Yup.

161
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Scott:  Who knows what's in there.

162
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,460
Rym:  In particular, it's another way, we say this a lot on GeekNights.

163
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Rym: I even say that we say this a lot on GeekNights a lot, but there used to be more websites.

164
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:52,800
Rym: Yahoo Answers was one of those websites in that it wasn't quite a forum, but it also wasn't one of the modern Web 2.0 or post-Web 2.0 internet experiences.

165
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:57,440
Rym: It was its own thing, and there really wasn't anything else like it.

166
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,432
Rym: This was 16 years ago.

167
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,258
Rym: they made this thing.

168
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:06,880
Scott:  And now you got things like stupid Quora and- - Yup, and they all serve different purposes.

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Scott:  Stack Overflow.

170
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:12,940
Rym:  But something was lost when the internet, by and large, rejected forums.

171
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:17,400
Rym: And I don't know if we'll ever see like what forums will come back.

172
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,060
Rym: I think we'll see forums and echoes.

173
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:20,600
Rym: Anyway, that's a broader topic.

174
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:30,799
Rym: Yahoo Answers, on one hand, I've noticed a lot of people were making a point that Yahoo Answers was always terrible and pretty much universally gave bad advice.

175
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,368
Rym:  Yes.

176
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Scott:  Like Yahoo Answers was- - It doesn't matter what the, even if the content, right, is horrible, shitty content, right?

177
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,519
Scott: Like the worst possible content.

178
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,952
Scott: That doesn't mean it needs to be broadcast around the world, right?

179
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,859
Rym:  But don't just destroy it like tears in the rain.

180
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:00,879
Scott:  Any work that humans have made, no matter how awful, is just worthy of mere preservation, right?

181
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,080
Scott: And archival, that's all by a minimum, right?

182
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,680
Scott: It might not be worthy of anything fucking else, right?

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,220
Scott: So for example, like, you know, some, what's the worst thing?

184
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,020
Scott: A Nazi newspaper, right?

185
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,180
Scott: Worthy of archival and nothing else, right?

186
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,079
Scott: Put it in some sort of vault.

187
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,479
Scott:  So you can research it.

188
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,560
Scott:  If someone needs to research or reference the Nazi newspaper, we fucking have it, right?

189
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,480
Scott: Should you be printing more copies of it?

190
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,257
Scott: Fuck no.

191
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,920
Scott: Should you be advertising it?

192
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,049
Scott: Should you be like, no, right?

193
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,339
Scott: Tweeting out links to it?

194
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,010
Scott: No, right?

195
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,780
Scott: But we should have it, right?

196
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,294
Scott: Somewhere, you know, the same way we have vaults for like seeds and DNA, right?

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Scott: And say, you know, have the fucking Yahoo Answers in a vault.

198
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,899
Scott: It's better than Nazi newspaper, so it's also worthy of archival.

199
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,885
Rym:  So shutting down Yahoo Answers actually brings up a more, like a moderately complex take on that beyond.

200
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,560
Rym: just should they save the data or not.

201
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,840
Rym: Like we agree we gotta save this data regardless.

202
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:14,740
Rym: So one thing that happens with services like that that are a little bit older is they tend to get overrun with right-wing conspiracy theories, anti-vaxx and like just evil nonsense.

203
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,960
Scott:  Yes, 'cause when you have something old but it's still active and that's why we put our old forum into our, you know, read-only.

204
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,720
Rym:  Yeah, I'm not gonna moderate that old forum.

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,920
Rym: And if we didn't moderate it and you could post, Nazi shit would start appearing.

206
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:36,396
Scott:  When you have an active, like lively community space online, there's not only people putting out content, but there's people watching it, right?

207
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,279
Scott: But if you have an old space, like an untended garden, weeds will grow.

208
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,040
Scott: And you know, if you're not gonna tend the garden, you need to freeze the garden.

209
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,500
Rym:  'Cause otherwise the garden is gonna break out of its boundaries and hurt some people.

210
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:58,560
Scott:  Right, so Yahoo Answers was a case like many others where it was an untended garden that was not frozen and thus filled with many weeds.

211
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,690
Scott: If you did make a backup of it today, somehow, you would find a lot of garbage that, you know, if it had been--.

212
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:10,740
Rym:  I feel like everything posted to Yahoo Answers since 2015 is probably suspect.

213
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:18,420
Scott:  Yeah, if you had frozen it at the right time, then it would have been a more valuable archive, right?

214
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,600
Scott: Or, you know, source of, you know, whatever, right?

215
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,680
Scott: But now it is tainted.

216
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,939
Scott: Like if you have just have an email box and you turn off your spam filter and you wait a year, it's like, well, yeah, you can back up your email now, but now it's a lot shittier backup 'cause it's full of all these spams.

217
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,120
Scott: I guess it's still, you know, worthy of backup.

218
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,739
Scott: Some human made those spams.

219
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,118
Scott: They're worthy of archival.

220
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:47,018
Rym:  But the other fascinating thing about Yahoo Answers is a lot of you are probably too young to have ever actually looked at it or used it.

221
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,660
Rym: And even the memes around it have largely disappeared and are things old people reference.

222
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,144
Scott:  It's pretty much.

223
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:52,540
Scott: how is bad be formed is the one.

224
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Rym:  Yep, or how does woman get pregnant?

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,059
Scott:  Yeah, those are the two.

226
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:06,519
Rym:  There's a great compilation, I'll even link to it, where someone compiled just hundreds of all the ways people very poorly asked how they could get pregnant and how pregnancy worked.

227
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:20,180
Rym: It is the thing that always fascinated me about Yahoo Answers, because even when it was live and a part of the social fabric, I definitely always looked down on it and it always made me cynical about humanity.

228
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,220
Rym: But I'm less cynical about it now because this is the spectrum of humanity.

229
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:41,779
Rym: But people would, instead of just typing something into Google or even Yahoo and seeing answers, would ask questions in Yahoo Answers that should have been answered by their parents, society, or typing what they just typed into Google or Yahoo.

230
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:43,233
Scott: And yet instead--.

231
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:52,380
Scott:  How much of Reddit, at least half of Reddit, is people asking a question that is answered by a Google search or another post in that exact same Reddit where they just asked the question.

232
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,459
Rym:  Now I saw someone pushing back against his narrative.

233
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:05,740
Scott:  Only Stack Overflow and associated sites solve this in a way where if you are typing in a question, if there are similar questions, it brings them up.

234
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,479
Scott: The question box is a search box.

235
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:16,340
Scott: And if you insist on posting your question again, even though it has been posted, people swiftly come and delete it and tell you it's been answered elsewhere.

236
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,080
Rym:  But I saw a pushback on this.

237
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:23,640
Scott:  It hurts community and makes people feel bad and whatnot.

238
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,759
Scott: It doesn't help them, right?

239
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,431
Scott: But there's a reason.

240
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:27,279
Scott: people are doing that.

241
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,860
Scott: They wanna talk to someone.

242
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,940
Scott: They don't care if they could get the information.

243
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,420
Rym:  Well, because in one case with a place like that, what are you making?

244
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,720
Rym: 'Cause a community could be a social thing or a community could be a means to answering questions specifically.

245
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,515
Scott:  Right, when someone just wants the information, they're not going to ask.

246
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Scott: People who are asking are asking not just because they want the information, but because they just want to talk to somebody, right?

247
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,120
Scott: There is an additional thing there, right?

248
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,140
Scott: And that's saying, "Let me Google that for you," only gives them half of what they're looking for.

249
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:04,298
Scott: They're looking for some sort of human contact, right?

250
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,718
Scott: Without saying so.

251
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,858
Rym:  Well, the other thing I've seen-.

252
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,915
Scott:  And so using the Stack Overflow solution, right?

253
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:20,120
Scott: It helps make a better website with better answers for other people who are just looking for information, but it doesn't help your community.

254
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,857
Scott: It pushes a lot of people away because they're trying to connect with other humans and you're saying, "No, stop doing

255
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:26,058
Scott: that.".

256
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,107
Scott:  But it's fascinating.

257
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:28,260
Scott:  Only good information.

258
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:43,358
Rym:  'Cause there's a lot of things, especially on the internet, that aren't intended to help humans connect to humans so much as to serve some other task, but people are lonely and desperate and end up seeking humanity even in those places where they don't really accommodate that in any meaningful way.

259
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,320
Scott:  Meanwhile, Facebook would be the opposite, which is we just, that's even what Facebook will say.

260
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,959
Scott: is we wanna connect people, right?

261
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:53,500
Scott: They just want to help people connect to people.

262
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,060
Scott: They don't care about the information or what people are saying to each other at all.

263
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Rym:  And that doesn't work either.

264
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,060
Rym: 'cause if you let people, if people are just talking to each other.

265
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:10,160
Scott:  People who are just desperate or want to seek some sort of human connection, Facebook is like, "Here, all the human connection you want, "you feel like you're with other people, togetherness, right?

266
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,060
Scott: "I don't care what the hell you're saying to each other.

267
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,740
Scott: "I don't care what information you're spreading.

268
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,000
Scott: "I'm just gonna give you that feeling of being together.

269
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,840
Scott: "and connecting with the rest of humanity.

270
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:21,238
Scott: "through the computer as best we can, "and I don't give a shit about anything

271
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:21,420
Scott: else.".

272
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,259
Rym:  And I'm about to mix my metaphors, but the monkey's paw curls, and oh no, I got exactly what I asked for.

273
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:37,075
Rym: But when I would, like, the guy who answers was just, the questions people would ask, like that, "How has Babbie

274
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:37,400
Rym: formed?"

275
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:41,299
Rym: was actually indicative of how a huge percentage of the site was used.

276
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,160
Scott: But I saw people- - How much of that was not in good faith, right?

277
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,956
Scott: Someone just being funny and typing in, "How has Babbie

278
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:47,199
Scott: formed?".

279
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:54,680
Rym:  Yeah, but there is a huge, I found a bunch of different archives of people looking at particular types of questions on Yahoo Answers.

280
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,990
Scott:  And how many of his people?

281
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:59,575
Scott: English as a second language, so their question comes off silly when they're trying to, you know.

282
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,265
Scott:  Yeah.

283
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:00,999
Scott:  There's a lot of that.

284
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,735
Rym:  There is that.

285
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:15,339
Rym: But I saw a pushback against that whole, let me Google it for you, a separate way around the idea that if someone's asking ostensibly, they could have already Googled, but they're looking for, like, some insight or something beyond that.

286
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,960
Rym: Like, they're looking for insight into, which of these video switchers should I- - They're just bad at asking questions?

287
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,720
Rym:  Yeah, but in my experience, that's usually not true.

288
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:27,197
Rym: They usually just want someone to tell them, "Buy this

289
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:27,379
Rym: one."

290
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:37,340
Rym: Like, they're not, like, well, even worse, the people who tend to answer people who ask questions like that tend to Google and give whatever answers come up high on Google.

291
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:45,460
Rym: So the people get the same experience they would have gotten Googling, except someone else paraphrases it and often introduces a mistake.

292
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,940
Scott:  I guess it does help them avoid reading, right?

293
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,820
Scott: If I Google for, like, best, you know, headphones, headphones have gotta be the worst one for this, right?

294
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,679
Scott: You're gonna find just so much information about best headphone, right?

295
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,120
Scott: There's even, like, tools to help you pick out headphones that ask you all sorts of questions, right?

296
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,954
Scott: You're basically, when you say, "Hey, what headphones should I

297
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:04,198
Scott: buy?"

298
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:11,839
Scott: Someone else is doing the research for you and just giving you the answer immediately, whereas Googling it will require some reading, right?

299
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,959
Rym:  Yep, you have to click on a website, make sure it's not a shady website, maybe click on a different website, see if it says the same thing, like.

300
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,860
Scott:  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

301
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:30,139
Scott: So you're basically trying to, there is an element there of asking a question to offload labor, if you think that learning and reading are labor, which a lot of people seem to.

302
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,720
Rym:  So, some other news, LG is not gonna make phones anymore.

303
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,179
Scott:  Yeah, I don't know, did I, I can't remember, was one of my flip phones LG?

304
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,380
Scott: I think it was a Samsung.

305
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,680
Rym:  I've never owned, did I, no, I don't think I've ever owned an LG phone.

306
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
Scott:  Yeah, I don't know if I did.

307
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,119
Rym:  LG is deep on my shit list for the ads in their TVs anyway, so.

308
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,800
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, this LG monitor is good, but I don't know if I'll buy any other LG things, right?

309
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,280
Rym:  Yeah, but it seems like they're just-- - I've never bought a lot of LG things in the past.

310
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,938
Scott: I guess I might buy some LG kitchen appliances, but when am I gonna buy kitchen appliances?

311
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,240
Rym:  Yeah, I own every kitchen appliance I could possibly need.

312
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,380
Scott:  Yeah, I don't even know if they make the best ones or not.

313
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:17,120
Rym:  I can't ever say that LG stood out as making particularly good phones, like at any point.

314
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,036
Scott:  No, LG was sort of, the way I see it is, they were in the flip phone days, right?

315
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,360
Scott: They were sort of making these good, but sort of second best, right?

316
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,639
Rym:  Yeah, like they weren't the Razr.

317
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,538
Rym: They were like, "Well, I can't afford a Razr, "but the LG is better than the

318
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:31,700
Rym: bottom.".

319
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,879
Scott:  Oh no, some of their phones would be more expensive, right?

320
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:43,319
Scott: But it was sort of like, it wasn't the premier phone, it was like another company that also made good phones, but not as good as the best ones, but someone bought them, right?

321
00:23:44,082 --> 00:24:03,560
Scott: And I think what happened was, in the transition to the smartphone era, it's very easy to see this in hindsight, is that the Apple, in bringing out the iPhone, not only changed phones, but they changed the skillset that was required to make a phone, right?

322
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,820
Scott: The people making phones before, were people who were companies that were good at making radios, right?

323
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,580
Scott: 'Cause that was the important part of the phone.

324
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:17,839
Scott: And then Apple was basically like, "No, if you wanna make a good phone, "you have to make good software," right?

325
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:22,940
Scott: And suddenly, all these companies that were good at making radios, were like, "Oh fuck, we can't make one of those.

326
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,373
Scott: "We're not good at making what that is," right?

327
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,211
Rym:  Yeah.

328
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,340
Scott:  It's like, Apple's good at making what that thing is, but that thing replaces our thing, but we don't know how to make that thing.

329
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:42,460
Rym:  Well, LG also, it was interesting, 'cause later, like around 2016s, they went after a market that probably doesn't exist.

330
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
Rym: Remember they made that modular phone?

331
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,295
Scott:  No.

332
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:47,575
Rym:  Oh, the modular G5?

333
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,459
Rym: It was like a modular phone.

334
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:54,079
Rym: And yeah, the fact that you don't remember it, yeah, it fucking failed so hard.

335
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:59,058
Rym: I had to look it up to make sure I was thinking of the right thing, 'cause this article talks about it.

336
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,940
Scott:  Yeah, all these other companies that were in the phone biz in the flip days, right?

337
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,959
Scott: Tried to transfer over to, Apple basically said, "Hey, this is what a phone is

338
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:08,120
Scott: now.".

339
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:17,518
Scott: They tried to transfer over, and basically, all the non-Apple ones were bad at software, and that's why they all, even Microsoft, right, was bad at phone software.

340
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,020
Rym:  2016, LG's modular G5 is the most daring flagship phone ever.

341
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,880
Rym: Here comes the era of the modular customizable smartphone.

342
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,720
Scott:  Right, the WebOS, they were good at software.

343
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:32,000
Scott: They failed for other reasons.

344
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,879
Scott:  They had the best software.

345
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,860
Rym: In the early days of smartphones, WebOS was like, it was way better.

346
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,320
Scott:  It's still being used in some smart TVs, funnily enough.

347
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:49,820
Scott:  You know, Android, it's not as good as iOS, but it was good enough to actually, it was way better than all those other phone softwares.

348
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:57,719
Rym:  And there was a time when I would say Android, there was a brief era where Android had outpaced the user experience of iPhones, but then iPhones just leapfrogged them again.

349
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:10,179
Scott:  But the point is is that Android provided the opportunity for all the phone people who could make a hardware phone who couldn't make software to just have that taken care of for them, right?

350
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:19,496
Scott: So an LG who isn't good at making software could make a phone and slap Android on it and maybe make a couple apps or something and customize it a little bit and be good to go, right?

351
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:24,060
Scott: LG would never be capable of making an Android OS ever.

352
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:32,080
Scott: But it's proven over time that like, look, Samsung and Google make the Android phone.

353
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,319
Scott: Maybe there's some other players too.

354
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,015
Scott: You get your Huawei's and your whatnot.

355
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,540
Rym:  Sony makes actually very good Android phones.

356
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:42,900
Scott:  But it's a tough world.

357
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:45,900
Scott: All these phones have the same software, right?

358
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,240
Scott: Lenovo makes phones, I think.

359
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,420
Rym:  And I think I do get the impression people who don't buy iPhones increasingly don't care that much which phone they get.

360
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,740
Rym: They get whatever one has a promotion.

361
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,399
Scott:  Yeah, who knows?

362
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,560
Rym:  LG apparently still had 10% of the market when they were deciding to shut this down though.

363
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:07,079
Scott: But if you don't have a larger percentage than that of the phone market, is it even worth it?

364
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:15,919
Rym:  Yeah, especially if your phones are mostly just bought by people who go to like a T-Mobile store and they point out, oh, that's the phone that you can get cheap if you get a plan.

365
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:26,039
Scott:  Right, and you also have to remember when you are LG making a phone, your money, your margins start and stop when that is on the hardware, that's it.

366
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,219
Scott: You sell your phone and that's it.

367
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:35,037
Scott: Apple sells a phone and then they get your iCloud money and they get your App Store money and they get your iTunes, right?

368
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:37,380
Scott: They have got you now, right?

369
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,740
Scott: They are making big money when they sell an iPhone, right?

370
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,756
Scott: They could sell an iPhone at a loss and be like, whoo!

371
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:43,278
Scott: Hooray, we sold an iPhone.

372
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,679
Scott: That guy is, whoever that is is gonna pay us a lot, right?

373
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,259
Scott: If you're Samsung, they make a little bit, phone carriers, they got their own thing going on.

374
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:54,919
Scott: Google, they got their Play Store money coming in when they sell a Pixel phone.

375
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:57,239
Scott: They're doing similar to Apple Biz.

376
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:02,441
Rym: Sony has a whole ecosystem of Sony phones have spent, like.

377
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:21,736
Rym: they're actually like 99% straight Android, except it is a Sony Android where they add a few Sony specific things that work with other Sony hardware, but it's very boutique and it's like, I don't use it, but no one needs that because all the smart devices will work with pretty much any phone with an app anyway,

378
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:22,239
Scott: so.

379
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:30,119
Scott:  Point is 10% of the phone market combined with not making any money other than the margins on the hardware is not enough to stay in business.

380
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Scott:  I think-- - Especially if they're in a downward trend, right?

381
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,153
Scott: It's like, are you at 10% and rising?

382
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,880
Scott: Oh, then keep at it, right?

383
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,008
Rym: But if you're down to 10%-- - So in 2020, they recorded an operational loss of $750 million a year in their smartphone division.

384
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,671
Scott:  Right, probably 'cause to also, to get ahead, right?

385
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,180
Scott: You had to probably take shittier margins on your phones.

386
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,277
Rym:  But also that was 2020, the year where no one needed to upgrade their smartphone unless there's broke.

387
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,900
Rym: It's not like I'm going anywhere.

388
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,495
Rym: This phone's getting--.

389
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,940
Scott:  What is the value add that LG adds to the phone that no one else has, right?

390
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,999
Scott: Well, they tried the modular thing, which didn't work as you just pointed out, right?

391
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:13,540
Scott: I think LG, it's like, well, they make displays that are really good.

392
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,020
Scott: That's a part that they make, right?

393
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,160
Scott: The chips, they're buying a lot of those chips from someone else, you know, how much money are they making on that?

394
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,792
Rym: They're better off selling things.

395
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,080
Rym:  I think middle of the road, generic, whatever.

396
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,719
Rym: Like they're the middle of the road, generic TV, middle of the road, generic cell phone.

397
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,259
Rym: This article actually points out something--.

398
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,600
Scott:  But they can sell parts to other people to put in their phones and make just fine monies.

399
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,259
Rym:  So I'll link to this Verge article that talks about the shutdown because it actually has an interesting tidbit.

400
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:51,359
Rym: This is from like, I'll paraphrase this 'cause it's short, but basically I'm not getting a lot of people saying, what will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?

401
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:56,340
Rym: I'm getting a lot of, ah, my first phone was an LG flip phone.

402
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,339
Rym: It was durable and reliable and I loved it.

403
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:10,540
Rym: Most of the chatter that journalists are seeing about LG exiting the business is about nostalgia for the old phones and almost nobody talking about any like recent smartphone that LG made.

404
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,153
Scott:  No, no one has one.

405
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,000
Scott:  Exactly.

406
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,100
Scott:  Only 10% of people have one.

407
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:32,538
Rym: But it seems like the hole they're leaving in the industry is the sub $300 hole, which I think is definitely people who buy the cheapest phone that comes with whatever cell phone contract or whatever their cell phone carrier gives them a deal on as part of the upgrade package they pay

408
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:32,680
Scott: for.

409
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,512
Scott:  You are in the sub $300 phone market.

410
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,039
Scott: You just wanna buy a cheap phone that works, that'll be just fine.

411
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,360
Scott: And you don't wanna spend a lot of money, right?

412
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,740
Scott: Go for used phone, old phone.

413
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,320
Rym:  Get a used phone with a refurbished battery.

414
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,520
Rym: Just make sure it has a refurb battery, that's all you need.

415
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,820
Scott:  My iPhone 7 that I just replaced, I could have not replaced it and been just fine.

416
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:59,119
Scott: If they hadn't come out with a small iPhone, I would still be using an iPhone 7 right now.

417
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,518
Scott:  Yup.

418
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,979
Scott:  And it would still be just fine.

419
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,180
Scott: iPhone 7 is way old already.

420
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,658
Scott: It's like four or five years old.

421
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,162
Scott: Yeah, five years old, I think for iPhone 7.

422
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:11,280
Scott: So at least, and it's just fine.

423
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,180
Scott: So if you got 300 bucks, I feel like you could definitely go out and get yourself an iPhone 8 or 9 or something.

424
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,440
Scott: I don't know what the prices are on these things.

425
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,339
Rym:  You'd be in pretty good shape, I think.

426
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,680
Scott:  And you could keep that thing going.

427
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,339
Scott: If you get a new one that's like still in the box, they're out there, they're not hard to find.

428
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:30,460
Scott: You can keep that shit going for quite a while, right?

429
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,199
Scott: You get like a Pixel 3a or whatever, that was just never sold when it was new.

430
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:36,955
Scott: You pick it up for cheap.

431
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,200
Scott: You can rock that thing for quite a while, right?

432
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,810
Scott: And clearly if you're only spending 300, you're accepting the fact that you're not getting the highest end.

433
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,900
Scott: amazing phone, but that's still a pretty great phone.

434
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,400
Scott: It's gonna be better than a brand new phone from some weirdo brand, right?

435
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,953
Scott: So Nvidia had a keynote today furthering my many year old, basically prediction slash.

436
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,571
Scott: I called it, whatever I told you.

437
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:02,936
Scott: so, right?

438
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,679
Rym:  We got announced for Thomas here.

439
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,400
Scott:  It was becoming, I mean, it was like obvious, right?

440
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,640
Scott: It was like, I was looking at green grass and I was saying, eh, grass is green.

441
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,739
Scott: I was looking at a tree with no leaves and I was saying in the spring that tree is gonna have leaves.

442
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,138
Rym:  He's a witch.

443
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:20,960
Scott: I bet you tomorrow these buds are gonna turn to leaves.

444
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,474
Scott: No, what?

445
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,675
Scott: Right?

446
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,798
Scott: So Nvidia had a keynote today and among their announcements, they announced like some, they got some chip they're making, it's gonna go in cars.

447
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,020
Scott: That's a big deal, right?

448
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:41,980
Scott: 'Cause you know, but all the big one is they announced this arm CPU they're making, that's gonna be going to targeting servers, right?

449
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:47,538
Scott: They want people to run servers in their data centers with Nvidia's arm CPUs in them.

450
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:51,496
Scott: And it's, you know, to further put pressure on the x86.

451
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,800
Scott: Basically, I'm just saying, I'm always talking about this.

452
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,140
Scott: I like, yeah, you're gonna have the all Nvidia computer.

453
00:32:58,301 --> 00:33:00,879
Scott: It's coming, look at what Apple's doing with the M1, right?

454
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,180
Scott: Nvidia is gonna be pushing that on the PC side, right?

455
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:20,920
Scott: They're just hitting, it's hard to hit the desktop without Microsoft, you know, getting Windows to run on ARM properly, which there is a Windows ARM, you know, it runs, it's getting better, but they'll just be like, okay, well, you know, Linux runs on this just fine.

456
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,620
Scott: We'll hit that data center, right?

457
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:30,520
Scott: You know, soon enough, you'll be seeing like an all Nvidia laptop or some shit that runs Linux for some nerds to buy, or who knows what.

458
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,340
Scott: This is gonna be, this is a thing, right?

459
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,980
Scott: Get ready for, you know, Intel has been taking a beating.

460
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,320
Scott: They're trying to push back a little bit.

461
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,859
Scott: You're seeing some, a little bit of life in the Intel, which is, you know, never died, right?

462
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:45,257
Rym: So don't know if Intel will die.

463
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:48,680
Scott: I don't know if Intel will die.

464
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:54,400
Scott: They're trying, they're showing some signs of life, trying to fight back against, you know, AMD and whatnot.

465
00:33:55,083 --> 00:34:01,820
Scott: X86 is showing, you know, not too many signs of life, but it's still going, but here Nvidia, here it is, right?

466
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,799
Scott: The pressure that it said was coming is now today announced even more pressure.

467
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:25,299
Rym:  Data center is real important too, because unlike like desktop and gaming, where there's a lot of different apps we'll use, you could sell chips that are not backward compatible at all because people who care about performance might be doing something novel enough to where they're just gonna write code that'll work natively on that chip.

468
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,498
Rym: Like they're not gonna-.

469
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,319
Scott:  Most things that run in a data center, run in a virtual machine of some kind or a container of some kind.

470
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:49,174
Scott: So you don't really give a shit what the actual CPU architecture is in the data center because you install like one layer of operating system on top of that, and then everything else, the actual applications people are running are not hitting that layer directly and they don't care, right?

471
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:51,739
Scott: It's gonna work, you know?

472
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:59,418
Scott: Or your data center could move your machine from an X86 Intel machine to an Nvidia R machine and you wouldn't know.

473
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:09,559
Rym:  Now the things that will hit, well, sometimes again, depending on the cases that will hit that hardware directly are things like big AI things, machine learning stuff, specialized stuff.

474
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,380
Scott:  They're coding that stuff from scratch every time.

475
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:14,320
Rym:  Yup, they're not gonna run the code from five years ago.

476
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:15,580
Rym: They're gonna write new code.

477
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,018
Scott:  They write the code knowing what the chips are gonna be, right?

478
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,577
Scott: So if Nvidia is like, "Hey, we're gonna have these chips for

479
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:21,719
Scott: you."

480
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,740
Scott: Someone will be like, "Oh, are those a better, "are those gonna give me more performance?

481
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:27,260
Scott: "for less money and less power?

482
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:28,734
Scott: "and make my data center better or

483
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:28,936
Scott: not?".

484
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:35,679
Scott: I'm building a data center, I'm buying what's best at the time and I'm getting my application, building it for what I'm gonna buy.

485
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:40,897
Scott: So you're not saying, "Oh, I have FX 86, "so I guess I better write it for

486
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:41,159
Scott: that.".

487
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,780
Scott: It's like, that's not how that works in that market.

488
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,960
Rym:  Yeah, that market is a market that a lot of people don't interact with directly and wouldn't see that.

489
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,540
Scott:  And then once you get your foothold in there, well, that's how you, you gotta branch out, right?

490
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:07,039
Rym:  I feel like in the long run, Intel might continue to compete on desktop, end user, retail type stuff, partly only because performance is not actually a concern for that market, except in rare gamer cases.

491
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,078
Scott:  Well, you know, there are other things though, battery life to compete on.

492
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Rym:  Yeah, mobile, mobile, we'll talk about that in a main bit because mobile is an interesting space because while that stuff all matters, people are increasingly just moving to like pure tablet, like already not X86, like that trend has already been happening.

493
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:35,339
Scott:  And you think performance is not a selling point, but then you see something like that M1 where it's just, it's like, yeah, performance isn't a selling point until it's so much more performance that it can't be denied.

494
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:46,576
Rym:  I'm still curious to see games and things running on an M1 with a high degree of performance, considering the lack of GPUs we can put in those devices right now.

495
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,670
Rym: Things of the day.

496
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,089
Rym: So check this out.

497
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,328
Rym: This is a YouTube video.

498
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:01,090
Rym: It is four minutes and 21 seconds long.

499
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:13,934
Rym: This is, as far as we know, the first film with a narrative ever made in Japan in 1899.

500
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:14,830
Rym: Momiji Gari.

501
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,830
Rym: It was, the story behind it's fascinating.

502
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:20,429
Rym: I learned about it recently, but this is the whole thing on YouTube.

503
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:40,010
Rym: It's actually preserved relatively well considering, but basically it was a recording of a performance of two extremely famous actors who were doing stage plays and they recorded the scene on film as a record for the future, not to be screened in theaters.

504
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,990
Rym: Like this was not something they intended to show anyone.

505
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:49,570
Rym: This was intended to be stored and archived so that in a distant future, people could see like these famous actors acting.

506
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,250
Rym: Like that was, this was the early era of film.

507
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,408
Rym: Like that made sense.

508
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:01,149
Rym: However, one of the actors died, like not too long after this was filmed.

509
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:09,830
Rym: So they ended up screening it and it was like in 1904, I want to say like the story behind this film is amazing, but it's just on YouTube.

510
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:10,988
Rym: You can watch it.

511
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:12,089
Rym: It's short.

512
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,530
Rym: You can just read a script for what happened.

513
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:15,369
Rym: It's a silent film.

514
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:19,029
Rym: So there's only like a couple of title cards of Japanese that you could just read.

515
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,328
Rym: And it is, this is pretty cool.

516
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,070
Scott:  All right, so we just, we talked about archival, right?

517
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,309
Scott: Well, you know, archiving software, archiving data, but one thing that's a lot harder to archive is hardware, right?

518
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:39,030
Scott: So a lot of old computers, old hardwares, here we got emulators and things like that, you know, so we'll never really lose, you know, the truth, right?

519
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:45,810
Scott: But sometimes stuff, you know, we want to have at least a few of the original real deal, - Well, especially when you find an edge case.

520
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:55,010
Rym: Remember we went to that talk about the guy making emulators and he was like, yeah, you find this crazy edge case and you gotta go look at the hardware to figure out what the hell it was doing and you never encountered it in your code path before.

521
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:55,930
Scott:  Exactly.

522
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,090
Scott: It's not in the documentation, it's not anywhere, right?

523
00:38:58,131 --> 00:38:58,609
Scott: But it's real.

524
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:00,630
Scott: And some software depends on it or something.

525
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:11,149
Scott:  So, you know, one problem, as someone who has recently been doing some stuff with some old devices, like a GBA, Apple II, Mac plus over here, right?

526
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:17,550
Scott: It's like, you sort of realize like, you know, if this breaks, right?

527
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:24,930
Scott: And I can't fix it and I can't get a replacement part for it, that's one less of those in the world and no one's making more, right?

528
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:27,908
Scott: So make sure they're in good hands wherever they are.

529
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:34,668
Scott: So what we have here is somebody with a Mac SE30.

530
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,242
Scott: So a Mac SE30 is a really interesting Mac 'cause there was the Mac 512K, right?

531
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,567
Scott: There was the Lisa, the Mac 512K, the Mac plus, which is what I have.

532
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:52,990
Scott: And then the SE30 came after the Mac plus and it's very similar except it had like a, you could get one with an internal hard drive.

533
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:58,830
Scott: That was like the, and it was faster and such, but that was really the big differentiator between that and the Mac plus, right?

534
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:11,130
Scott: The Mac plus, which came out in '86, could actually run Mac OS all the way up through like the mid nineties, like it was very long lived computer, but the SE30 was a little, you know, almost as amazing, right?

535
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,528
Scott: 'Cause that internal hard drive, you don't have to use an external one.

536
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:23,830
Scott: So that's like, if you wanna get an old Mac and sort of like hit that sweet spot of old vintage-ness, but also convenience, right?

537
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:27,069
Scott: The SE30 is like, it's right there, right?

538
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,410
Scott: With that internal hard drive action.

539
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:40,546
Scott: So we have here is a person who, I don't know if they had a broken one or if they just did this for fun, but they're like, hey, you know, I have a Mac SE30, right?

540
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,470
Scott: If this breaks, there's no replacing it, right?

541
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:55,210
Scott: It's getting new, you know, some parts you could maybe replace, like, you know, maybe some certain chips you could maybe get somewhere, you know, from somebody, or I was able to buy RAM for my Mac+ very easily, right?

542
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,609
Scott: I was able to get a battery for certain things, but you know, the CRT breaks, it's like, that's it.

543
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,370
Scott: You're not getting another one of those, right?

544
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:02,887
Scott: That's the end.

545
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:07,790
Scott: And if the motherboard breaks, that's it, right?

546
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:14,850
Scott: It's like, even if all the chips are in perfect condition, like if the motherboard, the board itself, the circuit board is broken, like you're done, right?

547
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,288
Scott: It's like, can't get another one.

548
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,290
Rym:  Yep, and a circuit board, a motherboard is not as simple.

549
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:23,870
Rym: if you look at one and you think, you can see all the lines, just like replicator from a photo.

550
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:25,040
Rym: All the boards are layered.

551
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,589
Rym:  It's multiple layers.

552
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26,969
Rym:  There's layers in there.

553
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,313
Scott:  Yeah, you can't,

554
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:29,721
Rym: this person

555
00:41:30,506 --> 00:41:49,809
Scott: amazingly, I guess, reverse engineered or, you know, figured out from who knows what, but they basically, you know, built up a schematic for the motherboard of the Mac SE30, and if you, you know, can create the, you know, the design, you can have circuit boards made very easily today.

556
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:59,289
Scott: They had a circuit board made, and sure enough, they put all the chips on it from another board, and it fucking worked.

557
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:15,829
Scott: They made a Mac SE30 motherboard, which means, now if anyone's Mac SE30 motherboard breaks, okay, you can't get an original one, but you can have one made that, as far as we can tell, is identical, you just need enough chips to fill it up.

558
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:23,509
Scott: So that's pretty awesome, I hope that more people do this for other motherboards of other devices, that would be pretty cool.

559
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:29,928
Rym:  Yeah, and the story, like the thread, they document this in pretty good detail, like this is a fun read, even if you have no idea what they're talking about.

560
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:37,329
Scott:  It'd be like, hey, they're not making Model Ts anymore, but I figured out how to make one, and I made one.

561
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:39,989
Rym:  I did get to ride in a Model T once.

562
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,770
Scott:  It's not that exciting.

563
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:58,350
Rym:  Nah, but, so get this, this was a Model T, this was actually in the year 1996, we bought a house, like my family, and the person who lived there, she was an old lady, and she was leaving, and she owned a Model T, that was her only car, and she literally used it daily.

564
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,930
Rym: So she was like, do you wanna go for a ride?

565
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:14,890
Rym: And she took us for a ride in it, and it had a few modifications to make it work better, but it was a Model T, like straight up, it didn't go that fast, and it was a fascinating ride, it was not comfortable.

566
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,030
Scott:  No, it's also dangerous, I've said that already, but I'll say it again, dangerous.

567
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:27,910
Rym:  In the meta moment, we just talked about the first Japanese film, well, we're also reading together the first Japanese novel, which happens to also be--.

568
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,050
Scott:  No, not just the first Japanese novel.

569
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,930
Rym:  Happens to also be the first novel, full stop.

570
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:40,210
Scott:  Think about it, that's something we haven't pointed out, Japan, Japanese people invented the novel, right?

571
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:51,150
Scott: So every novel you read, even if it's written by someone else who's not Japanese, can be considered a Japanese invention, right?

572
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:51,913
Scott:  Yeah,

573
00:43:52,437 --> 00:44:11,910
Rym: so if you wanna read it along with us, the only advice I have for you is, if you get hung up on trying to figure out 100% of what happened in a given short chapter, honestly, just let it wash over you, and you'll figure out the gaps that you didn't quite get from the implied language pretty quickly, and the things you don't figure out--

574
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:28,370
Scott:  You'll understand it, reading something over and over again that's confusing, 'cause it's, you know, in this ancient language, ancient, you know, old language, will won't help you understand it better, at least for me, reading ahead, keep going, and it will make it easier to understand.

575
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:33,068
Rym:  Read it like you're reading it for fun, don't read it like it's an assignment in 10th grade literature class.

576
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,147
Rym:  Yeah.

577
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:45,128
Rym:  That's my advice, and you'll see that Genji, Genji just kind of flits, he just moves from place to place, causing small amounts of trouble and not really learning lessons.

578
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,710
Scott:  It's a tale of Genji.

579
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,248
Rym:  Yep, it's just Genji doing his thing.

580
00:44:53,090 --> 00:45:16,629
Rym: Otherwise, GeekNights has an expansive online community and online presence, and we encourage you to check out all those places, but if you check out one place, other than, I guess, whatever you're using to listen to this or watch this right now, check out our Discord and our forum, because that's where a good chunk of our community is, but there's other places too, and you can find them all by typing the word GeekNights into Google and following links.

581
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,238
Scott:  Yep, and I ask people, you know, are there any places?

582
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:24,749
Scott: we aren't that we should be, and know when we're having really good ideas, but I'm still open to ideas.

583
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,021
Scott:  Yeah.

584
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:39,168
Scott:  And also, I've sort of, I think we have cataloged a list of all the places that we are, so I'm gonna make like a little resource so that you can go to one place, and maybe like that card website or something similar to it, and that way--.

585
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,790
Rym:  Oh, but that place will then become a new place.

586
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:55,710
Scott:  It will become a new place, but I'll make a place, maybe just on our website, a page, something where you can go there, and there'll be links to every place the GeekNights exists, and that way you can find them all very easily, and we won't have to list them.

587
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,430
Scott: We can just send you to that one place, be like, it's sort of like the GeekNights mall directory map thing.

588
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:03,087
Scott: I'm gonna make that pretty soon, 'cause it won't take very long at all.

589
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,047
Scott: So look out for that.

590
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:16,810
Rym:  All right, so we've talked about various parts of computers and things, and we've talked about some adjacent topics to this in an ancient, ancient past.

591
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,290
Scott:  We did shows on both of these things in the past.

592
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,028
Scott: We did a tablet show and a laptop show.

593
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,050
Scott: I think we've done several laptop shows, in fact, maybe.

594
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,670
Rym:  So actually, I can pull that list up right now in detail.

595
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,189
Scott:  Because things changed over time, so we did an update show.

596
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:38,631
Rym:  So we did a show on HTPCs, and I want to say 2011.

597
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:40,086
Rym: Nothing's changed, like HTPCs.

598
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,630
Scott:  Very little has changed.

599
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,549
Rym:  Our advice now is the same as then.

600
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,950
Rym: HTPCs are better than any other option on a TV for almost all use cases.

601
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,649
Scott:  Assuming you can afford it, yes.

602
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,866
Rym:  But the last time we talked about laptops, we actually even called the show, which is the, in 2008, we did a show called "How to Buy a

603
00:46:56,907 --> 00:46:57,309
Rym: Laptop.".

604
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:58,869
Rym: Do not follow the advice there.

605
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:15,900
Rym: In 2012, we did a show called "Laptops in 2012," because between 2008 and 2012, which was literally four years, the world of laptops changed so much that almost everything we said in the previous episode was 100% obsolete.

606
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:35,190
Rym: And now laptops are in a really not weird, but interesting space, because they are less used by pretty much most people who do not have one for their work, and most people who have one for their work, it replaced their work desktop.

607
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,530
Rym: So laptops are kind of a different space from what they were before.

608
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,150
Scott:  Yeah, originally, the laptop was, I have a desktop computer that I do these things with.

609
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:49,390
Scott: I want to be able to do these things when I am not at a desk in my house.

610
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,328
Scott: I want to be able to do this on a plane, on a boat, on a car.

611
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,710
Scott:  Now, when I was in high school-- - Hopefully not while driving, right?

612
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,349
Rym:  When I was in high school, that is an insane idea.

613
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,687
Rym: That is not something that was even remotely possible for me.

614
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:05,529
Scott:  Well, I mean, there were lots of portable computers even going back, right?

615
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,790
Scott: There were like, what was the first Mac one, right?

616
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:09,629
Scott: I forget, like the--.

617
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:12,930
Rym:  Oh, I had, actually, I wish I still had it.

618
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:13,569
Rym: I gave it back.

619
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,490
Scott:  When the iMac came out, there was the fruity laptop one.

620
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,469
Scott: It was a fruity iMac portable one.

621
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,529
Rym:  I had a 386 laptop that I used when I worked at IBM.

622
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,790
Scott:  Yeah, the Lenovo, the IBM ThinkPad, right?

623
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,470
Scott: Just IBM laptops in general, they go way back.

624
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:36,770
Scott: There were still, even in the '80s, maybe early '90s, there were like these big ones you'd like open up, right?

625
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,890
Scott: And really shitty monitors, and they were really limited.

626
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,831
Rym:  The laptop I had was a 386.

627
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:49,550
Rym: It was about the size of my HTPC, but you could put it, like you could sit down with it, and a little monitor popped out at the top as well as those orange phosphor displays.

628
00:48:50,152 --> 00:48:53,682
Rym: And it had a token ring thing and a modem in it, and it was just, it was a 386 laptop.

629
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,708
Rym: It did about what you'd expect, not much.

630
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:08,430
Scott:  But if you could look on this history of laptops on Wikipedia, right, shows you all sorts of amazing old machines of various kinds, right?

631
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:14,664
Scott: But the first thing you really see that is really good, let's see here, Apple and IBM, late '89, right?

632
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:24,866
Scott: Apple's Mac portable, IBM PS/2 Note 91, Apple PowerBook 91, IBM ThinkPad 92, those are the ones that started to become actually laptop.

633
00:49:25,773 --> 00:49:27,170
Scott: as we think about laptop.

634
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,688
Rym:  They were big, they were expensive, the batteries really didn't last, like you had to plug them in.

635
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:38,210
Scott:  The screens sucked, they had weird peripherals, the keyboards were good to bed.

636
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:45,710
Rym:  Remember, this was an era when no one had smartphones, and tablets couldn't be made, like there weren't tablets.

637
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,950
Scott:  There wasn't wifi necessarily, so you would have to, the only way these things would ever network is if you plugged them in with a cable.

638
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:59,129
Rym:  My first laptop that wasn't from work that I bought for myself, which I bought while we were doing GeekNights, I bought it when we lived in Beacon.

639
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:07,346
Rym: It had a port on the side to plug an RJ11 in to plug it into a phone line, 'cause it had a modem built in.

640
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,250
Scott:  Now we ended up doing laptop history here.

641
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:20,990
Rym:  Yeah, but basically, laptops grew massively in importance because people needed to do computing tasks when they weren't in their home or office.

642
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:29,970
Rym: So a lot of people had laptops, even if they were not necessarily nerds, technologists, or hobbyists, people were using them to just do daily life things.

643
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:44,050
Scott:  Especially companies, because when your most office-y jobs did not need high-performance multimedia computers, they just needed word processing, spread-sheeting computers, which even crappier, older laptops were very, very capable of doing.

644
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:50,369
Scott: And so you would just give those out to your employees instead of, you know, that way not everyone has offices with desktops.

645
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,970
Rym:  Most of what I did with laptops back then was not connected to any sort of network.

646
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,030
Rym: I was like writing a document in Word.

647
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,150
Scott:  If someone's laptop is broken at your office, okay, swap 'em, right?

648
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:04,270
Scott: It's like, you know, they're just like perfect for everything, you know, business-y, right?

649
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:15,750
Scott: So what happened was over time, as laptops improved, people who didn't need the ultra power even at home, right, would not have a desktop at all.

650
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,010
Scott: They would just have laptop only.

651
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,610
Scott: How many people just have like a MacBook and that's it, right, that's their thing, right?

652
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:32,089
Scott: And then what happened is people who didn't even need keyboard mouse type action, right, they were just, you know, doing a web-browsey emailing.

653
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:35,328
Scott: Now they could get an iPad or even Android.

654
00:51:35,348 --> 00:51:37,809
Scott: tablets are even more popular than you realize, they're out there.

655
00:51:39,093 --> 00:51:44,430
Scott: Or they just use their phone for everything and they have a big phone or they use their phone for everything and they have a small phone.

656
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:50,490
Rym:  There's a reason why a lot of people have phablets, like a tablet-looking laptop with a SIM card in it, basically.

657
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,450
Scott:  People don't even need, you know, anything anymore, right?

658
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:09,869
Scott: So the laptop is in this weird space now of, you know, it's like if you don't need the desktop and your phone doesn't do everything you need to do, that's where the laptop comes into play, the tablet comes into play.

659
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:15,290
Rym:  Like most people do not need laptops unless their work gives them one.

660
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,594
Scott:  And the gaming laptop occupies this weird space of like.

661
00:52:18,614 --> 00:52:20,009
Scott: you do need it, but you have no room.

662
00:52:20,393 --> 00:52:21,830
Scott: So you're willing to pay for this thing.

663
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,110
Scott: that's sort of ridiculous and doesn't make a lot of sense.

664
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,628
Scott:  Or you use, I've noticed-- - For a very small number of people, it makes a whole lot of sense.

665
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,030
Rym:  Yep, a lot of people who use gaming laptops, I think use them for a very specific purpose.

666
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,530
Rym: They use it like a portable computer.

667
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,330
Rym: They're not like using it on the plane.

668
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:42,550
Rym: Like it is just a very portable, compact computer that they bring to like a tournament to play on their own hardware.

669
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:50,970
Scott:  Or they just don't have a lot of room in their house, so they just buy this gaming laptop and then-- - Yep, it's an all-in-one package.

670
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,566
Scott:  Play games.

671
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,949
Rym:  Before the coins ruin everything, you just buy external video cards for those things too.

672
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,129
Scott:  I don't know how many people actually use those.

673
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,189
Rym:  A shocking number of people use them.

674
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,310
Rym: Good Lord, have I talked about those a lot with coworkers recently.

675
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:08,029
Rym: Kids are really obsessed with them.

676
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:16,350
Rym: Kids today, like I've learned this kind of recently, kids are like 11, 12, 13 right now, they all want gaming laptops.

677
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,570
Rym: They think desktop gaming is stupid.

678
00:53:18,951 --> 00:53:22,849
Rym: They want a gaming laptop and a gigantic external video card.

679
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:26,609
Rym: I don't know why, but they all want the exact same thing.

680
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:34,408
Rym: It's a niche that I've encountered among like literally three different coworkers' kids over the past two weeks.

681
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,448
Rym: 'Cause they all come to me like, "Oh yeah, you know about this stuff.

682
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,087
Rym: "Where can I get an external video

683
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:39,330
Rym: card?".

684
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,369
Rym: And I was like, "Nowhere.

685
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:41,710
Rym: "You're fucked.

686
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,224
Rym: "There's just no way to buy

687
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:43,406
Rym: one.".

688
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,628
Scott:  Also, why would you want one?

689
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:48,810
Scott: It's like just better to get a desktop computer.

690
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,850
Rym:  So now like I personally do need a laptop.

691
00:53:54,390 --> 00:54:02,352
Rym: So I recently, like in 2019, right before COVID, I bought a brand new Surface Laptop 3.

692
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:14,968
Rym: And I feel like the two kinds of laptops that exist in the world now are either it's the cheapest possible Chromebook, probably because the school gave it to you or you just needed like the bare minimum device.

693
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,489
Scott:  Schools fucking love Chromebooks.

694
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,209
Scott: You have no idea.

695
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,202
Scott: If you haven't been in a school, 'cause you're an adult?

696
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:22,409
Scott: recently, like Chromebooks are huge in schools.

697
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,210
Scott: Chrome OS is like enormous.

698
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,090
Rym:  Chrome OS has overtaken everything but Windows, I think, last I checked for desktop use.

699
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:37,569
Scott:  In terms of desktop operating systems, yes, Chrome OS is more popular than OS X in terms of like install base as of right now.

700
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:38,910
Scott: Not even joking.

701
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:42,410
Scott: Like there's more Chromebooks out there than there are Mac OS computers.

702
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:54,810
Rym:  And part of that I think is that the cheapest possible laptop ends up being cheaper than a crappy tablet 'cause it comes with like the keyboard and mouse built in and it's like you can sit with it and type.

703
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,490
Scott:  Almost everything, it does everything a person wants to do in their Chrome.

704
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,630
Scott: It's like that's all you're using if you have a computer anyway.

705
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:01,749
Scott: So what does it matter?

706
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:14,150
Rym:  And then you have people like us where like I need a very powerful laptop 'cause I do things like play high res videos and record streams or even actually live stream like from a convention.

707
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,770
Rym: Like I'm editing video on my laptop sometimes.

708
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:23,043
Rym: Like I needed a powerful, portable, compact device that I do primary tasks on.

709
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:23,949
Rym: that no tablet can do.

710
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,830
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, for me, I had the laptop, right?

711
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:37,810
Scott: And then I got the iPad mini originally a few years ago, right, and when I got the iPad mini, right, it was like, you know, my idea was like, okay, I'm sitting in bed here using this laptop, right?

712
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,389
Scott: I still needed the laptop for going to a convention or doing other things, right?

713
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:49,610
Scott: But I was like, it sort of sucks to use the laptop for most of the time when I was using it was like in bed 'cause if I'm not in my bed, I can use my desktop, right?

714
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:54,250
Scott: And it sucked to sit there with this keyboard, right, when most of the time, what am I doing in bed?

715
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,187
Scott: Watching a YouTube video?

716
00:55:56,030 --> 00:56:01,665
Scott: You know, so I got the tiniest iPad and I was like, this replaces a Kindle and it's better than the laptop.

717
00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:07,029
Scott: when I'm in bed and I'll just have the laptop and I'll use it only for the things the little tiny iPad can't do.

718
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:17,050
Scott: But then over time, you know, people always seem to still, I think tech people still scoff at this idea that like iPad is as good as laptop.

719
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,384
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like- - Unless you're doing something specialized, it really isn't.

720
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:32,830
Scott:  It, like the iPad Pro, I have the iPad Pro instead of the tiny iPad or the laptop now and yeah, the iPad Pro does do everything a laptop does.

721
00:56:33,293 --> 00:56:37,850
Scott: I can't even think of something I wanna do that I can't do with the iPad Pro.

722
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:43,008
Scott: The only thing I can't do with iPad Pro that I wanna do with it is write software that runs on an iPad Pro.

723
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,870
Scott: I want, if I have Xcode for iPad Pro, that's it, the end.

724
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,950
Scott: There is nothing, it's super powerful, it's more powerful than just about any laptop I could get.

725
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,849
Rym:  So the other thing, I guess for me, 'cause you know what I use my laptop for?

726
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,090
Rym: The reason I can't use an iPad, I travel a lot.

727
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:02,610
Rym: Well, for COVID, we'll get to how COVID even messed the situation up even more.

728
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:10,348
Rym: I would travel a lot and I'd be like away from home with a lot of flights and a lot of time in hotels for like weeks at a time.

729
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:15,590
Rym: So I wanted something that would run Windows so I could play any Steam game I own.

730
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,569
Rym: Like I could just play Overwatch if I wanted to.

731
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,370
Scott:  The iPad Pro does have, you could run the Steam link in Steam stream.

732
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,684
Rym:  Steam stream from what?

733
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:24,750
Scott:  Your home computer.

734
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:25,550
Rym:  My home computer?

735
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:29,310
Rym: Well, I'm in like Singapore in a hotel or on an Amtrak.

736
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,209
Scott:  Civilization 6 is just on iOS.

737
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,310
Rym:  Yeah, one that wasn't the case before, that's recent.

738
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,610
Scott:  But the point is a lot of the games that you wanna play are just on iOS.

739
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,169
Rym:  Yeah, but a lot of the ones I wanna play are not, most of them are not on iOS.

740
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:43,928
Scott:  Like what?

741
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,730
Scott: Slay the Spire?

742
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:45,430
Rym:  Radio Commander.

743
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,030
Scott:  Maybe it's on or not to look.

744
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,448
Rym:  I don't think that's on iOS.

745
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,369
Scott:  I'll take a look, who knows?

746
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,270
Rym:  I highly doubt that game is on iOS.

747
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,968
Rym: Overwatch, does Overwatch run on iOS?

748
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:56,766
Rym: I don't think so.

749
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:57,563
Scott:  No.

750
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,770
Rym:  That's my primary game already.

751
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,141
Scott:  Radio Commander is $5 on iOS.

752
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:03,205
Scott:  Really, that's new.

753
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:04,869
Scott:  Vietnam War strategy game?

754
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,750
Rym:  Yeah, so actually though, it would be hard to play that game without a mouse.

755
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,670
Rym: Anyway, you can plug a mouse into an iPad.

756
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:17,170
Rym: But the point is, for most people, laptop doesn't do much for them anymore.

757
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:24,650
Rym: And I think, laptops aren't gonna die, but I don't know what the future of laptops look like.

758
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,485
Rym: I think we're gonna see--.

759
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,070
Scott:  Laptops is a thing for work, I think.

760
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:28,970
Rym:  It's gonna be a thing for work?

761
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:29,596
Scott:  A computer.

762
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:32,749
Scott: that's a real computer, but it's for a job, right?

763
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:43,650
Rym:  Well, arguably, look, when I'm traveling, I'm either traveling for GeekNights or for my day job, and both of those, the laptop, I only need the laptop because I have things to do for one of those two jobs.

764
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:45,730
Rym: Specifically.

765
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:56,310
Rym: iPad, I think, would have trouble live streaming the stuff from a panel while we were also presenting the panel as a one-stop shop on a stage at a convention.

766
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,807
Scott:  It can do that, but it doesn't have a capture card.

767
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,622
Scott:  Yeah, like I can-- - You have to use the camera on it.

768
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:10,650
Rym:  Yeah, I can just plug an HDMI video switcher into the laptop and it'll just work and capture the video and be fine.

769
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,890
Rym: But again, that is a super niche case.

770
00:59:14,395 --> 00:59:20,190
Rym: If we didn't need it to do all that, the iPad can just also show our slides and even play videos at a convention.

771
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:20,909
Rym: That'll work fine.

772
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:25,130
Rym: We only don't do that because the laptop, I bring the laptop and it's easier.

773
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:28,310
Rym: Scott's iPad is the backup in case my laptop breaks or something.

774
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:30,230
Scott:  Yeah, it can do it, just fine.

775
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,990
Rym: And tablets, I think most people are just gonna have a phone, maybe a tablet.

776
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:44,089
Rym: And I think kids will remember that they had a laptop in school because their school gave them a Chromebook.

777
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:52,764
Rym: And I'll bet when kids get to college, they ditch that Chromebook and literally just have a tablet, maybe a desktop.

778
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:53,450
Rym: if they're a gamer.

779
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,010
Scott:  Depends what kind of work they're doing.

780
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:55,370
Rym:  Yeah.

781
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:05,350
Scott:  Could you imagine if I wasn't a computer person, you weren't doing computer work, maybe you were like, I don't know, some sort of literature student.

782
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:12,629
Rym:  Yeah, if I'm not a videographer editing 4K video, I don't even need that and playing super PC games, I don't need this one station.

783
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,569
Scott:  You could just get, you could just live your whole life with just iPad and that's it.

784
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:21,130
Scott: Or maybe you could buy the underpowered, right?

785
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:30,449
Scott: But things like the MacBook Air, which are just like, oh, it weighs nothing and its performance is low, but I just need the web browser, right?

786
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,310
Scott: I'm not a computer person, right?

787
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,630
Scott: It's like, you could, there's so much, that's almost luxurious.

788
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:43,430
Scott: It's like, whoa, you can set the smallest, lightest thing and not care that it's slow 'cause you don't ever push the CPU ever in your whole life.

789
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,490
Scott: YouTube video is the most it's ever gonna work, right?

790
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,697
Scott:  Yep.

791
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:46,030
Scott:  Who cares?

792
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:51,930
Rym:  And it's funny, I used to be obsessed with making my laptop as small as possible, which in the old days was really hard.

793
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:57,390
Rym: Like a small laptop performed worse and cost like three times more than a big laptop.

794
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:00,030
Rym: Like I actually, I pulled up the prices.

795
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:15,569
Rym: In 2008, I spent $2,225, $2,008 on a Lifebook P8010 laptop with a DVD, like a 6X optical read only drive.

796
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:23,749
Rym: And, but to like in that era, that was my primary form of entertainment when I was traveling anywhere.

797
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,270
Rym:  Yep, there's no smartphone.

798
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,986
Scott:  That would accompany like a Blackberry or something at best.

799
01:01:29,006 --> 01:01:29,149
Rym:  Yeah.

800
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,090
Rym: I can like watch DVDs on that thing.

801
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,670
Rym: I can watch pirated movies on that thing.

802
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,909
Rym: I'd play games on that thing.

803
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,409
Scott:  Exactly, so once the smartphone comes into the picture, that no longer needs to do that stuff.

804
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:43,310
Rym:  Yeah, like even on a trip now, like if you're taking a flight to PAX, I bring my laptop.

805
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:51,150
Rym: I rarely open my laptop or turn it on on that flight 'cause I could just look at my phone or play my Switch.

806
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,749
Rym: Like I have all these other devices that solve most of the things I would use a laptop for.

807
01:01:56,253 --> 01:02:00,590
Rym: I'm only bringing the laptop 'cause I'm using it at my destination for a very specific and dish purpose.

808
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:08,110
Scott:  Yeah, basically the laptop occupied this, there was a big vacuum of space it occupied and that space has been chipped away at.

809
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:13,509
Scott: So the circumstances under which a laptop now makes sense are so much smaller than they ever have been.

810
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:19,550
Scott: But I think makes a lot of sense and these are really popular and the Microsoft Surface is evidence of this, right?

811
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,049
Scott: Is the sort of convertible laptop situation, right?

812
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:30,110
Scott: Which it really sort of grows and conquers over some of that lost space, right?

813
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:34,969
Scott: It's like, oh, I see that you have a phone/tablet and therefore no longer need a laptop.

814
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:35,628
Scott: Well, guess what?

815
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:37,229
Scott: This is a laptop.

816
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,389
Scott: It's a Windows PC, but guess what?

817
01:02:40,016 --> 01:02:42,846
Scott: It can be your tablet 'cause the keyboard just comes right off, right?

818
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,969
Scott: You don't need an iPad, you got this, right?

819
01:02:45,591 --> 01:02:48,670
Scott: Oh, you need to go on a plane and actually do some work.

820
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,208
Scott: Well, guess what?

821
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:50,490
Scott: You can reattach that keyboard.

822
01:02:50,651 --> 01:02:51,628
Scott: I am a laptop now.

823
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:56,829
Scott: The iPad Pro sort of does the same thing, but this thing runs actual Windows with it, right?

824
01:02:57,972 --> 01:03:03,970
Scott: And it's like, oh, I see that you want to put me on your desk at work because I am your work laptop, right?

825
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,710
Scott: But at your desk at work, you have a keyboard.

826
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:11,770
Scott: Remove my keyboard and use your desk keyboard and save desk real estate.

827
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:15,210
Scott: But I am now an awesome monitor that is on your desk.

828
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,230
Scott: You only need one more monitor, right?

829
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:21,469
Scott: And it's just like, there's a lot of, Lenovo makes convertibles, right?

830
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,869
Scott: Where the keyboard flips over.

831
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,169
Scott: There's all kinds of choices out there in that realm.

832
01:03:26,072 --> 01:03:29,486
Scott: And I think that's why those make a lot of sense right now.

833
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:36,450
Scott: But going in the future, what makes sense is the question.

834
01:03:37,476 --> 01:03:39,670
Rym: If you're buying, tablets, buy what makes sense.

835
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:47,130
Rym: iPads are just better, but Android tablets aren't that bad and they are so cheap, you will be shocked.

836
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:51,850
Rym: And if you're willing to go bottom of the barrel, you can buy those Amazon Fire tablets.

837
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,346
Rym: They're limited in what they can do, but they cost nothing.

838
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:01,770
Rym: It's almost, I worry that them costing nothing just generates e-waste.

839
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:10,190
Scott:  Yeah, so what I'm seeing in the future, right, and this goes back to my Nvidia is taking over the world situation, right?

840
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:14,630
Scott: Is that you'll see what's gonna happen?

841
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:18,430
Scott: is the desktop power, right?

842
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,290
Scott: Isn't really running away a whole lot, right?

843
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,970
Scott: It's only in the realm of the big GPU.

844
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,969
Scott: is the desktop still king.

845
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:29,310
Scott: Otherwise the desktop can't really escape, right?

846
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,328
Scott: It's size advantage isn't helping it anywhere except for GPUs.

847
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:35,632
Scott: So every application- - There's

848
01:04:35,793 --> 01:04:51,308
Rym: one area, the surface books and like high performance laptops that are small, one problem they have, they can be very fast, but because they don't have good cooling, their performance profile drops rapidly if you use them too long, like use them for too much intensive stuff.

849
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,606
Scott:  Right, but that's you're looking at only in the x86 realm.

850
01:04:55,370 --> 01:05:15,730
Scott: If you look at the other, right, the M1 chip that Apple has come out with that is now shockingly inexpensive for something that came out and is probably the best consumer CPU available, the prices on the MacBook Air and the Mac mini that contain the M1 chip are like just dropping constantly.

851
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:20,309
Scott: It's like, holy shit, it's like, I don't wanna buy one, but it's like, if you're gonna give me one for what?

852
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:22,770
Scott: Mac mini, 600 bucks now, right?

853
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:26,100
Scott: The MacBook Air with the M1 is I think, I saw it go down to 1100 ish.

854
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:32,090
Scott: It's like, even if you don't need a computer, it's like, I got 10 computers.

855
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:36,130
Scott: It's like, I can't, how can you not take one?

856
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,269
Scott: It's just so much, right?

857
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:42,069
Scott: It's like, that thing's better than like most of your i7s and whatnot, right?

858
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:56,249
Scott: So if the laptops keep running away in all the non GPU realms, then it suddenly becomes a world where it's like, okay, I guess you just buy those, right?

859
01:05:56,773 --> 01:06:07,710
Scott: But then since you're no longer really building your computer, it's like, well, suddenly Nvidia comes with an arm, comparable machine, right?

860
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,089
Scott: The Nvidia laptop, right?

861
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,970
Scott: It's coming, it's got an arm Nvidia chip in it.

862
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,010
Scott: It runs Windows arm.

863
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:17,270
Scott: You don't know the difference, but it's competing on performance, right?

864
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:22,268
Scott: Your desktop isn't better than it really, except for in the GPU department and that's it.

865
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:25,410
Scott: And then what, it's convertible, right?

866
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:26,426
Scott: Maybe, right?

867
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:33,306
Scott: So now it's like, oh, okay, I'll have my phone and I'll have my convertible Nvidia, right?

868
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,209
Scott: Thing that does literally everything else.

869
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:38,647
Scott: And I only have a desktop if I'm some weirdo.

870
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:45,230
Rym:  Yup, a weirdo who's videographer, modeler, developer, gamer, like not many other use cases.

871
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:50,748
Scott:  Even gamer could probably, you're telling me an Nvidia convertible thing isn't gonna be the gaming, you know?

872
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:51,417
Scott:  I don't know.

873
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:52,290
Scott:  To your device.

874
01:06:53,230 --> 01:07:00,110
Rym:  One thing that I don't know, 'cause right now games still, like video cards are still progressing rapidly, partly because games will use that power.

875
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:01,209
Rym: They always fill that vacuum.

876
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:03,570
Rym: But at some point we gotta hit a limit there.

877
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:15,484
Rym: I think part of what Accelerate kept that trend going was that 4K in particular, high refresh rate 4K, is still beyond the capabilities of all but the most extreme GPU devices.

878
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:21,790
Scott:  I mean, what's the resolution on the freaking iPad Pro, or the big iPad Pro at least?

879
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:31,090
Rym: But is that gonna run a serious modern game in 4K at 60 FPS, reliably, for long periods of time?

880
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,459
Scott:  4K resolution is 3840 by 2160, right?

881
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:45,070
Scott: Okay, so then an iPad Pro, the big one, is 2732 by 2048.

882
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:51,689
Scott: So, not quite, it's missing like 1,000 pixels in one direction, I'd say.

883
01:07:52,175 --> 01:07:56,979
Rym:  But also, you can see this, so I have a 1080 video card in my workstation, 'cause I can't get a 3080?

884
01:07:56,979 --> 01:07:57,870
Rym: 'cause of your fucking coins.

885
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,429
Scott:  It's maybe 3K, I guess?

886
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:00,334
Rym:  Yeah.

887
01:08:00,597 --> 01:08:09,710
Rym: (laughs) But basically, if I run any game at 1080p, barely touches my 1080 GPU, like whatever.

888
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:14,010
Rym: 4K, now it's pushing that GPU to like 80% of its capacity.

889
01:08:14,453 --> 01:08:17,532
Rym: And that's for an older game running in 4K 30.

890
01:08:17,532 --> 01:08:20,203
Rym: I can't run a lot of games in 4K 60 with a 1080 right now.

891
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:40,270
Rym: But that, 'cause the sheer amount of additional processing power you need to drive 4K displays at high resolutions, I think has caused, like it keeps desktops for these performance use cases, especially gaming, viable for the foreseeable future.

892
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:47,167
Rym: But I think there will be a future generation where, all right, now everything's running 8K, and we literally won't make more Ks after that.

893
01:08:50,576 --> 01:09:00,747
Rym: But yeah, the moral of all this is, if you're gonna buy a laptop, like honestly, think long and hard about what you're actually gonna ever do with it.

894
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:09,310
Rym: 'Cause if you're not doing something weird, you probably don't need a laptop, or you can get the cheapest Chromebook that costs like almost nothing.

895
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:17,269
Scott:  I just see in the future that like, what the desktop is now of this thing that only certain people need.

896
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:18,268
Rym:  Laptop will be that.

897
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,929
Scott:  The laptop will be that, the desktop will become like this even more weird thing.

898
01:09:23,109 --> 01:09:27,970
Rym:  The desktop will be the thing that most people go to an office where there is the work state.

899
01:09:28,651 --> 01:09:32,529
Rym: Desktops are rapidly becoming, we used to, there used to be a big differentiation.

900
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:33,728
Scott:  What job needs that?

901
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:34,979
Rym:  Like modeler.

902
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,609
Rym:  Very few jobs.

903
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,189
Rym:  Yeah, like 3D modeling and rendering, that kind of thing.

904
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,569
Scott:  Very few jobs.

905
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:40,429
Rym:  But that's the point.

906
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:47,729
Rym: In the old days, there was a clear distinction between a desktop computer and a desktop workstation.

907
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:54,290
Rym: And I think workstations will persist, but desktop computers will largely disappear.

908
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:55,626
Scott:  Desktop computers are basically already gone.

909
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,510
Scott: I guess some still exist, but really no one makes a desktop computer that isn't ridiculously powerful.

910
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,110
Rym:  That isn't effectively a workstation.

911
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,630
Scott: Every desktop I own is a workstation.

912
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,649
Scott:  Yeah, there's no point for that.

913
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:07,409
Scott: Look at the Mac mini, right?

914
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,050
Scott: I just said the price is dropping because who needs it?

915
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:17,370
Scott: It is powerful, but it's like, who's buying a Mac mini these days unless you're using it for some cool thing, right?

916
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:22,810
Rym:  Like you know who's gonna buy like 40 or 50 serious desktop workstations?

917
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:29,469
Rym: A company making a television show and doing a lot of compositing and video work and animation and stuff like that.

918
01:10:30,052 --> 01:10:30,929
Rym: A game studio.

919
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,598
Rym: I think we killed enough time to stop the show right there.

920
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:39,880
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

921
01:10:40,021 --> 01:10:45,079
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

922
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,420
Scott:  Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

923
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,339
Rym:  Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

924
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,100
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

926
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,900
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

927
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,040
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

928
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:34,700
Rym:  And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Ellen Joyce, Link Eiji, Dread Lulu, Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Crane Paddock, Old Man Safe, Desktop, Peacock, Mind Snack, Finn, Graham, Vince, JustLikeADudeGuy, Ren from New Zealand, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Parent, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Hurl, Taylor Braun, You Hold the Key to My Heart, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

929
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:42,619
Rym: So now tonight, I simply leave you with... - Ladies and gentlemen, the royal tarts have arrived.

930
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,660
Rym:  Feel your movement.

931
01:11:53,003 --> 01:11:54,138
Scott: Eat my tarts?

932
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:15,140
Rym:  This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win, bandit can, then I'll still be here tomorrow to high-five you yesterday, my friend.

933
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:16,531
Rym: Peace.

934
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,189
Rym:  Sheesh.
