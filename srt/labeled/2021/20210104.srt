1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,380
Rym: It's Monday, January 4th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,762
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:13,383
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,435
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:19,690
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about outages apropos of nothing.

6
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,007
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,130
Scott: Oh, finally back from a very long, uh, breaky.

8
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,629
Rym: Oh, I gotta work.

9
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:34,990
Scott: Even though it feels like I'm back from a long break because today was my first day of work.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,790
Scott: But actually we did GeekNights up through, we only skipped one GeekNights, a Thursday, right?

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,870
Scott: So it's actually not that long a break for the listener.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,150
Rym: Yeah, and we only skipped that one because it was the actual New Year's, like New Year's Eve.

13
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:46,829
Rym: Yeah, okay.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,090
Scott: So we chat talk a whole bunch about what we were going to do during the break.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,548
Scott: What the fuck did we actually do?

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,210
Scott: We played some video games.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,261
Scott: Podcasted.

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,809
Rym: Yep, I played a lot of video games.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,649
Scott: Played a lot of video games.

20
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:05,697
Scott: So the one thing I actually did sort of work on a little, uh, you know, get the ball rolling on us.

21
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:15,870
Scott: for some reason, I think partially because of the advent of code thing, um, was I sort of like, you know, remembered why I like programming computers a little bit.

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:22,370
Scott: Because when I'm at work, the computer programming is Python Postgres, right?

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:30,610
Scott: It's, there's a web page, it sends in some stuff, you make some queries, it's SQL, you send out some JSON or whatever, right?

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,590
Scott: It's, you know, it's a lot of the same stuff and it's very high level programming.

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,530
Scott: There's no algorithms you got to worry about usually, right?

26
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:39,670
Scott: It's already implemented by someone else.

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,370
Scott: You just make, you know, you just take the magic words and put them in the right order.

28
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,048
Scott: That sort of thing.

29
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,790
Scott: And that's not that interesting, right?

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,690
Scott: That's not, you know, what makes you, you don't become a fan of computer programming doing that kind of stuff that businesses need using modern tools.

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,274
Rym: I'm sure there's someone out there, like.

32
00:01:54,374 --> 00:02:01,290
Rym: I've met people who are weirdly passionate about that like type of weird enterprise-y technology stuff, but there aren't many.

33
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:07,110
Scott: Anyway, so I talked about before how I was, you know, I took my old computers off the shelf, right?

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,389
Scott: My Mac Plus and my Apple IIGS.

35
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:11,690
Scott: I upgraded them a little bit more.

36
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,749
Scott: I made them easier to use so I don't have to use old school floppy drives even though I have them and they work.

37
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:18,930
Scott: And they're working perfectly.

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,889
Scott: I upgraded them both.

39
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,530
Scott: It's amazing.

40
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,810
Scott: And basically I was like, well, what can I actually do with these things, right?

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,090
Scott: Besides, the only things you can really do with them are use the software that was created for them.

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,468
Scott: And some of those softwares you might want to use, like it's like, man, I could use like, you know, Microsoft works for a Mac and that's like from 1990 whatever.

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,970
Scott: That's actually kind of fun, but it's like, and it's kind of nice compared to the word processors we have today, like even Google Drive.

44
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,329
Rym: It's so weird to think back.

45
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,050
Rym: Like I, there was a time when I had a 486 that wasn't connected to any network, like couldn't even dial up yet.

46
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,448
Rym: And I would just sit there doing something on that computer for hours on end.

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,076
Scott: Right.

48
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,050
Scott: And like there are games for it, but the games for these things.

49
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,470
Scott: It's like Carmen Sandiego, probably the best game on the Mac Plus, I guess, that you can play.

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,130
Scott: Even with the four megabyte of RAM upgrade, a screen is black and white, right?

51
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,369
Scott: SimCity, I guess it plays.

52
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:14,550
Scott: SimCity one, you know, and it's like, even with the upgrades and everything, it's like, they're not that convenient and nice to use.

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:24,830
Scott: So with the upsides of the good feelings that you can get from some retro software, the difficulty of using them, it's like, even if I did use them, it's like getting the data that I even I wrote, like I wrote something.

54
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:31,050
Scott: Getting that writing off of that computer is a little bit of a hassle, not a huge one, but hassle enough, right?

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,390
Scott: What do you actually do with them is program them, right?

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,088
Scott: That's what you can do.

57
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,529
Scott: You can like make something, make them do something cool.

58
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,270
Scott: And that's the exciting activity you can do with these old computers.

59
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,370
Scott: And of course, though, in doing so, it's like, oh, right.

60
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:47,489
Scott: That's also kind of a hassle.

61
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,910
Scott: Not just, you know, learning the language, learning the architecture is fun and great.

62
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,490
Scott: You know, read, get an old Apple two GS assembly manual, read it.

63
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,610
Scott: It's like, you know, figure out its quirks.

64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:11,950
Scott: That's not a problem, but it's like, all right, now go get that program into that computer and make it run it, debug it without, you know, it's like, you know, I complain about IDEs, but it's like, this isn't even like, you know, Vim shell situation.

65
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:15,430
Scott: This is way worse, right?

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,050
Scott: This is like, you can only see a few lines of text at a time, you know, with a basic listing situation.

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,937
Scott: It's not, it's not great.

68
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:26,010
Scott: once you've had modern conveniences.

69
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:38,290
Scott: But I sort of wanted, you know, I still got the feeling to like, hey, I want to make, you know, you know, if you think about making like modern software, like, you know, is not so exciting, right?

70
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:49,250
Scott: I want to make the old software, but I want to have the convenience while making the old style software of my current, you know, just at least shell and terminal and text editor, right?

71
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,160
Scott: Like it's 2020 or whatever.

72
00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:02,210
Scott: And I went looking around and I was like, you know, there's those, I don't know how many people, there weren't too many like well-used programs outside of business that use these things.

73
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,370
Scott: Because I think most people at home who had DOS were like playing games, right?

74
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,582
Scott: Or using Windows 3.1 or whatever.

75
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:09,989
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,090
Rym: There were very few non-game applications I would launch in DOS like on its own.

77
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:15,170
Scott: Right.

78
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,310
Scott: But it's like in DOS, there were applications that sort of had a Windows-like GUI that was made with the ASCII characters.

79
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:22,827
Scott: Oh, yeah.

80
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,869
Rym: I had a lot of things that would like configure stuff that would do that.

81
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:34,370
Scott: For example, when you installed Wolfenstein 3D and it told you to choose what sound card you had, that sort of interface, right?

82
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,170
Scott: Or if you wanted to edit a text file, you edited your autoexec.bat using edit.exe in DOS, that thing.

83
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:47,030
Scott: And I was like, you know, there are a lot of programs that had that sort of DOS text UI.

84
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,949
Rym: Like a kind of ASCII character set UI.

85
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,310
Scott: Exactly.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,550
Scott: And I know that nowadays if you want to make that kind of UI, you would use like ncurses or something along those lines, right?

87
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,990
Scott: But those ncurses UIs, they don't look and feel the same as the old DOS ones.

88
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,968
Scott: They're not all blocky.

89
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:07,030
Scott: They're technically blocky, but they don't have that same feel.

90
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,130
Scott: So I was like, what did they use to make those, right?

91
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,330
Scott: That was before my time.

92
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,110
Scott: You know, I never made one of those.

93
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,669
Scott: They must have used some library to make those.

94
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:22,790
Rym: The closest I ever got is I made, I would make like command where it would ask you to like type an answer to something to do something.

95
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,250
Rym: But they were still just like, blah, blah, blah, yes, no.

96
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,110
Rym: And I type Y and then my script would continue.

97
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,270
Scott: So there were two things that people used that I found to make those in the DOS days for DOS specifically.

98
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,130
Scott: Those text-based GUIs that still had like file menus and status bars and desktops and windows and dialog boxes and all that shit, right?

99
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,810
Scott: One of them was something I never knew existed, which was Visual Basic for DOS.

100
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,529
Scott: Visual Basic for DOS came out after Windows Visual Basic came out.

101
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,610
Scott: And it's pretty amazing.

102
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:57,396
Scott: And the only thing I could find with it.

103
00:06:57,436 --> 00:07:02,950
Scott: that was a problem, I got it to run in a Windows 3.1 DOS virtual box, no problem.

104
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:03,928
Scott: It totally works great.

105
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:11,150
Scott: The problem with it is that the applications it produces are not great to run on like a current computer, right?

106
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,150
Scott: So that was sort of like, that was like a really hopeful discovery.

107
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,390
Scott: That was sort of also a dead end, right?

108
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,029
Scott: You can't like, you know, put those on like your Linux box and run them.

109
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,490
Scott: So the other thing I found was, and this is the answer, this is my opening.

110
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:26,170
Scott: All right.

111
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,150
Scott: Was a thing that I knew the name was familiar, but I never, if you said ask me, what is the thing I'm about to say?

112
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,810
Scott: And then I could say, well, that's a thing I've heard of, but I don't know what the fuck it is.

113
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,269
Scott: It must be some programming thing.

114
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,470
Scott: It was a thing called Borland.

115
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,909
Scott: Remember Borland, they used to exist.

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,758
Scott: Borland TurboVision.

117
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,070
Scott: Borland TurboVision.

118
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,609
Rym: I think I've ever heard of that.

119
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,268
Scott: I've heard of a thing called Borland TurboVision, but I didn't actually know what the hell it was, right?

120
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,630
Scott: Borland TurboVision is a library Borland made for making those text based UIs.

121
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:05,510
Scott: If you Google image search Borland TurboVision, I guarantee you will know, at least someone your age, will know programs that look just like that.

122
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,810
Scott: And if they look just like that, they were made with Borland TurboVision.

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,250
Rym: Oh wow, the Pascal version was distributed alongside Borland Pascal.

124
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:12,870
Scott: That's correct.

125
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,796
Rym: On a bonus disc.

126
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,770
Rym: It was never released under a free license.

127
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:16,985
Scott: Indeed.

128
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:30,048
Scott: However, somebody on GitHub has a repository, TVision, which is basically an implementation of Borland TurboVision C++ library.

129
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:52,026
Scott: But you can compile and run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux and get your programs to build, no matter what, because it just relies on... It'll basically link to end curses or whatever the local text based GUI library is, but then you code as if you're coding Borland TurboVision C++ in 1990, whatever.

130
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,183
Scott: And this is very well... Borland TurboVision is very well documented.

131
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,310
Scott: The books are now just PDFs online.

132
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,130
Scott: They were probably really expensive books back in the day, or they came with the expensive software.

133
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,425
Scott: And I found all the example code online.

134
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:09,270
Scott: I found like everything.

135
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:19,767
Scott: So I haven't done C++ in a long time, but I found some good free C++ books that were probably really expensive back in the day to help remember what I haven't done C++ in like 15+ years.

136
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,941
Scott: Just gotta remember some syntax here and there and see what's changed since then.

137
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,264
Scott: I think they're on C++ version 17 now.

138
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:31,894
Scott: But I'm not aware of.

139
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:37,230
Scott: for anyone else who's like, "I don't want to speak too soon and shit talk," right?

140
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,437
Scott: But I feel like there's a lot of programs.

141
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,786
Scott: I've actually made some programs, but they don't have UIs, right?

142
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,230
Scott: It's just the processing part.

143
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,603
Scott: And it's like, if I really master this TurboVision thing, that could be my thing.

144
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,750
Rym: That could be your shit, like the wet bandits or the sticky bandits.

145
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,775
Scott: I can make games and all kinds of stuff.

146
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:01,101
Scott: Imagine you play like a HypnoSpace Outlaw, right?

147
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:06,190
Scott: I can make a game, but it just looks like Portland TurboVision instead of looking like HypnoSpace Outlaw.

148
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,372
Scott: And it's a lot of fun.

149
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,197
Scott: It's way more fun than my job.

150
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:15,249
Scott: And if I'm stuck inside, check it out.

151
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:24,270
Rym: Obviously the news that gave us the idea to do the show, everyone came back to work after the holiday and Slack wasn't fucking working this morning.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,030
Scott: Yeah, at first I thought it was just an artifact of the fact that because I haven't used my work computer in a while, I was logged out of the single sign-on.

153
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,030
Rym: I think a lot of people took a while to realize that it was actually down for similar reasons.

154
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,318
Scott: So I tried to log into the single sign-on again and get Slack to open again.

155
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:46,470
Scott: The Slack windows app is just like one of those Electron web things.

156
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:53,945
Scott: So I clicked on a link in it to go to the Slack status page, but then the whole app was stuck on that page.

157
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,430
Scott: There was no way for me to reload or escape from that.

158
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:02,210
Scott: So I had to uninstall the whole Slack app because I couldn't clear its cache because its menu wasn't appearing in the app.

159
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,078
Scott: And then I figured out, yeah, all of Slack is down.

160
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:07,663
Scott: It was down for several hours.

161
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,047
Scott: It was completely 100% down.

162
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:17,750
Scott: And this totally reminds me of that time where Blizzard launched a Diablo game, I think it was Diablo 3, and then they went down.

163
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:24,850
Scott: I said this, we were talking about it earlier, I worked at a website called Broadway.com.

164
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,241
Scott: We knew during the Tony Awards, we're broken Broadway.com.

165
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:30,084
Scott: That's our time.

166
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,309
Scott: That's the time for us.

167
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:36,258
Scott: We know what business you're in, you know what your time is.

168
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:40,569
Scott: If you're working at NFL.com, you know the Super Bowl is your fucking time.

169
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,195
Scott: That's your time that you don't go down.

170
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:44,980
Scott: You don't mess with shit.

171
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,570
Scott: You add extra servers, you increase your whatever you gotta do.

172
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:50,173
Scott: You know when your time is.

173
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,376
Scott: Stop uploading code.

174
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:55,204
Scott: This is January 4th.

175
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:58,070
Scott: The first day people come back to work after a break.

176
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,396
Scott: And Slack knows who they are.

177
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,400
Scott: They've been around for years.

178
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,202
Scott: They're not brand new.

179
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,467
Scott: They know that they should know.

180
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:05,450
Scott: this is your day.

181
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,018
Scott: Nobody is using their vacation day today.

182
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,469
Scott: Everyone has a lot of messages from the past month they haven't read stacked up.

183
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,796
Scott: So when they log in, they're gonna need to load a whole bunch.

184
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:20,559
Scott: And they fucked it up.

185
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,130
Scott: And whoever is responsible deserves, you know, they deserve negative consequences.

186
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,054
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

187
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:33,210
Rym: But we're not gonna get into outages because that's the main bit that we'll talk about in detail.

188
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,710
Scott: No, we're talking about this outage.

189
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:41,550
Rym: But this outage, things like this happen not that often actually in the modern world.

190
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:42,856
Scott: They're happening less.

191
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:46,010
Scott: Like back in the early days of Twitter, they'd be like "the whale", right?

192
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:51,727
Scott: I think the only site that's had a lot of outages more recently is Reddit.

193
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:52,690
Scott: Reddit has problems.

194
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:54,309
Rym: Yeah, I guess I've noticed that.

195
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:58,010
Scott: And there was like a brief YouTube outage somewhat recently.

196
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,758
Rym: It was a weird outage because of the way it manifested.

197
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:04,390
Rym: It seemed like YouTube was working, but then videos would like play a little bit and then peter out.

198
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,559
Scott: Yeah, but outages like these are getting increasingly rare.

199
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,387
Scott: And this one was long and complete.

200
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:11,270
Scott: Like, mega.

201
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:24,090
Rym: Yeah, but I guess one takeaway you can think about is think about how many companies you wouldn't otherwise think about use Slack for something critical and how many people literally just cannot do their jobs without it.

202
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,741
Scott: Yeah, it took a while for my coworker to figure out we could use Google Chat.

203
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:31,170
Scott: And I think other people did the same thing as well.

204
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:39,267
Rym: We actually have like fallback plans of like, if X is down, here is like the two other tools in order that people will like devolve to.

205
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:40,370
Rym: And that works okay.

206
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:41,800
Scott: I mean, we really needed to.

207
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,690
Scott: We could have emailed, right?

208
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,345
Rym: Just pick Google.

209
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:44,730
Rym: That's cheap.

210
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,214
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:53,967
Scott: But yeah, I was actually surprised, but also I was disappointed and surprised in this outage because the Slack status page.

212
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,730
Scott: Companies, I complain about this all the time.

213
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:58,434
Scott: They have status pages that are always up.

214
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:01,678
Scott: I've never seen a status page go down, so they're doing a good job with that.

215
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,168
Scott: But the status pages always seem to A, update late, right?

216
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,810
Scott: Relative to when the outage happens.

217
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,154
Scott: And B, under report, right?

218
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:17,363
Scott: They'll have like a yellow triangle when it's clearly red X, right?

219
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,667
Scott: You know, Amazon is the worst at this.

220
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,150
Scott: Like S3 will be down.

221
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,519
Scott: And you'll go to the Amazon 3 status page and they'll be like, S3, yellow triangle in like one region.

222
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,782
Scott: And it's like, no, I don't even work there.

223
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:30,966
Scott: And I know that you are red X in all of this.

224
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,869
Scott: I've already figured this out, right?

225
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:33,450
Scott: You're lying.

226
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,130
Scott: And are you 10 minutes later, they still have an update.

227
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,154
Rym: There's a bunch of reasons for that.

228
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:45,590
Rym: And some of them have to do with like contract stuff where depending on what you say, like there can be Clovax and contracts.

229
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,051
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,849
Scott: Well, if you fuck up, then get Clovax.

231
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:57,470
Rym: At the same time, what if your site is oversensitive and it says there was an outage that there wasn't, someone could still claw back saying you officially notified us that there was an outage.

232
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,990
Scott: Well, there must have been some sort of problem if it did that, even if it's overly sensitive.

233
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,130
Rym: I think false positives in enterprise monitoring are more common than false negatives.

234
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,267
Scott: Maybe.

235
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,693
Rym: That's a gut feeling I have.

236
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:11,016
Rym: I don't have anything to back that up.

237
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:11,878
Rym: That's a gut feeling.

238
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:17,030
Rym: Also, my perspective is heavily skewed by being in capital markets, which is its own world.

239
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:23,182
Scott: Even so, I saw Slack, A, during this outage, they were slow.

240
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:26,490
Scott: I knew that they were out completely everywhere with everything.

241
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,225
Scott: And their status page was showing the yellow triangle for, or actually showed nothing for a while.

242
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,610
Scott: Then it showed the yellow triangle.

243
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:37,870
Scott: But they did eventually go to, I guess they don't have red X, they have red circle with white line in the middle.

244
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:43,370
Scott: And they eventually did go to that across the board for all of their little, you know, app.

245
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,261
Rym: Well, Slack also, they went public recently.

246
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,850
Rym: I don't think that affected their stock.

247
00:15:47,950 --> 00:16:00,470
Scott: Yeah, but I'm really, really curious what they messed up to be down, not only on the critical day, but for such a large amount of time with the amount of engineering resources they must have.

248
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:07,470
Rym: It's like no one put out a patch or pushed out some code to production like New Year's Eve.

249
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:11,665
Scott: And if you look at their status page, there might be new information.

250
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:12,670
Scott: I haven't read before the show.

251
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,430
Scott: But if you looked at their status page, where they updated every half hour as to what they knew, like the first four updates, they didn't know a damn thing.

252
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,170
Scott: So that was two hours, they just didn't know what the hell was going on.

253
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,716
Rym: Verge only has two updates on the story.

254
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:27,690
Rym: The first one saying they updated to say that it's a full outage.

255
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:31,870
Rym: And then another one saying the service may be returning to some users and then nothing.

256
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,659
Scott: You know how I'm going to.

257
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,302
Scott: there's two.

258
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:37,190
Scott: there's two ways I tell if something is down.

259
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,954
Scott: Well, three ways.

260
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,549
Scott: There's a website is up dot me.

261
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,013
Scott: Yep.

262
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:40,598
Scott: Right.

263
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,930
Rym: Which is a good website.

264
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:51,050
Rym: But at the same time, I have seen people who don't really know technology go to that website and make really, really like ridiculous assumptions from what they see there.

265
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:56,390
Scott: There's down detector, which which is where people self report, like a thing is down for me.

266
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,230
Scott: And if enough people self report, then you can sort of infer that like it must be down for a lot of people if it is this many people.

267
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,015
Scott: And it's pretty accurate, actually.

268
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,849
Scott: And then there's Twitter, where I just search Slack down or YouTube down.

269
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,429
Rym: Twitter is my go to for that unless Twitter's down.

270
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,073
Scott: I sort by latest.

271
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:17,750
Scott: And if I see that there's a lot of recent tweets saying that a thing is down, it's probably down.

272
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:27,868
Scott: So with that in mind, if I'm a company, right, what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up some sort of thing that monitors Twitter and searches for the name of my app down down.

273
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:37,930
Scott: And if it suddenly sees over a certain threshold of tweets saying is my thing down in the very least, like opens a ticket for someone to go take a look.

274
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,251
Rym: Right.

275
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,830
Scott: Like if I'm if I run Gmail, I'm at Google.

276
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:46,069
Scott: And if I see a lot of tweets that say is Gmail down and that I'll see what the baseline is when I know we're up.

277
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:46,671
Scott: Right.

278
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:48,136
Scott: And then I'll set a threshold.

279
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:52,390
Scott: And if the number of tweets saying is Gmail down goes over the threshold, that's how we know.

280
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,575
Rym: So you want to know something funny?

281
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:56,850
Rym: Because we don't like Scott, I don't talk about our jobs that much.

282
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,190
Rym: We talk about the tech we use, but not like our actual jobs.

283
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:07,570
Rym: Most of my career has been around that kind of monitoring and alerting of outages in large enterprise environments.

284
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,510
Rym: Like that's what I was doing from IBM onward is that kind of thing.

285
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:21,970
Rym: And in my professional opinion, most companies on earth have garbage for detecting problems, let alone correcting them.

286
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,422
Rym: Nobody has good monitoring.

287
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:25,269
Rym: No one.

288
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,316
Rym: Only I basically my life.

289
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,650
Rym: I'm not going to lie that I thought basically adequate monitoring.

290
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,437
Rym: And you know why they had adequate monitoring?

291
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,910
Rym: They spent way more money than they should have.

292
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,810
Rym: If they'd spent less money on that monitoring, they probably would have been fine.

293
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:39,653
Scott: Yep.

294
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:44,930
Scott: We have basically more than, you know, we have basically okay monitoring, right?

295
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,397
Scott: It's like we basically set up at work.

296
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:53,527
Scott: We have some software as a service monitoring thing.

297
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,229
Scott: We install it.

298
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:54,810
Scott: We set it up.

299
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,084
Rym: What do you use, like New Relic or something?

300
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,230
Rym: I forget what all the options are.

301
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,154
Scott: I think it's a different one.

302
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:03,929
Scott: But basically it posts on Slack in a channel when things go over.

303
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,571
Scott: Right.

304
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,996
Scott: Whatever they're supposed to be.

305
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:07,481
Scott: And then people actually do.

306
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,010
Scott: It's calibrated pretty well.

307
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,928
Scott: So that like you don't usually ignore when it posts in there.

308
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:13,230
Scott: Right.

309
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,357
Rym: Because that's the cardinal sin of that kind of monitoring.

310
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:18,790
Rym: If it's noisy, no one will ever pay attention to it.

311
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:19,375
Rym: Exactly.

312
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,029
Rym: Something's really down.

313
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:29,830
Scott: Pretty much anytime something gets posted from the bots, the monitoring bot in the Slack channel, I see like other people being like, hey, so and so, what's up with this?

314
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,133
Scott: That's right.

315
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,269
Scott: They take action on it.

316
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:38,107
Rym: I mean, my like guiding force is like the statements of how to do good monitoring are very simple.

317
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,310
Rym: Alerts must be actionable.

318
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,000
Rym: They must be stateful, meaning if the problem resolves itself, they clear.

319
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,524
Rym: They must be accurate.

320
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,410
Rym: They must have a high signal to noise ratio.

321
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,510
Rym: And if you can't meet all of those four things, that is not something you should be alerting on because you don't understand the problem sufficiently.

322
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,516
Scott: And then we have whenever.

323
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:57,510
Scott: we basically whenever I set up anything on Oz, I set up CloudWatch.

324
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,316
Scott: And we sort of I sort of set up two levels of CloudWatch.

325
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:05,310
Scott: There's the level that's for, you know, the monitoring and the Slack posting and the actionable items.

326
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:09,710
Scott: And then there's like a debug level that doesn't obviously alert anyone about anything.

327
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:13,150
Scott: But that way I can go and check it because I have to make the software work and have to see that.

328
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:22,350
Rym: The real key to all that these days is like in the old days, people would set up that monitoring software, but they pick like specific indicators and make rules about it.

329
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:38,670
Rym: The modern way to do it that very few people are doing, like it's an area where machine learning could and should be applied, but weirdly isn't in most cases, is just to detect anomalies and not worry about what those anomalies are and use that to determine if things are down.

330
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,755
Scott: So just basically here's every single metric.

331
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:47,310
Scott: OK, I guarantee for you here is a sample of data for all metrics that is stable.

332
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,070
Rym: Here's my last year of operational data and I flagged where there were problems.

333
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:52,232
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:57,290
Scott: And then if you see anything out of these that's out of the ordinary for this data, let me know.

335
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:57,771
Rym: Yep.

336
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,130
Rym: Let a human know whose job is to decide if there's a real problem and decide what to do.

337
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,910
Scott: And if they say no, then don't alert about that amount again.

338
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,378
Rym: Well, that's the use of train the model.

339
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,550
Rym: That will literally be input into the model.

340
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,430
Scott: Right.

341
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:14,106
Scott: Unless it's statistically significant from whatever they said is OK already.

342
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:18,540
Scott: You know, like there were two database connections for the whole year.

343
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,926
Scott: We added a third thing that connects to the database and alerts.

344
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,330
Scott: There's a third database connection.

345
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,248
Rym: You know how much of my career has been telling people to do what I just said in the course of my life?

346
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,285
Rym: Machine learning has been around for a long time, and this is a pretty easy application of it with like baby's first M.L.

347
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,190
Rym: algorithms, like stuff you could have written in Python.

348
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,589
Scott: Let's Google to see if anyone does that and then see what they're up to.

349
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,652
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:48,150
Rym: But anyway, moving on to some other news that's actually really, really important and we should pay attention to this.

351
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:51,689
Rym: A whole bunch of Google employees just unionized.

352
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:52,826
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,414
Rym: A Silicon Valley union.

354
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,722
Rym: This is a big goddamn deal.

355
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,970
Rym: It is a ridiculous myth.

356
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:06,990
Rym: And in fact, it's almost like propaganda coming from tech companies telling people like the line is usually you don't deserve a union.

357
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,719
Rym: Look how much better you're paid than like a coal miner.

358
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:13,010
Rym: Like that is the typical like propaganda of why you shouldn't unionize.

359
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,710
Scott: But a lot of anti-union propaganda.

360
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:16,431
Rym: Yeah.

361
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:22,870
Rym: Unions are pretty much a benefit to society for almost like I cannot stress to you enough.

362
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:27,625
Rym: Every reason why you don't just die on the job today is because there was a union.

363
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,930
Rym: at some point if you live in America.

364
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:36,670
Rym: Yeah, pretty much like five day work week, 40 hour work week unions basically busted skulls to get that kind of literally.

365
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:38,315
Scott: And we can get more.

366
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:38,777
Scott: Right.

367
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,243
Scott: It's like, you know, they should get more.

368
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,970
Scott: Those were those are compromises.

369
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,689
Scott: We can get more than that if we would just unionize again.

370
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:57,130
Scott: But yeah, when it comes out, just no matter where you work, whether you work at a little tiny place with, you know, or you work at a big company, almost every company in the United States is some sort of autocracy.

371
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:58,013
Scott: Right.

372
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,401
Scott: They're not usually democracies.

373
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:02,910
Rym: There are very few companies that are just like a co-op.

374
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:05,478
Scott: There's some employee owned companies.

375
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,342
Scott: There's some co-ops.

376
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:07,688
Scott: They're not many.

377
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,230
Scott: Right.

378
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:16,450
Scott: It's usually there's some kind of boss who has literally all the power or shareholders that have all the power and employees are basically just you.

379
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,054
Scott: You're not a slave.

380
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:18,536
Scott: Right.

381
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:20,261
Scott: Because you can obviously quit.

382
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:21,645
Scott: You're not being treated.

383
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,270
Scott: Don't even try to compare it to slavery.

384
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:23,952
Scott: Right.

385
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:24,774
Scott: It's not even close.

386
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:27,181
Scott: But you're basically you have.

387
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,324
Scott: you have a choice.

388
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:29,968
Scott: You can continue to work there or not.

389
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:30,550
Scott: You're free to go.

390
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:38,870
Scott: And if you choose to stay, you and you want to continue to stay and get money, you got to do what they say or they could make you leave against your will.

391
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,151
Scott: Right.

392
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,313
Scott: And then that's your choice.

393
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:40,554
Scott: Right.

394
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:47,228
Scott: So you have no power if your boss says sweep the floor and you say, you know, I only want to clean dishes.

395
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,230
Scott: I don't want to sweep floors.

396
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:54,590
Rym: I was working at the bellows in Rochester in college because I was desperate for money, making like seven bucks an hour.

397
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:00,179
Rym: And one day someone, I think the technical term is caused a shitstorm in the toilet.

398
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,070
Rym: And I walked in and saw it and I walked out and I told the manager and basically he was like, all right, go clean it up.

399
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,638
Rym: And I said, I'll quit if you actually make me do that right now.

400
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:09,621
Scott: Yeah.

401
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,570
Rym: And he went to someone else and he basically no one is willing to do it.

402
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:21,010
Rym: So finally he was like, anyone who cleans that bathroom is allowed to leave as soon as they're done and will get paid as though they worked 10 hours today.

403
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,713
Rym: And one girl was like, I'll do it.

404
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:29,948
Rym: But yeah, I would have quit and I would have had no recourse if I didn't want to do that.

405
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:30,750
Rym: They could have fired me.

406
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,378
Scott: Yep, exactly.

407
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,690
Scott: I mean, they could fire you anyway.

408
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:34,151
Rym: Oh, yeah.

409
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:38,042
Rym: Most states you can be fired for any non-protected reason at any time.

410
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:40,067
Rym: You can be fired because someone doesn't like you.

411
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,150
Rym: And that's totally legal.

412
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,561
Scott: Even if your job is fantastic, like my job is fantastic.

413
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:44,982
Scott: Right.

414
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:47,210
Scott: I mean, relatively speaking, it's not.

415
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,090
Rym: I mean, relatively speaking, my job is also fantastic.

416
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,256
Scott: I have way less complaints than pretty much everyone I know.

417
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,707
Scott: Everyone else has more complaints about their job and valid ones than I have.

418
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,130
Scott: basically none of those complaints.

419
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:03,910
Rym: All my complaints are things that capitalism cannot accommodate, like I want to work less.

420
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,651
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

421
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:17,809
Scott: You know, so the point is that even in my workplace, it's like, well, you know, somebody asked, right, the CEO of like the last meeting, like, how about a four day work week?

422
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:18,710
Scott: How's that sound?

423
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,816
Scott: And he was like, nothing's off the table.

424
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,926
Scott: That's the kind of, you know, they gave that sort of not answer answer, right?

425
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,590
Scott: He didn't say yes, didn't say no.

426
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:35,185
Scott: But if we had a union, we could instead say four day work week or a tough shit.

427
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:36,187
Scott: Right.

428
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,210
Scott: That's what we could say.

429
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,526
Scott: So and we even at my work where you can say things like, how about a four day work weeks, Mr.

430
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:43,088
Scott: CEO?

431
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:43,810
Scott: Right.

432
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,776
Scott: You know, we have that level of goodness where I am.

433
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:49,643
Scott: We can't say give it to us or else.

434
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,290
Scott: But if we got a union, then we could say that.

435
00:25:53,811 --> 00:26:04,990
Scott: Even though our situation is so good, union just makes it better because you're always getting screwed out of something in capitalism as long as the boss is, you know, just in charge and has power.

436
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:12,299
Rym: That said, there are a lot of outward problems with unions that are really just reflections of capitalism and cronyism and such like.

437
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:20,950
Rym: the example we always use is convention centers where because of union rules, like I can't plug in my own camera without paying them $150.

438
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,595
Rym: And then I'm not allowed to operate my own camera.

439
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:28,442
Rym: A camera person who is paid by the convention center by law has to operate my camera.

440
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:33,570
Rym: If I operate my camera, I can get sued or kicked out and all sorts of problems.

441
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,258
Scott: So that's not a problem with.

442
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:38,770
Scott: that says like, oh, unions are bad.

443
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:49,590
Rym: That's a problem where the government in that area is making up jobs from nothing to try to avoid the problems of capitalism with the corrupt convention center build in the first place.

444
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:50,911
Scott: Right.

445
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:55,418
Scott: And, you know, the union itself, you know, has to operate, you know, they were in back in the day.

446
00:26:55,498 --> 00:27:02,910
Scott: And I think this actually is what also hurt not only the propaganda, but also what hurt a lot of unions was the unions relations with organized crime.

447
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:15,504
Rym: Well, also weird stuff, like a lot of unions in the past four years were against Medicare for all for reasons that boiled down to the union got their workers good health care.

448
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,389
Rym: So why should we push for something different than the union to get us anything?

449
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:20,330
Rym: That's a terrible argument.

450
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:29,779
Scott: That's also there used to be more solidarity of, you know, unions and all people instead of this sort of competitive, you know, competitive greed, you know, not caring about other people.

451
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:29,999
Scott: Right.

452
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:30,359
Scott: They were just.

453
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,521
Scott: we're trying to get as much as they could for their people.

454
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:33,362
Scott: Right.

455
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:34,563
Scott: They didn't care about anyone else.

456
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:34,883
Scott: Right.

457
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:41,930
Scott: That same that same idea hurts all of our society, whether that idea is held by a union or by an individual.

458
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:55,805
Rym: There can also be very dysfunctional unions like that can happen because if you've ever done local politics or, say, volunteered for a convention or been on a board, like people are just so full of ridiculous drama and incompetence that it's kind of amazing sometimes.

459
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:57,407
Rym: And that same thing will happen with unions.

460
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:58,569
Rym: Like there's no way around that.

461
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,450
Rym: That's just how people are.

462
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,611
Scott: Mm hmm.

463
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:02,812
Scott: But that doesn't mean that unions are bad.

464
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,254
Scott: It's a Google having a union.

465
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:14,362
Scott: if they get way more people to sign union cards and such to where to get to the point where they can collectively bargain with the executives of Google.

466
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:24,430
Scott: I think that that will have actually, depending on the numbers and what that bargaining deal looks like, that could have a huge impact on the whole world.

467
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,451
Scott: Because suddenly.

468
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:26,471
Scott: Right.

469
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:36,218
Scott: No longer will the search engine that powers the earth or at least a lot of the earth, I guess not in Russia, they use what Yandex and in China, they got their QQ or whatever.

470
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,279
Rym: I mean, Google should be broken up.

471
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,880
Rym: That's a whole separate conversation, obviously.

472
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,702
Scott: But a very large thing that is so powerful.

473
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:43,363
Scott: Right.

474
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:46,385
Scott: That no one person should be allowed to control it.

475
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:54,330
Scott: It should be democratically controlled, will be more not democratically controlled, but more demographically controlled, and that more people will have a say.

476
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,851
Scott: In its functioning.

477
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,953
Scott: And that will be for the benefit of all people.

478
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:05,238
Rym: But all that said, honestly, unions are still just a Band-Aid over the root problem, which is American capitalism.

479
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:13,944
Rym: Yeah, pretty much like unions are just a Band-Aid over these far more fundamental structural problems that are topic for another show.

480
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,826
Rym: Do you want to talk about the deep use?

481
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:19,928
Scott: We can talk about deep use another time.

482
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:20,488
Rym: All right.

483
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,230
Rym: Then it's time for.

484
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,751
Rym: Things of the day.

485
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:30,271
Rym: What do you got?

486
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:35,295
Scott: So, you know, on YouTube, we love that lock picking lawyer, right?

487
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:41,240
Scott: Picking all them locks, channels interest, making us interested in watching lock picking, even though that's not a hobby that I'm personally interested in.

488
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,720
Scott: Right.

489
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,063
Scott: I'm not even interested enough to, like, go buy one of those practice locks or anything.

490
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,324
Rym: I'm moderately interested.

491
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:47,685
Rym: I wish I was picking.

492
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:50,527
Rym: I was picking the lock on my office at IBM a lot because I was bored.

493
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:51,368
Rym: Yeah.

494
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,729
Scott: You know, if I bought one, it would just.

495
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:54,030
Scott: it would just go next to the harmonica.

496
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,130
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,792
Scott: So at least, you know, at least it's small, I guess.

498
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:01,534
Scott: Anyway, but it's really interesting to watch.

499
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:05,276
Scott: I learned a lot about locks, which is fun and fascinating for a nerd to learn about.

500
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:07,938
Scott: But we can't use lock picking lawyer for thing of the day again.

501
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:13,042
Scott: So instead, what I've got is this other channel with a video that has six point three million views.

502
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:15,123
Scott: So you've probably seen it already.

503
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:24,550
Scott: But if you haven't, this person on this stuff made here YouTube channel made a lock that is, perhaps, unbelievable.

504
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,931
Scott: Unpickable in quotes.

505
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,251
Scott: Right.

506
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:28,653
Scott: Because as lock picking lawyer says, nothing's unpickable.

507
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,194
Scott: It just means I can't pick it yet.

508
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,194
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:37,959
Scott: But the principle and the fundamental principle is one that even I thought of just watching lock picking videos is that when you're picking a lock.

510
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:38,159
Scott: Right.

511
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:45,784
Scott: What you do is you're trying to line up pins or cylinders or disks or levers or whatever it is in a particular configuration.

512
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,025
Rym: They're basically a password.

513
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:47,886
Scott: Right.

514
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:48,866
Scott: It's basically a password.

515
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:51,548
Scott: The key is a thing that moves the.

516
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,550
Scott: you know, whatever they are in the lock, whatever kind of lock you have.

517
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,094
Scott: Into a certain position so that they're just unlocked.

518
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:58,475
Scott: Right.

519
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:04,722
Scott: And if you're picking a lock, what you're doing is manually moving each one into the right position until the lock unlocks.

520
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:11,890
Scott: And the way that you figure out when they're in the right position is basically you bind the lock.

521
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,733
Scott: So you like if it was a key lock, you would try to basically apply turning, you know, some, you know, some tension.

522
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,054
Scott: Right.

523
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:18,034
Scott: Try to turn the lock.

524
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:21,256
Scott: And that way you turn the lock, you move the pins up and down.

525
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:25,339
Scott: And you can tell if you've got it in the right spot because when they line up.

526
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,120
Scott: Right.

527
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,362
Scott: The locks are not machined so perfectly.

528
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:30,063
Scott: Right.

529
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:33,905
Scott: You know, you turn a little bit and it's like the pin will sort of rest on the edge there.

530
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,466
Scott: You can turn it a little bit.

531
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:35,766
Scott: Right.

532
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:37,648
Scott: And all you need to do is turn it a little bit.

533
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:40,870
Scott: And that just creates a space for the pin to sort of sit on the ledge.

534
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,573
Scott: And eventually you get all the pins to sit on the ledge and you can turn it.

535
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:44,014
Scott: Right.

536
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:51,683
Scott: If you could somehow in my thinking was like, well, just make a lock that's so precisely machined that you can't turn it even one micron.

537
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:52,384
Scott: Right.

538
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:57,410
Scott: And that way you could never know if the pin was in the right position unless they were all in the right position.

539
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,614
Rym: Or at that point you make a purely electronic lock.

540
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:03,400
Rym: that's literal just modern cryptography and no access to any components.

541
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,262
Scott: People do do that.

542
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,043
Scott: Those locks are great.

543
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:05,704
Scott: People do do that.

544
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:08,870
Rym: And also the way most people attack a door is not to pick the lock.

545
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,311
Scott: Obviously.

546
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:10,691
Scott: Yes.

547
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:11,532
Scott: That is also true.

548
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:15,037
Scott: The physical security is and lock picking lawyer doesn't hide that from you.

549
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:15,238
Scott: Right.

550
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:21,266
Scott: So what this person did was even more ingenious in that, you know, when you're picking a lock normally.

551
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:21,566
Scott: Right.

552
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:22,207
Scott: You can pick.

553
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:24,310
Scott: you can figure out one pin at a time.

554
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,974
Scott: So that would be like, imagine if I had to figure out your password and I could be like, is the first letter a, how about B?

555
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:31,015
Scott: How about C?

556
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:31,496
Scott: Right.

557
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:36,599
Scott: I'd only have to guess 26 different, you know, I guess in plus numbers, plus whatever.

558
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,041
Scott: But I would get the first letter pretty quickly.

559
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:39,642
Scott: Right.

560
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:47,708
Scott: And then I've got that one locked in so I can just go to the next one and actually won't be that many guesses until I get it all right, because I can do one letter at a time.

561
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:50,270
Scott: But that's not how passwords work on a computer.

562
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,771
Scott: You have to get all.

563
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:52,852
Scott: it's either all or nothing.

564
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:55,114
Scott: You have to get everything right or you just get a wrong.

565
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:55,534
Scott: You can't.

566
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:59,037
Scott: It's not like friggin, you know, Wheel of Fortune here.

567
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:00,238
Scott: It doesn't.

568
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,198
Scott: it doesn't work like that.

569
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,903
Scott: This lock he made is basically the anti Wheel of Fortune lock.

570
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,824
Scott: You basically raise the pins.

571
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:09,505
Scott: Right.

572
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:16,150
Scott: And then you turn the lock, but they pass through a gate that's far away from where you lifted them.

573
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:21,279
Scott: So while you're doing the lifting, you can't tell if you've lifted them the right amount.

574
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:27,970
Scott: You have to lift all of them to the correct amount before they'll pass through that gate all the way to the side.

575
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,377
Scott: And there's no way that I can think of at least for you to know.

576
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,700
Scott: So you have to get them all right.

577
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,105
Scott: You can't be like got the first one, got the second one.

578
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,988
Scott: You can't do that with this lock.

579
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:38,810
Scott: Very fascinating.

580
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:45,503
Scott: You can see the struggles they go through to produce the lock, which is there's no way I don't think this can be easily mass produced.

581
00:33:45,563 --> 00:33:49,450
Scott: At least no one's someone have to make like a new kind of machine to do it or something.

582
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,433
Rym: There's a reason why a lot of the, quote, unpickable locks are bespoke.

583
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:58,380
Scott: Yeah, this is definitely bespoke, but very fascinating video here.

584
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,009
Scott: And I recommend watching at least, you know, one video about like, you know, basic normal lock functioning before watching this one.

585
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,110
Scott: It'll it'll mean a lot more.

586
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:13,985
Rym: I love watching the locksmith actually try to open this lock because he's basically just like trying to rake it, trying to bump it, like all the basic stuff.

587
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:15,730
Scott: He's doing all the things that would work on a normal lock.

588
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,996
Rym: Because most locks, like any lock in any random house, you can probably just bump key with zero problem.

589
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:28,326
Scott: Yeah, that locksmith that they call to come and pick the unpickable lock, you know, is a skilled locksmith.

590
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:31,170
Scott: Yeah, maybe not lock being lawyer level, but they know what they're doing.

591
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:48,570
Rym: So, uh, my thing of the day, this, I ran into this kind of randomly and it was, it was a topic I knew a little bit about because my grandpa, his job, like after World War, after the World War and all the nonsense, like he was back home and got a job like in the civilian community.

592
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:54,039
Rym: He worked as a typesetter at an old fashioned newspaper, the Macomb Daily.

593
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,550
Rym: So his job was literally to set the type and like do the press work for an old style newspaper.

594
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,949
Scott: Old school metal bits.

595
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,654
Rym: It was obsolete by the time I was old enough to see it in person.

596
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:16,810
Rym: And in fact, I remember he took, he and the family, like we went to the Macomb Daily ones as they were planning to shut it all down because they want to take a bunch of pictures with him because he was like the last living person who did this job.

597
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:17,790
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,892
Scott: Well, I mean, sure they switched to a digital process, right?

599
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:20,212
Rym: Oh yeah.

600
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:28,219
Rym: In fact, I remember this very like poignant moment when I was a little kid and I came home from school and I showed grandpa this essay I had written.

601
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,520
Rym: This was in like third grade.

602
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,981
Rym: I want to say maybe fourth grade.

603
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:34,124
Rym: I read it on a computer and I printed it at school.

604
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:40,249
Rym: I brought it home and I showed it to grandpa and he said that literally just put me out of a job forever.

605
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,310
Rym: That is amazing.

606
00:35:43,310 --> 00:36:00,370
Rym: But basically in the 19th century, so the 1800s, you might notice if you look at newspapers, there's a lot of ASCII art all of a sudden, even though ASCII didn't exist yet because typesetting was complicated.

607
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:15,370
Rym: And basically people started to be clever and they do things like submit a classified ad to the paper, but the type they would submit was ASCII art that would make an ad that was way bigger than the single font size they were allowed to use.

608
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,393
Rym: And it was a whole thing.

609
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:22,056
Rym: So this tweet has a bunch of like amazing examples.

610
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:24,860
Rym: Like one of them is a picture from the, what is this?

611
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,121
Rym: This is like, what year is this?

612
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:29,525
Rym: This is the December 6th, 1880 edition of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

613
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:43,730
Rym: And you go to the classifieds and there's like this giant ad in the middle of the classifieds that is composed of like 20 different smaller classified ads that all link together in a big ASCII art.

614
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,393
Rym: And there's an article I'm also going to link to.

615
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,238
Rym: that sort of gets into how and why this happened.

616
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,902
Rym: And it seems to come down to.

617
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:59,930
Rym: there was like one company, Brooklyn Furniture Company, that did it first.

618
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,736
Rym: And then everyone else was like, what?

619
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:03,980
Rym: We could do this?

620
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:07,350
Rym: And started being a giant pain in the ass to all the newspapers after that.

621
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:14,519
Rym: And it was made obsolete by this concept, which I'm not going to explain, called hot metal typesetting.

622
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,723
Rym: But it was basically, it was the next form of typesetting.

623
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:22,550
Rym: There were multiple competing versions after the like just loose like characters thing.

624
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:23,856
Scott: I don't know.

625
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:24,908
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

626
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:32,099
Rym: Basically, it meant you could have more font sizes and like it was easier to do like more complex layouts, meaning this kind of thing was obsolete.

627
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:40,130
Rym: But there was a brief time when people were making ridiculous high quality ASCII art in newspapers to game the system.

628
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,410
Rym: And it's kind of amazing.

629
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:42,749
Scott: Awesome.

630
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,165
Rym: In the meta moment, it's 2021 and guess what?

631
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:47,030
Rym: We're still stuck at home.

632
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:52,305
Scott: Well, hopefully we'll only be stuck at home for maybe half of 2021, maybe a little bit more than that.

633
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:53,696
Rym: Yep.

634
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:04,170
Scott: I'm currently, my current estimation is that two thirds of the way through the year, I've got a better than 50% shot of going outside.

635
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,733
Scott: 51%.

636
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:07,845
Scott: That's my estimation right now based on.

637
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:14,910
Rym: Because once I'm vaccinated, like I'll still wear a mask in public because I could spread it and like there's a lot of.

638
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,897
Scott: You got to get, you got to get, you got to get daddy too.

639
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:18,122
Scott: One is not enough, right?

640
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,970
Scott: I'm not, if I get the one, I'm not going.

641
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:23,250
Rym: But when I am vaccinated, as in fully vaccinated, I got the full course.

642
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,474
Scott: That's right.

643
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:26,050
Rym: I got to get number two and then I got to wait a few weeks.

644
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:32,450
Rym: But then I'm only going to get together without masks in private settings with other people who have also gotten the full course.

645
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,591
Scott: Yep.

646
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,550
Scott: And people who I trust not to be morons.

647
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,811
Scott: Yep.

648
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:37,810
Rym: And that is when ReviewCon will happen.

649
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:40,490
Scott: Yeah.

650
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:47,350
Scott: And then I think maybe it would have to be very late 2021, like maybe PAX Unplugged earliest possible.

651
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,349
Scott: And that's even a shot.

652
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:57,110
Rym: Because the problem is a convention might happen when vaccines are available and a lot of people are vaccinated.

653
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:01,050
Rym: But there's a lot of Americans who don't want to get vaccinated, which is a big problem.

654
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,890
Rym: And as a result, it will mean that we also have to wear masks to protect these idiots who refuse to get vaccinated.

655
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:15,970
Rym: But during that time period, if there's a convention and it requires masks, I wouldn't go because it's not safe to the people who are stupid and refusing to get the vaccine.

656
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,410
Rym: And also, can you imagine how much of a pain in the ass it would be to wear a mask for like an entire PAX?

657
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:22,610
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:23,273
Scott: I mean, it's not.

659
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:25,824
Scott: I mean, you know, medical people wear masks all day.

660
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,190
Scott: People work in mines and stuff.

661
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:27,651
Rym: Oh, yeah.

662
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:32,267
Rym: But if I'm like getting board gaming con rather than wear a mask all day, I'll just stay home and play board games with people.

663
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:33,290
Rym: I don't need to wear masks around.

664
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:34,331
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:39:34,512 --> 00:39:36,279
Scott: It's, you know, it's not.

666
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,670
Scott: I think it's, you know, I just don't want to make mask wearing like a big deal.

667
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,532
Scott: No, no, no.

668
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:41,540
Scott: It's like requiring masks.

669
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,370
Rym: We got to get to the point to where masks are no longer required to protect society.

670
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:48,430
Scott: But if it's so dangerous that I have to wear a mask, why would I risk going there in the first place?

671
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,269
Scott: That's the thing.

672
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,983
Rym: The first cons we go to will be cons where it is safe to attend without wearing a mask.

673
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,390
Rym: Until that time, I'm not going to any big events.

674
00:39:58,252 --> 00:39:58,435
Scott: Nope.

675
00:39:59,588 --> 00:39:59,750
Scott: Anyway.

676
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:00,263
Rym: Yeah.

677
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:10,350
Scott: So you can see if you can stay home, you can read the book club book, which is A Tale of Genji, the first novel ever written by human beings that we have not continued to read at all.

678
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,709
Rym: I'm reading more and more nonfiction right now.

679
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:14,561
Scott: I'm reading C++ book.

680
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:19,030
Rym: I'm also reading the rest of Chainsaw Man so we can review it on Wednesday.

681
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,011
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:20,856
Scott: Ooh, spoilers.

683
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,270
Scott: Wednesday episode of GeekNights, Chainsaw Man, the manga.

684
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,756
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,791
Rym: All right.

686
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:26,613
Rym: So let's get right into it.

687
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,877
Rym: There is the outages, the slag, it gave us an idea.

688
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:35,630
Rym: Now, funnily, the listener pointed out right away on the stream, they've misread the title of this episode at first as Outrages and were excited about it.

689
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,689
Scott: I don't know what tech outrages are.

690
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,620
Rym: I mean, that could be a good Thursday show.

691
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,110
Rym: The concept of outrage.

692
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,090
Rym: Things that outrage us.

693
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,369
Scott: A lot of things anyway.

694
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,269
Scott: But no, we can talk about outages in a more generic sense.

695
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:59,187
Scott: So you got your computer systems and you fuck something up and now they're just like not fucking working.

696
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:00,250
Rym: Sucks.

697
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:11,450
Rym: But it's fascinating because like this is a relatively like for normal people who do not work like in factories or in technologist places where like this is a thing.

698
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:18,161
Rym: For a long time until relatively recently, technology outages did not impact most people.

699
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:23,230
Rym: Like the impacts were very localized to like a particular business or the effects of the outages were delayed.

700
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,675
Rym: Like there'd be a big problem somewhere.

701
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,822
Rym: And as a result, my RAM is more expensive for two months.

702
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:32,610
Rym: But it was like there weren't that many people using social media.

703
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:36,118
Rym: There weren't like Netflix's and YouTube's and all these things online.

704
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:41,609
Rym: And a lot of corporations still use mostly internal or homegrown or analog solutions.

705
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:52,890
Scott: I wonder historically, I don't know historically, right, where the first outages must have been like water supply outage, like a drought or like a power outage.

706
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,158
Rym: I mean, I guess we could consider a drought an outage.

707
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:58,430
Rym: Like all the Mattawan reservoirs dry.

708
00:41:59,712 --> 00:41:59,933
Scott: Right.

709
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:03,350
Scott: But it's still like the system as just completely stopped.

710
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:12,610
Rym: A technology, a practically applied technology system used by the average citizen that is now not functioning due to an acute and temporary problem.

711
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:13,612
Scott: Right.

712
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:15,738
Scott: And, you know, you could think of an outage is like my one.

713
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:17,383
Scott: TV broke, but that's not really.

714
00:42:17,403 --> 00:42:19,349
Scott: that's just a you know, it's not big enough.

715
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:19,530
Scott: Right.

716
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,550
Scott: But like TV, like during broadcast TV days, the broadcast antennas messed up like TV is out.

717
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:32,510
Rym: I remember there were TV outages like I remember when I was a kid, like one of the local networks just went down for like three days.

718
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,978
Scott: The telephone network is not working.

719
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:36,626
Scott: You can't make a phone call right now.

720
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:37,490
Scott: It's not your fault.

721
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:48,330
Scott: Like there's an out like the whole system that applies to many people is broken in such a way that it is completely nonfunctional, not just like a little messed up.

722
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:52,625
Scott: But like it is just might as well not even exist right now until it's fixed.

723
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:53,890
Scott: Something is mad messed up.

724
00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:12,190
Rym: Now, one thing that's really changed in this space in the like the current era is that previously most systems that a normal non specialist person interacted with were designed and managed to a degree by engineers, often with regulations and certifications and rules.

725
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,598
Rym: And most Internet things have no like.

726
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:21,230
Rym: the word engineer barely applies to what that like what is done to make those systems work.

727
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:22,131
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:32,030
Scott: And that's not to say that like, you know, everyone working for like, you know, your local power utilities on the grid is some sort of, you know, genius, amazing engineer, even though many, many are.

729
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:32,871
Scott: Right.

730
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:42,969
Scott: But, you know, there's a they have all sorts of procedures and protocols and things they've learned and, you know, the things that they follow.

731
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:43,089
Rym: Right.

732
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:51,730
Rym: Like I used to work in factory automation, like I worked in a fab, like there were like very clear procedures for outages and failures of that machinery.

733
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:58,308
Scott: And since the outages are such a big deal and the system is so old, however old it is, depending on where you are.

734
00:43:58,328 --> 00:43:58,850
Scott: Right.

735
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,617
Scott: It's like they really got their shit together.

736
00:44:01,757 --> 00:44:06,590
Scott: Outages are really rare and only happen if there's like somewhat extreme circumstances.

737
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:06,891
Scott: Yeah.

738
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,663
Rym: Like trains don't crash into each other often in America and haven't for a long time.

739
00:44:10,703 --> 00:44:12,810
Rym: They're starting to again because their infrastructure is falling apart.

740
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,462
Scott: Yeah, they do too often, but once is too often.

741
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:18,530
Scott: But yeah, it's not that often.

742
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,188
Rym: And then there was remember the great Northeast power outage?

743
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:23,891
Scott: Yeah, that was.

744
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:26,298
Scott: But it's like since then, how many outages have there been?

745
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,990
Scott: I don't think I've had at least in my apartment, even during.

746
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,730
Rym: I've never lost power for even a second in the 10 years I've lived here.

747
00:44:35,312 --> 00:44:37,821
Scott: Yeah, we've lost power, I think a little bit in Beacon, I think.

748
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:40,390
Scott: But I don't think we've ever, I've never lost power.

749
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:47,490
Rym: There's a photo you took of me reading a Penny Arcade comic with the light, like I was holding up a flashlight and reading a Penny Arcade comic in the dark.

750
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,822
Scott: But yeah, in New York City, I've never had a power outage.

751
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:55,250
Scott: There have been times where the lights have flickered or like a little mu.

752
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,246
Scott: I guess that counts as a brownout, but like a one second brownout.

753
00:44:58,287 --> 00:44:58,850
Scott: That's not a big deal.

754
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:04,490
Rym: I've had a couple of localized service outages where like my router was dying, but that only affected me.

755
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,111
Scott: Oh yeah, sure.

756
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:05,573
Scott: Stuff like that.

757
00:45:05,613 --> 00:45:09,226
Scott: There have been some internet outages that they were kind of brief, even with shitty Spectrum.

758
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:10,310
Scott: I've never had one with FiOS.

759
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,582
Rym: But I guess this concept, like to talk about it in a practical way, there's a few lenses to look at.

760
00:45:15,702 --> 00:45:18,970
Rym: One lens is, are you on the inside or on the outside?

761
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:32,009
Rym: Like if you work for a power company or like Slack and something goes down, that is one lens of an outage compared to I'm some jerk trying to turn on my light and the light doesn't work because the power's out.

762
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,995
Rym: And then the other lens is, what is the scale?

763
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:39,879
Rym: Like the server that runs.

764
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:47,570
Rym: the spreadsheet stuff that you use to manage your local business only affects your business and maybe like your local customers.

765
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,449
Rym: But Slack going down affected the entire world for several hours.

766
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,194
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

767
00:45:57,256 --> 00:46:03,790
Scott: And yeah, but the point that Rym was making before, Slack doesn't have, you know, I'm sure they do have their procedures and things set up.

768
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,829
Rym: But they do not have like formal engineering practices.

769
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,810
Scott: I don't, they could, but I doubt it, right?

770
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,748
Rym: I highly doubt that.

771
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,174
Scott: I'm talking engineering.

772
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:16,130
Rym: the same way that electrical and municipal engineers have certifications and practices.

773
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:16,792
Scott: Yeah.

774
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:22,630
Scott: They're not set up in that way that the power company is, and that's why they can have a several hour outage.

775
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:31,310
Scott: They're also not a, the kind of thing where, I mean, I guess lives are sort of indirectly on the line, but not the same way that they're on the line of the hospital.

776
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:41,650
Rym: And that's why I like don't do, I don't, we're not saying that every internet service needs to have that level of formal engineering and processes and procedures, but that line is a big gray area.

777
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:49,370
Rym: And sometimes the consequences of an outage in something that you wouldn't think is consequential can be scarily broad or dangerous.

778
00:46:50,750 --> 00:47:08,650
Scott: You can also see, you know, just from what I know about tech companies is that, you know, Netflix always talks about, they have this thing called the, like the chaos monkey, where it basically randomly intentionally goes around their production infrastructure, just wreaking havoc, right?

779
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:10,112
Scott: All the time.

780
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:19,790
Scott: And then what they did is over time, they would design, you know, basically their production infrastructure to basically survive, even while the chaos monkey is running.

781
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:20,531
Scott: Right.

782
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,134
Scott: It's like they turn on the chaos monkey.

783
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:23,858
Scott: It goes and turns servers off.

784
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:26,143
Scott: It blocks network connections.

785
00:47:26,183 --> 00:47:28,728
Scott: It does all sorts of, it fills up hard drives.

786
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:29,610
Scott: It pretends like hard drives.

787
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,213
Scott: It does all sorts of ridiculous stuff.

788
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:36,384
Scott: And Netflix doesn't go down even when they're intentionally trying to make it go down with this chaos monkey.

789
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:39,370
Scott: and Netflix doesn't have a lot of outages.

790
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,530
Scott: So there do I, you know, from my, in my professional opinion, they're doing, they're doing something right over there.

791
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,991
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:49,641
Scott: You know, uh, I guess Amazon doesn't have outages either, but YouTube has outages.

793
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,124
Scott: Slack has outages.

794
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,389
Scott: Facebook has some Twitter.

795
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,198
Rym: Twitter's gone down every now and then.

796
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,469
Rym: And my instinct is always to try to go tweet about it.

797
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:58,351
Scott: Yeah.

798
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,593
Scott: Twitter used to go way down.

799
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:00,354
Scott: Remember the whale?

800
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,017
Scott: The whale is a big deal back in the day.

801
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:04,822
Scott: Twitter people nowadays don't know about the whale.

802
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:08,469
Scott: Reddit has a ton of outages.

803
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:08,970
Scott: They're awful.

804
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,154
Rym: Let's go from the inside first.

805
00:48:12,214 --> 00:48:16,024
Rym: Cause you know, this is Monday GeekNights and a lot of you are probably technologists or wannabe technologists.

806
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:18,110
Rym: Like you want to have jobs similar to what me and Scott do.

807
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:27,945
Rym: So we can, we'll go from like small scale to like large, like in your house outages all the way up to like enterprise service provider outages.

808
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,850
Rym: Cause there's like the types of concerns you have.

809
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:36,749
Rym: If you work for a company like that are radically different depending on the scale of that company's operation.

810
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:43,250
Scott: Like, I mean, you know, anything small enough to where it can wait till you get back to work is basically no big deal.

811
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:43,851
Rym: Yep.

812
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:47,016
Rym: And a lot of businesses operate that way.

813
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:52,085
Rym: Like, Oh no, the credit card processing system in our local store is down.

814
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,890
Rym: We have a backup process to charge credit cards.

815
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,310
Scott: Cash only.

816
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:55,811
Rym: Yep.

817
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:58,830
Rym: Or, or I don't know if they still require it, but for a long time.

818
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:00,969
Scott: I'll use the, I'll use the square app on my phone.

819
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:12,750
Rym: Well, I was about to say, I don't know if it's still required because I can Google it during this episode, but for a long time, businesses had to have that, uh, the old, uh, impression system to take impressions of the credit cards as a backup.

820
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:16,529
Rym: Cause they had to be able to take the credit card, even if the system was down.

821
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,454
Rym: But I don't, I think some of that got deregulated and changed over the years.

822
00:49:21,674 --> 00:49:35,610
Rym: I, I don't, I'm not an expert in that like local space, but if you work for a company like that, it really comes down to, does it impact like your job or the company's bottom line right now, or will it impact it later?

823
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:39,676
Rym: And then it's around, do you detect these problems automatically?

824
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,400
Rym: And do you know what to do to correct these kinds of problems?

825
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:48,550
Rym: And honestly, that's the kind of situation where you are probably the only technologist in that entire company.

826
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:54,369
Rym: Like small companies will have like one tech person who handles all of that.

827
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,598
Rym: So it's really in your best interest, like in those situations, you don't have to worry about all this enterprise nonsense.

828
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:09,410
Rym: You don't need like a website hosted somewhere else that'll tell like the people who might come to your submarine sandwich shop that you have an outage or anything.

829
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:17,230
Rym: You pretty much just got to come up with like processes to make sure that you are not personally woken up in the middle of the night by anything.

830
00:50:18,591 --> 00:50:19,133
Rym: And that is it.

831
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:24,090
Rym: Like that is your only goal is to not get woken up at night and never be called when you're not in the office.

832
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:37,950
Scott: When I was responsible for setting up such systems and making sure they're not down, I pretty much set them up perfectly, like handcrafted perfections that nothing would ever go wrong and nothing ever went wrong.

833
00:50:39,151 --> 00:50:43,823
Scott: Because I absolutely would not have anyone messaging me when I was not at work.

834
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:45,768
Scott: And I left at five every day.

835
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:46,390
Scott: I did it right.

836
00:50:47,670 --> 00:51:04,749
Scott: Even though we did not use all these engineering practices or whatever, we just basically relied on my knowledge of how to set it up in a way that didn't suck and trust in the things that we were using from third parties that they would be high quality and several layers of fallbacks.

837
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:14,690
Rym: Pretty much comes down to knowing where are the critical links and the thing you're responsible for and what are the things that are likely to go wrong with them.

838
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:25,490
Rym: And then you've got to have just a broad enough IT and computer science and just computing and technology knowledge to know what kinds of ways you could mitigate or detect that stuff.

839
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,902
Rym: Like, do you know how to use SNMP to like detect to like?

840
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:30,970
Rym: have your Postgres server send out a track?

841
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:32,528
Scott: You and your SNMP.

842
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:42,910
Rym: SNMP is a pretty solid protocol that shockingly just works from a lot of things, especially like operating system level problems.

843
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:48,070
Scott: Yeah, I think most people don't do SNMP directly and are using some other software.

844
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:48,732
Rym: Oh, definitely.

845
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,710
Rym: SNMP is definitely like old school nonsense at this point.

846
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,230
Scott: People will just use some monitoring package of some kind.

847
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:01,246
Rym: A lot of those monitoring packages, weirdly, aren't really set up to detect specific issues.

848
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:02,550
Rym: very well, I've found.

849
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:10,450
Rym: A lot of them are kind of half-assed or they generate a lot of metrics, but not a lot of actionable events and they're kind of noisy.

850
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,514
Scott: You get what you pay for.

851
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:12,920
Scott: It's on you, right?

852
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,009
Scott: You have to customize for your thing.

853
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:22,810
Rym: But if you're a coder, when in doubt, log everything and then figure out what kinds of log lines mean there's something you got to deal with.

854
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:31,350
Rym: And write a script that like tells VAR log messages and emails you whatever like certain lines appear and come up with a system around that.

855
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,250
Scott: That's okay.

856
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,573
Rym: Yeah.

857
00:52:35,914 --> 00:52:41,068
Rym: Then you get more like to middle level, like bigger companies, like Scott's companies, like there's a lot going on.

858
00:52:42,052 --> 00:52:42,849
Rym: There's a lot of systems.

859
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,270
Scott: There's kind of a lot going on, not really.

860
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:51,310
Rym: But there's like external customers, there's internal users of things, there's more technology infrastructure.

861
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,886
Scott: Yeah.

862
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:01,370
Scott: But yeah, you know, the biggest problem that you have usually is that, you know, depending on your, even if your company is big enough, right?

863
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,190
Scott: The resources devoted to different things might not be enough, right?

864
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:05,611
Rym: Yup.

865
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:19,990
Rym: A good rule of thumb, if you're not investing about 20-25% of like the assets you have into protecting yourself from outages and attacks, you're probably going to have a big outage at some point.

866
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:31,750
Scott: But the thing is that if you don't have outages, right, you're probably not spending a lot of time defending for them, right?

867
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:36,183
Scott: You're usually spending more of your time focusing on like making new stuff, right?

868
00:53:36,444 --> 00:53:38,510
Scott: Or adding, you know, doing other things.

869
00:53:39,491 --> 00:53:44,450
Scott: So it's like you do a good job and you're not then protecting all the things that come.

870
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:53,469
Scott: And then when an outage happens, suddenly your whole company is like, "Oh, we got to do a bunch, we got to stop what we're doing and go back and work on defending ourselves and shoring up the...".

871
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:54,011
Scott: Right?

872
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,670
Scott: It's like you wait for after the flood before you build a dam.

873
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:03,550
Rym: Which, honestly, often is the right approach if it's not going to destroy the business to have an outage.

874
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,454
Scott: Well, but that's the thing.

875
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:07,630
Scott: It usually doesn't destroy the business until it does, right?

876
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:11,630
Scott: It's like you have a flood, it didn't destroy the business, we fix it, it won't happen again.

877
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:14,870
Scott: It happened again because there was something else, we were wrong, right?

878
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,798
Scott: Okay, now it still didn't destroy the business.

879
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:18,626
Scott: Something else happened.

880
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:19,550
Scott: Okay.

881
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,148
Scott: And then the fourth time, it destroyed the business.

882
00:54:22,188 --> 00:54:22,329
Scott: Oops.

883
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,750
Rym: But this is where you get into the level to where it's not just one tech person who has to deal with everything.

884
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:32,810
Rym: There's often like development people and then separate DevOps or operations people.

885
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,789
Rym: DevOps is a relatively new concept.

886
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,086
Scott: Yeah, well, DevOps is basic.

887
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:40,890
Rym: It existed but was not called DevOps for a long time.

888
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:43,470
Rym: Big companies just called it operations, usually.

889
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:44,552
Scott: Yeah.

890
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:53,006
Scott: Well, I think what happens is you've got, you know, your IT people are mostly like set up server, make sure hard drive doesn't get full, set up network, right?

891
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:53,830
Scott: All that kind of stuff.

892
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:59,150
Rym: Monitor to see if server I'm responsible for is at max load for too long so I can go yell at somebody.

893
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:00,132
Scott: Right.

894
00:55:00,152 --> 00:55:12,330
Scott: Software people, they make a software and they make it work on a server and they configure the server, but then you have this sort of in-between like, okay, the software we wrote, you IT person who knows nothing about the software we wrote because you're an IT person.

895
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:19,549
Scott: It's your responsibility actually to make the software we wrote run on that server, but actually we could do it better than you could.

896
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,918
Scott: But it's your job though.

897
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,190
Scott: We're not doing it and we're not responsible if it goes down.

898
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,329
Rym: That was basically my job for a long time.

899
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:28,951
Scott: Yeah.

900
00:55:29,051 --> 00:55:33,330
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's sort of tough there.

901
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,250
Scott: You got to have real good communication, right?

902
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:44,170
Scott: It works better if your software, your IT people understand software or, and the problem is like for a lot of other reasons.

903
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,948
Rym: But your software people have to understand IT too.

904
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:47,225
Scott: Oh yeah.

905
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,230
Rym: So many developers like don't fucking know how to install a database.

906
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:52,752
Scott: Oh yeah.

907
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:53,776
Scott: A lot.

908
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:54,338
Scott: Yeah.

909
00:55:55,202 --> 00:56:01,130
Scott: But yeah, being a person who knows both like me, usually I'm the one who's sort of, you know, doing that between biz.

910
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:07,743
Scott: And it's like, if they just gave me that IT job, like those responsibilities, like I could just do both.

911
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:08,230
Scott: Right.

912
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,449
Scott: And I'd probably do it better than the people who are supposed to be doing it.

913
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:15,630
Scott: But I'm not letting anybody call me after five o'clock, so I'm not going to do it.

914
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:17,809
Scott: And they're not paying me more, so I'm not going to do it.

915
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,770
Rym: I used to do on-call stuff, but they paid me enough to where it was worth it for a while.

916
00:56:22,072 --> 00:56:22,796
Rym: And it was a rotation.

917
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:28,570
Rym: Like every seven weeks I had one week, or if anything crazy happened overnight, I would get notified.

918
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:34,196
Rym: But you know what I dedicated my entire working life to when I was in the office while I worked at that company?

919
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,590
Rym: Making sure that thing never fucking called me ever.

920
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:37,849
Scott: That's right.

921
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:42,088
Rym: I think I got woken up maybe 10 times ever in that entire time.

922
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,260
Scott: That's a lot of times.

923
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,969
Scott: That's a lot of times.

924
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,649
Scott: I don't think I've been woken up 10 times in my life.

925
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:47,633
Rym: Yeah.

926
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:55,630
Rym: But a lot of what that came down to was whoever your DevOps or operations people are, like that cannot be underestimated.

927
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:58,110
Rym: That's also a career that they don't tell you about in school.

928
00:56:58,575 --> 00:56:59,767
Rym: You think, "Oh, I'll be a computer

929
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:00,010
Rym: programmer.".

930
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:00,676
Scott: It didn't exist.

931
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,189
Scott: It didn't really exist so much.

932
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:09,190
Rym: Yeah, it only existed in big enterprise companies, and school guidance counselors don't even know that stuff exists.

933
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:11,137
Rym: IBM had that practice forever.

934
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:15,090
Rym: That's what I was doing at IBM in 2003.

935
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:25,610
Scott: Right, so we're talking like your job as a DevOps person is going to be stuff like install Nginx and Postgres and configure them and get the software running.

936
00:57:26,772 --> 00:57:31,510
Rym: And understand what that software does and figure out how to monitor this whole ecosystem.

937
00:57:32,811 --> 00:57:42,390
Scott: Yeah, and set up a system for it to automatically deploy to help the developers get their... We've talked about in previous episodes, like CI/CD, like actually set that up.

938
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,064
Scott: Because developers aren't setting that up.

939
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:44,629
Scott: They're just coding.

940
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:53,050
Scott: You've got to set that up for them to use the tools that they need to get their job done that aren't just on their computer.

941
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:55,130
Scott: You have to set them up on the servers.

942
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,624
Scott: They're not the developer servers.

943
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:57,190
Scott: They're your servers.

944
00:57:57,491 --> 00:58:10,770
Rym: But the key to a job like that, like to get a career that could lead more toward like what I do, is you really need to have a very broad and holistic understanding of technology to where it doesn't matter what the software is doing.

945
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,741
Rym: It doesn't matter what the OS is.

946
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,290
Rym: It doesn't matter what the hardware is.

947
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:16,130
Rym: You can Google all the fiddly details.

948
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:21,070
Rym: You need to know stuff like, "Huh, the load on a server is really high suddenly.

949
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:23,350
Rym: What are the kinds of things that could cause that?

950
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,526
Rym: What would I do to figure out what's causing

951
00:58:25,566 --> 00:58:25,808
Rym: that?".

952
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:37,430
Rym: Those soft skills are very hard to teach and usually people learn them on the job, but get very siloed and very narrowly focused and tend to assume things or problems they've seen before.

953
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:46,330
Rym: You really need to like... If you don't know what all the different directories in the file system of Linux mean, you will have a very hard time doing DevOps.

954
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:46,765
Scott: Oh yeah.

955
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:47,797
Scott: But think about it.

956
00:58:47,878 --> 00:58:48,425
Scott: I've only ever...

957
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,270
Rym: Like Docker fails.

958
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,430
Rym: Who the fuck do you look for logs to figure out why Docker's having a problem?

959
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,367
Rym: If you don't just know that, you might not know, "Oh, where does Docker

960
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:56,689
Rym: log?".

961
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:02,688
Rym: But you should know all the types of places Docker is likely to log on any given server, no matter what OS it is.

962
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:09,389
Scott: And you have to create a mental model of what your systems architectures are and know them or learn them or create them.

963
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,669
Scott: It doesn't exist.

964
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:14,630
Scott: We need these applications and you need to be able to create a systems architecture.

965
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,890
Scott: Well, I'll set up things this way and install this here and configure them this way.

966
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,749
Scott: It's like I've only ever set up in my life like a Postgres, a MySQL.

967
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,030
Scott: SQLite doesn't count, right?

968
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,470
Scott: I've never set up an Oracle in my life.

969
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,510
Scott: I've never used an Oracle.

970
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,324
Scott: I've never done a single SQL query.

971
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,750
Scott: I've never set up an Oracle.

972
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:33,710
Scott: I've never seen an Oracle.

973
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,370
Scott: I've never done a single SQL query with an Oracle server.

974
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,730
Scott: I've done my Microsoft SQL server.

975
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,749
Scott: I've never installed that.

976
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:46,807
Rym: I was using Postgres and making my own binary replication scheme with DRBD back before.

977
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:48,090
Rym: Postgres did all that for you.

978
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:54,270
Scott: But I'm saying I've done connections to Microsoft SQL, but I've never installed it.

979
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:55,728
Scott: But I've never touched Oracle.

980
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,090
Scott: I just know it's this database that exists.

981
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,561
Scott: But if someone hired me and said, "Scott, here is Oracle.

982
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:05,120
Scott: Here's the software.

983
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:05,889
Scott: Here's the license key.

984
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,928
Scott: Here's where to download it.

985
01:00:07,215 --> 01:00:07,729
Scott: It's legal.

986
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,419
Scott: We paid for

987
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:08,500
Scott: it.".

988
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:10,309
Scott: Set it up.

989
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,069
Scott: It's going to be used for X, Y, Z. I am 100% confident that I could do that job.

990
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,329
Scott: I can absolutely do it.

991
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,390
Rym: If I have an internet connection.

992
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,709
Scott: If I have an access to an internet connection.

993
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,130
Rym: We haven't mentioned RIT yet.

994
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,450
Rym: The school we both went to, the Rochester Institute of Technology.

995
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,550
Rym: But one thing, and this is relevant because I'm going to get back to an anecdote.

996
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:36,250
Rym: The one thing I can say about RIT grads that has been consistent both when we were there and in my entire career whenever I meet them professionally.

997
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:43,670
Rym: For whatever reason, RIT teaches people these broad skills that a lot of other tech schools just fucking don't.

998
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,648
Rym: And I don't know why.

999
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:47,510
Scott: Did they really teach me those broad skills?

1000
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,410
Rym: Well, I don't think RIT taught it.

1001
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:53,130
Rym: I think it was the co-ops coupled with the kind of vague lesson plans.

1002
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,208
Scott: I learned a co-op.

1003
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:58,450
Scott: I think I learned most of that stuff just by most of that stuff.

1004
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:04,210
Scott: I learned because I would mess around trying to set up my own web server.

1005
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:10,530
Scott: And I ran Linux as my primary OS during the time period where that made sense to do.

1006
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,810
Rym: Making that Counter Strike server work like the real one we ran.

1007
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,350
Rym: I learned a lot making that work.

1008
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:16,310
Rym: I had it monitored.

1009
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,069
Scott: Setting up DNS in our house.

1010
01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:23,290
Scott: Doing that, it's like the stuff you do at a company is basically the same only bigger.

1011
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:27,690
Rym: I wonder if it's partly that RIT, there's this culture of that.

1012
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,424
Rym: Especially in IT more so than CS.

1013
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:32,930
Rym: A lot of our classes would have a class that was worthless.

1014
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,809
Rym: Like, oh, if you don't know what Active Directory is, we're going to teach you and it's going to be terrifying and boring and most of you are going to skip it.

1015
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:43,950
Rym: But then the class was graded in a lab where the lab was, by the end of the quarter, we're going to come into this room.

1016
01:01:44,491 --> 01:01:51,830
Rym: And in this room, across these five PCs you have access to, you have to run these ten services providing these forty different capabilities.

1017
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:53,069
Scott: I didn't have that.

1018
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,668
Rym: And then hackers are going to attack it and it's got to stay mostly up.

1019
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,290
Rym: Like, those are the kinds of classes we had.

1020
01:01:58,431 --> 01:01:59,790
Scott: That class I had, the hacking class.

1021
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,189
Rym: That class was super fucking fun.

1022
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:07,150
Rym: But anyway, I was on defense and they actually forced us to install old versions of stuff because otherwise no one could hack in.

1023
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:12,030
Scott: I was on offense and there was a message, because that lab wasn't connected to the internet.

1024
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:18,470
Scott: And there was basically, I read a news on Slashtide that talked about a vulnerability in Microsoft Messenger, MSN Messenger.

1025
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:23,090
Scott: So I basically downloaded the files for it onto floppy disk, three and a half inch.

1026
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:28,550
Scott: And I went to that lab and sure enough, I could open Microsoft Messenger, right?

1027
01:02:28,931 --> 01:02:34,049
Scott: And I had the patch, like the patched version, I was able to try applying the patch to the EXE.

1028
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:39,910
Scott: But the problem was that because the lab didn't have an internet connection, I couldn't log in to the MSN Messenger.

1029
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:46,150
Scott: But it's like, if I could have, it absolutely would have worked because I tested it at home first.

1030
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:51,928
Scott: And I would have just, if I ran it at home, I was able to open up a root CMD, you know.

1031
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:58,470
Rym: But it forced this fundamental understanding of how to make basic things work on any kind of computer.

1032
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:04,736
Rym: So when I got my first co-op at IBM, one of the first things they did is they were like, "All right, we have a problem you can help us with.

1033
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:09,370
Rym: Here is all the installation media for some fucking ancient version of WebSphere.

1034
01:03:10,451 --> 01:03:14,147
Rym: Get it working on this server and deploy this Java application to

1035
01:03:14,247 --> 01:03:14,287
Rym: it.".

1036
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:16,610
Scott: We ain't even talking about outages anymore.

1037
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:29,890
Rym: But I guess the point is being able to do that kind of thing holistically will make you like a top tier DevOps person who can handle pretty much any outage that gets thrown at you.

1038
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:33,403
Scott: All right, one off-way topic, but let's have one last thing I want to talk about.

1039
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:34,890
Scott: the outages, right?

1040
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,542
Scott: Is when there is an outage, right?

1041
01:03:37,562 --> 01:03:39,090
Scott: You know, how do you deal with it, right?

1042
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:47,353
Scott: And then how do you not only deal with it in terms of fixing it, but also deal with it in communicating with the people who- Yeah, that's a good topic.

1043
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:50,406
Rym: Question one, can you fix it before anyone notices?

1044
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:51,470
Rym: Ask that first.

1045
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:52,648
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1046
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,922
Rym: Because if you can fix it and no one notices, you fucking win.

1047
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:57,287
Rym: That is like winning your job.

1048
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,379
Scott: If no one notices, there wasn't an outage.

1049
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,450
Scott: If a tree falls in the woods, no one heard it.

1050
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:02,680
Scott: Yep.

1051
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:06,870
Scott: Okay, so you had an outage and someone noticed, right?

1052
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,193
Rym: Well, I'd say point two.

1053
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:15,790
Rym: If you have an outage and you think people are going to notice, can you at least tell them before they tell you?

1054
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:18,170
Scott: That's also a good thing to do, yeah.

1055
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:22,150
Rym: If your user knows there's an outage and you don't, that is a big problem.

1056
01:04:22,957 --> 01:04:23,390
Scott: Like today?

1057
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:24,208
Rym: Yep.

1058
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:29,562
Scott: Okay, so next thing, right?

1059
01:04:29,602 --> 01:04:30,266
Scott: So what do you do?

1060
01:04:30,306 --> 01:04:31,170
Scott: You got to fix it, right?

1061
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:38,150
Scott: So you got to figure out which area the problem is in, because like we talked about, IT people, software people, devops people.

1062
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,858
Scott: One or more of them is going to be the ones to call.

1063
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,688
Scott: If it's full hard drive, your software person is going to be like, "I didn't do shit about

1064
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:43,869
Scott: that.".

1065
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:49,850
Scott: And if it's bugging the code, IT person can't fix that no matter how much resources you give them.

1066
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,640
Scott: They need the software person to figure that out.

1067
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,789
Scott: But you might not realize that's what it is.

1068
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,970
Scott: So you need to sort of get everyone to take a look and see if they're the problem.

1069
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:13,490
Rym: Unless you're above a certain scale where that is a waste of everyone's time, you, if you're a devops person, should have figured out a triage process to where it's very easy to narrow down what the most likely problems are.

1070
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:15,609
Rym: So you can stop wasting your time looking everywhere else.

1071
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:18,350
Scott: Yeah, you know, that's definitely good.

1072
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:23,690
Rym: But it's really hard to, like, that's a hard skill to teach, because it really requires that holistic knowledge I was talking about.

1073
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,350
Scott: Especially since things that first appear to be one thing could be another thing.

1074
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:36,210
Scott: And the better your systems are set up, when there is a problem, the harder it's going to be to figure out what the hell it is, because you rule out so many things that you're defended against.

1075
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:55,750
Rym: And you can tell devops people and operations people who never got that sort of formal or at least holistic education in technology, but only learned on the job, because they will persist in trying to say the problem is something that they've seen before without, like, understanding why it could not be the problem.

1076
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,170
Rym: You'll see that a lot, especially in enterprise.

1077
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:05,530
Scott: Yeah, you can usually, figuring out what the cause of the problems is very similar to figuring out problems with, like, your local computer.

1078
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:14,227
Scott: Like, using process of elimination, understanding how things connect to each other, saying, "Oh, well, I'm getting an image on the monitor, so the video card is

1079
01:06:14,348 --> 01:06:14,749
Scott: working.".

1080
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:15,771
Scott: Right?

1081
01:06:16,535 --> 01:06:18,745
Scott: But it could be, "Let me try the monitor on a different

1082
01:06:18,765 --> 01:06:19,308
Scott: computer.".

1083
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:19,730
Scott: Right?

1084
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:25,630
Scott: That same thinking process is the same thing that you use to figure out what's causing the outage.

1085
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:35,010
Rym: The important server that's having a problem has a link light, like, I'm looking at it, and there's a link light, even though no one can connect to it, and it's powered on, so at least some of the circuitry in there is working.

1086
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,504
Scott: It's got to be in a higher level of the OSI model.

1087
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:39,710
Scott: It's not in the hardware layer.

1088
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,599
Rym: Yep, but see what you just said, the OSI model.

1089
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:45,530
Rym: That is foundational, broad knowledge of computing.

1090
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:56,790
Scott: You have to have a model of the system's architecture in your brain, just like you have to have a model of a working PC in your brain to be able to use the process of elimination.

1091
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:07,490
Rym: I still remember when I worked at Pipeline, we had 23 demons, mostly written in C, that did the things, and I still know, like, the path of data through all these different demons.

1092
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:17,890
Scott: Usually the hardest problems to solve are when your mental model is at a certain abstraction layer, and the actual problem is beneath, right?

1093
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:22,637
Scott: So it's like, okay, I understand how this, you know, program works, right?

1094
01:07:22,677 --> 01:07:30,950
Scott: It's written in, like, Python or something, and the actual problem is in, like, C library that you're importing or some shit.

1095
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:31,565
Scott: Yep.

1096
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,821
Scott: You're not thinking on that level, right?

1097
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,089
Scott: You're thinking of this, like, blob.

1098
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:37,032
Rym: Or, like, networking.

1099
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:47,251
Rym: You're thinking, alright, IP addresses, routers, all that stuff you know, but there could be a problem of a mismatch in your physical network between Ethernet 2 and 802.11.3.

1100
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:49,802
Scott: Yeah, it's like, all my IP addresses are right, what's wrong?

1101
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:51,770
Scott: Two things have the same MAC address, baby.

1102
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,809
Scott: So you didn't know how that happened.

1103
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:56,149
Rym: Someone fucked around, or you got...

1104
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:58,589
Scott: Very, very, very unlikely for that to happen.

1105
01:07:59,512 --> 01:08:02,550
Rym: Unless someone fucked around with cloning or something.

1106
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:03,849
Scott: They found out.

1107
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:08,896
Scott: Okay, so now, you got the outage, right?

1108
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:11,523
Scott: You know you got people on it, they're fixing it, right?

1109
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:13,889
Scott: You're gonna do the best you can to fix it.

1110
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:23,250
Scott: Hopefully, you have backups, so worst case... Outage means you lose time, you might lose money, but if you lose data, that is the worst, right?

1111
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:32,010
Scott: You cannot lose data, you gotta have the backups, even if you're out for days, if you still have the data, it's like, thank god, right?

1112
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:39,889
Scott: If YouTube goes down and comes back, okay, if YouTube goes down and comes back, and half the videos are gone forever, just shut it all down, that's it, it's done.

1113
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:50,529
Rym: And I think we did an episode on disaster recovery, which includes such things as starting your business back up in an entirely new physical location because literally everything burned down.

1114
01:08:50,930 --> 01:09:00,790
Scott: But the data is the thing, as long as you save the data, everything else can be redone eventually, even if it sucks and you go out of business in the meantime.

1115
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:04,109
Scott: Do not lose the data, that is always number one.

1116
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:06,502
Scott: Alright, so coming back, right?

1117
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,350
Scott: What do you tell people?

1118
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:13,270
Scott: First of all, you gotta be honest with the customer, whoever the client, or whoever it is.

1119
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:16,510
Scott: You don't wanna be like, oh no, everything's just fine, problem must be on your end.

1120
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:22,270
Scott: No, don't do that, that just makes people, 'cause they know you're bullshitting, they can tell you're bullshitting right away, they got Twitter.

1121
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:34,729
Rym: So, in my experience, once you get way up this chag to big enterprise companies, usually what happens is both sides will bullshit and say the other side is at fault, and ask them to prove it's not them, because they're still trying to figure out the cause of the outage.

1122
01:09:36,156 --> 01:09:36,729
Rym: I say that a lot.

1123
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:41,729
Scott: That's fine, if you don't know the cause, if it could be someone else, then don't admit it's you.

1124
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:48,510
Rym: But if you know there's an outage, be honest and tell all the people who could be impacted in the most succinct way possible as soon as possible.

1125
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:54,990
Scott: And tell them the truth about how they will be impacted, so that they can make appropriate plans.

1126
01:09:55,310 --> 01:10:05,270
Scott: So like, if you're gonna be down for hours, you gotta say, hey, we're gonna be down for quite a while, you might wanna do X, Y, Z, 'cause we're not gonna be available.

1127
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:16,330
Rym: Stock exchanges will do that, a stock exchange might go down and officially announce to the market, sorry, we're fucked, please send orders elsewhere for the rest of today, we cannot deal with you, we're done, we're down, sorry.

1128
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,990
Rym: We'll be back up tomorrow.

1129
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:30,970
Scott: If you have, like I just said, the worst case, if you lost the data, you just gotta fess up and say you lost the data and give them all your money, give them money to replace the data, you fucked up.

1130
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:46,670
Rym: Yup, and this is where you run into like big company stuff of SLAs, service level agreements, you might have customers where you sign contracts guaranteeing certain amounts of uptime, clawbacks where a client can literally get refunds from you or cash payments for outages.

1131
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:58,570
Rym: Like, it gets really messy in a hurry, this is why business people get involved, you know, there's always like that VP who keeps calling into the line when there's an outage and they're always like, can I get a status, what's going on, have you fixed it yet?

1132
01:10:59,731 --> 01:11:03,244
Scott: Yup, they're nervous about the wallet, if you're out too long, they lose money.

1133
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:10,408
Rym: So back to the Slack outage, their website said that it was a localized partial outage for a long time.

1134
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:11,990
Rym: It sure did.

1135
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,589
Rym: While Twitter said it was completely down.

1136
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:18,470
Scott: It's 100% down for everybody in the universe.

1137
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,430
Rym: But at the same time, it did come back up pretty quickly.

1138
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,670
Scott: After hours, hours is not good.

1139
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:28,649
Scott: Minutes is eh, right?

1140
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,649
Scott: Many minutes is bad.

1141
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,308
Scott: Hours is real bad.

1142
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,370
Scott: Frontrecruit.com doesn't go down for hours.

1143
01:11:36,412 --> 01:11:39,010
Scott: It's when I'm sleeping and then as soon as I wake up, it just takes a few minutes.

1144
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:46,310
Rym: Yup, I mean, our process is basically, I'll be like, I'll just message Scott and be like, hey, I think the database is broken.

1145
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,709
Scott: We have better uptime than Slack.

1146
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:53,490
Rym: Actually, for the 15 plus years we've been doing GeekNights, we got pretty good uptime.

1147
01:11:54,055 --> 01:11:55,590
Scott: And I've never lost data ever.

1148
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:56,327
Scott: Not once.

1149
01:11:59,076 --> 01:12:00,570
Scott: And that's just one person operation.

1150
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:01,667
Scott: So what excuse do you have?

1151
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,370
Rym: But that's it.

1152
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:13,690
Rym: It comes down to honesty, openness, problem solving skills, and a holistic understanding of your technology and technology overall.

1153
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:15,226
Scott: And promptness.

1154
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,930
Scott: Don't be delaying.

1155
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:18,938
Rym: And then when you do fix it, right?

1156
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,750
Scott: Tell everyone what the fuck happened.

1157
01:12:25,394 --> 01:12:26,530
Scott: The technological details.

1158
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,949
Scott: Because even though most people...

1159
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,130
Rym: The post-mortem, we don't have time to talk about that.

1160
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:34,990
Scott: Yeah, you gotta write one and make it available to everyone who knew about the outage.

1161
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:39,590
Rym: And if you're a big company like Netflix or Slack, I'd love for there to be a little more openness.

1162
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:42,249
Scott: They usually are pretty open.

1163
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,590
Rym: They usually are, but not always.

1164
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:43,872
Scott: That's like.

1165
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,030
Scott: the only thing that they're kinda open and good with is the post-mortems on the outages.

1166
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:54,070
Scott: Because those are great for not only customers to see that you're not bullshitting, to see exactly what went wrong.

1167
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:56,626
Scott: They can have their tech people look at it and go, "Mmm, mmm, mmm,

1168
01:12:56,646 --> 01:12:56,908
Scott: okay.".

1169
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:01,270
Scott: And then everyone else can learn and not fuck up the same way.

1170
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:01,571
Rym: That's it.

1171
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:06,010
Rym: You're adding to the body of human knowledge so someone can Google for a weird outage.

1172
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:09,829
Rym: Find your post-mortem because they pasted a log line that happens to be yours.

1173
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:13,070
Scott: You go online, there are places that collect all these.

1174
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,446
Scott: You can go read them and learn how people have fucked up.

1175
01:13:16,466 --> 01:13:17,270
Scott: so you don't do it the same way.

1176
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,910
Rym: I have written so many post-mortems over the years.

1177
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,207
Rym: That's been one of my jobs.

1178
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,329
Scott: Yeah, you know.

1179
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:27,730
Scott: We don't usually write them because, A, we don't have that many outages, really, of any significance.

1180
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:30,888
Scott: And also the only users are internal, so it's like they don't care.

1181
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:32,590
Scott: There's no technological audience for outages.

1182
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:39,408
Rym: Also, our systems are so federated to where there's like five different ways to download GeekNights if any one of them is down at any given time.

1183
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,950
Scott: Oh, for GeekNights, I basically tell people.

1184
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:46,288
Scott: I just tweet or something and be like, "Yeah, we're down because of this,".

1185
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:46,670
Scott: or whatever.

1186
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:57,130
Rym: And capital markets, there are industries where some of this stuff does not apply because there are laws, regulations, rules, and governments involved that make things weird.

1187
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:01,769
Rym: That's the asterisk for, "But, but, but, I work for a military

1188
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:02,010
Rym: country."

01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,016
Rym: Like, yeah, dude, I know.

1190
01:14:03,036 --> 01:14:03,962
Rym: I know what that's like.

1191
01:14:04,726 --> 01:14:05,229
Rym: I've been there.

1192
01:14:07,035 --> 01:14:07,598
Scott: Alright, I'm hungry.

1193
01:14:08,643 --> 01:14:09,527
Scott: I'm gonna have a stomach outage.

1194
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,400

1197
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,880

1200
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,399
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1201
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,600
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1202
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:59,360
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this 2021 episode of the GeekNights Podcast are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Link, EG, Graham Finch, You Hold the Key to My Heart.

Rym: Stay safe out there.

1206
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:24,379
Rym: Get the vaccine as soon as you can.

1207
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:31,680
Rym: Hopefully we'll see you at a convention at some point once enough people are vaccinated and this horrible nightmare comes to some sort of conclusion.

1208
01:15:32,162 --> 01:15:34,394
Rym: But for now, I leave you with...
