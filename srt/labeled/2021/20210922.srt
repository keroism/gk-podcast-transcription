00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,538
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 22nd, 2021.

2
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:08,719
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:12,650
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,936
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:16,689
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about those anime magazines you all forgot about.

6
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,730
Scott: Comic magazines, too.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,849
Rym: Also comic magazines.

8
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:22,483
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:28,210
Scott: So today, I did something that I haven't done in almost two years.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,142
Rym: Almost two years.

11
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,930
Rym: Alright, so something involving the pre-COVID world.

12
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:39,349
Scott: Yeah, I went to my office where my employer rents office space.

13
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:45,650
Rym: I was actually at my office today, but I go in like once every other week-ish, maybe.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,836
Scott: I hadn't been there and I'm not going back there.

15
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:51,028
Scott: It's unlikely I'll go back there ever, question mark?

16
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:51,650
Scott: Who knows?

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,829
Scott: So I went there because apparently there were some people coming in.

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:12,150
Scott: I don't know how many, but when I was there, I saw on these two floors and on the bottom floor where I worked, there were two human beings that I saw.

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,770
Scott: One was eating and one was working on this giant office floor with many, many desks.

20
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:24,750
Scott: But I guess they had some people coming in and they wanted to clear out desks that hadn't been used.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,670
Scott: Because my stuff had just been sitting there like a little Scott Museum.

22
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,495
Rym: Oh, we're doing something similar.

23
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:34,650
Rym: People who haven't used their desk in a long time are getting moved to less great locations, it looks like.

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,968
Scott: Right, so they put my stuff into boxes into a closet, I guess, and I said, "Alright, I guess I'll come get

25
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:39,048
Scott: it.".

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,470
Scott: So I went there and I didn't see the person who boxed them up, the office managing person.

27
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,287
Scott: She was just like, "Yeah, I left your boxes in the kitchen area on that floor.

28
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:50,608
Scott: Go get

29
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:50,749
Scott: them.".

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,130
Scott: And smartly, I brought some FreshDirect bags with me because carrying boxes on the subway sucks.

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:05,890
Rym: I love how everyone in New York City has like 50 FreshDirect bags that we're using for all these kinds of tasks.

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,688
Scott: The IKEA bag would also have worked.

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,157
Rym: Yeah, but the FreshDirect bag, how often do you go to IKEA?

34
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:12,270
Rym: I've got so many FreshDirect bags, even considering how many we donated.

35
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:17,350
Scott: So yeah, I was able to add handles to the boxes and bring them home.

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,550
Scott: But the thing is, now that they're home, it's like, "Aw shit, I remember all the things now that I see the things.

37
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:31,484
Scott: I remember all these things, but I did not remember having all these fucking things.

38
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:32,687
Scott: I have no use for these things at

39
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:32,968
Scott: home.".

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,248
Rym: Yup, it's like, "Let's see, what do I got at my

41
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:35,410
Rym: desk?".

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,204
Scott: "I've got so much garbage

43
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:36,469
Scott: here.".

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,329
Rym: "I got a Goomba, I got a couple of plaques, I got a bunch of

45
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:41,550
Rym: packs.".

46
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,157
Rym: You know what the saddest thing is?

47
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:46,069
Rym: You know what's actually in my desk, like in my drawer right now?

48
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:53,750
Rym: The Marantz, the microphones, and basically a lot of the shit that I brought to PAX East right before COVID.

49
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:59,430
Scott: I mean, you know, tchotchkes are one thing, but I had a pair of shoes that were like the office-only shoes.

50
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:02,745
Rym: My office-only shoes are in my desk next to the Marantz.

51
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:03,850
Rym: Well, one of the Marantz's.

52
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,238
Scott: I got a salad bowl for the salad lunch place.

53
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,990
Scott: There was a whole very light hoodie thing that I forgot I had.

54
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,330
Rym: So when I went in today, I wore a jacket, like a sport jacket.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,930
Rym: When I got to work, an identical sport jacket that I'd left there was sitting, like hanging over the back of my chair.

56
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,910
Rym: Because I'd left it there at some point in the past, so now I have two jackets hanging over that chair that are actually the same jacket.

57
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,181
Scott: Uh, yeah.

58
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:42,140
Scott: So, there was so much junk there, and I don't need all this junk, so we're gonna bring back the segment, second dibs.

59
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,040
Scott: Here we go, you ready?

60
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:49,739
Scott: So, I have for you today, if you're watching our stream on YouTube, you can see it.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,705
Scott: A keyboard!

62
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:55,120
Scott: Because obviously I wasn't gonna use whatever shitty keyboard work gave me, right?

63
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:56,040
Scott: That looks like a nice keyboard.

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,204
Scott: Some Dell garbage, right?

65
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:01,874
Scott: So, this keyboard I bought in the year 2015.

66
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,100
Scott: It is a six-year-old keyboard.

67
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,610
Scott: It is identical to the keyboard on my desk.

68
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,780
Scott: I bought a second one of these, that's how much I liked it.

69
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:15,316
Scott: It's a code WASD, it's a code keyboard by WASD keyboards, model V2B.

70
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,019
Scott: It is a USB keyboard.

71
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:22,579
Scott: It has the completely normal key layout with a numpad, nothing strange about it.

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,840
Scott: The keys, the switches in this one are a Cherry MX Clear switches.

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,849
Scott: The ones in the one on my desk are brown switches.

74
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:37,280
Scott: I tested them, and I prefer the brown, so the clear one's gonna go.

75
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,485
Rym: I use brown at work.

76
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:39,631
Rym: I like brown.

77
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:40,977
Rym: I mean, I prefer blue, ideally.

78
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,340
Scott: I had the clear ones at work, and then I bought the brown ones for home, and I think I do prefer the brown.

79
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,291
Rym: What's the deal with the clear ones?

80
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,399
Rym: I actually forget which one that is.

81
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,400
Scott: It's basically the same as brown, only I think that the strength is different.

82
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:54,752
Rym: Okay, okay.

83
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:55,200
Rym: Anyway.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,900
Scott: They feel a little mushier and less clicky than the brown one.

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,671
Rym: Oh yeah, the clickier the better.

86
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:00,039
Rym: That's why I like blue and black the most.

87
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Scott: Well, I mean, I like blue the most, except for the noise, otherwise I would get blue.

88
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:09,700
Rym: I just live with the noise, but to my credit, I did not get blue at work, because I feel like someone would have killed me.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,640
Scott: Yeah, so the other thing, this keyboard has a bunch of dip switches on the back for various settings.

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Scott: So my favorite setting is the one that lets you turn the cap slot key in hardware into control or command or whatever, so that way you don't need to mess around.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Scott: On Windows, you still need to do some registry editing to remap the key, but you just remap it in hardware, it'll just work.

92
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:36,600
Scott: You can also do other things like flip your alt and windows keys, things of that nature, you know.

93
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,479
Scott: It's a micro USB keyboard, you get a cable, it comes with a cable, and I have it here for you.

94
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,680
Scott: And micro USB goes into the keyboard, and the other end is whatever you want, probably regular USB.

95
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,990
Scott: It's a keyboard, it types, it's working perfectly.

96
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,581
Scott: However, the only thing is, it is from 2015.

97
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:09,460
Scott: So the keys are the original, the key caps are the original ABS key caps, and they've been A, sitting in an office, and B, were touched by my grubby hands for years and years.

98
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:12,734
Scott: So they're all shiny and kind of gross.

99
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:13,960
Rym: You can clean them.

100
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,040
Rym: Yeah, that shininess, you just got to live with it.

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:27,600
Scott: You can clean them if you want to, but what I recommend you do is get this keyboard from me, and then go online and do what I did to my other keyboard, the one I have at home right here.

102
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:38,480
Scott: And buy some PBT key caps, right, made of the different plastic, not the ABS plastic, and they'll never get shiny, and they have that nice texture to them.

103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,000
Scott: And I'll give you the keyboard, the key cap swapping tool also, because I have a whole pile of them.

104
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Scott: So you can swap all the keys on it really easily, just go online and find any, you know, Cherry MX compatible key cap set for a 104 key keyboard with the colors that match your preference that are made of PBT.

105
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:04,800
Scott: Oh, and the keyboard has a backlight, so you want to get some double shot ones, that way the light will shine through the lettering on the keys, right.

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,880
Scott: If you don't get a double shot one, the lights will sort of be like, because there's a little LED in every single key.

107
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:17,260
Scott: So if you don't get double shot keys, the light will be really meh, you're sort of wasting it, right.

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,520
Scott: So yeah, this keyboard available, I don't know, I guess, you know, if really no one wants it, it could be free.

109
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,280
Scott: But actually, you know, it costs a lot of money to buy it, you know, also for some amount of money, like what, you know, how much did this thing fucking cost me?

110
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,363
Scott: I don't even know.

111
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:38,880
Rym: I don't think, especially with COVID getting in my way, like, I kind of forget what things cost because I own everything I need.

112
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,942
Scott: Okay, so in the year 2015, it cost $170.

113
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,040
Rym: That's a lot more than I paid for my fancy keyboard.

114
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:47,707
Scott: Well, that was with, that was with tax.

115
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:50,440
Scott: Let's see what they charge for them brand new at the WASD website.

116
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,520
Scott: Let's see, WASD keyboards, mechanical keyboards.

117
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,279
Rym: Alright, look at what my keyboard costs now.

118
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,200
Scott: Yeah, they charge like a hundred, they still charge $185 for the equivalent, the current model of this keyboard, so.

119
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,120
Rym: Alright, the new DOS keyboards are around the same amount of money, it looks like.

120
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:12,061
Scott: Yeah, okay, okay, and actually they're charging, oh, that's without, without keycaps, they're charging $130.

121
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,968
Rym: Though mine, the keyboard I own was only $120, so, Mr.

122
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,735
Rym: La-Dee-Da with his fancy keyboard.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,757
Scott: Well, I don't need, I don't need the money that badly, and this is also really old and used, so, I mean, what, $50, right?

124
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,807
Scott: Maybe $70 at the most, something like that.

125
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,980
Scott: If you need a mechanical keyboard, you know, come contact me.

126
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,500
Rym: Alright, so a little bit of news.

127
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,539
Scott: And I got, I got a lot more junk here to get rid of too, we'll see about that in the future.

128
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:43,559
Scott: Oh, and the listener who took the monitor from last time seemed to be very happy with it, so, this is a good program.

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,360
Rym: The problem is the things I want to give away are too low quality.

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,200
Scott: Yeah, I got, I got low quality things to give away, but most of them I gave away on Facebook Marketplace.

131
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:04,820
Scott: Someone came yesterday and got my, the ethernet cable that used to connect from in my bedroom at Beacon, all the way down the hallway, all the way across the hallway, all the way over to the cable.

132
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:05,999
Rym: I remember that ethernet cable.

133
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,219
Scott: The mega long, beat up ethernet cable, like, it still worked, I tested it.

134
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,128
Scott: I don't know how long it was, ridiculously long.

135
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,640
Scott: Someone came and took it for free, I'm like, here you go, they were very happy.

136
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:39,737
Rym: Alright, so, before we get to some news, I got a little geek bite, because I continue to watch a lot of cartoons that Scott doesn't watch, and other than, you know, Rick and Morty we'll all talk about in another show, like, now that I had a big finale and changed everything up, and pissed off all the fanboys, but Star Trek Lower Decks, I finally watched some of this show, and what I got to say about it is, if you're not a fan of Star Trek, I have

137
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:40,280
Scott: no idea.

138
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,839
Scott: Oh, it's not a pirate, I thought, when you said Lower Decks, I was like, oh, I thought it was a pirate show.

139
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:56,020
Rym: No, it is, so it's literally, you know, you've seen some Star Trek, and I don't really like Star Trek, but it's always focused on, like, the important ship, and the officers running the important ship, like, it's always the big bucky mucks.

140
00:09:56,522 --> 00:10:00,838
Scott: And this is basically on an important ship, but it's focused on people who die.

141
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:14,400
Rym: This is on, like, the second tier ship, like, the ship that comes in after first contact to literally deal with the follow-up to first contact, like, that kind of thing, like, boldly going where the Enterprise just went.

142
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,780
Scott: Oh, so it's not even the same ship, it's, like, another ship.

143
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,080
Rym: Yeah, well, also, you realize all the Star Treks are, like, completely different ships, one of them is not even on a ship, it's not a space station, like...

144
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:25,619
Scott: Yeah, I know.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:41,460
Rym: Okay, so anyway, this show is about, like, the low-ranking, like, grunts just, like, sleeping in hallways and, like, doing the normal job, but it fits all of that pretty well within the canon of Star Trek, which is actually pretty interesting.

146
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,359
Rym: So, the way that you...

147
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,040
Scott: 'Cause I'm about to ask, like, I know enough about Star Trek to know that it's basically space, communism, paradise, utopia.

148
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:49,478
Scott: It is.

149
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:54,180
Scott: Why would you take that job if you were a human being and not, like, a robot?

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,154
Rym: Because those jobs still require extreme skill.

151
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:58,058
Rym: Think like, uh...

152
00:10:58,421 --> 00:10:59,399
Scott: But why would you want it?

153
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,454
Scott: That answer is why they need it, it's not.

154
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,340
Scott: why would you do it.

155
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,250
Rym: Well, the same reason.

156
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,019
Rym: why would someone...

157
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,020
Scott: You could just live in space communist utopia on Earth.

158
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,080
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, if you've watched Star Trek, the answer to that question is just the same as the answer in They Were Eleven.

159
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:16,340
Rym: Most people just live in space communism, no give a shit.

160
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Rym: The people who are bored with that are the people who joined Starfleet.

161
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,740
Scott: Right, if I was bored with it, it would make sense why I would be Captain Picard or whatever.

162
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,080
Rym: Yeah, how do you think Captain Picard got there?

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,260
Scott: Why I would be in the engine room on the Enterprise, why would I want to do that?

164
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,860
Rym: 'Cause everyone at the top goes through all of that to learn how the fuck everything works along the way.

165
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Rym: The lowest-ranking Starfleet officer is still the best of the best of the best of the best.

166
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,500
Scott: But if you're just gonna die before you can be Captain Picard...

167
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,040
Rym: They don't die, the red shirt thing was mostly the original show.

168
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,998
Rym: There is not a high body count in like...

169
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
Scott: Space is very dangerous.

170
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,780
Rym: Yeah, and also they have a lot of technology.

171
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,858
Rym: Anyway, the way the show progresses is it both...

172
00:11:59,182 --> 00:11:59,539
Scott: Earth safe.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,540
Rym: It makes fun of Star Trek canon pretty directly.

174
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:09,740
Rym: It's full of references that anyone who's watched the existing canon of Star Trek will get, understand, and appreciate.

175
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,380
Rym: It is earnestly funny.

176
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,700
Rym: But it also fits pretty well into the canon of Star Trek.

177
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,480
Rym: It looks like they're taking great pains to not break any of the canon.

178
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,660
Rym: So where this show plausibly is in the same universe as Next Generation or Voyager or whatever.

179
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,292
Scott: But if you're not a Star Trek fan, it's gonna be a miss.

180
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:29,774
Scott: You won't get it.

181
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,920
Rym: I feel like if you're not a Star Trek fan, but you're a fan of science fiction comedy... I think you would still find the show engaging and funny.

182
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:43,060
Rym: I think the jokes... Kind of like we talked about Spider-Man on another show.

183
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:47,820
Rym: Most people in America at least have a passing understanding of Star Trek.

184
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,620
Rym: So that if they watch this, they'll get enough of it to where it'll still be funny and make sense.

185
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,480
Scott: You just won't get the inside inside jokes?

186
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,400
Rym: Yeah, you won't get the inside jokes.

187
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,524
Rym: You won't really get.

188
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:02,640
Rym: the fact that someone says they're serving on the Voyager is really funny.

189
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,858
Rym: But you'll get like, "Yeah, that's probably the name of a

190
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,099
Rym: ship.".

191
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,956
Rym: "Wasn't that the ship in that other show I didn't watch or I heard

192
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:09,117
Rym: of?".

193
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,329
Rym: But the voice acting is funny.

194
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,535
Rym: It's really rapid fire.

195
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:13,440
Rym: There's a lot of characters.

196
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,299
Rym: And it seems like it's got a good thing going on.

197
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:19,800
Rym: I would recommend it if you even passingly enjoy Star Trek.

198
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,569
Rym: The humor is also quite dark.

199
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:25,059
Rym: And I appreciate that.

200
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:36,860
Rym: So in some other big anime news that we just haven't had a chance to talk about yet... There's a live-action Cowboy Bebop that is actually happening.

201
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,020
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know if this qualifies as anime news because it's not anime.

202
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:42,386
Scott: It's not animated.

203
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,200
Scott: It's a live-action TV show that Netflix is making.

204
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,579
Scott: It just happens to be an adaptation of Cowboy Bebop.

205
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,007
Scott: Now usually, I'd say 99.99% of the time, the thing I say is like, "Why?

206
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:52,648
Scott: Why does this need to be

207
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:52,929
Scott: done?".

208
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:02,437
Scott: You can just show Cowboy Bebop, "Why do you need to remake

209
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:02,537
Scott: it?".

210
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:11,500
Scott: If you think there's money to be made from this property, then just take what already exists and just fucking show it to people.

211
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,032
Scott: People who haven't seen it won't know that it's old.

212
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,539
Scott: Just pretend it's new.

213
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:25,380
Rym: Especially, it's a trend you saw in America a lot where a lot of just basic people just sort of have this idea that animation is for kids.

214
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:35,220
Rym: And that the animated version of something is inferior, so if something's mature enough or good enough, then there'll be a live-action version of it and that's the one they'll watch.

215
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,500
Rym: That idea has been very pernicious in America in particular, and it's not uncommon in the rest of the world either.

216
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,328
Scott: And also, on top of that, it's like, "Why does this need to be

217
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:45,629
Scott: done?"

218
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,437
Scott: is the first question, which I still don't see.

219
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,500
Scott: why it needs to be done ever.

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,348
Scott: But B, most of the time when people do it, it's garbage.

221
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:07,540
Scott: There's very, very few, if any, live-action adaptations of things that were originally animated properties that are any fucking good.

222
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:11,880
Scott: So you got your live-action Disney remakes of Disney animated films.

223
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,964
Rym: Except those are animated.

224
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,255
Rym: They're just 3D CG, photorealistic.

225
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:16,400
Rym: They're not live-action.

226
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:17,900
Scott: I'm just saying.

227
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:31,139
Rym: It's just funny that so many people, like this gets back into that other problem, a lot of Americans refer to those Disney movies as the live-action versions because they fall into that same trope of, "Well, they took this old good Disney thing, but now they made it

228
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:31,659
Rym: real.".

229
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,829
Rym: But it's still literally just 3D CG.

230
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,060
Rym: It's still an animated cartoon.

231
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,091
Scott: There's a live-action Ghost in the Shell.

232
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:40,555
Scott: It exists.

233
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,220
Scott: I've never seen it.

234
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,979
Rym: Yeah, I have no intention of seeing it.

235
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,879
Scott: I have no intention of seeing it at all.

236
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,069
Rym: The best I've heard is, I think, that Battle Angel Alita.

237
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,840
Rym: People I trust said it was better than they expected, and that's as far as I got.

238
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,157
Scott: Battle Angel Alita was not... I don't think there's an... Is there an anime for that?

239
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:55,820
Scott: I thought it was just a manga.

240
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,690
Rym: I've never actually seen any of it.

241
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,778
Rym: That's not the kind of anime.

242
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,380
Scott: I've read a couple volumes of the manga.

243
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:05,973
Scott: I don't know if there's an anime of it or not.

244
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:06,437
Scott: There might be.

245
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,203
Scott: Regardless.

246
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,240
Scott: There's not a lot of success going that route.

247
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:13,963
Scott: So, why do this?

248
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:23,880
Scott: But, the only thing I gotta say about this particular instance is that, judging based on the materials and the facts and information that they have released so far...

249
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,475
Rym: Especially information that was released today that I'm about to touch on.

250
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:28,460
Rym: I don't know if you saw this.

251
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,488
Scott: For example, they told us Yokokana was involved in the music.

252
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,691
Scott: We've seen the cast.

253
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:37,740
Scott: We've seen shots from production shots of what it looks like.

254
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:46,220
Scott: And the indication is that this is probably likely... Can't guarantee it could still be garbage.

255
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:50,820
Scott: This is likely as good as anyone's ever done on this kind of endeavor.

256
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,160
Rym: But the most important thing...

257
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:53,869
Scott: Good?

258
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,259
Scott: I guess?

259
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,400
Rym: And I'll link to the article that was on Animator News Network today.

260
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:04,160
Rym: The showrunners have confirmed that it is not going to be a remake of any of the animated show.

261
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:08,047
Rym: It's just going to be more of that show.

262
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:14,980
Rym: All original stories in that universe canonically expanding it without necessarily remaking any of it.

263
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,967
Scott: Canonically?

264
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:16,819
Rym: We'll see.

265
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,744
Rym: The article says that.

266
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,897
Rym: That it will "expand the

267
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,220
Rym: canon.".

268
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:26,900
Rym: They said it is expansion to the canon of the anime, adding original stories.

269
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:33,359
Rym: It will not be a full-on remake saying that "just redoing the anime will leave the audience hungry for something they already

270
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:33,620
Rym: saw.".

271
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,919
Rym: That's a very promising sign right there.

272
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,160
Scott: Well, the fact that there's self-awareness by the people who wrote that.

273
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,439
Rym: Because there is a possibility, much like Evangelion had the movie remakes, and we're going to talk about those two weeks from now.

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,660
Rym: But here, we might be in a situation when this all comes out.

275
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,450
Rym: Well, I was making quote motions.

276
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:56,094
Rym: You couldn't see.

277
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,120
Rym: Anyway.

278
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:09,080
Rym: But there's a possibility, there's a future where we will see that Cowboy Bebop consists of this animated show, this one animated movie, and this one live-action show.

279
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,993
Rym: And they all complement each other.

280
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:11,800
Rym: That is possible.

281
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Scott: My hope is that somehow, obviously this is going to appeal to people who already enjoy Cowboy Bebop and just want more.

282
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:29,940
Rym: Oh yeah, but imagine the kind of basic person who's like, who won't watch cartoons, sees this, loves it because everything about it looks great if you've never heard of the anime.

283
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,479
Rym: And then Netflix is like, "Hey, did you know this was based on this Japanese

284
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:34,640
Rym: cartoon?".

285
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,761
Scott: Right.

286
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:41,680
Scott: If this gets even some people to watch the original, then I guess it's worth it, right?

287
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:46,880
Scott: People who wouldn't have watched the original ever otherwise without this existing, then I guess it's a positive.

288
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,328
Scott: Even if it sucks.

289
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:49,695
Scott: In itself, right?

290
00:18:50,760 --> 00:19:03,300
Rym: And the other thing, I'm going to list some things they talked about that make it clear, this definitely takes place during the show and not after the final episode.

291
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:04,939
Scott: You don't say.

292
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:16,460
Rym: I mean, there are actors for several characters who definitely could not be in the show were this show to take place after the end of Cowboy Bebop.

293
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:17,759
Rym: Much like the comic book movie.

294
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,393
Scott: Oh yeah, let me just have my, you know, let's run a space runaway.

295
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,520
Scott: Ide on, it takes place after the last episode.

296
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,960
Scott: Let's run Evangelion, it takes place after the last, season three, we'll say.

297
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,660
Rym: Evangelion 2, it takes place right after End of Evangelion, Death and Rebirth.

298
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:32,860
Scott: Exactly.

299
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,379
Rym: Granted, if they announced that and Anno was behind it, I would watch it.

300
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:43,253
Scott: You can't have a movie called Attack the Tokyo Gas Station.

301
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,220
Scott: that's a sequel to Godzilla.

302
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,840
Scott: It's like, the gas station ain't there anymore.

303
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,102
Rym: So I know you didn't watch it.

304
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:58,220
Rym: One could argue that if there were a sequel to End of Evangelion, Death and Rebirth, it could canonically be the good place.

305
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,540
Scott: You should finish watching these rebuilds before you say anything.

306
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,380
Rym: You should watch the good place before you say anything.

307
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,520
Rym: That is a top-tier, like, S-rank show.

308
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:11,272
Scott: Anyway.

309
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Rym: I do not say that lightly about a live-action show in America.

310
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,059
Scott: And some actual anime news.

311
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:23,300
Scott: Something we've asked for, right, we've got a situation where we made a-- A monkey's paw has curled a finger here.

312
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,219
Scott: A monkey's paw situation, right, we went to the genie and we asked for something and the genie said, "Okay, here you

313
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,420
Scott: go.".

314
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,720
Rym: Monkey's paw, give me an anime about hockey.

315
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:35,020
Scott: Right, so there's plenty of sports anime out there, plenty of sports manga.

316
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,219
Scott: And there have been many sports manga about ice hockey, quite a few.

317
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:42,960
Scott: But they've never been translated to English, I've seen them though in their original forms.

318
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:44,678
Scott: But obviously couldn't read them.

319
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,120
Scott: I don't know if there are fan translations either.

320
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,140
Scott: So, I've been waiting for an ice hockey anime.

321
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,950
Scott: We got a bicycling anime.

322
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,420
Scott: that wasn't too bad, it was fun.

323
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,626
Scott: It wasn't, like, legendary.

324
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,659
Scott: good, but, you know, Yo-Yo Pedal is fun, I like it.

325
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,860
Scott: They didn't finish the anime though, they'd sort of stopped, which led me disappointed.

326
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,620
Scott: But anyway, ice hockey anime is coming.

327
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:06,427
Scott: Hurray!

328
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:07,299
Scott: Bad news.

329
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,020
Scott: It's a really, it's gonna be a garbage anime.

330
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,639
Scott: So, at first, I looked at this-- Not good like Yo-Yo Pedal.

331
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:22,811
Rym: I looked at this and it's definitely like a Moe show, like, it'll be hockey and it'll probably have scenes like, "Senpai, how do pucks work?

332
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,519
Rym: Let's talk about the curve of a

333
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:24,760
Rym: stick.".

334
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,476
Rym: Like, it's gonna be really, really Moe anime.

335
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,340
Rym: crap, I suspect.

336
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:34,860
Scott: But, there's a little-- It's also tied into some, like, microtransactions video game stuff.

337
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:43,460
Rym: So, lately, there's been a trend where the red flag that anime is gonna be bad is if it is actually part of a mixed media project.

338
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Rym: Because usually that means it's actually a mobile game and the anime is just promoting the mobile game.

339
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,039
Scott: Exactly, that's exactly what this is.

340
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,000
Rym: It is animating this thing and if you look at things C2C has animated, it is things like that.

341
00:21:58,002 --> 00:21:59,359
Rym: I don't think any of these are good.

342
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:08,480
Scott: This is not going to be, you know, a good story with good characters that have any sort of fun to them or anything interesting, right?

343
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,775
Scott: It's just gonna be, "But, it's ice

344
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:11,178
Scott: hockey.".

345
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:19,679
Scott: It's like, "Please, can't you make a Haikyuu or a, you know, Yuri on Ice or a Yo-Yo Pedal level of quality but make it ice

346
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:20,019
Scott: hockey?".

347
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:21,520
Scott: Why can't you do that, right?

348
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:25,240
Scott: You know, a free, even make a free ice hockey, right?

349
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,397
Rym: Oh, I've said that for years.

350
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:35,140
Rym: I want to see an anime with the production quality of free, but it's either hot boys playing hockey or hot boys skiing.

351
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,779
Rym: Like professional ski competition.

352
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Scott: Ooh, skiing anime.

353
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,711
Rym: It's like wearing nothing at all.

354
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:40,820
Scott: Nothing at all.

355
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,642
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

356
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:50,800
Scott: anyway, there's many different kinds of sports anime and the only kind that's not any good is the kind that they decided to finally make ice hockey.

357
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:51,365
Scott: It's like, "Come

358
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:51,748
Scott: on!".

359
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:54,851
Scott: So, very disappointing.

360
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:56,060
Scott: Just avoid this show.

361
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:57,555
Scott: Do we even say the name of the show?

362
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:58,020
Scott: What's it called?

363
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:00,698
Rym: Oh God, it is called, uh, what did I put it?

364
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,400
Rym: Pura Ore, Pride of Orange.

365
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,544
Scott: Yeah, we don't need this.

366
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,960
Scott: Also, the orange part bothers me because that's the Philadelphia Flyers colors.

367
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:10,980
Scott: They can go fuck themselves.

368
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,300
Rym: Yeah, I think the team they play for is called the Dream Monkeys.

369
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:16,900
Scott: At least that's a funny name.

370
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,240
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:19,338
Rym: I, uh, I am...

372
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,320
Scott: If we go bowling and we need a team name, we'll put Dream Monkeys.

373
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,620
Rym: I will watch one episode of this, but I am confident it is bad.

374
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,080
Rym: If somehow I watch that one episode and I have a desire to watch more than one episode, I will eat my fucking hat.

375
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:43,780
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, we haven't done and probably won't do Judge Anime by its cover, but we would be like, there's no way that the judge is wrong on this one.

376
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,337
Rym: Yep.

377
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:56,380
Rym: And if you're wondering why we're not doing more Judge Anime by its cover, so remember when I complained about how even just like a review of an anime where we had a single screenshot got taken down with a copyright strike from these companies.

378
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:05,700
Rym: Judge Anime by its cover, I've gotten copyright takedowns from screenshots that are tiny and blurry and in the background.

379
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:13,098
Scott: I have never gotten any copyright message whatsoever for any Judge Anime by its cover episode that we put on to my YouTube channel.

380
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,151
Rym: That didn't even have the slides in it from an anime.

381
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,738
Rym: Boston got copyright takedowns.

382
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,793
Scott: None of my Judge Anime by its covers that are on my channel have any notices takedowns.

383
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,400
Scott: If I still was monetizing, I would be able to monetize.

384
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,707
Scott: That is fascinating.

385
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,760
Rym: That's honestly fascinating.

386
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,620
Scott: My channel is a safe space for anime judging.

387
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,361
Rym: Alright.

388
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:38,873
Rym: But also, Judge Anime by its cover honestly was only popular at conventions.

389
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:41,480
Rym: It wasn't that popular on the internet for a lot of reasons.

390
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,505
Scott: I don't care how popular it is.

391
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:43,971
Scott: I just care if I like making it.

392
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,960
Scott: It was a little bit of a hassle to make.

393
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,028
Scott: It was a lot of effort to make.

394
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,380
Rym: And yeah, anyway.

395
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,345
Rym: Things of the day.

396
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:55,911
Rym: So I bumped into this.

397
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,440
Rym: It's just a short 52-second YouTube video.

398
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:06,640
Rym: And the best way I can describe this is it's a skit that's very funny and it asks a fundamental question.

399
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,780
Rym: And the question is, why do we do this to ourselves as humans?

400
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,940
Rym: And the thing that we do to ourselves is as soon as we wake up, reach over, find our phone, and turn it on.

401
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:23,520
Rym: And look at the words and images that are presented to us on this phone as the first thing we do.

402
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,918
Scott: I do that, yeah.

403
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,341
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,931
Rym: So if you watch this video, you'll see what I mean.

405
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:30,300
Rym: The video is very apt and very funny.

406
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:31,759
Scott: I like doing that.

407
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:32,663
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:35,720
Rym: I also do this, but you'll see when you watch this video.

409
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:36,924
Scott: I do it with an iPad.

410
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:41,200
Scott: And also, thanks to iOS 15 that just came out, they have a new focus feature.

411
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:44,144
Scott: I don't really care about the focus.

412
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:50,300
Scott: It's meant to be like where you enable or disable different notifications for different apps and different scenarios.

413
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,817
Scott: So it's like, oh, I'm doing this now, so I only want these notifications.

414
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:56,680
Scott: That's what it's meant for.

415
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:03,960
Scott: But one of the side features that they just added is the ability to set -- you can set many different home pages on your phone or your tablet.

416
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,492
Scott: And then you can assign a subset of those pages to a particular focus mode.

417
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,260
Scott: So I could have an indoor biking focus mode.

418
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,340
Scott: And if I choose that, suddenly the home page on my phone will literally just be the apps I need for indoor biking and Spotify and nothing else.

419
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,008
Scott: So what I did is I created a morning focus mode.

420
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:31,360
Scott: So when I wake up, it actually automatically and intelligently on its own enters the morning focus mode.

421
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:41,260
Scott: And in a row are all the apps that I check every morning and then widgets I need with information I want to see every morning like weather, calendar, tasks, that sort of thing.

422
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:43,889
Scott: And it's pretty good so far.

423
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,060
Scott: I've used it for two days maybe.

424
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,781
Rym: I will try that out.

425
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:52,340
Rym: The package that arrived today is either my new iPhone or the MagSafe battery for my new iPhone.

426
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:53,880
Scott: They didn't come together.

427
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,225
Rym: Yeah, they shipped separately.

428
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,450
Rym: And one of the two arrived.

429
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,420
Rym: I did not look to check which one it is yet.

430
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:00,669
Scott: Okay.

431
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,855
Scott: So yeah, thing of the day.

432
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:02,700
Scott: Did I do thing of the day?

433
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,384
Rym: Yeah, you did.

434
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,500
Rym: Dua Lipa.

435
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,543
Scott: All right.

436
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,954
Scott: So but I didn't actually do it.

437
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:08,600
Scott: Now I have to do it.

438
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,279
Rym: Now you got to do it.

439
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,360
Scott: If you don't know, Dua Lipa is a singer songwriter person who makes dancey cool music.

440
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,485
Scott: You either don't know them.

441
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,810
Scott: If you do know them, you like them.

442
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,533
Scott: Maybe you don't like them.

443
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:21,035
Scott: Who knows?

444
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:21,838
Scott: I like Dua Lipa.

445
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:22,440
Scott: Dua Lipa is cool.

446
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:28,440
Scott: Dua Lipa I think is like, my perspective is Dua Lipa, she is the master of collaboration.

447
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:28,921
Rym: Wait, wait.

448
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:30,226
Rym: What's YouTube saying here?

449
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:31,630
Rym: There's a thing on the bottom.

450
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:32,874
Rym: It says she's on tour.

451
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:34,037
Rym: Oh, this is March 1st.

452
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:34,499
Rym: It's just old.

453
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:34,900
Rym: Never mind.

454
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:36,362
Scott: Yeah.

455
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,626
Scott: Dua Lipa is the master of collaborations.

456
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:45,520
Scott: Like in terms of like featuring on other people's tracks, getting people to feature on her tracks, but also doing like fashion collaborations.

457
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,388
Scott: It'll be like, oh, such and such brand X Dua Lipa.

458
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:52,500
Scott: Like she like joins with everybody and makes all these deals.

459
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:53,643
Scott: And I think I feel like.

460
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:59,738
Scott: that's how, like I've never actually seen like Dua Lipa stuff that was just Dua Lipa.

461
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:00,420
Scott: Like here I am.

462
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,776
Scott: It was always something X Dua Lipa, right?

463
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:05,680
Scott: Every single time.

464
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:14,040
Scott: And that's the only reason I knew she existed to begin with because of so many, she kept repeat reappearing paired with other things that I did already know.

465
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,580
Scott: So a really good agent and business dealing going on over there in Dua Lipa's territory, I got to say.

466
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:30,340
Scott: But my thing of the day is Dua Lipa is fundamentally a singer songwriter and has a new music video for a song called Levitating.

467
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:34,065
Scott: And the music video is an animated music video.

468
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:43,280
Scott: It is 100% 2D animation and it is a strong, perhaps copyright infringing Sailor Moon.

469
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,993
Rym: Oh, the aesthetic of this hits me right in the soul.

470
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:50,556
Rym: Like so hard.

471
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:52,080
Rym: This is like a weapon against me.

472
00:28:52,260 --> 00:29:03,660
Scott: I'm surprised that if this wasn't Sailor Moon X Dua Lipa with an official partnership, I'm surprised they don't come at her with some kind of lawsuit because wow, it's literally just a Sailor Moon music video.

473
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,270
Rym: It is so good.

474
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,539
Rym: This aesthetic is everything.

475
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,524
Scott: And the song's not bad either.

476
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,328
Scott: Pretty good song.

477
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,559
Scott: So check this out.

478
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,939
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is still the tale of Genji, but we are...

479
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:16,000
Scott: I read some yesterday.

480
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:17,679
Rym: Yeah, I've read some as well.

481
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,279
Scott: Stuff was happening.

482
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,604
Rym: I think we'll be able to talk about it pretty soon.

483
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:26,620
Rym: I still worry that my opinion, like most books I read, my opinion changes and then as they get to the end, I have like a final thought.

484
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,840
Rym: But I hit this point where there's nothing different, I'll say, except for reacting to specific things Genji did and trouble he got into along the way.

485
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:41,760
Rym: But I do know that something's going to happen not too far from where I am that radically changes everything.

486
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:47,640
Rym: But I also haven't decided if I'm even going to read past that point because it's not even clear if that is canonically part of the original novel.

487
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,527
Scott: I mean, there's this stuff going on with that, right?

488
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:57,080
Scott: But I figured everything on these pages was written by the same author and was, you know...

489
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,559
Rym: There's a point near the end beyond which there seems to be dispute about that.

490
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:03,293
Scott: I mean, possibly.

491
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:03,860
Scott: Who the fuck knows?

492
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:05,500
Rym: There's a character who dies.

493
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:08,895
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to read everything in the whole book that is there.

494
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,800
Rym: Yeah, I'm just saying it is possible that everything after a certain character dies might not have been written by the same person.

495
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:20,940
Rym: And I was reading a bunch of stuff about this, but I've got to read more to sort out my thoughts on that so I haven't decided.

496
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:31,620
Scott: Regardless, I think part of the problem is that the plot keeps progressing, things keep happening, but there isn't too much in the way of character development.

497
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:33,220
Scott: Characters are who they are.

498
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,339
Rym: Genji has never at any point learned anything.

499
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,868
Scott: Right, it's like none of the characters change.

500
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:43,180
Scott: They might change their mind and do a different thing.

501
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,016
Rym: Or some of them get killed by ghosts.

502
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:47,840
Rym: Sometimes that happens.

503
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,580
Scott: Things happen to people, people do things, but people are who they are and that's it.

504
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,730
Scott: And I haven't seen anyone develop or grow.

505
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,560
Rym: One character who is developing, but it is too creepy to even get into right now who that is and how they're developing.

506
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:14,000
Scott: Yeah, so that is what sort of makes it, you know, it's like you're reading more, well your opinion won't change because it's sort of like soap opera, things are happening.

507
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,399
Scott: It's like the events.

508
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:22,440
Rym: Which is interesting because in a way, that's how a good chunk of another very long book that I read long ago, The Count of Monte Cristo is.

509
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,931
Rym: In that it's just a very, very straightforward.

510
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,960
Rym: this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this happened.

511
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:35,031
Rym: And The Count himself is not changing or evolving in any way.

512
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:39,540
Rym: He's just great and he is doing his plan and at no point is he changing his plan.

513
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,179
Rym: He's just adapting the plan.

514
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Rym: But then at the very end of the book, I guess spoilers for The Count of Monte Cristo, he changes his plan and evolves as a character.

515
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:57,180
Rym: But that doesn't happen until like the last hundred pages of the book and the book has many times one hundred pages.

516
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,380
Scott: Yup, anyway.

517
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,489
Rym: Anyway, otherwise we're not planning to go to any conventions, obviously.

518
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,416
Rym: You can see our most recent PAX panel on the YouTubey.

519
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,060
Rym: We just linked to it, Atari Game Design.

520
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:13,816
Rym: I am working on a panel that will either debut or maybe I'll debut because it's a topic.

521
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:14,940
Rym: Scott doesn't care about that much.

522
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:23,339
Rym: But I gathered, I think, all the, I need to play one more game and get enough footage to do the analysis and then I'm ready to rock on this thing.

523
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,624
Scott: I'm working on things.

524
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:29,833
Scott: I'm not, but I can't shit talk anything, right?

525
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:32,240
Scott: So I'm not going to say what I'm working on, if I'll finish it.

526
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:37,520
Rym: Notice, I did not say what this thing, what this panel is about specifically to cover my own ass.

527
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,442
Scott: I didn't say what things.

528
00:32:38,482 --> 00:32:39,264
Scott: Is it panels?

529
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:40,086
Scott: Who knows what it is.

530
00:32:40,146 --> 00:32:46,620
Scott: But yeah, I have spent hours of my time producing works of some nature.

531
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:46,887
Rym: Yup.

532
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,629
Scott: In recent days, I have done that.

533
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,075
Scott: Will you see those works?

534
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:52,040
Scott: I don't know.

535
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,980
Rym: I'm a little sidelined by the fact that we're about to get a new couch and also it's warm, so I'm spending most of my time outside, but very soon.

536
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:01,980
Scott: It's still warm in the late September.

537
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,501
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:15,820
Rym: Now when it gets cold, I'm also outside at the time because I'll be skiing, but we're about to enter that magic era, not too long from now, where it's too cold to do the things I like to do outside, but not cold enough to do the other things I like to do outside.

539
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:18,940
Rym: And that is the most productive Rym is ever in his life.

540
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,100
Scott: Here is also another fact that is not a lie.

541
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,286
Scott: Ooh.

542
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:30,940
Scott: I have 18 paid time off days I have to use before the end of the year, unless my company again extends rollover beyond the normal 10 days.

543
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,180
Rym: Oh, if my company lets me roll over more than five days, I'm rolling over like all the days I got left.

544
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,086
Scott: We are also, my company always by default does not work between Christmas and New Year's.

545
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:51,700
Scott: It is very likely that I will simply not work in December, in which case it is more likely that I may make something in December.

546
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,279
Scott: Yep.

547
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,308
Scott: With no promise whatsoever.

548
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:56,058
Scott: I may lay on the couch for December.

549
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:56,460
Scott: Who knows?

550
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,800
Rym: Yeah.

551
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:09,040
Rym: I'll admit that I've had, I've enjoyed doing, being less productive and creative and doing less creative output for a few months and enjoying myself more, but I'm feeling that itch like pretty hard again.

552
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,500
Scott: So, all right, so let's talk about some magazines in the categories relating to cartoons, comics, anime, et cetera.

553
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:24,379
Scott: In the United States, historically, there have not been too many of them, and at least not too many that were like big.

554
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:34,679
Scott: If you look in your comic book, you know, if you run a comic book store and you look at the order form for Diamond, Diamond is in trouble now because they lost all their deals.

555
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:41,847
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,550
Scott: There's like a James Bond magazine that keeps coming out.

557
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,514
Scott: It's like, what content do you have for that?

558
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:49,040
Scott: I guess there's a new James Bond movie now.

559
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,679
Rym: Well, it's kind of like how there are still Firefly podcasts to this day.

560
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,679
Scott: Right.

561
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:04,160
Scott: And there are some comic books magazines out there, like this Back Issue magazine or something, and it's like for the extreme comic nerds out there, right?

562
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,568
Scott: And I think some of these are quarterlies.

563
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,520
Scott: They're really narrow, and I don't know much about them.

564
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:18,960
Scott: But in terms of major ones, we can list them, and we're going to go through these sort of historically as like when I encountered them in life, right?

565
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,193
Scott: Yeah.

566
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,917
Scott: So the first one I really encountered in life was Wizard Magazine.

567
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:23,620
Scott: You ever read Wizard Magazine?

568
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,173
Rym: I read Wizard Magazine because back then, there was no internet.

569
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,020
Rym: I couldn't learn about any of this stuff.

570
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,084
Scott: So I didn't actually read.

571
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:32,747
Scott: I never bought Wizard Magazine.

572
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:36,153
Scott: At the time, it's weird because I was in middle school.

573
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:40,060
Scott: If I saw Wizard Magazine, I was interested in the contents of that magazine.

574
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:51,919
Scott: Other people had them, other nerds I knew, and I might skim them and read them when I was at a kid's house or something, but I never felt the need to buy or subscribe to Wizard Magazine.

575
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:05,880
Rym: I similarly would read them at friends' houses, or occasionally I'd read them in bookstores, though I don't remember if Wizard did this specifically, but a lot of the magazines like this I used to read in bookstores started coming in plastic sleeves that prevented me from reading them in the bookstores.

576
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,214
Rym: Wow, Wizard actually ended in 2011, and also it didn't start until 1991.

577
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,600
Rym: It started later than I thought.

578
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,004
Scott: Also, Wizard ran those conventions.

579
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:16,447
Scott: Remember Wizard World Philly?

580
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,870
Scott: That was the same wizard, right?

581
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,553
Scott: So I always thought it was strange.

582
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,358
Scott: First of all, the name and that we had Dungeon Magazine.

583
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:23,680
Scott: We had Dragon Magazine.

584
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,686
Rym: Now, Dungeon Magazine was Adventures for D&D.

585
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:31,173
Rym: Dragon Magazine was commentary and articles about D&D.

586
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:34,720
Rym: Wizard Magazine had nothing to do with wizards or dungeons or dragons.

587
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,387
Scott: Wizard Magazine had to do with comic bookstores.

588
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,192
Scott: It's like, what?

589
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:38,539
Scott: But it's called Wizard.

590
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:52,520
Rym: I have memories of knowing about Wizard, flipping through it and everything, but I am hard-pressed to say anything that I learned ever from looking inside a Wizard Magazine in my entire life.

591
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,100
Rym: Wizard Magazine was literally- I feel like it was a kid-brain thing where I would just flip through it and not internalize anything.

592
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:11,140
Scott: Yeah, it was the most consumerist, collectorist, not mainstream because comic books weren't mainstream, but mainstream in terms of the comic world, right?

593
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:25,118
Scott: It was like, yeah, superheroes, yeah, collect stuff and put it in bags and buy ultra rare cocoa beans and a magazine is 90% ads and everything is great, buy stuff, right?

594
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:26,300
Scott: That's what it was.

595
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:36,240
Rym: See, also, in the gaming space, Wizard was one step less bad than what Scryed, which was literally just, here's how much people are selling every fucking magic card for.

596
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,540
Scott: Yeah, well, Scryed isn't anime.

597
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,640
Rym: Oh yeah, but similar, it's aimed at this consumerist demographic.

598
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:48,309
Scott: Wizard Magazine wasn't talking about any indie comics, right?

599
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:53,080
Scott: It was either Marvel, it was DC, or it was Spawn, and otherwise it wasn't in there.

600
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,407
Scott: It's like they weren't trying to teach you anything, they were just trying to make you buy something you already like.

601
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:09,200
Scott: So you liked these comics, you bought Wizard to get news about the things you already liked in the pre-internet era, and then you would buy more shit, and that's what Wizard was.

602
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,180
Rym: But at least that news was also available in other places, and America, for me, was way more important.

603
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,800
Scott: You're skipping over a lot of magazines.

604
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:19,296
Rym: Alright, I'll follow your list then.

605
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,546
Scott: Okay, so there was another thing called the Comics Journal, which is from the 90s.

606
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:32,419
Scott: I don't know if it still exists, and what this was is you go to the comic book store, and you check out, and they give you a bag with the comic book store's logo on it, right?

607
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,100
Scott: Yeah, that's how they do.

608
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:42,220
Scott: And then in with your comic books, they would put this thing that was like, you know, a few pages of newsprint for free, that was the comic news.

609
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,960
Rym: I've never seen or heard of the comic news.

610
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,999
Rym: I'll admit, I've never seen or heard of the comics journal until now.

611
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:51,452
Scott: Well, the comics journal's different.

612
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:52,480
Scott: This is comic shop news.

613
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,068
Scott: So, comic shop news was this free piece of shit newspaper thing that was only a few pages.

614
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:05,080
Scott: they put in there, and I don't remember what the contents of it were, even though they gave it to me every single time I went to the comic shop, and I looked through it.

615
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,217
Scott: I think it was mostly ads, obviously, because it was free, but I don't know what the hell was in that thing.

616
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:11,140
Scott: I read it many times.

617
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,813
Rym: I don't think my comic shop gave any of that stuff out.

618
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,260
Rym: I just don't remember comic shop news.

619
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:18,139
Scott: It was a very 90s thing, the comic shop news.

620
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,765
Scott: So, yeah, the comics journal was something else.

621
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:26,491
Scott: I didn't encounter the comics journal until much later, but it is quite old.

622
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:28,635
Scott: I don't know if it exists anymore.

623
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:31,420
Scott: It had times where it went digital only, I think.

624
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,015
Scott: But this was made by Fanta Graphics, and this was like, you know, it was thick, right?

625
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:41,240
Rym: And this was like indie- Well, because it was a bi-annual magazine.

626
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:49,254
Scott: Yeah, and they'd be like deep, deep interviews with like indie comics people, like pages and pages long.

627
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:52,660
Scott: That was like, you know, the real deal biz, the comics journal.

628
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:58,033
Scott: And it went on for bi-annual, but it had like hundreds of issues, I think.

629
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,960
Scott: It went on for a long- It's still going.

630
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,341
Scott: It's still going?

631
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:14,307
Scott: Okay, because I know it had troubles going in and out of print and digitally- Because this was a real deal thing.

632
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:17,620
Scott: It wasn't some rah-rah, spend money, you know, rigid garbage.

633
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,933
Rym: Rich Buckler sued them because they called him a plagiarist showing his art side by side with Jack Kirby art, and he sued them over it.

634
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:27,318
Rym: I don't think he won that lawsuit.

635
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:39,380
Scott: Yeah, so if you, you know, if you want to, you know, do some research on what was really going on, especially in the indie comic scene back in the day, comics journal, that was the real stuff.

636
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:53,740
Rym: Yeah, and the thing I have to say about that kind, like in general, like these types of magazines is that they are really important for research, like modern research into the history of comics, the scenes at the time, because they're like- It's not quite an academic journal.

637
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,800
Rym: But they're just, they're an artifact.

638
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,419
Scott: But it's not a magazine either.

639
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:07,300
Rym: They're an artifact with so much contemporary information about like a particular year in comics that like a researcher could have a field day cross-referencing this with other information.

640
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:16,800
Scott: And it's like the amount of work that goes into making this thing versus what they charge for it is like just so dramatically, you know, imbalanced, right?

641
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:26,059
Scott: I was surprised like, you know, how long it went on, like, wow, it's like it's someone's whole job to like work really hard to make this thing and they're probably getting almost no money for it, right?

642
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:31,010
Scott: So the comics journal is definitely worth looking into, even back issues of it, right?

643
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,792
Scott: Whatever you can get.

644
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,620
Scott: I think there is archives of it you can pay for or get somewhere.

645
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,460
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's not unavailable.

646
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,859
Rym: I guess part of it is that I really didn't read a lot of superhero comics until actually like high school and later.

647
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:48,860
Rym: I was so deep into anime that anime magazines are where I have the most like nostalgia and memories.

648
00:41:51,021 --> 00:42:00,400
Scott: So I guess actually, you know what, something I mentioned I didn't put on the list here that's worth at least mentioning a little bit is TV Guide, which obviously has no place in modern society.

649
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:01,586
Scott: And is it dead?

650
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:02,551
Scott: It should be dead.

651
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:04,360
Scott: If it's not dead, it's close to it, right?

652
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:13,300
Rym: I mean we stopped getting TV, like we even stopped, like we grew up in the late 1900s and TV Guide just stopped appearing in our house right when we moved.

653
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,928
Scott: We never had to, we never bought it.

654
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,860
Scott: We just used the newspaper's TV section.

655
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,398
Rym: Oh, we subscribed to it and we used it.

656
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:28,720
Scott: We did not, but it did have, parts of it were not just the guide part, parts of it were talking about shows and stuff and would occasionally talk about animated shows.

657
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:34,240
Scott: So it is not an anime magazine, animation magazine, but parts of it were occasionally.

658
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,040
Rym: TV Guide is how I would find out if an animated show I like would continue the next year or not.

659
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:50,100
Rym: Like that was, or if it moved, like a show would move, like you kids don't understand what it was like in the 90s when you'd watch a TV show, like a cartoon, like Mask or something, even the 80s that you like.

660
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:56,232
Rym: Cartoon, it's on TV, you watch it, every week you know it's on like Saturdays at 7 a.m.

661
00:42:56,252 --> 00:43:00,580
Rym: or whatever, and then one day you turn on the TV at that time and your show's not on.

662
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,040
Rym: There was almost no way to figure out what happened if there's a different way to watch it except by reading something like TV Guide.

663
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:15,300
Scott: Yeah, it's like, oh, is Sci-Fi Channel going to show in the late 90s, are they going to show some 80s cartoons at, you know, six in the morning on Sci-Fi Channel?

664
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,740
Scott: There's no way for you to know that unless you have TV Guide.

665
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:19,038
Rym: I remember, you know why we stopped?

666
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
Scott: Unless you happen to flip to the channel at the right time.

667
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,646
Rym: I remember exactly when we stopped getting TV Guide.

668
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:29,960
Rym: Where we lived in Michigan, similar to how we got cable modems really early nationally, we got cable really early.

669
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,900
Rym: And there was one of those early cable channels that would just scroll through.

670
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,580
Scott: The cable channel tells you what's on you.

671
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,820
Rym: Yep, and once we had access to that channel, a TV Guide just stopped appearing in our houses.

672
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,300
Scott: Yeah, so we never had, we never bought it, but I always see it at the grocery store.

673
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,592
Scott: Anyway, so there was a Nickelodeon magazine, which is somewhat animation related.

674
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:50,460
Scott: It was mostly just a kid's entertainment magazine from what I remember.

675
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,039
Scott: I think my brother might have gotten it for a year or so.

676
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,686
Scott: My brother got it too.

677
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,640
Rym: I remember like half reading it.

678
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:04,200
Scott: But I mean, it was animation related and it did, you know, I don't know how much it counts.

679
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,700
Scott: But more importantly, there was Disney Adventures.

680
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:13,120
Scott: So I never bought Disney Adventures, but I did see it on the checkout aisle at the grocery store.

681
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:16,560
Scott: And it was sort of a digest size deal, like an Archie comics thing.

682
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:24,180
Scott: And it was really interesting in that even though it was called Disney Adventures, I never actually bought it, but I would look at it occasionally.

683
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:26,726
Scott: It had comics in the back, right?

684
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:32,200
Scott: And those comics were often like tailspin comic, right?

685
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,527
Scott: It's like there was good shit in there comics wise.

686
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:47,520
Scott: And I'm wondering now that I haven't thought about this magazine in decades, if those comics, some of which were good, are like compiled anywhere that you can get because some of them are probably worth reading today.

687
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:55,540
Scott: But in the front part, there was entertainment news targeted at kids and it wasn't exclusive to Disney.

688
00:44:55,841 --> 00:45:01,640
Scott: Even though it was Disney Adventures magazine, they would be telling you shit about like all kids media.

689
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,487
Scott: Like other cartoons and things that were going on.

690
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:22,000
Scott: So if you were a kid and you were into, you know, cartoons in the United States, and this magazine was still in print, which it is not, it was really like, you know, if I was born five years later, I probably would have had this magazine and learned all kinds of stuff about what was going on.

691
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,680
Scott: Like new shows coming, going, movies coming out.

692
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,780
Rym: Oh yeah, there's a whole list of all the original, like not based on an existing Disney property comics in there.

693
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,680
Rym: Little Gloomy, Society of Horrors, The Last Laugh, Luna Park, Kid Blast Off, Gorilla Gorilla.

694
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,140
Scott: This was basically, if you want to think about Disney Adventures magazine, it was like the print version of Disney Afternoon.

695
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,226
Scott: It was like, it was pretty good actually.

696
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:52,800
Scott: Even though I didn't buy it ever, I knew enough of it that I knew that it was the real deal.

697
00:45:52,941 --> 00:45:57,500
Scott: So you can probably easily get, you know, I don't know if people are scanning it.

698
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:05,040
Rym: So it looks like they released, they released back in the day, seven volumes that collected all the comics that were in them, it looks like.

699
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,140
Scott: Oh nice, okay.

700
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,239
Rym: This might have been a long time ago, but I'll bet there's a way to get these comics.

701
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,900
Scott: Which is probably hard to get also, but the library probably has them or something.

702
00:46:13,283 --> 00:46:13,464
Scott: Yeah.

703
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,260
Rym: I'm going to bookmark this to remember to look into, to inquire about that a little bit.

704
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,832
Scott: Yeah, I think it's largely forgotten.

705
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:20,960
Scott: I haven't seen anyone mention it.

706
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,399
Scott: I bet if I tweet like, hey, I remember Disney Adventures magazine, it might blow up.

707
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,509
Scott: Anyway, so let's talk about the actual anime shit now, right?

708
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:31,720
Scott: So I did not think about anime magazines at all.

709
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:39,720
Rym: This is where Scott and I sort of switched places, because I turned into a weeb when I was in fourth grade, which was a long fucking time ago.

710
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:44,260
Scott: I was, like I knew anime was a thing, you know, earlier.

711
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:44,796
Scott: But when?

712
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,519
Scott: I guess whenever, when Akira came out in the US.

713
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,139
Rym: Yeah, I was a little bit, I was a bit before that.

714
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,665
Scott: Was that 80 something, right?

715
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:54,790
Scott: Late 80s, early 90s, who knows?

716
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,420
Scott: I knew anime existed, you know, but I wasn't, didn't actually have access to anime.

717
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,140
Scott: I would go to the comic shop and you see those Ranma VHSs there, but I didn't buy or watch those, even though I knew they were there, right?

718
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,655
Scott: Dragon Ball was on, whatever, but I wasn't, you know, you know, Sailor Moon was on.

719
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:11,220
Scott: I wasn't, I didn't actually watch that either.

720
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:20,560
Scott: I watched Voltron and Macross, Robotech, whatever, but I, you know, I wasn't, I didn't actually watch Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon, even though they were on TV.

721
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,580
Rym: But I went, like, by the time I was in middle school, I was already mailing strangers on the internet to get VHS tapes back.

722
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:33,520
Rym: But it was a weird world, because again, late 1900s, I knew anime existed and I was obsessed with it and I would get as much as I could.

723
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,400
Scott: I couldn't buy it.

724
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,800
Scott: I would try to watch, anytime sci-fi channels showed anime, whatever, I would try to watch it.

725
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:47,600
Rym: Literally watched every single anime that was in the local video stores, which was not that many, like maybe 20 tapes total.

726
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:50,080
Rym: And I'd watch them all multiple times, like I was obsessed.

727
00:47:50,520 --> 00:48:01,940
Rym: But this was pre-internet, and even as the internet started to appear more and more, there was very little reliable or factually correct information about anime in America.

728
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,019
Scott: Most of it would just be like a little GeoCities fan site.

729
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,279
Rym: It was either, it was fan sites?

730
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,878
Scott: You're lucky it'll be some JPEGs.

731
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:17,400
Rym: But even worse, the fan sites would have content like, here's screenshots, or like, later on, here's an RM video of 10 seconds of the opening animation to like Ranma.

732
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,599
Scott: But I'm a fan of the thing, here's the thing, I'm writing my thoughts about it.

733
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:29,680
Rym: But also, nobody in America except people who were like, were professionals, knew shit about it, and kids would make stuff up about anime.

734
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:32,560
Rym: So you couldn't even trust the information you could find.

735
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,400
Scott: And there were zines, there were zines made by some smaller organizations.

736
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,773
Rym: I was too young to find zines.

737
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,680
Scott: And I had no access to those, though.

738
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:48,700
Rym: I was going to gaming cons in the early 90s, but I didn't go to anime cons until 2002.

739
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,520
Scott: I didn't even know an anime con was, you know, I didn't really understand.

740
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:00,500
Rym: Yeah, Scott and I at RIT learned that anime cons existed when the people who ran the RIT Anime Club were like, hey, let's go to the anime convention.

741
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:01,747
Rym: And we were like, what?

742
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:03,114
Rym: There are anime conventions?

743
00:49:03,335 --> 00:49:04,080
Rym: Oh shit, oh fuck.

744
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:12,358
Scott: Before I went to college, like, the idea of a con, it's like I sort of understood from, because there were cartoons that made fun of them, like that.

745
00:49:12,378 --> 00:49:13,320
Scott: there were Star Trek cons.

746
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,140
Scott: And I understood that there was Magic tournaments, because I went to one.

747
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:24,760
Scott: And I was going to a lot of- I understood that there were baseball card, you know, pro wrestling figure trade show type things, because I went to some.

748
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:28,420
Scott: But I didn't fully understand that there were cons.

749
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,320
Scott: And like when I was in the year 2000 in college, they're like something something Otakon, OhioCon, whatever.

750
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:37,160
Scott: I didn't fully understand what the hell they were talking about.

751
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:41,499
Scott: And I don't, I don't really, I don't remember how I ended up going to the one.

752
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:52,840
Rym: Yeah, I would do a lot of gaming cons, which honestly not that different from what I do at PAX is today, except they're the old Grognard gaming cons where you'd have to schedule in advance and tickets.

753
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,160
Rym: And they're very Gen Con-esque, just like shittier and smaller.

754
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:58,019
Rym: Like I went to Michigan a bunch of times.

755
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,039
Scott: But for somehow I like I understood they existed, but I had never conceived of like going to it.

756
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:14,500
Rym: But because of this dearth of actual reliable information, it was very hard for me to engage with anime other than getting as much as I could and watching it.

757
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:18,660
Rym: But I didn't have sources to know like who was involved, who directed something.

758
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:20,680
Rym: Like it was just hard to find out those kinds of things.

759
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,480
Scott: What other anime are available that I don't know about.

760
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,700
Rym: Animerica was the first time I encountered any reliable source of information about anime in my entire life.

761
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,754
Rym: And this started in like the early 90s.

762
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,860
Scott: Yeah, so I didn't know Animerica existed until we were in college.

763
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,480
Scott: I would skimmed it a few times here and there when it was lying about, but I never bought it.

764
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:42,226
Scott: And why?

765
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:42,974
Scott: I should have bought it.

766
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:43,580
Scott: Why didn't I buy it?

767
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,344
Scott: I couldn't afford it.

768
00:50:44,465 --> 00:50:47,440
Rym: I would read other people's copies, especially in high school.

769
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,040
Rym: I knew people who subscribed to it and I would get their lead.

770
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,068
Scott: Again, it made no sense.

771
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:52,660
Scott: Like I should have subscribed to, you know, Wizard.

772
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:55,800
Scott: I don't like, but I should have subscribed to that when I was a kid in middle school.

773
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:58,700
Scott: And why didn't I subscribe to Animerica when I found out?

774
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:58,961
Scott: Two reasons.

775
00:50:59,002 --> 00:50:59,605
Rym: One, kid brain.

776
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,120
Rym: And two, like when I was young, our parents were very clear.

777
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,820
Rym: Like we could each subscribe to a magazine.

778
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,260
Rym: Like they're not going to let us subscribe to everything we want because we're kids.

779
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,489
Scott: I subscribed to several magazines.

780
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,715
Scott: I had GoPro, GamePro.

781
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,688
Rym: Nintendo Power was the big one for us.

782
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:16,219
Rym: That was like the magazine we cared the most about.

783
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:17,666
Scott: Anyway.

784
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:18,619
Rym: PC Gamer, etc.

785
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:30,720
Rym: But Animerica was just the first glimpse I and a lot of anime fans in America ever had into like actual information about anime in Japan and the anime industry.

786
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,000
Scott: So it was made by, so Viz made Animerica.

787
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,578
Scott: But Viz was most of the anime industry at the time in the U.S.

788
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:37,960
Scott: at least.

789
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,999
Scott: So that they were covering most of the stuff.

790
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:42,959
Scott: So it was a little bit Viz promote-y.

791
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:46,859
Scott: And it did have manga in the back because they're promoting the mangas that they sell.

792
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:51,160
Scott: But yeah, Animerica was kind of good actually.

793
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:57,800
Rym: Especially because not only did nothing exist even like it that we had access to, but it was very informative, very well written.

794
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:08,640
Rym: And it was also, while it was a little like it would focus on anime that Viz was involved with, it was also not as consumerist as the comic book stuff in America at the time.

795
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,900
Scott: Yeah, they would show, they would put fan stuff in, you know, usual stuff, letters, columns, right?

796
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:18,000
Rym: In retrospect, there were photos from conventions, but I guess I just assumed they were all like Star Trek conventions.

797
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,637
Rym: Like I didn't know.

798
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,120
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know.

799
00:52:20,483 --> 00:52:21,399
Scott: I blame a lot of that on Kid Brain.

800
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,960
Scott: There's also Animerica Extra.

801
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,300
Scott: Animerica Extra was just manga.

802
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,139
Scott: And it was like a few chapters of a few different manga like compiled, but not as thick as like a real Shonen Jump was.

803
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:34,459
Scott: So that was a thing.

804
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,880
Scott: And what I find really interesting is I remember specifically like, was it 2004 or 5?

805
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,580
Scott: It was like the anime boom.

806
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,119
Scott: And anime was huge.

807
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,639
Scott: You would think Animerica would keep going, but actually at the anime boom, like at the peak, they stopped it.

808
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:58,260
Scott: And I think what happened, if I remember correctly, is everyone who had a subscription, they ran out your subscription with issues of Shoujo Beat instead.

809
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:01,380
Rym: Oh, that's really common in the magazine industry.

810
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,360
Rym: So remember the Disney thing we were talking about?

811
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:07,200
Rym: They just ended it one day and everyone who was subscribed didn't get a refund.

812
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:10,119
Rym: They just got Sports Illustrated for Kids until the subscription ran out.

813
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:18,600
Scott: Yeah, it's like they stopped doing Animerica and Animerica Extra and they just did Shonen Jump and Shoujo Beat as manga compilation things only.

814
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,320
Scott: And I think, yeah, you just got those instead.

815
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:27,479
Scott: I remember at the convention, we were like at Otakon and they were like, "Subscribe to Shoujo Beat stuff going on," right?

816
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:29,560
Scott: And that was the end of Animerica.

817
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,940
Scott: So the other big anime magazine was New Type.

818
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,260
Scott: So New Type I didn't know about until I got to college.

819
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:37,280
Scott: And there were issues of New Type there.

820
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,740
Scott: And there was a Japanese-only thing that someone imported.

821
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:44,080
Scott: But it didn't matter that you couldn't read it too much because it was mostly pictures.

822
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:53,018
Rym: Now, we talked about New Type USA and New Type on the show a few times because it was a moderately...

823
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,200
Scott: New Type USA came out while it was a new thing when GeekNights existed.

824
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,499
Rym: Yeah, in fact...

825
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,260
Scott: There may be a New Type USA episode of GeekNights.

826
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:11,980
Rym: So there is an episode from 2008 when we reviewed Bone and the news for that episode is that New Type USA is dead.

827
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:13,638
Scott: Okay.

828
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:31,460
Rym: So basically, the story is we saw New Type at RIT in the RIT Anime Club library and flipping through it, one, just images of anime we'd never seen or heard of that were like upcoming, that were not available in the US yet and a lot of text that we really wanted to read.

829
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,620
Rym: When New Type USA was announced...

830
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,320
Scott: Mostly pictures, though.

831
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,550
Scott: Yep.

832
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:41,419
Rym: When New Type USA was announced, everyone, like the Anime Club, us, everyone in America, anime fans were so excited about this.

833
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,620
Rym: Finally, the Forbidden Magazine will get access to it.

834
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,120
Scott: I mean, if you looked at a New Type in the early 2000s, if you just had one...

835
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,480
Rym: It was like this big format, like glossy printing.

836
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:53,960
Scott: For a Japanese person, it would be no big deal.

837
00:54:54,161 --> 00:55:06,960
Scott: But for someone outside of Japan who was a fan of anime and manga, seeing one of those things, it was like the print quality, the size of it, the colors on it, it was like an art book, basically.

838
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,780
Scott: It was almost like getting a few pages of art book from every different anime art book and you could somehow get that monthly.

839
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,214
Scott: It was just like this unbelievable thing.

840
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,138
Scott: You wouldn't treat it like some piece of shit magazine like in An America and recycle it, right?

841
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,010
Scott: It would be like,

842
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:22,112
Scott: "Whoa.".

843
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:23,480
Scott: So, fast forward.

844
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,279
Scott: I got a New Type.

845
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,639
Rym: New Type USA comes out.

846
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:31,000
Rym: Like, we, however we knew, like pre-ordered subscriptions to it.

847
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:31,700
Rym: And it wasn't cheap.

848
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:32,840
Rym: It was real expensive.

849
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:35,079
Rym: And we got the first issue.

850
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:40,219
Rym: And what I remember is as I was flipping through it and looking at the pictures, I felt really good.

851
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,860
Rym: But then I read the words and the words were nothing.

852
00:55:44,363 --> 00:55:46,160
Rym: There was nothing in that magazine.

853
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:48,400
Rym: It was just pictures.

854
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,200
Rym: It didn't say anything at all.

855
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,400
Rym: It did not share any useful information.

856
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,180
Scott: It was like, "Hey, this new anime is coming out here.

857
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,997
Scott: Here's all the characters drawn from every different angle by the character

858
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:56,400
Scott: designers.".

859
00:55:56,681 --> 00:56:02,119
Rym: The text under a caption for an image of a character would be like, "This is character so-and-so.

860
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:04,378
Rym: She is very important in the

861
00:56:04,419 --> 00:56:04,580
Rym: show.".

862
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:05,597
Rym: And that's it.

863
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,359
Rym: The interviews were the most insipid.

864
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:13,479
Scott: I mean, the magazine is really useful for artists, cosplayers especially, to get reference for things like that.

865
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:19,720
Scott: And just to look at and see what... It serves the same purpose as like anime chart serves now, right?

866
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,440
Scott: You could judge anime using a new type instead of animechart.net or whatever.

867
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:28,780
Scott: But as a magazine, it left a lot to be desired text content-wise.

868
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:43,340
Rym: Yeah, and it cratered pretty hard as everyone in America simultaneously realized that even if you don't read or speak any Japanese, you get the same information out of the Japanese version as you do out of the very expensive American version.

869
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,780
Scott: Yeah, and it was very expensive either way, right?

870
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,620
Scott: Cos it was so big and fancy and colorful.

871
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:56,880
Scott: Now, the Japanese one did actually include manga in it and manga that were not available anywhere else, right?

872
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,359
Scott: Or at least not anywhere else easily.

873
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,740
Scott: So most famously, Five Star Stories, right?

874
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,540
Scott: Which is a huge deal as it is a fascinating topic in its own right.

875
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,920
Scott: But Five Star Stories is from New Type magazine originally.

876
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,060
Scott: Full Metal Panic also originally from New Type magazine.

877
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:18,440
Scott: And I think what's really funny is that New Type is named after New Types from Gundam.

878
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,420
Scott: And I don't think there was any Gundam... I mean, there have been plenty of issues in there with Gundam stuff, right?

879
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:31,580
Scott: But manga-wise, I don't think there was any Gundam manga published in New Type magazine.

880
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,600
Scott: So that's interesting.

881
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,400
Scott: But yeah, they didn't do that with New Type USA.

882
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:42,279
Scott: There wasn't a manga in it that you couldn't get on its own.

883
00:57:42,986 --> 00:57:44,140
Scott: To sort of carry it, right?

884
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:57,620
Scott: If New Type USA had included Five Star Stories in the same original order that the original New Type did, that's a really strong manga that if people read might have kept buying just to read that, right?

885
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,780
Scott: So, anyway.

886
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:01,714
Scott: As New Type was a big deal.

887
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:12,700
Rym: I guess part of New Type's failure was that that insipid level of information was coupled with the fact that that was around the time when digital fan subs appeared for real and really grew.

888
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:16,220
Rym: And also, legit ways to watch anime made it everywhere.

889
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,180
Rym: And there were websites that actually had real information about anime that you could just look at.

890
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,700
Scott: The New Type USA magazine specifically came too late.

891
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:34,020
Scott: If somebody, maybe five to ten years earlier, had just simul-translated and published New Type Japan in English directly...

892
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:37,620
Rym: Oh my god, if I could have gotten New Type in English...

893
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:39,160
Scott: I think that would have been much more successful.

894
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,340
Scott: Although it still would have been expensive.

895
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:49,360
Rym: But I could have gotten New Type in English in elementary school when I was obsessed with anime, and that would have been the only thing I wanted for Christmas.

896
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:56,540
Scott: If I would have seen New Type on the shelf at the bookstore in the 90s, yeah, I wasn't going to mess up and not buy that.

897
00:58:57,923 --> 00:58:59,540
Scott: Unless it was 40 bucks or something.

898
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:04,380
Rym: And at that point, that insipid, useless information would have been more than I had access to at the time.

899
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,062
Scott: Right.

900
00:59:05,503 --> 00:59:11,458
Scott: So, there was an anime magazine that also appeared very briefly around when I was in college.

901
00:59:11,498 --> 00:59:15,900
Scott: that I did buy, because it was issue number one came out when I was in college.

902
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,956
Scott: And I was like, "Oh, a new anime magazine was called Anime Insider, I

903
00:59:18,996 --> 00:59:19,197
Scott: think.".

904
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:26,740
Scott: And I bought the first issue, and I bought the second issue, and never bought it again, because it was basically Wizard Magazine, but for anime, but worse.

905
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:32,114
Scott: It was so, like, nothing as far as content-wise.

906
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:33,960
Scott: It was just ads and stuff.

907
00:59:34,823 --> 00:59:36,379
Scott: It should have been something to give you for free.

908
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:45,139
Scott: But it existed, and I remember it, because I bought it off the newsstand two or three times when it was new, and then stopped buying it.

909
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:48,732
Scott: But I just remember it clearly, because I was like, "Whoa!

910
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:49,676
Scott: A new anime

911
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:50,358
Scott: magazine!".

912
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:55,400
Scott: And I guess I feel, personally, I like to start with a number one of something.

913
00:59:56,003 --> 00:59:58,720
Scott: So, something bad that just happens to be number one.

914
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,620
Scott: Like, I'll choose that over an America number 100.

915
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,216
Scott: For some reason, right?

916
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:09,980
Scott: But what I think does... So, the last one, does it still exist today, Otaku USA?

917
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:12,840
Rym: I don't know, actually.

918
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:15,640
Scott: Does Otaku USA still exist?

919
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:17,780
Scott: It looks like there's a website.

920
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,240
Scott: Yeah, the sole surviving anime and manga magazine in the United States.

921
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,839
Scott: And their website is things posted today.

922
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,027
Rym: There you go.

923
01:00:26,148 --> 01:00:28,100
Rym: Nike releases some Gundam unicorn sneakers.

924
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,320
Scott: Yep.

925
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:36,640
Scott: So, yeah, I think this might still... If the website still exists, yeah, you can subscribe to it on their website.

926
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:38,099
Scott: They'll sell it to you.

927
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:43,060
Rym: The great and honorable Patrick Macias is still listed as the editor.

928
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,110
Scott: Yep.

929
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:45,934
Scott: Very cool.

930
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,460
Scott: I mean, this... Yeah, this is still a thing.

931
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:54,758
Scott: If you want, like, actual anime articles, content, editorial, right?

932
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,939
Scott: It comes six times a year.

933
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,530
Scott: You know, I don't know if it's just anime.

934
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,440
Scott: I think it's all things Otaku.

935
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:07,020
Scott: Even their website, you know, has headers for games, manga, cosplay.

936
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,820
Rym: I think just between Otaku USA and Anime News Network, your cup overflowed.

937
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:12,203
Scott: Right.

938
01:01:12,244 --> 01:01:14,859
Scott: So, but, you know, Otaku USA is still a thing.

939
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:23,480
Scott: You know, you can get deep dives, real magazine-level, you know, articles about Otaku shit in English.

940
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,820
Scott: I'd actually... Even though I know people who've written for it, worked on it, I've met Patrick Macias briefly one time.

941
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:32,882
Scott: Right?

942
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:34,889
Scott: I know it's existed for many, many years.

943
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,518
Scott: I've never read a single issue of Otaku USA magazine.

944
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:38,140
Scott: I'm not gonna lie.

945
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:38,457
Scott: Yeah.

946
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:39,439
Scott: I've never read it even once.

947
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:40,999
Scott: I just know what it is.

948
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,183
Scott: Was it for Otaku USA?

949
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:48,299
Rym: So way, way, way back, I wrote a, like, it was just published.

950
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,160
Rym: I wrote for one of these magazines a review of an early Otakon, like, as a podcaster.

951
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:58,940
Rym: And I don't remember which of these magazines it was in, but it was, like, a four-paragraph review that I wrote.

952
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:00,740
Rym: And they did, in fact, publish it with my byline.

953
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,799
Rym: And then I didn't have time or energy or care to write any more articles after that.

954
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:05,922
Scott: Yep.

955
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:08,979
Scott: So, yeah, if you like that sort of thing, this exists.

956
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:13,674
Scott: And the subscription cost for one year is 16... Oh, it saves $16 a year.

957
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,100
Scott: So it's 20 bucks a year for the print edition.

958
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,092
Scott: Print and digital combo, 25 bucks a year.

959
01:02:22,313 --> 01:02:23,519
Scott: That's not expensive at all.

960
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:27,379
Scott: If you go for two years, they'll give you a free T-shirt, too.

961
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,866
Scott: So... And that gets you six issues.

962
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:34,480
Scott: 20 divided by six, that's, like, two or three dollars an issue.

963
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:34,942
Scott: Right?

964
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:36,178
Scott: That doesn't seem bad at all.

965
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:38,966
Scott: If you like it, go get it.

966
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,915
Scott: But, yeah, magazines as a whole are mostly dead.

967
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,720
Scott: We'll talk about that next Thursday.

968
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:44,149
Scott: Yep.

969
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,180
Scott: 'Cause next Tuesday we're doing gaming magazines.

970
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:46,842
Rym: Yep.

971
01:02:46,983 --> 01:02:49,260
Rym: And I guess next Thursday we're doing magazine magazines.

972
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:50,639
Scott: That's right.

973
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,219
Rym: Talk about some Reader's Digest and some...

974
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,883
Scott: Time in life.

975
01:02:56,348 --> 01:02:56,870
Scott: Some people.

976
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:58,355
Scott: And also some meta.

977
01:02:58,555 --> 01:02:58,716
Scott: Right?

978
01:02:58,776 --> 01:02:59,820
Scott: Magazines as a thing.

979
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:06,340
Scott: So, yeah, magazine, you know, September is a magazine half-month.

980
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,244
Rym: Highlights?

981
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:08,360
Rym: Sports Illustrated for Kids?

982
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:09,705
Scott: Yeah.

983
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,620
Scott: With regular Sports Illustrated.

984
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,420
Rym: Yeah, I read the... Sports Illustrated for Kids, when we get to that show, was fucking better than Sports Illustrated.

985
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:20,400
Scott: I mean, Teen Vogue is better than Vogue.

986
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,669
Rym: Teen Vogue is, like, consistently better.

987
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:25,200
Rym: Teen Vogue is shockingly a great magazine.

988
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,760
Scott: Teen Vogue might be the best magazine that exists now.

989
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,100
Rym: Like, if you think we're joking, like, we are so not joking about Teen Vogue.

990
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,219
Rym: Like, go read an article from Teen Vogue and we'll see what we mean.

991
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:44,140
Scott: Even if you're not a teen, you know, the only thing that will bother you if you read Teen Vogue if you're not a teen is all the ads are targeting teens.

992
01:03:44,462 --> 01:03:44,575
Rym: Yep.

993
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,099
Scott: And it's mostly ads.

994
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,730
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

995
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:57,870
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

996
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:03,270
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

997
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:06,217
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

998
01:04:06,337 --> 01:04:10,930
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

999

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1000
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,820
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1001
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:21,890
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1002
01:04:22,514 --> 01:04:54,630
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... Because we're going to have a lively discussion about these old magazines.

1003
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:03,710
Rym: And really stay tuned to that Tuesday episode because gaming magazines are probably where we have the most memory and most experience.

1004
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:27,489
Rym: But for now, I leave you simply with... Come on and join the Adelaide Parade.

1005
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,770
Rym: Adelaide to Adelaide.

1006
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:34,810
Scott: We're going to Adelaide's house today.
