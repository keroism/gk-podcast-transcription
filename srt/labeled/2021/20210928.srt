1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,425
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:09,585
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:09,786
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:21,691
Rym: I forgot to push And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:26,660
Rym: tonight we are talking about gaming magazines, you know, like Nintendo power and biz.

6
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:35,613
Scott: Let's do this so astute The listener who may be watching and not just listening.

7
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:42,498
Scott: astute watcher may notice I'm not wearing the headphones that I've worn for at least a year and change.

8
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,139
Rym: Oh, yeah I just I didn't even ask I just assumed.

9
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:54,768
Scott: So I've had this pair of Bose QC 35 to Headphones for a long time.

10
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,020
Scott: They just been in an office unused for all right.

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,940
Rym: You went into your office to get all your crap.

12
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:06,160
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I went to my office to get all my crap which we talked about in a previous episode.

13
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:15,826
Scott: And so I these headphones were among my crap and I went to use them and I was like, oh, yeah These are actually like the best.

14
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:18,194
Scott: Why did I not go get these earlier?

15
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,780
Scott: I could have been using these the whole time.

16
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:27,680
Rym: It's funny because at home like I'm wearing my Sony like studio monitor headphones the closed ones I have just the exact same headphones.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,379
Rym: I have two pair of them one at home and one at work.

18
00:01:29,982 --> 00:01:34,136
Scott: Well, they I had you know, the AKG ones that I've been using at home, right?

19
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:35,100
Scott: We're open.

20
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:47,300
Rym: So I actually have a closed and an open plugged into my computer at all times and I use whichever one Based on like if I'm playing a game or working and I want like I could stalk Emily or hear things.

21
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,845
Rym: So I wear the open ones but recording GeekNights or mastering audio I wear the closed ones or like.

22
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:56,702
Scott: point is I had those because I'd never had to use them in a situation before Right.

23
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,559
Scott: I didn't have to a wear them all day.

24
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:01,547
Scott: Be aware them right while they were in noises.

25
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:06,760
Scott: I was wearing them like alone in an apartment, you know for music or game audio.

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,363
Scott: That was it.

27
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:13,709
Scott: That's those are the only audio that came out of my home computer, but now I'm working at this computer all day.

28
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,060
Scott: I got Spotify going while I'm working.

29
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:22,020
Scott: I got noises coming from open window because the weather is we open window weather now.

30
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:27,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, and as an aside that stop work order out our building is over and they're drilling on the wall again.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:40,477
Scott: Okay, but yeah, you know we used to always make fun of Bose because Bose was I guess in his origin Sort of this audio file brand like overrated like they weren't bad.

32
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:46,219
Scott: They were just way overrated Overpriced and overrated and still a bit overpriced.

33
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,934
Rym: The worst thing is nerds would always be like audio.

34
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:51,666
Rym: people would always be like no highs No lows must be Bose.

35
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:55,120
Scott: What are the audio audio file telling are like above Bose?

36
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,206
Scott: They got to go to somewhere other nonsense.

37
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:05,896
Rym: Oh, I work with someone who's one of those audiophiles and good lord Did he spend like thousands of dollars on preamp our cable?

38
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:18,440
Scott: Yeah But Bose is always like, you know get normal people who you know We'll have money to buy a more expensive thing with that, you know, sort of like a luxury brand in a way.

39
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:25,439
Scott: But but you know, I'm sure some Bose products, I don't know their whole product line ours probably still bullshit like that.

40
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:30,916
Scott: But the quiet comfort noise cancelling headphones are legit.

41
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,020
Scott: They actually have newer ones now.

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,881
Scott: This is 35 2.0.

43
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:40,536
Scott: They have 45 now Which is like a few dollars like tens of dollars more than these and is slightly different.

44
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,980
Scott: I guess super closed.

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,144
Rym: I really like monitors.

46
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,891
Rym: I just Sony above and beyond.

47
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:49,049
Rym: I prefer the closed without noise cancellation No matter how loud my environment is.

48
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,920
Scott: Well, have you had the noise cancellation?

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,640
Rym: Yeah, I find it doesn't matter that much compared to a truly closed like isolating.

50
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,281
Rym: I mean These are.

51
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:06,239
Rym: these are truly closed if I turn the noise cancellation off and it makes an enormous difference With these I literally can't hear anything like at all like Emily Yeller size literally can't hear a thing when these things are on.

52
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:07,817
Scott: I mean, I can't hear.

53
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:08,281
Scott: you know It's.

54
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,940
Scott: I can hear nothing when they're on and I can hear even less when the noise cancellation is on.

55
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:17,785
Rym: I can hear everything through my Sennheiser's Yeah, but anyway, it's.

56
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:25,439
Scott: it does make a huge difference, you know throughout the day right in terms of like just you know Distracting noises and whatnot being heard and such.

57
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:27,305
Scott: You know.

58
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:30,004
Scott: and usually for example right now Podcasting right?

59
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:32,837
Scott: I would usually have to turn Rym up because discord is quiet.

60
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,480
Scott: for some reason.

61
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:34,725
Rym: I don't reason.

62
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,609
Rym: I can explain why.

63
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,276
Rym: if any nerds care I'll do that in the stinger.

64
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,080
Rym: I'll explain why anyway.

65
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:46,000
Scott: So yeah, if you have a pile of money, I do recommend This one Bose product and no others.

66
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:58,158
Scott: And speaking of speaking of getting the shit from the office last episode I did offer up my keyboard as a second dibs my office keyboard and listener purchased it.

67
00:04:58,238 --> 00:04:58,900
Scott: I sent it to them.

68
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,850
Scott: They received it today and they are very happy with it.

69
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,840
Scott: So that's two for two on the second dibs.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,319
Scott: We sold a monitor and a keyboard.

71
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:11,074
Scott: I'll find something else to sell soon because I definitely have some more crap.

72
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:16,074
Rym: I actually have Second dibs when we get to that part of the show, but it's not time for that.

73
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:17,340
Rym: It's time for news.

74
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:18,738
Rym: You can't use that here.

75
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,051
Rym: So, uh, there's a ton of gaming news.

76
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,980
Rym: I think we even skipped a Tuesday show at some point.

77
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,720
Scott: So we're not gonna always a ton of gaming news.

78
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,223
Scott: When is there?

79
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:26,464
Scott: not?

80
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:33,538
Rym: but there was like more than usual between the Nintendo Direct a bunch of old stuff We didn't even talk about and the blizzard story just continuing to it.

81
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,767
Scott: I mean the Gen Con happened.

82
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,477
Scott: a pax happened that you know a tax happen.

83
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:39,099
Rym: We were in debt.

84
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:41,908
Scott: Game devs of color expo happened.

85
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,333
Rym: Oh, there's so much going on.

86
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,239
Rym: So a few things we'll talk about.

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,354
Rym: one There is some big news on the financial side of tabletop gaming.

88
00:05:50,394 --> 00:06:01,963
Rym: if you don't know as Modi As my day as my day The company that basically is the second largest maker of board games in the world Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,295
Rym: I want to say Hasbro is technically the biggest publisher.

90
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,200
Scott: I don't know maker.

91
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:18,331
Rym: Well, they sell most of the articles is so much like way back when we were talking about how complicated and like difficult to summarize the relationships between publishers producers Like development studios in the video game industry is.

92
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,780
Rym: tabletop is getting just as complicated.

93
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:25,919
Rym: So most of the articles refer to them as a maker rather than get into that can of worms.

94
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:37,727
Rym: But anyway, they're basically the big ones They now are responsible for ultimately and own the IP for like most of the tabletop games You probably know about that are right.

95
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,773
Scott: So what happened was way back.

96
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,720
Scott: was it a year few year ago?

97
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:42,847
Scott: I don't know how long ago.

98
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,600
Rym: I feel like we even talked about it on GeekNights.

99
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:53,460
Scott: We did, you know They were already kind of a big board game publisher over in Europe and I forget what the exact order of events.

100
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:57,720
Scott: But they think they were acquired by some sort of private equity.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,353
Rym: Pa I partners one of the bigger like private equity firms in the world.

102
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,136
Rym: They're a big deal.

103
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:03,180
Rym: They seem okay.

104
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,437
Rym: Well, I will not give any judgment on the quality of their purchases because I'm not a financial advisor.

105
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:14,340
Scott: But anyway Anyway, the asthma day started acquiring other board game company.

106
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,911
Scott: Tom is notably fantasy flight, but also others as well.

107
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:26,100
Scott: He man Catan studios days of wonder Yep, so they brought all of these big-time board game places under one roof.

108
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:32,160
Scott: So, you know you think you're a private equity firm, you're either gonna a do some Toys R Us type scamming.

109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,358
Scott: But that's not what's going on here.

110
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,819
Scott: Instead you just you bought this thing.

111
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:41,360
Scott: Your goal is to make it more valuable than it was when you bought it and then sell it, right?

112
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,324
Scott: So they bought asthma day and if they did there are two main methods they did to increase the value of the company As outsiders.

113
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,691
Scott: Sure, they acquired these other board game companies and merge them.

114
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,320
Scott: now, you know one plus one normally equals two.

115
00:07:56,962 --> 00:08:09,980
Scott: But if you get enough big companies together one plus one can equal three because when there's less competition Right and you have more control over the market a bigger market share Suddenly, you know have more power in the market.

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,500
Scott: And even though you only had one plus one the value of the thing, you know of yourself goes up, right?

117
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:24,320
Scott: And the second thing they did was cut right laid people off Got rid of redundancies got rid of you know, things that weren't selling.

118
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:36,075
Scott: Well, if you could just look at fantasy flight alone You can see how much stuff they cut away from that company and got rid of and only kept the business lines That were profitable like the Star Wars stuff.

119
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:42,919
Rym: Yeah, right Like a lot of in games, especially in tabletop for a long time a lot of smaller studios.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,452
Rym: You saw this in the anime industry too.

121
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:45,360
Rym: in America.

122
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:59,220
Rym: The people who ran the companies for a lot of reasons would use profitable things to prop up underperforming things for a lot of different reasons and Private equity generally just says just drop the unperform underperforming things entirely, right?

123
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Scott: If it doesn't make you know, okay sure that thing made money, but it didn't make enough money.

124
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,858
Scott: So getting let's get rid of it.

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,820
Rym: Yep, or that thing makes a lot of money, but it takes up all the time of our best development team.

126
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:18,460
Rym: Let's cancel that whole thing and have this development team work on this other intellectual property that we acquired in this other company and work With those artists and make something that'll sell way more.

127
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:36,792
Scott: Regardless they successfully increase the value of asthma day significantly and now they're attempting to sell it for they bought it for 1.1 point billion euros in 2018. now they're selling it for they're asking two billion So they basically made eight hundred million dollars if they successfully sell.

128
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:40,620
Rym: Yep, never mind any profits They gain depending on the relationship.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,781
Rym: Like.

130
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,299
Rym: I'm not too deep in exactly how their relationship worked.

131
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:47,040
Rym: But any profits they would have taken along the way as well like revenue or anything.

132
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:57,226
Scott: So we'll see if it sells and to whom for how much and that will have a significant impact on the future of Board gaming worldwide.

133
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:05,940
Rym: Yep, and I think your two takeaways are one a lot of nerds Really really misunderstood this news and think that Goldman Sachs is buying as mode a. that is not what?

134
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:18,740
Rym: Oh Many Tweets or like full-on news articles on bullshitty blogs said Goldman Sachs buying games gonna ruin them Like they're just managing the transaction.

135
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:24,619
Rym: I understand that you're mad about capitalism, but that is that is so far from what's happening here.

136
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,109
Scott: If that that would actually be amazing.

137
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,217
Scott: if it happened I could go work for Goldman's right.

138
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,060
Rym: make it work, right?

139
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:37,587
Rym: But Speaking of making a fortune the other thing this actually is really really like the real news here.

140
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:54,760
Rym: Is that board gaming is fucking huge Globally and the fact that these kinds of sales are happening mean that capital like the people who have capital Believe that it is still an underserved and untapped market that we've only scratched the surface.

141
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:59,155
Scott: Part of that value increase was definitely just the growth of the into the.

142
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:00,380
Scott: you know, the pie, right?

143
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,347
Scott: Yeah board games as an industry got bigger.

144
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:10,287
Rym: therefore board game companies got bigger and it's very telling that it's private equity Involved in this and not public companies.

145
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:21,494
Rym: or like Hasbro or something like Hasbro probably couldn't even afford to buy as mode a. It gets real complicated with public companies real copy.

146
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:23,680
Scott: Hasbro, I think has two billion dollars somewhere.

147
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:26,209
Rym: Oh, yeah, but basically what I'm getting?

148
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,439
Scott: Apple could afford a hundred as mode days with just the cash they have.

149
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:45,397
Rym: Private equity is often maligned unfairly though to be fair private equity can suck shit but because capitalism fuck is is terrible, but The difference between a public company and a private company at this scale is not what you think it is.

150
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:55,773
Rym: in general Private companies can take way bigger risks can do a lot more aggressive stuff without having to be beholden to anyone who's holding them accountable because of.

151
00:11:56,134 --> 00:12:04,608
Rym: if a private equity backed company goes under The people who backed it just lose everything like they're just done And they know that risk and that happens all the time.

152
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:09,000
Rym: public companies have a very powerful fiduciary duty to their shareholders.

153
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:15,220
Rym: That's why you see things like in our next news of shareholders suing a company if they believe that company didn't maximize profits.

154
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:28,800
Scott: Private equity can kind of do whatever it wants, but sorry Yeah, I mean like, you know if you invest in a private company, you know If you're on the board of the you know private equity firm, you might be able to choose the CEO of the company, right?

155
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,293
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't have to listen to you that much.

156
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:39,751
Scott: you could change the CEO, I guess Or a private company could donate all its profits to charity.

157
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:42,999
Rym: if a public company just heard that the shareholders could sue over it.

158
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:51,780
Rym: So Generally, what what this means is that people who invest in public companies like rich people with capital.

159
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,595
Rym: Those are generally safer investments that are more regulated more scrutinized.

160
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:56,699
Rym: There's more public information.

161
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:07,719
Rym: Private equity goes after things that are either very risky or things that people who have money and inside knowledge think are way undervalued by the rest of the stock market.

162
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:19,540
Rym: Mm-hmm, I'm generalizing a lot here and this is not investment advice But my read on this is that board gaming has only scratched the barest tip of the surface of the real market.

163
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,504
Rym: Like I think we're in the.

164
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:24,540
Scott: we're also, you know, given the other things going on in board game world, right?

165
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,940
Scott: You know shipping and production and supply chain issues.

166
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:29,030
Scott: We'll see.

167
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:34,851
Rym: Yep So yeah We will see and I think we'll save that for another show in some other news.

168
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:39,326
Scott: if that destroys many smaller board game companies suddenly the big ones get even bigger.

169
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:44,985
Scott: that makes Hasbro and Edmo as modé ever more powerful because the bigger boat is Easier to weather a storm with.

170
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:50,659
Rym: yeah, also a bigger boat has too many people who cannot afford to let it sink Yep.

171
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,260
Rym: So in some other news the Nintendo Direct happened.

172
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,206
Rym: There's a ton of news.

173
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:58,846
Rym: if you want a play-by-play of everything They announced go to a site.

174
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,030
Rym: that'll give you that like.

175
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,980
Rym: we're just gonna talk about the ones that we're interested in.

176
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,309
Scott: Often the big one that no one knew was coming.

177
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,352
Scott: that's a big for us.

178
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,580
Scott: is that that Actra is a remake that came out.

179
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,918
Scott: So now I don't know out there if any if the listener ever heard of Actra is there they had to.

180
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,922
Rym: if you listen to GeekNights.

181
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:17,888
Rym: I feel like we've granted.

182
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:18,712
Rym: I don't think we've talked about.

183
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,922
Rym: Actra is or except in like 2007.

184
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:23,868
Scott: Actra is a Super Nintendo game.

185
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,036
Scott: That was that's truly unique.

186
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:34,080
Scott: not entirely unique But very unique in that a incredible soundtrack a plus soundtrack B. it's two games in one.

187
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,439
Scott: There's a town game and as a side-scrolling normal kind of action guy with a sword game sort of like Strider a little.

188
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:47,328
Rym: yeah that juxtaposition was So crazy to kids when it came out.

189
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,600
Rym: It was like one of the earliest widely known genre destroying games.

190
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:55,999
Scott: Yeah, and the town part affected the the actiony part, right?

191
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:01,660
Rym: You level up your shit you go the actiony part you find an item you go back and use that to help the town part.

192
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:06,486
Scott: right, so the the problem was Actra 2 came out.

193
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:12,754
Scott: cuz Actra 1 was a hit and Act raiser 2 was just the actiony part and was said we are town part.

194
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,400
Rym: We even did a panel on this.

195
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,066
Rym: It's one of the few lost GeekNights panels.

196
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:24,751
Rym: if someone in the audience recorded a panel from like PAX West Called egregiously unrealized potential.

197
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:25,596
Rym: Holy shit.

198
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:27,316
Rym: Get me that video I will die will pay you.

199
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:33,260
Rym: but we only ever did that panel once and Almost everything we talked about except the poke.

200
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:35,309
Rym: I think the Pokemon MMO is the only thing we talked about.

201
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,660
Rym: that has not come true and we talked a lot about.

202
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,623
Scott: I thought it was forgotten.

203
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:42,035
Scott: masters was the one that no one now steal from.

204
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,945
Rym: the forgotten masters also Had some of that.

205
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,160
Rym: but we talked about like SOP with and stuff in that panel.

206
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:53,357
Rym: This one is where we were like bionic commando the remake of the NES game did better than the game.

207
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,250
Rym: They made it to promote Act ready.

208
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,078
Rym: right the point is.

209
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,987
Scott: Released an HD remake of Act raiser.

210
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:03,949
Scott: if you've never played Act raiser in your whole life find a Super Nintendo ROM or buy this thing.

211
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,324
Scott: Interesting notes.

212
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:12,005
Scott: the music in Act raiser was made by the guy who made the streets of rage music

213
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,078
Rym: also a plus and game music and

214
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:30,801
Scott: He said on Twitter he's like hey, you know, I made some extra tracks for this remake and what he did was he made the tracks The old Super Nintendo way right because you can play the remake in old-school mode or recurrent mode quote And he

215
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:37,140
Rym: features an upgrade to use a kosher soundtrack by kosher himself, but you can stick to the original score if you like.

216
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:43,219
Scott: Right, but he may be because most of the tracks were already scored for a Super Nintendo in the 90s.

217
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:50,440
Scott: And then we're sort of HD remade right to be except somebody added new songs.

218
00:16:50,901 --> 00:17:01,556
Scott: So in order to keep everything on the level he composed those new songs in their old-school Super Nintendo Way first and then HD remade those.

219
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:07,655
Scott: that's amazing Yeah, so even though it's the year 2021 if you've never played this game.

220
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,220
Rym: I honestly recommend playing the remake.

221
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Scott: I just assumed it'll be fine, but I'm disappointed that they just didn't make Act raiser 3.

222
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,407
Rym: Yeah, because maybe maybe that's coming.

223
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:16,910
Scott: who knows?

224
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:24,132
Rym: I think it could come because the problem with Act raiser was that The mashup and the music was really all it had going for itself.

225
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:30,918
Rym: because honestly just from a pure game design perspective The town part is simplistic to the point of being insulting and was fun.

226
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,116
Rym: It was to a kid.

227
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:41,066
Scott: That is ultimate fun if you really can't lose at the town part, but if you play it today babies first It's like baby's first popular.

228
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,736
Rym: Yeah, but if you play it today like you'll look at it, and he'll be like.

229
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:44,599
Rym: so I just wait.

230
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:55,212
Rym: You basically just wait pretty much Yeah, but and the platforming part was only okay, it was not bad But it was like a mediocre to average platformer for its.

231
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,780
Scott: It was just a platforming hit guys with sword thing.

232
00:17:57,881 --> 00:17:59,840
Scott: It wasn't anything special about it.

233
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,680
Rym: Yeah, you had pretty limited movement, and it was difficult like very difficult especially in the later levels for kids.

234
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:09,756
Scott: But I'd rather play something like demon sword for NES.

235
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:16,500
Rym: Yeah, absolutely There's a lot of platform 2d platformers from that era that Ninja Gaiden is better than Act raiser.

236
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,282
Rym: Yeah, Act raiser.

237
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:19,204
Rym: You know what it felt like.

238
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,207
Rym: it felt like a lot of parts of Faxanadu.

239
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:27,113
Scott: if anyone remembers that I Rather play Faxanadu than just the action part of Act raiser.

240
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:28,740
Rym: I feel like it's a close race.

241
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,949
Rym: I'd have to play them both again.

242
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,998
Scott: It is pretty close.

243
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:37,160
Rym: Anyway, yeah cuz the thing I don't I can't speak to out of Faxanadu is how NES annoying is it?

244
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:45,995
Rym: I have not played it since I had an NES a little bit, but not too much Yeah, so uh in some other Nintendo Direct News, it looks like the cut.

245
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:54,000
Rym: the original console war is Done to the point that there is now a Sega Genesis classics coming out of the Nintendo switch.

246
00:18:54,481 --> 00:19:02,350
Scott: Well, so the way this is working is that if you have Nintendo online, which isn't free but is inexpensive It's like one annual fee of like 20 bucks.

247
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,174
Scott: It's cheap, right?

248
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,667
Rym: Well, we did the like plan thing So I'm just mooching off of you.

249
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,400
Scott: Yeah, I think the family plan is worth it.

250
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,067
Scott: I don't think the individual plan might.

251
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:09,670
Scott: absolutely.

252
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,800
Rym: I would not pay for it if I had to pay for it.

253
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:13,164
Scott: It depends how much.

254
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:16,736
Scott: if you're playing a Nintendo switch games online a lot, then it's probably worth it.

255
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:35,514
Scott: But anyway the The way that works is if you have Nintendo switch online plan Then you get free access to NES and SNES games and among other games like Tetris 99 and stuff like that Just on your switch for free as part of it not for free.

256
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:36,559
Scott: It's part of the thing, right?

257
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:43,287
Scott: They're adding n64 games and Genesis games Which you know is actually pretty.

258
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:53,335
Scott: the n64 ones are significant because you know emulating those is a little is Still easy, but a little bit different than emulating, you know an NES game, which is trivial, right?

259
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:55,080
Scott: You know, there are difficult.

260
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,767
Scott: It's not difficult like emulating a Saturn game.

261
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:06,148
Rym: Yeah, but like the fidelity is not quite there for most of the emulators The MB the fidelity is there but it's not quite there.

262
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,677
Rym: if you're like speedrunning or something, let's say oh it depends.

263
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,586
Scott: but anyway the point is there.

264
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:19,310
Scott: now the n64 and Genesis games are coming to the switch, but You need to pay more.

265
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:26,819
Scott: you need to get a switch online plus Can you know you pay more money to get those like an upsell to the next level just kind of meh.

266
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:29,980
Rym: Well, the other thing there's gonna be a retro controller.

267
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:37,520
Scott: But well there they already sell retro NES and SNES controllers that you could use with Bluetooth with your switch.

268
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:38,926
Scott: I have the NES one.

269
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:40,413
Scott: It's exactly what you think it is.

270
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,920
Scott: It's a Bluetooth NES controller, right?

271
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:52,040
Scott: But they're gonna sell Genesis ones and n64 ones that are Bluetooth wireless controllers to work with a switch and You can buy those if you have the account, right?

272
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,519
Scott: It's like if you have the account then you can just buy the controller.

273
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:56,671
Scott: Otherwise they won't sell you the controller.

274
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,159
Scott: you could buy one from someone else.

275
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:05,020
Scott: however The Genesis controller they're selling is the original us three button controller.

276
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:10,080
Scott: People in Japan are going to be able to buy a six button Genesis controller.

277
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:22,214
Scott: That will not be sold as far as we know so far in the US which is bullshit because there are Several Genesis games where that controller is basically mandatory Though many where it's not.

278
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:30,307
Rym: yeah Well their argument they made a very clear statement that they're not gonna go back on this and the answer and what they said was For the mass market in America.

279
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,516
Rym: No one ever had a six button one.

280
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,139
Rym: So I had it.

281
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,186
Rym: Yeah, we've only super nerds did most.

282
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:39,780
Scott: most people absolutely needed it to play several like officially the fighting games like Street Fighter.

283
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,024
Scott: It was like essential.

284
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:41,646
Rym: Yeah.

285
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,150
Rym: Well, it's essential if you care.

286
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:51,220
Scott: It's not actually essential to make the game work Super Street Fighter 2 tournament edition was like one of the top Genesis games.

287
00:21:51,406 --> 00:22:01,819
Rym: Oh, yeah But I'm saying their their argument is very few Americans were acquainted with the six button controller at the time The Genesis was available in stores Anyway, so that's just a sad thing.

288
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:09,517
Rym: Any other major news is I mean, yep So the blizzard saga is ongoing and I do want to mention a few updates to that.

289
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:20,300
Rym: So one Cal is a state of California has actually weighed in I think we talked about this a little bit before Accusing blizzard of shredding evidence of abuse in the company.

290
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,959
Rym: So there is a state level like possibly criminal investigation going on as part of this.

291
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:38,957
Rym: Also In in this backdrop the person in charge of overwatch - kind of one of the biggest deal games They're working on has quit blizzard.

292
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:44,039
Scott: You're just leaving So and a lot of people are quitting or a lot of people resigning.

293
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,332
Rym: Oh, yeah, people are quitting blizzard left and right.

294
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,540
Rym: It's not clearly everything.

295
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,520
Scott: You know the the doubt the the worrying started when it became Activision Blizzard, right?

296
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,420
Scott: That was the worrying started but nothing bad happened immediately.

297
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:02,205
Scott: Then there was that big layoff like a few years ago And that's when the.

298
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,731
Scott: that's when it was like, oh that was.

299
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,239
Rym: that was when most of the people I knew who were working at Blizzard at the time we're gone.

300
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:11,599
Scott: Yeah, there was like a big layoff a few years ago, I think it was a news for sure.

301
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:20,831
Scott: I Remember I was why I was the time when I was like playing hearthstone a lot and I was watching a hearthstone streamer And he had to just turn on his.

302
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:26,412
Scott: his partner worked at Blizzard doing something I don't know and he basically had you like.

303
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,760
Scott: he got up there was like, you know to take a phone call.

304
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,737
Scott: He came back and he was like gotta go because his partner was just laid off in the big layoff.

305
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,035
Scott: Yep So turned his stream up.

306
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:46,180
Scott: Oh That was when things started going downhill and then you started to see big names at Blizzard leaving Right, you know the people who ran hearthstone, right?

307
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:58,148
Scott: They left to make a different company and then you started to see like, you know, the CEO right the historic Blizzard people Right, they bailed, you know Yeah, and then the shit hit the fan.

308
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:02,039
Scott: and now it's like, you know, the curve was already downward trending.

309
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,706
Scott: now It's like a straight vertical line.

310
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:06,980
Rym: So with poop at the bottom shareholders have sued Blizzard.

311
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,667
Rym: I think we already talked about that over the sexual harassment and such.

312
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:22,232
Rym: the SEC is now investigating Blizzard over that same situation not as part of that shareholder lawsuit per se just in general and There is some breaking news.

313
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,380
Rym: It looks like from today.

314
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:25,745
Rym: Yeah, this just broke.

315
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:35,985
Rym: It looks like Activision is now agreeing as part of a settlement Just in the just to not win a settlement for I guess the Federal Employment Agency Lawsuit.

316
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:37,340
Rym: there's so much stuff going on.

317
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,099
Scott: I can't actually I can't even tell which.

318
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:46,678
Scott: basically I see headlines that are like bad stuff at Blizzard and I can't tell if it's a rerun an Update or actually a new bad thing.

319
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,429
Scott: So the civil right after bad thing.

320
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:56,796
Rym: in in the middle of all that there was a civil rights lawsuit By the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Blizzard.

321
00:24:57,338 --> 00:25:08,060
Rym: today It was announced that they are settling and with 18 million dollars The company will now put into a fund to deal with and pay victims of harassment and assault within the company.

322
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,005
Scott: Yeah, somebody tweeted.

323
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:15,159
Scott: I don't know if this is true because they didn't cite any facts on this and it doesn't sound true to me.

324
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:27,103
Scott: They tweeted saying that you know Call of Duty something something Activision makes five million dollars a day, which Hard to believe that Numbers handy.

325
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:27,966
Rym: I could look that up.

326
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:30,093
Scott: But yeah, but they're like.

327
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,414
Scott: so they're.

328
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:30,956
Scott: so they were like.

329
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:33,344
Scott: the 18 million is nothing And I'm like that.

330
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:36,212
Scott: that 18 million is kind of nothing to accompany that.

331
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:42,500
Rym: but remember that only deals with one Tiny story in the sea of bad news around Blizzard.

332
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:43,803
Scott: Yeah, it's.

333
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:45,391
Scott: it doesn't mean you know, it's not like.

334
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:47,200
Scott: oh they got off the hook right there.

335
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,103
Scott: They're still in the deep.

336
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:51,718
Rym: This does not resolve any of those other situations that are going on.

337
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:56,994
Scott: Also, I question five million dollars a day on one game.

338
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,540
Scott: Why would you have any other game?

339
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:12,325
Rym: But in other Blizzard news I guess Diablo 2 the remake like came out in the middle of all this and I Didn't actually never played Diablo 2 the original Just played the original.

340
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:19,476
Scott: I mean the remake is probably a little easier user interface wise But also don't give this company any fucking money.

341
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:28,639
Rym: Yeah I do feel like there is a future where The end result of all this is a company with good game design and good people working in it.

342
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:32,660
Scott: But I think it was a blizzard was before it was Blizzard activated.

343
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:42,440
Rym: So some of the one of the several of these things predate the Activision Merger and several of these things were specific to Blizzard executives and early.

344
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:48,140
Scott: I'm not saying that the company wasn't like horribly sexist and toxic in turn with its internal culture.

345
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:49,224
Scott: It was blizzard.

346
00:26:49,305 --> 00:27:00,833
Scott: I'm saying is that before it was before the Activision days It was one of those companies that only produces, you know Well designed hit games every single time.

347
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:04,311
Scott: like you knew if it was a blizzard game It was gonna be a big.

348
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,643
Rym: they still are Accomplishing that.

349
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:13,788
Rym: the people I know who do still work there talk about how that is still true and like now I think that some you know to some degree.

350
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:19,219
Scott: Yes, but also they converted into making everything You know micro transaction money.

351
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:30,019
Rym: well the problem there is that trend is happening everywhere and it's gonna continue to happen because the Meta reality is that there's no way to make money with big games without that.

352
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,352
Rym: Under modern capitalism, you're gonna see that same creep everywhere.

353
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:38,643
Rym: Uh, I mean, there's a real Failing.

354
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:43,400
Scott: they also have made some failing games like the that MOBA the crowd.

355
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:48,474
Rym: So I feel like a good company can rise out of the ashes of this.

356
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:52,451
Rym: but the word Ashes, there's a load-bearing word in my scent.

357
00:27:52,491 --> 00:28:00,522
Scott: at the end of the day no matter what happens There will be a company that owns the rights to Diablo Starcraft Warcraft Etc.

358
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:06,200
Scott: And that company has value no matter what because those brands are so valuable, you know.

359
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:15,402
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

360
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:17,169
Rym: so it's just a little video.

361
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:22,754
Rym: The it's titled if this doesn't win the spill to see our next month And that award means nothing.

362
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:23,798
Rym: and all the video.

363
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,544
Rym: you don't even need to understand anything.

364
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,407
Rym: that's happening in the video.

365
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,050
Rym: read any text.

366
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:29,949
Rym: But if you watch the video, you will see people playing a game.

367
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:34,765
Rym: You will be able to endure it into it from the video which is less than a minute long.

368
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:36,601
Rym: what the rules are to this game?

369
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,934
Rym: This game is amazing.

370
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:43,027
Rym: I would love to see it played in like a PAX or something like an omega-thon.

371
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:43,930
Rym: I'm not even joking.

372
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:51,429
Rym: and this game involves Cash money and mousetraps and blindfolds and that's all I'm gonna say.

373
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:56,170
Scott: I mean if real but like, you know, they're joking if this doesn't win this field this yard.

374
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,143
Scott: But it's like a game that you can a just looking at it.

375
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:02,420
Scott: You want to play it B You don't even need to be taught the rules.

376
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,050
Scott: You can figure them out by looking at it.

377
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,940
Scott: Yeah, it's like a game that can do those two things is already like.

378
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:11,922
Scott: No, you need a genius designer.

379
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,590
Rym: What do we say at all our panels?

380
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:16,066
Rym: Those two things we talked so much about.

381
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:16,550
Rym: elegance.

382
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:19,423
Rym: Nothing is more elegant than a game that Scott just described.

383
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,617
Rym: you look at the board and you go Oh, I know exactly how this game works.

384
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,882
Scott: And you're right.

385
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:24,947
Rym: Yeah, that's the key.

386
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:28,710
Scott: You're right Napoli and say I know how this works and be wrong.

387
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:34,389
Rym: You cannot look at this and you and I both looked at scythe and had an idea about what that game was.

388
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:35,902
Scott: Yeah, we're wrong.

389
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:37,953
Scott: Yeah All right.

390
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:39,659
Scott: So another thing of the day.

391
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,250
Scott: So a lot of computer sciency people.

392
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:49,330
Scott: They love to have these sort of programming competitions where pro you write programs that compete against each other at a game, right?

393
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:59,583
Scott: It's like hey everyone write a chess bot We'll have a have the chess bots have have a chess tournament and we'll see which one wins Right, and then you're I guess the best AI programmer, right?

394
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:10,808
Scott: So a lot of those Projects back in the day used to be you would just program at a bunch of you know hard coded heuristics Which could be very strong And often are still the way to go.

395
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:16,729
Rym: I mean watch me play Bomberman for real and I follow some very simple flow chart rules that will often win me a game.

396
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,449
Scott: Nowadays, you might do some machine learning when your heuristics, you know, can't get you over the last mile or whatever.

397
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:29,181
Scott: So here someone made a competition of basic programming Bomberman bots.

398
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:35,270
Scott: it involves co-op and competitive because sometimes you might have teams And I don't even know what all the rules are because they didn't read them all.

399
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:48,994
Scott: But it's a competition called Bomberland where you have to program a Bomberman bot a Program that will play Bomberman and compete against other programs playing Bomberman to attempt to win at Bomberman and that is Pretty good.

400
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:51,684
Scott: That is anyone entering this.

401
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,310
Rym: Yeah, I you know what I want to see.

402
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:59,929
Rym: I want to see like two years from now and SGDQ where they show off like the ultimate AI that exists in this game.

403
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,795
Scott: somehow I don't know.

404
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:04,330
Scott: But yeah, you can you can enter this thing.

405
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,692
Scott: It's like.

406
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:06,503
Scott: I think it's an ongoing kind of thing.

407
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:10,019
Rym: It's not like a one-shot team In the meta moment the game has.

408
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,570
Rym: book club book is the tale of Genji.

409
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:15,710
Rym: I did not read this weekend, but I was reading for a while ahead of Scott.

410
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,790
Rym: So I think we're still on track to finish in October.

411
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:24,366
Scott: It's weird because if you look at the Kindle report at the bottom, it says I'm like 30% done, right?

412
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:32,730
Scott: But if you look at the chapter number this 50 something chapters and I'm on chapter 20 something that feels like I'm halfway.

413
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:36,789
Rym: Is it a Prince of nothing situation where there's like a hundred pages of glossary?

414
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:37,831
Scott: I do.

415
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:52,045
Scott: Yeah, I don't know either a this big chapters coming up that are long or B There's some sort of post credits shit that's taking up a pile of pages Making me think I'm not as far along as I am or C both.

416
00:31:52,828 --> 00:32:03,010
Rym: Yep Find out we are steamrolling along as Genji continues to sleepwalk through life Discarding women left and right in his pursuit of the little girl.

417
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,796
Rym: He's attracted to that.

418
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:07,687
Rym: He wants to groom into his perfect wife to replace the woman who spurned him.

419
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:12,783
Rym: kinda Man Genji kind of a shitbag.

420
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:20,430
Scott: Yeah Any other meta things we will not be at literally any convention even if they might happen.

421
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:29,947
Scott: Yeah, and if you don't believe us about like we've already not gone to conventions But like we have hockey tickets that we paid for and we're not going to the hockey game.

422
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:34,070
Scott: Yeah We're just losing money technically.

423
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:36,436
Scott: So we're not losing money.

424
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,338
Scott: The money's already lost.

425
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:39,464
Rym: at least those were preseason games.

426
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:41,790
Scott: that that's what are you gonna do in a few?

427
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,179
Scott: Weeks, and there's a real game you gonna go.

428
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:43,904
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

429
00:32:43,924 --> 00:32:44,790
Rym: I haven't thought about that yet.

430
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,210
Rym: I'm just compartmentalizing that I'm gonna think about it this weekend.

431
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:54,582
Rym: You better think fast, yep But otherwise our discords rocking.

432
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:55,830
Rym: we're playing games we're doing stuff.

433
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,258
Rym: It's still warm outside enough to.

434
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,470
Rym: we're still biking a lot, but we're working on some projects.

435
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,723
Rym: I'm working on some panels that might just turn into online panels.

436
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:05,490
Rym: Not at any particular convention.

437
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:11,123
Scott: We'll say I had an idea for a thing and then I actually went to do the thing and it turned out to be not As great an idea as I thought.

438
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:11,609
Scott: so didn't do it.

439
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,532
Rym: I still think it's a good idea But you're gonna.

440
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:18,170
Rym: you gotta wait until you see one of your sources and you're inspired like you see it.

441
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,238
Rym: You're like, that's the one.

442
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:20,810
Scott: I don't think it's gonna happen.

443
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:25,730
Rym: The problem is you're not gonna watch enough of that kind of content to find the one.

444
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:29,662
Rym: Anyway, I mean I'm still working on.

445
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:30,447
Rym: I need to.

446
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:46,595
Rym: I failed and it looks like other people failed to get mega team fortress to work with quake online because the online multiplayer doesn't seem to work with it, but Instead I looks like I can get it to work locally so I can at least get the footage Material and analysis.

447
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,722
Rym: I need to do that our other panel I was talking about.

448
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,576
Scott: you could also get it to work with the not Remaster.

449
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,069
Rym: Oh, yeah, I could do it that way.

450
00:33:53,733 --> 00:34:02,850
Scott: I think the only thing is every player would have to install the mod themselves Identical and then you have to run the server and then everyone have to type in the IP address of the server.

451
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,950
Scott: Oh,

452
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:07,470
Rym: I'd have to run it like completely old-school the way I would have before the quick remaster even existed

453
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:08,610
Scott: Yeah,

454
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:15,829
Rym: which we'll see if I do that or if I just play the game locally and run around with a rocket and a stopwatch And analyze the video to figure out what I need to figure out.

455
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,170
Scott: Yeah, I went online and I downloaded just some maps not mods just maps, you know to get some more deathmatch variation And they totally worked in the remaster.

456
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,130
Rym: But you didn't make that JSON file that you need to make them show up in the menu.

457
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,556
Scott: Even if you did that, it doesn't matter.

458
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:35,498
Scott: The problem is that if I start a server and someone joins the server They'll just be disconnected because they don't have the map.

459
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,870
Scott: it won't automatically download the map to them from the server.

460
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:45,570
Scott: Yeah You have to independently go and get the map and put it in the folder themselves in order to actually play multiplayer.

461
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:54,770
Scott: So I could do that and I could just give you a zip file to all my friends and we could all install the same Maps that I found on the internet or I could just give you the link and you could install the same maps.

462
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:02,860
Scott: But we couldn't get more players in easily because they would have to you know Right and we couldn't communicate with them because they wouldn't get into the server.

463
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,747
Scott: Yes, we switch to a normal map.

464
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:19,390
Rym: now I just look forward to quake to getting the similar treatment because I am confident they will support the popular mods in quake 2 Because nobody would play quake 2 online much unless they included action quake support and lithium deathmatch support.

465
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:32,349
Scott: There is no reason that any mod that is simply maps, you know, and you know Sounds you know those sorts of things right and not anything that modifies the exe file should not just work.

466
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,392
Rym: So, yep.

467
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:40,890
Rym: So, uh, yeah that aside we'll get right into it continuing our two-week long Odyssey into magazines.

468
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:50,400
Rym: We're talking about gaming magazines, which there's way too many to talk about even all the ones we read But any magazines were the biggest deal.

469
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,570
Scott: right if you were a kid in the 90s, there was no internet.

470
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,550
Scott: There was no other news source.

471
00:35:55,771 --> 00:36:04,446
Rym: Like if you were a mega nerd like at the mega ist of nerd you could dial into a BBS that would have information about games.

472
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:06,795
Scott: maybe Maybe but yet there was.

473
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:15,523
Scott: games were a big thing especially video games and there was no information source For video games that was widely available.

474
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,490
Scott: There wasn't a TV show about video games.

475
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,050
Scott: Oh, he's not one that had news regularly, right?

476
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:27,978
Scott: There was like that one work of the game show where kids would run around collecting NES cartridges or Captain N. Yeah, but those didn't give you video game news.

477
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:31,350
Scott: You might see some a few TV commercials for video games.

478
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:38,654
Scott: you might see some ads for video games in like a comic book magazine ads in comic books and piece and dot.

479
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:42,129
Rym: I almost had PC games and ads on TV were how I found out.

480
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:47,026
Scott: about 90% of the video games I cared about might find out about games just because someone else has them.

481
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:51,710
Scott: you might go to Toys R Us And look at the wall of games and just see one that you never saw before.

482
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,725
Rym: Yeah, you might go to that local blockbuster and rent every NES game one by one.

483
00:36:55,745 --> 00:37:00,662
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah, but yet to get information about video games.

484
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,090
Scott: The only real way was magazines.

485
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:08,590
Scott: That was it, you know Cuz no one's uncle actually worked at Nintendo unless you lived in Redmond, Washington.

486
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:09,192
Rym: Right it.

487
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:14,630
Rym: every fucking kid you knew had an uncle who worked at Nintendo and told you a lot of secrets that were not real.

488
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:16,977
Scott: They were not true, but they tell.

489
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:20,989
Scott: then there was the Japanese kid who came who's family moved from.

490
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,315
Scott: you know Japan for real.

491
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:22,857
Scott: who?

492
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,590
Scott: in fourth grade when everyone said what do you want for Christmas?

493
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,103
Scott: He said he wanted a Super Nintendo and everyone was like that doesn't exist.

494
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,814
Rym: I Have a similar story.

495
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,260
Scott: It was we thought he.

496
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,750
Scott: we thought he was making up his uncle working at Nintendo.

497
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,619
Rym: I think this was first grade.

498
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,804
Rym: I might have been second grade.

499
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:43,930
Rym: I'm going based on Remembering what the classroom looked like but we had a guest who came in.

500
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,890
Rym: She was the mother of a Japanese exchange student who was in the school.

501
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:48,361
Rym: so she flew over the u.s.

502
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:53,387
Rym: And she came to our school and She was just like answering questions of all these first graders about Japan.

503
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:59,690
Rym: and then at the end She was like, hey tell me a word and I'll teach you how to write it in Japanese and I raised my hand first.

504
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:07,310
Rym: I was super excited and I was like Famicom and The teacher and all the kids were like what the fuck and she was like, ah Famicom.

505
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,161
Rym: And she was real excited about that.

506
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,710
Rym: and we talked about the NES for a while.

507
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:19,310
Scott: Yeah, anyway Say there was no way to get information about video games except magazines and video games were a big deal.

508
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,022
Rym: Yeah, like before we were born like both of us.

509
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,950
Rym: our families had Atari's and televisions.

510
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:32,959
Scott: Yeah video game video games were a big deal in the 80s and 90s and there were several magazines that were had that sold large numbers of copies.

511
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,346
Rym: now to be clear not just video games because tabletop Dungeons & Dragons like that was also big in the 70s.

512
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,147
Scott: Like there was also no way to get news about those other than magazines.

513
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:45,810
Scott: mainstream.

514
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:54,120
Scott: You know things that publish news about all sorts of topics like newspapers or you know More general magazines didn't talk about that stuff.

515
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,650
Scott: You had to get a specialized magazine.

516
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,656
Scott: Yeah, no other news source that was widely available.

517
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,660
Rym: So I guess we'll go and cut a lot.

518
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,650
Rym: Not only that when one showed up like that we were subscribed to.

519
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:21,246
Rym: Usually it was the fight with me and my brother if we got to read it first followed by it being read and reread and re re re read for an entire month until the next one came

520
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:21,467
Scott: out

521
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,160
Rym: I Would spend a lot of time looking at screenshots of games.

522
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,310
Rym: I'd never played imagining what they might be like.

523
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:40,639
Rym: So just like last week We'll go in vague chronological order and the one I remember the earliest one I remember was literally just called electronic games and I mostly experienced I know that one existed.

524
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,910
Scott: I don't think I ever actually read it.

525
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:55,359
Rym: I experienced it by reading back issues that were like on coffee tables and like on shelves at relatives houses Like I think my uncle had them this - this was talking about like Atari Games and in television games

526
00:39:55,961 --> 00:40:01,190
Scott: and that one goes way back to like the Commodore, you know You know Apple PC type era.

527
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:02,434
Rym: Yeah, like this is.

528
00:40:02,474 --> 00:40:07,790
Rym: this magazine started in 1981 like before I was even born, but yeah, there was no NES.

529
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:11,570
Rym: But that was an era when I was too young to even seek out information.

530
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:33,680
Rym: so I would just read like kids often don't have a sense of time in the pre internet era in that I would get a Bloom County comic or a Dunesbury comic or a Mad Magazine from the 60s like Mad Magazine from the 60s was a Big example where as a kid, that's just this is a funny thing I'm reading and I have no like sense of place or time of the where this artifact came from.

531
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:52,459
Rym: So I'd be reading these electronic games magazines being really excited about like Atari 2600 or Commodore games that were already very old that I just didn't know about But the one you didn't have a lot of information But the one that like changed everything was Nintendo Power.

532
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,790
Rym: for me That was we I remember so clearly.

533
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:12,929
Rym: we were in a superstore in Michigan I think was a Meyers which was one of those like Walmart adjacent type places and we're doing grocery shopping and we hurrying our parents into walking through the video game aisle and we saw a Magazine there called Nintendo Power.

534
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:19,740
Rym: It was in fact the first issue of Nintendo Power and we Convinced our parents to buy it.

535
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,640
Rym: It wasn't cheap for compared to magazines at the time and we basically convinced them to subscribe to it.

536
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:38,420
Rym: We didn't actually get one delivered for like two more months so we had to go back and buy the second issue but starting with the third issue it came and Nintendo Power was my primary interface into the world of gaming

537
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:39,565
Scott: Pretty

538
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,719
Rym: much up until like early high school like late middle school.

539
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,413
Scott: So I didn't get Nintendo Power.

540
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:46,579
Scott: not because I didn't enjoy it.

541
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:50,834
Scott: I bought a few and my brother had a subscription I guess in the n64 days.

542
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:53,929
Rym: He says wow We unsubscribed in the n64 days.

543
00:41:53,969 --> 00:42:03,760
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the reason I didn't go for Nintendo Power is you know I would read one now and again at a friend's house and ever and I'd be like, whoa, right?

544
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,943
Scott: I'd enjoyed it greatly.

545
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:10,017
Scott: but even my kid with brain was like Nintendo makes this magazine.

546
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:11,220
Scott: It's not independent.

547
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:12,889
Scott: I can't be trusting this.

548
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:14,719
Rym: Ah, see I thought of it differently.

549
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,911
Scott: I did not subscribe to Nintendo Power.

550
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:20,440
Scott: I know its contents entertained me greatly.

551
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:22,660
Rym: I knew most Nintendo games for crap.

552
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:31,472
Rym: I knew most video games were crap because I grew up with in the target in television before we even had in any s. But the Nintendo games that were good were so high quality.

553
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,280
Rym: and I wasn't reading Nintendo Power to get news about games.

554
00:42:34,864 --> 00:42:41,260
Rym: I was reading it to learn about Nintendo games I didn't have access to to figure out if they were worth buying not based on their games.

555
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,448
Rym: I didn't know I didn't read the words.

556
00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:45,074
Rym: when I think back to being a kid.

557
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:46,740
Scott: I barely read the words.

558
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:47,827
Scott: Oh, I read all the words.

559
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:59,532
Rym: I read the words like after the fact I'd mostly look at the images look at like maps of games Like I remember looking at the maps of levels of Strider To decide if Strider was worth buying at a garage sale.

560
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,942
Scott: because I saw some actually read all the words in the magazines I bought.

561
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:08,300
Rym: I'd go back and read all the words like later, but mostly I was reading Nintendo Power not to get news.

562
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:23,332
Rym: I was reading Nintendo Power because every issue had at least one article that gave some insight into like the Japanese side of Nintendo or like like a name of someone like Miyamoto would like be mentioned or like so something about.

563
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:27,744
Rym: hey Mario 3, you know, it's coming but here's some like screenshots from it.

564
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:30,191
Rym: and that's what I was reading Nintendo Power for.

565
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:34,509
Rym: and then secondarily I was reading it to get tips about Nintendo games.

566
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:35,579
Rym: I was struggling to beat.

567
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,333
Scott: Hmm well, yeah tips are a thing.

568
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:41,967
Scott: So I bought Game Pro, I think I started.

569
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,654
Rym: Oh games driving to Game Pro.

570
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:50,298
Scott: the first issue I got Magazine world way late.

571
00:43:51,533 --> 00:44:05,515
Scott: Yeah yeah had Mortal Kombat 2 on the cover and It had inside a guide for doing combos in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo right or yeah, Super Street Fighter 2 in the arcade, right?

572
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:10,612
Rym: So I went for reviews compared to Nintendo Power.

573
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:14,712
Scott: Well, so with Game Pro, right, you know I was reading all the words the letters.

574
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:15,860
Scott: column was a lot of fun.

575
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,140
Scott: Yeah, you know the the editors had all these personalities.

576
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:25,060
Scott: The biggest most famous editor was scary Larry who I'm pretty sure works at Nintendo Company and or still works there.

577
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,489
Scott: He's we definitely did work there.

578
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:28,038
Scott: I think he still does.

579
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:35,281
Scott: And then you know, there would be a section in the back that you know had a few pages of like arcade stuff and foreign Stuff.

580
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,509
Scott: right, you know, like oh my god, look at this machine.

581
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,552
Scott: One arcade machine.

582
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:39,676
Scott: You'll never play.

583
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:48,480
Scott: Yeah, right There were some tips and things in there but often they were not for games that I had so they didn't help me that much.

584
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:54,402
Scott: Yeah, I was mostly just actually looking at you know news from the world of you know Video games like.

585
00:44:54,422 --> 00:45:00,020
Rym: what's happening was definitely more like news and reviews for me as opposed to Nintendo Power, which was mostly tips and tricks.

586
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:07,100
Scott: Yeah, so But yeah, I subscribed to Game Pro like even up until the all the way through college.

587
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:15,657
Scott: I think I stopped subscribing when he lived in Beacon at some point Mmm, and then I gave all the magazine to some teacher who used him for a craft project.

588
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:19,810
Scott: I think They're all in archive or online.

589
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,840
Rym: you can we ever actually subscribe to Game Pro?

590
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,544
Rym: I just like read copies of it laying around read him in Walden books that kind of thing and I'd Subscribe to it.

591
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:30,376
Scott: I got every single for like years and years and years.

592
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,320
Scott: I got every single one.

593
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,220
Scott: It definitely went downhill over time as those editors all left and all those writers left.

594
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:44,534
Scott: It was literally just at some point, you know You're just printing what big game companies wanted them to print right ads advertorials.

595
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:45,898
Rym: Yeah, that's our.

596
00:45:45,938 --> 00:45:54,311
Rym: but that even for me We're still way later because even before I was reading Nintendo Power like around the same time I was getting Dragon magazine, but not subscription.

597
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,295
Rym: that shit wasn't cheap either.

598
00:45:55,315 --> 00:46:08,439
Rym: I was buying random one-off episodes of our episodes issues of Dragon magazine With like my allowance money at the local gaming store from like this giant cardboard box of just one's going back into the 70s.

599
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:12,169
Scott: Yeah, I didn't do that because I was like I ever bought.

600
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:15,320
Scott: I don't did I ever buy a dragon or dungeon magazine.

601
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:35,627
Rym: I probably bought easily 50 or 60 Individual issues of Dragon magazine before I was able to afford to a subscription to Dragon magazine Long time when in the era where D&D was the only TTRPG for me right in the in those days You know high school college earlier.

602
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:41,125
Scott: Oh, yeah, you started way later than me, but I was also He middle school out played.

603
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:45,960
Scott: but I was basically like a core book only person, right?

604
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:53,014
Scott: I was like member in college that you guys would always buy like, you know When third edition was the thing you guys are always buying like sword and this or cuz.

605
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:55,827
Scott: that's where I was like, oh, sorry I was like.

606
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:58,142
Scott: I do not buy any extra stuff I buy.

607
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:01,072
Scott: my place is look Dragon magazine was the magazine.

608
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:06,630
Scott: Dragon magazine felt to me like Extra extra stuff except it wasn't what your.

609
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,980
Rym: but the funny thing is that was basically dungeon magazine.

610
00:47:10,101 --> 00:47:20,119
Rym: Dragon magazine was pretty much a lot of commentary Advice news ads Miniature nonsense like there was a lot going even at video game reviews.

611
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:26,280
Rym: But I just think there was a lot going on in Dragon magazine, but it wasn't just here's supplements for your game.

612
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,222
Rym: It was mostly commentary and articles and stuff just like long I mean, I saw a dragon magazine at the game store, but yeah I never.

613
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:34,733
Scott: I don't think I ever really read it that I didn't have.

614
00:47:34,873 --> 00:47:36,360
Scott: I think there was a comic that was in it.

615
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:38,629
Rym: There were multiple comics in it.

616
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:40,959
Rym: nights at the dinner table is the one a lot of people remember which?

617
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,425
Scott: well That's its own thing now, right?

618
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:44,535
Rym: Yeah, but a few other print I think.

619
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:45,580
Rym: oh, what was the name?

620
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,311
Rym: There was one about a henchling.

621
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:48,620
Rym: I forget what it was even called.

622
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,698
Rym: There's a bunch of comics in it.

623
00:47:50,041 --> 00:48:03,229
Rym: It had a but it had a whole like comic section at the end, but it was so dense with content that I read dragon magazine religiously Pretty much through all of elementary school and into middle school.

624
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,940
Rym: in the era before I had people to play D&D with and then in.

625
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:14,160
Rym: But I finally had people to play with when we were playing either rules cyclopedia D&D or like a D&D first edition.

626
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:21,708
Rym: By then I was playing actively and also using dragon magazine And I subscribed to it well into RIT.

627
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:27,267
Rym: dragon magazine was like a big part of my life until I don't remember a dragon Magazine ever showing up at the apartment.

628
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:28,532
Rym: Yeah, they arrived.

629
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:29,175
Rym: I kept getting them.

630
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:29,537
Rym: I had them.

631
00:48:29,557 --> 00:48:30,300
Rym: There's a giant pile.

632
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,625
Scott: I never remember a single.

633
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:34,014
Rym: Yeah, I you never read it.

634
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:35,158
Rym: You never seem to go.

635
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,203
Scott: I didn't But I didn't read it.

636
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:38,788
Rym: dragon magazine was pretty legit.

637
00:48:39,249 --> 00:49:00,172
Rym: The only complaint I really have about it as like having escaped the orbit of Dungeons & Dragons was that dragon magazine's essays were very typical of the D&D discourse that happens today just on the internet where People were writing big essays about how to fix problems that are only problems if you're an insufferable shithead.

638
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:06,286
Scott: I Because people don't change right?

639
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:09,235
Scott: Yeah, it's like they're still playing the same game D&D.

640
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:10,740
Scott: Yeah, and you're still a shithead.

641
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:19,024
Scott: So you're gonna right have the same problem and write the same solution over and over again And you're not gonna stop playing D&D or every D&D Conversation.

642
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:20,269
Rym: the discourse that

643
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:21,895
Scott: is gonna stop being a bad person that has

644
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:47,379
Rym: happened about the rules Seems to all be the same as the article I read in dragon magazine as a kid called romancing the stone skin, which was about Literally how to prevent your players in second ed D&D and a D&D from abusing the stone skin smell because that was considered a Significant problem and I cannot describe to you how much discourse there was about that specific problem on.

645
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,920
Rym: It was an alt fan D&D whatever the whatever the alt net board was for Dungeons & Dragons.

646
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:59,380
Scott: So the other big thing I guess is mostly middle school times, you know late late middle school was you know?

647
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,031
Scott: Magic the Gathering when CCG's became a thing.

648
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:04,240
Rym: Yeah, there were only two magazines.

649
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,467
Rym: Scry is no inquest.

650
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:11,500
Scott: Yeah, there were no way to get news about those either other than magazines.

651
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,074
Scott: So there was inquest magazine scry magazine and I think another one that we didn't have.

652
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:18,960
Scott: the internet says there was one called duelist But I never had that.

653
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:22,700
Rym: Everyone I knew would talk about scry when I was in middle school like big into magic.

654
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,249
Rym: So one day scry was.

655
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,396
Scott: there was scrying inquest.

656
00:50:25,477 --> 00:50:29,840
Scott: at the time I felt like they were both kind of equal and they were both honestly super shitty.

657
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:31,946
Scott: Yeah, that they didn't really.

658
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,819
Scott: they were mostly just ads for you know.

659
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,766
Rym: Oh, I was even working out.

660
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:41,340
Rym: scry was mostly the sheet of the current going rate of every magic card.

661
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:46,780
Scott: Yep, because there weren't there were so few at the time that you could put them all in a magazine.

662
00:50:46,861 --> 00:50:58,139
Rym: Yeah for a complete price card I would borrow my friend's copy of scry just to keep up to date on what my magic cards were worth so I could go sell The ones that were valuable to make money to buy more magic cards.

663
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:04,460
Rym: That was like a big part of my middle school life was selling valuable magic cards to get more really magic.

664
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:14,723
Scott: These magazines did not have any helpful information in terms of strategy, you know, oh scry was absolute Garbage content.

665
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,869
Rym: other than that priceless like it was just.

666
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:20,640
Scott: it was just ads just buying into the might as well.

667
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,873
Rym: I've just been Laura Mipson text for all.

668
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,000
Rym: I gave a shit about scry.

669
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:30,300
Scott: Yeah, but CCG's were such a big thing at the time and there was no information source for them.

670
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,980
Scott: So if you were into them those mag and you didn't have you weren't like part of a community because you were just a little kid.

671
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,680
Scott: Yeah, the magazine was like your key to knowing what the hell was going on.

672
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,880
Scott: Like, you know knowing that there was a new set coming to the comic shop, right?

673
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,121
Scott: It's like.

674
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,440
Scott: I didn't know otherwise that would have showed up seen Ice Age and we're like, what the hell is that?

675
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,213
Scott: Yeah, thanks to the magazine.

676
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:49,040
Scott: I knew what the hell it was.

677
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:55,780
Rym: The full title of scry was technically scry collectible card game checklist and a price guide.

678
00:51:56,843 --> 00:51:59,060
Rym: Yep, that tells you everything you need to know about it though.

679
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,716
Rym: fun fact dragon magazine was how I learned about magic the gathering because remember interesting.

680
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:11,196
Rym: so there was a D&D CCG that came out right after magic where they tried to hop on that train like everyone did.

681
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,139
Rym: it was terrible It was so bad.

682
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:21,580
Rym: But dragon magazine had an article about magic the gathering where an editor like played it and reviewed it and I was fascinated.

683
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:25,620
Rym: But kid brain I didn't realize they were talking about magic.

684
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:31,740
Rym: So I bought the D&D collectible card game and it was so bad that I like was offended.

685
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:43,919
Rym: But - I think it was - two or three dragon magazines later All the articles were about how every D&D group got completely ruined because the players don't want to play D&D They show up and then they want to play magic.

686
00:52:45,324 --> 00:52:45,851
Scott: It's a better game.

687
00:52:46,114 --> 00:52:48,324
Rym: Yeah But that was like the -.

688
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:48,706
Rym: I learned

689
00:52:48,726 --> 00:53:00,744
Scott: about magic because some kid I was friends with brought it over to my house and we Played it and then I saw the box the little starter box that his revised starter box And I was like, I've seen those at the store on the counter now I know what the hell that is.

690
00:53:00,865 --> 00:53:05,960
Rym: I started playing I started playing in the middle of unlimited run anyway.

691
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,329
Scott: So last some last magazines here.

692
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:14,067
Scott: There's a magazine that I've read a couple times I haven't bought it called Game Informer.

693
00:53:14,488 --> 00:53:20,108
Scott: And the thing that's notable about Game Informer is that it's owned by Gamestop Yeah, so even worse.

694
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,560
Scott: I don't know if it still is but it might still be if it still exists.

695
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,840
Scott: Yeah, Gamestop is still the publisher Yeah, but even worse than Nintendo Power, right?

696
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:39,660
Scott: There was official PlayStation magazine things like that which were effectively the same as Nintendo Power But a magazine owned by the retailer felt to me as even worse than that, right?

697
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:43,892
Rym: So apparently it's a weird scam.

698
00:53:44,032 --> 00:53:52,815
Rym: In 2017 the total circulation of Game Informer was 7.5 million and it was the fifth most popular magazine in America.

699
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:53,618
Scott: It's huge.

700
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:54,540
Scott: Absolutely huge.

701
00:53:55,102 --> 00:54:00,079
Rym: But it appears that almost all of that circulation was copies that were put into Gamestops that no one ever read.

702
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:11,097
Scott: Also true Also, I think like if you were like doing if you were a big kid who is doing a lot of you know If we were younger, we would have been those kids who were constantly buying and selling games.

703
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:11,900
Scott: Oh, yeah Gamestop.

704
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,420
Rym: That's why I don't begrudge those kids.

705
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:17,300
Scott: I think if you did that and you got the Gamestop card and stuff you got Game Informer.

706
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,352
Rym: Yeah, by then I was already an internet citizen and I didn't need any of that crap anymore.

707
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,880
Rym: But yeah, I understand why kids are the way they are.

708
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:27,829
Scott: Yeah, so Game Informer was a thing.

709
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:28,852
Scott: so there was in the.

710
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,200
Scott: there was also the PC gaming magazines, right?

711
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,320
Scott: So the thing about the PC gaming magazines that set them apart was a. they could come with games.

712
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:42,746
Rym: You couldn't do that for like, you know that the sole reason I subscribed to PC gamer was to get that fucking disc and later That CD.

713
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:43,720
Scott: I didn't subscribe.

714
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:53,684
Scott: I would just buy issues on the shelf if I saw that the CD was advertising games that I didn't already have demos of or shareware of Cuz.

715
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:54,527
Scott: they'll always share where.

716
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:55,853
Scott: they never gave you full versions on that.

717
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:59,085
Rym: Oh, no thing is as a kid Kind of didn't matter.

718
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:02,436
Rym: I played the doom shareware for a long time.

719
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:03,740
Rym: It was perfectly happy with it.

720
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:08,980
Rym: I never had the real version of One Must Fall 2097 or Rapture Call of the Shadows.

721
00:55:09,703 --> 00:55:13,058
Scott: But I wouldn't had any version if it wasn't for a PC gamer CD-ROM.

722
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:17,216
Rym: Yep PC gamer which also had that racist coconut monkey caricature.

723
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:18,080
Scott: That's coconut monkey.

724
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,760
Scott: So if you put that CD-ROM in your computer, it wasn't just a CD-ROM full of demos.

725
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,639
Scott: There was sort of like this little application that was sort of like a front end.

726
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:29,220
Rym: I installed that shit every time I got an issue.

727
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:39,340
Rym: That was an era when you could take a random disc sent to you by a magazine and it honestly wouldn't fuck your computer up And they would put little Easter eggs in it and it was cute and sometimes funny.

728
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:46,160
Rym: But yeah nerds would like scrutinize the files on those discs and later those CDs to like try to figure stuff out about games.

729
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:50,032
Scott: But PC gamers mascot was this racist coconut monkey.

730
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:51,236
Scott: That would be like hello.

731
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:52,540
Scott: I am coconut monkey.

732
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:53,905
Scott: Yeah, it's like whoa, dude.

733
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:55,310
Scott: Whoa at the time.

734
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:57,860
Scott: I thought it was just a cute monkey, but now it's like whoa.

735
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:13,899
Rym: Yep, like Apu was offensive as a caricature and coconut monkey is way worse than a coconut monkey like Left through warp speed beyond Apu into a terrifying realm that as a white kid growing up in the Midwest I did not even like get it.

736
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:24,499
Scott: Yeah There were some other PC gaming Magazines besides PC gamer even though PC gamer was the biggest one and they also had CDs a game where I think also felt like the most Respected one.

737
00:56:25,169 --> 00:56:26,562
Scott: Yeah, definitely I think.

738
00:56:26,582 --> 00:56:30,654
Scott: the other thing that said PC gaming magazines apart was that they would talk about hardware.

739
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:32,540
Scott: you GamePro would never talk about hardware.

740
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,004
Scott: It was all about games.

741
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:37,414
Scott: right and Nintendo was only about Nintendo games PC gamer.

742
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,400
Scott: You would see ads like voodoo card.

743
00:56:39,804 --> 00:56:48,120
Rym: Yeah, PC gamers How I learned about like glide drivers and like when video cards became a thing for real what the deal was with video cards.

744
00:56:48,623 --> 00:56:55,635
Scott: Yeah, I think that's why we mentioned it even a little bit in our tech Episode because it was like partially a tech magazine.

745
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:58,900
Scott: right because it was PCs and the games that you played on them together.

746
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:09,374
Rym: Yeah and pretty much for me PC gamer like the content was great right up until I stopped reading it and the sole reason I Stopped subscribing to PC gamer was the internet.

747
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:09,996
Rym: 100% replaced everything.

748
00:57:10,036 --> 00:57:11,140
Rym: I was getting out of PC gamer.

749
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:13,013
Scott: I can download demos now.

750
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:13,094
Scott: Bye.

751
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:17,189
Rym: Also, hey people are reviewing games online.

752
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:18,231
Rym: All right, cool.

753
00:57:18,252 --> 00:57:21,300
Rym: I don't even I don't even trust game reviews anymore.

754
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:29,030
Rym: yeah, I don't read reviews like I died like I don't know if it's obvious but We basically don't use game reviews at all.

755
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,540
Rym: Like I don't use reviews of anything, right?

756
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,995
Scott: It's like a lot of board game people are like out there, you know going to like.

757
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,300
Scott: there's all this board game media.

758
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:43,960
Rym: You know like so-and-so, you know, I almost never read game reviews of any kind.

759
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:53,012
Scott: I only don't play games and I do not consume reviews of pretty much media Period movie reviews book reviews nothing.

760
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:53,735
Scott: I just don't.

761
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:54,920
Scott: I don't need them.

762
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,084
Scott: I know what I want.

763
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:58,994
Scott: All I need to know is what it is and when the release date is.

764
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:09,418
Rym: I will sometimes read a review mostly when I'm doing research for a panel or trying to get better at a game but Not to decide if I like the game or not or should buy it or not.

765
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,660
Rym: for sure Hmm.

766
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:12,467
Scott: So just brief mentions.

767
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:14,114
Scott: There was a magazine called EGM.

768
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:15,057
Scott: It's like trying to gain.

769
00:58:15,218 --> 00:58:17,485
Rym: Oh, yeah Stay tuned Scott.

770
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:18,809
Rym: Yeah, stay tuned.

771
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,454
Scott: I don't know if it still exists.

772
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:21,758
Rym: Oh, it still exists.

773
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,885
Scott: I found it Okay But does it still?

774
00:58:25,925 --> 00:58:30,020
Rym: if anyone knows what the fuck I'm referencing you are one of the original listeners of GeekNights.

775
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:30,779
Rym: I'll just leave it at that.

776
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,176
Scott: I don't know if it's still in print, but it was like to me.

777
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:37,108
Scott: it was the most generic Gaming magazine like.

778
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:41,980
Scott: it just covered all video games Reprinted press releases, you know just industry shill.

779
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,234
Scott: You don't have anything valid but it.

780
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:45,240
Rym: but I

781
00:58:45,420 --> 00:59:02,520
Scott: Also have this memory that probably would be confirmed if I bothered to google it that it had a long history Right that like old like it feels like that was an old magazine That had you know, like a history of being really good and then just fell from grace over time.

782
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:04,262
Scott: That's like.

783
00:59:04,282 --> 00:59:09,140
Scott: that's what my I don't know if electronic gaming monthly is related to electronic games, which is an old magazine.

784
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,484
Scott: So there could be some confusion.

785
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:11,346
Scott: I don't know.

786
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:18,507
Scott: and then lastly I want to give a brief mention to games magazine Which is not much of a magazine.

787
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,858
Scott: It's mostly crossword puzzles and things like that.

788
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:22,299
Rym: Oh, oh, yeah I know what you're talking about.

789
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:37,140
Scott: Yeah It's basically this magazine that comes out and it has like a variety of you know, little puzzles crossword word search Cryptograms all that sort of stuff, but I think it's notable, you know, because you could just buy a collection of those puzzles.

790
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,626
Scott: Why would you buy games magazine?

791
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:41,378
Scott: There are two things I remember about games magazine.

792
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:43,384
Scott: granted I haven't read one since the 90s.

793
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:44,046
Scott: is that a?

794
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:51,969
Scott: it would actually talk about like, you know things happening in the sort of the Puzzle game adjacent world.

795
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:52,932
Scott: It was like a little bit.

796
00:59:53,013 --> 00:59:57,479
Scott: It did have some content in the front And I think it might have even had a letters column.

797
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:09,285
Scott: but B it was sort of like this hotbed of You know, like here's a new kind of puzzle right and things like that like puzzles you hadn't seen.

798
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:18,518
Scott: there isn't some collection of like a Thousand of these puzzles in a book because they weren't sure yet if that kind of puzzle was gonna be popular.

799
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,065
Scott: So It's like before.

800
01:00:21,105 --> 01:00:25,238
Scott: there was a book with like a thousand Sudoku's in it because Sudoku wasn't a big thing in.

801
01:00:25,278 --> 01:00:28,816
Scott: the u.s Right games magazine would have a Sudoku in it.

802
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,496
Scott: Yeah And then that's how they found out that Sudoku was a big deal.

803
01:00:32,536 --> 01:00:39,080
Rym: as to think it is I don't know so long as I kind of last and least Dungeon magazine which I didn't really actually talk about the deal with that one.

804
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,670
Rym: Oh, I never subscribed to it because it was way expensive.

805
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:43,377
Scott: Well, I just knew it existed.

806
01:00:43,417 --> 01:00:44,160
Scott: I never looked at it.

807
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,440
Rym: So it wasn't like the sister to dragon magazine in any real way.

808
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,345
Rym: It was just if dragon magazine was.

809
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:51,451
Rym: essays articles content.

810
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:53,096
Rym: dungeon magazine was.

811
01:00:53,437 --> 01:00:54,460
Rym: here are four modules.

812
01:00:55,383 --> 01:00:56,206
Rym: Every issue was just.

813
01:00:56,326 --> 01:01:00,040
Rym: here are specific modules for D&D games.

814
01:01:00,101 --> 01:01:01,900
Rym: You can just run these as a game master.

815
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:15,980
Rym: The idea was only game masters subscribe to it and read it and players were encouraged not to read it because it had like The stories that your game master might just run for you But the way I would be less expensive than buying actual modules.

816
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:20,484
Rym: Yep, it was also a way just to find interesting modules Like it was just.

817
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:28,360
Rym: it was a wide range of content But generally what I would do is buy old back issues from the dollar bin at that same game store.

818
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:29,988
Scott: I'm an easy like that.

819
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:30,611
Scott: It's like there's.

820
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:32,340
Scott: no it doesn't matter.

821
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,985
Rym: It's like the only ones are better one.

822
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:43,442
Rym: because my players were very much less likely to have read a dungeon magazine from like mmm, I Want to say it's.

823
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:47,879
Rym: I don't think I actually had any issues of dungeon magazine from before like the late 80s.

824
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:52,092
Rym: Oh, yeah, I didn't even see a magazine.

825
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:52,856
Rym: so it's probably early 90s.

826
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,737
Scott: Yeah, so yeah when it comes to gaming especially magazines were the key way to get news about it in the 80s 90s.

827
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,288
Scott: Yeah, the internet became a thing in the mid 2000s.

828
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,096
Scott: And so being nerds of the time.

829
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:06,400
Scott: We read a lot of them nowadays.

830
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,127
Scott: They're useless.

831
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:08,399
Scott: They don't never reason to exist.

832
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:15,680
Rym: Yep, and the content that was really timeless from these things mostly essays has migrated online pretty effectively.

833
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,500
Scott: There is a lot of thankfully scans of most of these magazines are on the internet.

834
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:29,436
Rym: Oh, yeah, but also just people are writing very insightful essays on game design and games Even just for free and putting them online like that content is just out there.

835
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:30,419
Rym: or Twitter threads?

836
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:36,740
Scott: Yeah, there are Twitter thread to subscribe to get to a magazine to get the equivalent of a current Twitter thread I get for free.

837
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,315
Rym: Yeah Now I can just follow Cole early on Twitter and he'll just throw insights at me randomly.

838
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:45,375
Scott: people on board game geek Just throw down whole like these design diaries.

Rym: and the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol Ellen Joyce link eg dread Lily Tenerbrae Chris for armor Clinton Walton decks Finn just like a dude guy.

847
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:36,194
Rym: kashaya Hi 85.

848
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:42,562
Rym: Rebecca Dunn review mad bull 34 cowards Ryan Perrin Sam Erickson sure I'm on home Taylor Braun underground pro law.

849
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:43,185
Rym: it appears right.

850
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:44,170
Rym: seed ab threat open.

851
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:48,390
Rym: You hold the key to my heart and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

852
01:03:48,510 --> 01:04:06,250
Rym: so yeah, if you plug professional audio equipment like say the beta 87 a microphone that I have plugged into a audio device via USB and all this nonsense and you try to use it in something like zoom or discord what you'll often find is That you are quieter than other people.

853
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:20,674
Rym: The main reason for that is that to ensure that you're not clipping and to take advantage of all the headroom on such a professional device you tend to have Relatively low levels so that even very large spikes are Accommodated by the hardware.

854
01:04:21,115 --> 01:04:26,490
Rym: and then in post-production or in live like say on the stream you run it through a compressor.

855
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:36,015
Rym: But generally consumer level stuff and gamer headsets will pre compress the audio to make it Apparently louder.

856
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:52,845
Rym: so you have compressed audio where you've lost fidelity but it has a total higher average amplitude compared to Audio that has a lower average amplitude because it can accommodate and Include all of that extra information that would otherwise be lost.

857
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:59,910
Rym: with all of this combined Basically fancy microphones sound quieter in things like zoom and discord than crappy gamer microphones.

858
01:05:00,492 --> 01:05:05,507
Rym: So, uh, there's really no easy way around that unless I actually have discord.

859
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:13,529
Rym: pick up a mix Separate from my main direct input and run that through a processor that will compress the audio and then amplify it.

860
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,213
Rym: So, yeah, there you have it.

861
01:05:16,514 --> 01:05:24,194
Rym: But anyway for right now, I leave you with Christianity again.

862
01:05:25,016 --> 01:05:27,864
Scott: after cowboys you went all the way back around.
