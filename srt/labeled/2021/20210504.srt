1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,638
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 4th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:10,879
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:14,265
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,734
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,527
Rym: Tonight, we're reviewing the game you might have heard of, Super Mario Bros.

6
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,190
Rym: 3.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,228
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,249
Rym: So, yeah, got my second COVID shot.

9
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:28,389
Scott: Okay, me too.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,797
Rym: Yeah, it was an interesting experience.

11
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,302
Rym: I got Moderna.

12
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,907
Rym: I'm not going to pretend I didn't get side effects.

13
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:34,810
Rym: I had a pretty rough day.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,509
Scott: But I didn't have my arm hurt.

15
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,590
Scott: Yeah, it felt like someone punched my arm and like it was a bruise there, even though there wasn't.

16
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,489
Scott: And then that lasted not very long.

17
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:44,510
Rym: Yeah, it's fascinating.

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,250
Rym: That was a wide spectrum of like levels of side effects ranging from nothing to like two days of like bad feelings before you're good again.

19
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:56,807
Scott: Like, you know, some of my coworkers reported like they were.

20
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:57,550
Scott: they were blah.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,390
Scott: And then suddenly it went away after like, you know, a day or whatever.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,541
Scott: But, yep, nothing happened to me on either shot.

23
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:07,010
Scott: I just took both and I was just like, OK, my arm hurt.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,090
Rym: Yeah, I had a really strong reaction for the first like thirty six hours after my second shot.

25
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:16,970
Rym: But it was almost fascinating because it was like it felt bad, like real bad.

26
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:19,750
Rym: But at the same time, I knew I wasn't sick.

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,512
Scott: You should lie.

28
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,521
Scott: And, you know, I mean, I don't lie, but you should because then you're going to.

29
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,330
Scott: people are not going to want to get it because they're pretty side effects.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,355
Scott: You should be like, oh, it was great.

31
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,923
Scott: It felt like I was high.

32
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,290
Scott: I felt like I was doing things.

33
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:35,650
Rym: The problem is then there's a disconnect between like when dare said, hey, kids, don't do drugs, drugs suck.

34
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:37,417
Rym: And then they tell you about drugs.

35
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,270
Rym: And the way they describe me, you're like, wait, drugs sound awesome.

36
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,089
Rym: And then they're like, no, but the weed will kill you.

37
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:47,869
Rym: And then when a kid finds out that weed might not be great for other reasons, but it won't kill them, they question everything else.

38
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,454
Scott: Hmm.

39
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:50,501
Rym: So I don't want to lie.

40
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,690
Rym: Like I had pretty bad side effects.

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,090
Rym: But the feel like once the side effects passed, like a day goes by, I gave up a Sunday.

42
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,510
Scott: The feeling of liberation, even despite the fact that I'm not going to get it, honestly, should have gone on a Monday or a Friday.

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,274
Scott: So you don't lose a weekend.

44
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:06,835
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:12,170
Scott: You know, knowing that the side effects are possible, you should go in a weekday, do it on a weekday, make work, pay for the shit.

46
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:13,231
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:18,510
Scott: My work said, you know, if you're going to go get vaccinated, don't even use vacation days or sick days.

48
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,496
Scott: Just fucking go whenever you can go.

49
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:20,577
Scott: Yep.

50
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:21,520
Scott: Right.

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,630
Scott: And if you have a side effect, all right, just don't work and then just wait.

52
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,106
Scott: And don't worry about sick days or vacation days.

53
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:27,609
Scott: Just don't work.

54
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,890
Rym: Because frankly, like I'm being real, the side effects, even if you get the worst case side effects, they're not pleasant.

55
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:34,073
Rym: They go away.

56
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:39,190
Scott: It's better than losing your taste and smell or coughing to death or whatever else COVID is going to do.

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,210
Rym: I would rather go through a month of feeling the way I felt than losing my sense of taste and smell.

58
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,651
Scott: Exactly.

59
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:49,370
Rym: Like also, and I'm not changing my life radically like post shot.

60
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,230
Rym: Like there's a very slow reentry into society for safety reasons and a lot of reasons.

61
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,712
Scott: I'm waiting.

62
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,220
Scott: I'm looking at the numbers.

63
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,230
Scott: I'm just going to play a numbers based game.

64
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:06,930
Scott: And now that I have a vaccine, I'm vaccinated, I'm going to wait for the numbers to go down enough to where it's like, oh, now I'm just going to trust that number.

65
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,565
Scott: There's some threshold at which I have not yet decided, but we're definitely not under it yet.

66
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,468
Scott: Whatever it is.

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,651
Scott: Not close.

68
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:22,810
Rym: But despite not changing anything immediately, it still is a weirdly like strong and profound feeling of relief to have that second shot.

69
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:28,610
Rym: Like just knowing that I'm pretty much into this thing is a really good feeling.

70
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,790
Scott: I don't really have that feeling.

71
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,592
Rym: All right.

72
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,902
Rym: I mean, you're welcome to not have that feeling.

73
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,930
Rym: I definitely have that feeling.

74
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:37,933
Scott: Okay.

75
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:42,730
Scott: I mean, like, you know, it's like if I got a, you know, I was I was saying even beforehand, right?

76
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:49,250
Scott: It's like, you know, if you get a tetanus shot, right, you know, and then you step on a rusty nail, you still are worried, right?

77
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,369
Scott: I'm immune to tetanus.

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,050
Rym: The only tetanus shots I've gotten, because the way you're supposed to get a tetanus shot every 10-ish years, at least that's the last time I checked.

79
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,013
Rym: Maybe it's less now.

80
00:03:59,053 --> 00:03:59,354
Rym: I don't know.

81
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,766
Rym: But usually what happens is I injure myself.

82
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:03,930
Rym: I go to the doctor.

83
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,819
Rym: They ask me, hey, when was the last tetanus shot?

84
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,950
Rym: And I think back and I'm like, I'm not 100 percent sure.

85
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,950
Rym: And the way doctors point is, if you're not 100 percent sure, they give you one.

86
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:14,614
Scott: Right.

87
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,130
Scott: But the point is, I had one in 2012 in Australia, right?

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:24,870
Scott: If I would have stepped on a rusty nail in 2014 when it was definitely still effective, I wouldn't have felt like, ha ha, I'm totally safe from tetanus.

89
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:25,790
Scott: I got that tetanus shot.

90
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,255
Rym: I would have literally felt that way.

91
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:31,830
Rym: I would have been like, ha ha, I only have to worry about this gaping wound and not about a deadly disease.

92
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:33,678
Scott: Yeah, I would not have felt that way.

93
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,650
Scott: I would have still been worried about tetanus, right?

94
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:42,890
Scott: It's like, you know, if you give me a vaccine for some STD, I'm not going to go banging people with no protection, right?

95
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,289
Scott: Like I'm like, I'm immune.

96
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,693
Rym: Well, it depends.

97
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,094
Rym: It depends.

98
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:51,270
Rym: A lot of like in the tetanus vaccine in particular is so extremely effective.

99
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,350
Scott: I know.

100
00:04:52,390 --> 00:05:01,521
Scott: But I'm just saying is that even if you tell me it's ninety nine point ninety nine percent effective and there's studies to show it and such and such, I still I can't feel like it's.

101
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:08,630
Scott: you know, I still can't act like I'm totally safe from it and run around with people coughing and breathing in the area.

102
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,713
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's the difference.

103
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:15,390
Rym: Like if I step on a nail, I feel 100 percent good because I know my last tetanus shot was within the last 10 years.

104
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:19,670
Rym: I actually can't remember exactly what it was, meaning whenever I hurt myself again, I'm going to have to get one again.

105
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,841
Rym: But if I go on the subway, I'm not going to go find rusty nails to step on.

106
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,964
Scott: No, but if I go on the subway and someone cough in there, I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm vaccinated.

107
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:30,265
Scott: I'm good.

108
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:31,610
Scott: I'm like, oh, shit, got to get off this car.

109
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,828
Rym: I'm not going to be like, let me let me go lick your hands.

110
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,375
Scott: Exactly.

111
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,770
Rym: Save the hand licking of strangers till like twenty twenty two sometime.

112
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,111
Scott: Yeah, right.

113
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:42,114
Rym: We'll get back to that.

114
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,360
Rym: The licking one's hands.

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,004
Rym: That's the traditional greeting it packs.

116
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,010
Rym: Nothing bad's ever come of that.

117
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:50,531
Scott: OK.

118
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,117
Scott: All right.

119
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:52,529
Scott: Have any other actual news here?

120
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:53,815
Rym: There's a bunch of news.

121
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:54,578
Rym: So we'll start with something.

122
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,070
Rym: But it's this is a game.

123
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,790
Rym: So we're going to talk about it just in case any of you nerds decide that you think this is not a game.

124
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,539
Rym: But there's a game you might have seen called hockey.

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,150
Rym: And in that game, air hockey, ice hockey.

126
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,568
Rym: The best hockey is one of the upper hockey up there.

127
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:26,990
Rym: But in ice hockey, ice hockey is a weird sport in that fighting up to a certain point within certain weirdly like defined parameters is expected and to a degree accepted.

128
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:27,853
Scott: And this.

129
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:28,155
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:29,681
Scott: So over over time it is.

131
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:30,142
Scott: Yeah.

132
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,110
Scott: Over time it has decreased significantly.

133
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:32,911
Scott: Right.

134
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:49,990
Scott: But there is basically this toxically masculine culture in ice hockey whereby there is some sort of unwritten codes or rules such that, you know, the people who actually enforce the game, the referees in the league don't actually enforce everything.

135
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:58,910
Scott: And instead, the players engage in some sort of barbaric self enforcement where, you know, it's like, yeah, you're allowed to hit people in the game.

136
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,995
Scott: It's part of the game.

137
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:01,502
Scott: Maybe that should be removed.

138
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,230
Scott: But that's for another time.

139
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:23,835
Scott: But, you know, if you hit someone too hard or hit the wrong person or hit someone in the wrong way, whether it may or may not be legal within the rules of the game out there, you'll have other players who will then, you know, fight you, you know, to be like, you know, to sort of keep the other team in line so they don't just beat the shit out of your team and vice versa.

140
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:36,750
Scott: And also sometimes just get in a fight to sort of, you know, theoretically rile up the blood and get your team, you know, adrenaline pumping because, you know, they see you fighting.

141
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,323
Scott: And, you know, this is toxically masculine attitude of, you know, OK, this my team saw me fight.

142
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:44,010
Scott: Now they'll get the breathe some life into them and they'll play better.

143
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,451
Scott: That stuff's all nonsense.

144
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:56,683
Rym: But an example of where that like there's a rule called roughing in hockey and the way roughing works is if you hit someone in a way that has no rules associated with it, like you just sort of rough someone up

145
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:03,550
Scott: and you weren't fighting, but you you weren't actually all out fighting, dropping the gloves, having a boxing match.

146
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:10,310
Rym: Like if the whistle blew and Scott was on the rival team and I skated by him and I just like elbowed him, that's like that's roughing.

147
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:20,930
Scott: Well, there's an elbowing rule, but like, you know, you grab someone, you shake them up a little bit, you know, and you're like, but you didn't really, you know, maybe you didn't like start throwing fisticuffs back and forth.

148
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,960
Rym: It usually involves things that happen after the whistle.

149
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,830
Rym: But again, there's a lot of weird like blurred lines.

150
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,439
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, how you have like first degree murder.

151
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,330
Scott: It's sort of like second degree fighting is called roughing.

152
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,493
Rym: But fighting is like a whole different thing.

153
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:42,578
Rym: So anyway, there's a dude by the name of Tom Wilson who's basically, at least in hockey, a piece of shit

154
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:54,750
Scott: because he's notorious, like he is, you know, there's always these players who have like a history of, you know, getting called and punished or for, you know, being extra violent.

155
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,543
Rym: Like ask anyone in the NHL who the bad people are, who like hurt people on purpose.

156
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,226
Rym: Everybody knows the list of names.

157
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,870
Rym: It's the same list of names that everyone.

158
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:12,464
Scott: So on the one hand, there's this sort of thing where, you know, somebody, you know, maybe they ask, you know, because sometimes it happens by accident.

159
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,528
Scott: Just you do something, you're on ice, right?

160
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:15,670
Scott: It just looks bad.

161
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:15,930
Scott: You hurt.

162
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,720
Rym: There's some players who are very large and they might execute a perfectly legal check that hurts someone.

163
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:29,970
Rym: And that's a difficult situation to resolve because they did, they followed the rules of the game, but they're gigantic.

164
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,458
Scott: You can get this sort of bad reputation that may or may not be undeserved.

165
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:39,870
Scott: And then something happens along the lines and you get a punishment that's greater than anyone else because you have this history.

166
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,431
Scott: Right.

167
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:44,896
Scott: And because of this reputation that may or may not be well earned.

168
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:45,657
Scott: Right.

169
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,179
Scott: You suddenly are now the target.

170
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,641
Scott: And it's like, are you actually bad?

171
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:55,030
Scott: You know, you can find things that other people have done that look just like that who are considered good, good sportsmen.

172
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:55,592
Scott: Right.

173
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:59,170
Scott: You know, and, you know, stand up, not dirty players.

174
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:08,310
Rym: An incident happened last night that brought this up again because this person has a history of doing egregious, objectively wrong things.

175
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,031
Scott: Right.

176
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:14,699
Scott: And, you know, yeah, and have been, you know, it's like repeat offender.

177
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,909
Scott: But if you watch the footage, it's like, you know, and then compare which times it was enforced and which times it wasn't.

178
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:21,670
Scott: It's like, yeah.

179
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:28,230
Scott: And then if you actually watch the person and the way they behave, you can tell these basically are barbaric.

180
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,931
Rym: Oh, my God.

181
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,695
Rym: Someone in the thread talking about this.

182
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,840
Rym: Someone used the big dog thread.

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,185
Scott: There's so many threads the whole Internet is talking about.

184
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,530
Rym: But it was like Tom in the safety penalty box.

185
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,210
Rym: Rawr!

186
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,913
Rym: Tom appealing his suspension.

187
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,054
Rym: Please don't hurt me.

188
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:42,956
Rym: I'm just a hockey player.

189
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,921
Rym: So last night there was a hockey game that did not matter.

190
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:51,647
Rym: Like it could ostensibly determine if the caps have like the number one seed or the number two seed.

191
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,750
Rym: But like doesn't matter that much.

192
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,563
Scott: It wasn't zero percent mattering.

193
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,150
Scott: It was like a barely mattering game.

194
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:58,590
Rym: Yeah.

195
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:03,079
Rym: So the game, we expected it to be a game where like none of the star players are playing.

196
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,063
Rym: Everyone's kind of just trying not to get hurt.

197
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:08,450
Rym: Like there's an agreement that no one's going to try too hard.

198
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:12,357
Rym: But then people started trying really hard for a bunch of other reasons.

199
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:16,165
Rym: And then there was a big pile up of people in front of a net.

200
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,830
Rym: And Tom Wilson is on top of a player.

201
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:19,472
Rym: Butch.

202
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,334
Rym: It was Butch, right?

203
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:20,555
Rym: Yeah.

204
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:21,337
Rym: Yeah.

205
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:25,990
Rym: And just drills him out of nowhere long after the whistle.

206
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,151
Scott: He's holding his.

207
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:31,500
Scott: he's holding Butch's head down right with his stick across the back of his neck.

208
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,789
Scott: So Butch is just laying there just like, well, someone's on top of me holding my head down to the ice.

209
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:36,190
Scott: All right.

210
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,798
Scott: And then while Butch's head is held down to the ice, Tom Wilson punches him in the head.

211
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,501
Scott: Now, which is against the ice.

212
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:47,010
Rym: If an equivalent assault happened in like an NBA game, there would be charges pressed.

213
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,338
Scott: Well, there's a thing called the Malice at the Palace.

214
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:50,161
Scott: I don't know if you know about this.

215
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,490
Rym: We've talked about this on GeekNights like 10 times.

216
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,571
Scott: Right.

217
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:57,338
Scott: But they didn't go to jail for the Malice at the Palace, I don't think.

218
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:57,739
Scott: Right.

219
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,703
Scott: They just got suspended for a very long time.

220
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,830
Scott: And this is, you know, this sounds ridiculous.

221
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,756
Scott: You know, because like hockey fights is such a thing.

222
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:13,130
Scott: But it's like, why when you get into a hockey fight, aren't you just arrested on and taken off the ice and charged with assault?

223
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,951
Scott: I don't understand.

224
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:20,443
Scott: I'm not even exaggerating why you got into a you fight someone on the street in that exact same way.

225
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:24,090
Scott: The cops would come and at least you spend like a night in a little little pokey.

226
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:24,831
Scott: Right.

227
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,013
Scott: Or something like that.

228
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:26,233
Scott: Right.

229
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:27,174
Scott: Something would happen to you.

230
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,917
Scott: They might even take you in and let you go.

231
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:32,964
Scott: But, you know, it's like you can't have a fight of that nature.

232
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,930
Scott: But if you have it on the ice, it's like, oh, OK, you can have that fight.

233
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,491
Scott: It's like what?

234
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:39,315
Scott: Yeah, it's like, but this is so.

235
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:47,150
Scott: if I was the coach of an ice hockey team or the GM, I'd be like, if anyone fights even one time, you are off this team and I'm calling the police.

236
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:56,129
Scott: Also, if anyone comes and tries to fight you, you are to run away and try to get them penalized without you like during the big brawl, Panarin just rightly turtled.

237
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:57,212
Scott: Right.

238
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:06,870
Scott: So so after Butch's punch in the head, obviously, because of this code and the refs, you know, not doing anything like the ref didn't even react to the hit and like.

239
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:07,631
Rym: Right.

240
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:10,841
Rym: It looked like other players pummeling him too.

241
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:11,483
Scott: Right.

242
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,770
Scott: You have to sort of stand up for your team.

243
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,039
Scott: It's like you don't have a choice in that bad system.

244
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,804
Scott: It's like that's sort of what you have to do.

245
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:20,810
Scott: So they go.

246
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,040
Scott: The other players who are not fighting top plate type players.

247
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,361
Scott: Right.

248
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,470
Scott: You got Panarin, who's one of the best players in the whole league.

249
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:33,429
Scott: You know, you had to realize he's as tall as me and he only weighs maybe like 10 more pounds than me.

250
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:38,207
Scott: Only he's obviously has no body fat and is all muscle, whereas I have a bunch of flesh.

251
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:38,730
Rym: I can't.

252
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,680
Rym: Tom Wilson is six foot four and weighs two hundred and twenty pounds.

253
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:46,190
Scott: And he's got like 50 pounds on the ice by his neck.

254
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,775
Scott: He has 50 pounds on Panarin.

255
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:53,490
Scott: So Panarin comes, you know, to sort of defend Butch Nevich and so does the rest of the team.

256
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:01,250
Scott: And a fight ensues that is not the normal kind of hockey fight where two guys, you know, go, OK, let's fight and drop the gloves and have a little fisticuff.

257
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,690
Scott: This is like we are defending our teammate and then the Capitals players are then like defending their teammate.

258
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,153
Scott: And it's like it's an actual fight.

259
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:17,870
Scott: Like if, you know, two groups of people, you know, on the street got into a fight thinking they were actually defending their friend from people actually trying to hurt them.

260
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:27,870
Scott: And in the process of this, Tom Wilson basically like ragdolls Panarin in a way that he could have, you know, his helmet came off at some point.

261
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:33,790
Scott: It looked like he could have just slammed Panarin's head into the ice, killing him, ending his career potentially.

262
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:41,930
Scott: He ended his season, which is not, you know, there's only a few games left, but he thankfully is a lower body injury, they're saying.

263
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:50,710
Rym: But here's the deal, not to go like forever on this, because we could do a whole show on this and there's hockey podcasts that will just watch the footage yourself and decide for yourself.

264
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,211
Scott: Yeah, right.

265
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:53,094
Rym: But here's the salient points.

266
00:14:53,335 --> 00:15:01,610
Rym: One, the NHL doesn't actually have at least currently enough like power and rules to deal with this kind of situation.

267
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,162
Rym: The maximum fine they can give him unless they change the rules is five grand.

268
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,250
Rym: They find him like NHL players.

269
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,750
Scott: The players union in their union contract says you can't find any one of us more than five thousand dollars.

270
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,277
Scott: So the players union is OK with this.

271
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:20,930
Scott: Also, the player union rep at the Capitals is Tom Wilson, the barbarian.

272
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,190
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,755
Scott: Which says everything.

274
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:29,170
Rym: Even further, Tom Wilson has been suspended for shit like this before, fined for shit like this before.

275
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,907
Scott: He was suspended earlier this season and afterwards he was like, OK, I got to change up my game.

276
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:34,610
Scott: He didn't change shit.

277
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:35,091
Rym: Yep.

278
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:42,710
Rym: And after this fight, when he was issued a game misconduct and there was likely there was a fine, it was clear the NHL was reviewing.

279
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,330
Rym: He gets up in the penalty box and starts taunting the people he fought.

280
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,088
Scott: Yeah, like he's some sort of like, you know.

281
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,110
Scott: He should be ejected from the league.

282
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:54,670
Scott: I mean, at the very least.

283
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,712
Rym: Make an example of him.

284
00:15:55,813 --> 00:16:01,570
Rym: If you're going to make an example of anyone, there is no more deserving person than Tom Wilson to be kicked out of the NHL.

285
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,254
Scott: I've posted this comment all in all places of the Internet.

286
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:04,535
Scott: Right.

287
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:09,183
Scott: But my comment is basically, look, baseball permanently kicked out.

288
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:13,370
Scott: Pete Rose from all of baseball permanently for betting on games.

289
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,091
Scott: Right.

290
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:14,613
Scott: So right.

291
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:19,349
Scott: And while that's clearly bad to bet on a game that you are participating in.

292
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,613
Scott: Yeah.

293
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:24,867
Scott: And in, you know, it's all different from grabbing someone by the neck and slamming their head against the ice.

294
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,020
Scott: It's detrimental to the integrity of the game.

295
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,290
Scott: Clearly, you know, betting on games that you're playing in.

296
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:37,810
Scott: But, you know, violently attacking another human being in the course of a game, you're hurting another.

297
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,057
Scott: How is that not worse than gambling?

298
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:40,840
Scott: Right.

299
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,629
Scott: How is that not worse than gambling on the game that you're in?

300
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,112
Scott: It's got to be worse.

301
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:45,914
Scott: Right.

302
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:53,070
Scott: Being a violent barbarian and, you know, beating the shit out of someone else that doesn't warrant being permanently banned from the game.

303
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:54,589
Scott: But gambling on it does.

304
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:55,132
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,356
Scott: That makes no sense to me.

306
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:56,717
Scott: Right.

307
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,470
Scott: As far as I'm concerned, anyone who has ever been in a hockey fight.

308
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:01,211
Scott: Right.

309
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:03,016
Scott: Should be permanently banned from hockey.

310
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:04,820
Scott: It's like, don't fight.

311
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,709
Scott: It's like, you know, you know, it's like, come on.

312
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,534
Rym: But especially these.

313
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,085
Rym: There's the weirdly consensual hockey fights.

314
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,650
Rym: And then there's this kind of fight.

315
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,432
Scott: Right.

316
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,088
Rym: But it's like, OK, there should be a debate about this kind of fight at all.

317
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:19,530
Scott: Right.

318
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:24,146
Scott: We've got, you know, it's like we've reached a point where it's like, listen, you know, boxing was a thing.

319
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:24,268
Scott: Right.

320
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,661
Scott: It's like we don't need to continue to have boxing.

321
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:30,110
Scott: If you really want to see boxing, you can just watch Muhammad Ali.

322
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,094
Scott: There's this video.

323
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:31,917
Scott: Right.

324
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:32,961
Scott: You can watch Mike Tyson.

325
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:33,544
Scott: We don't need more.

326
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,995
Rym: We said we don't need more fights.

327
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:37,617
Rym: Right.

328
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,419
Rym: It's 2021.

329
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,141
Rym: We can end, you know, MMA.

330
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,655
Scott: It's like, why do we have that?

331
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:43,977
Scott: Right.

332
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:44,960
Scott: Get rid of that shit.

333
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,221
Scott: Right.

334
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,770
Scott: It's like we had enough, you know, violence.

335
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,319
Scott: We don't need violence anymore.

336
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:50,961
Scott: Right.

337
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:51,523
Scott: Football.

338
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:51,965
Scott: Right.

339
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,190
Scott: It's like we've had it.

340
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,737
Scott: We've you know, we got plenty.

341
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:55,904
Scott: Now it's over.

342
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:56,547
Scott: We've learned.

343
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:57,090
Scott: Right.

344
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,820
Scott: We don't need to keep doing this anymore.

345
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,429
Scott: If you really want to see it, you can see it.

346
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,881
Scott: And we don't need to have it anymore.

347
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:04,330
Rym: Specifically, we don't need them for the game.

348
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,970
Rym: There are enough YouTube videos of great hockey fights to sustain you for the rest of your life.

349
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,578
Scott: Formula One is better without people dying in car crashes.

350
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,150
Scott: You know, funny how much better with them surviving after it saved someone's life.

351
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,938
Scott: Like, oh, yeah, exactly.

352
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:18,199
Scott: Right.

353
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,430
Scott: It's like we don't need violence.

354
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,928
Scott: We don't need the sports to have physical violence where you're hurting the other players ever.

355
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:25,410
Scott: Right.

356
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,795
Scott: Any sport where that's a thing.

357
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:30,470
Scott: Other than, you know, we can still have things like Greco-Roman wrestling.

358
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,438
Scott: You can have Olympic boxing.

359
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,864
Scott: You can have Taekwondo.

360
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:34,526
Scott: Right.

361
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:35,290
Scott: Kendo.

362
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,310
Rym: Arguably, many of those are not less safe than MMA, but are definitely safer than boxing as it was.

363
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,177
Scott: I'm just saying is like there is.

364
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,190
Rym: I'm just saying don't call out MMA specifically if you're gonna give a pass to all those.

365
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,010
Rym: The line is a lot blurrier than you're implying.

366
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:57,330
Scott: I'm just saying is that we can have, you know, there is a line where we can draw to where we can have an acceptable combat-esque sport.

367
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,914
Rym: Here's an easy line to draw.

368
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:04,830
Rym: A sport that doesn't require like that level of violence should excise that violence.

369
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,840
Rym: Non-consensual hockey fights should be unambiguous.

370
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:10,786
Rym: Like there should be zero debate about that.

371
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,010
Rym: Like that's a place to start.

372
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,950
Scott: It's like I want something more extreme than that, but it's like that's just obvious, right?

373
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,948
Scott: It's like if you have a hockey fight that wasn't, you know, two guys agreeing to fight, it's like that's it.

374
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:24,470
Scott: You're done.

375
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,222
Rym: So can you imagine if there was a fist fight at an esport?

376
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,970
Rym: Like someone would get arrested.

377
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,161
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

378
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:31,990
Rym: That has happened.

379
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:33,716
Scott: Obviously.

380
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,530
Scott: So what's the difference between that and a hockey fight?

381
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,166
Rym: Yeah, they're both just games being streamed on some internet service.

382
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,532
Scott: It's like baseball, right?

383
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:47,110
Scott: It's like, you know, baseball also in the, in the pitcher, you know, sometimes you hit the batter by accident because it happens.

384
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:53,190
Scott: But if you do it on purpose, it's like why you just do a baseball at someone at like a hundred miles an hour, you could have killed them.

385
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,778
Scott: You should be banned from baseball permanently.

386
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:57,030
Scott: That's worse than what Pete Rose did.

387
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,398
Rym: So yeah, that's really all we can say about that.

388
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:04,190
Rym: Go listen to a hockey podcast if you want to learn like the excruciating details.

389
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,370
Scott: Don't listen to a toxically masculine hockey podcast.

390
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,763
Rym: Yeah, don't, don't listen to, stay away from Barstool reporting on this.

391
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:12,870
Rym: Follow like Shayna or something to see what happened.

392
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:13,786
Scott: Who knows?

393
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:15,653
Rym: All right.

394
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,382
Rym: So some other news.

395
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:18,670
Rym: Oh yeah, this Ravenloft thing.

396
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,231
Scott: Yeah.

397
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:30,569
Scott: So Ravenloft, you know, people who know the old D&Ds have some sort of memories of Ravenloft, which is the vampire slash horror campaign setting for the D&Ds.

398
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,269
Scott: You know, with your, what's the vampire's name?

399
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:34,835
Scott: Count Strahd.

400
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,298
Scott: That's right.

401
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:36,682
Scott: Strahd.

402
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,390
Scott: Chris of Strahd.

403
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:49,950
Rym: Generally it's a world where like in old D&D, the way it would work is you'd have a campaign in some other world and then you'd be like a fog comes in and you transport your PCs to some other campaign setting and have them do one long adventure there.

404
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,700
Scott: Or you could do a Planescape.

405
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:52,750
Scott: You could do a Planescape.

406
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:58,188
Rym: Ah, actually Ravenloft was canonically, I don't know if this has changed, not accessible from Planescape.

407
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:58,850
Rym: It's its own thing.

408
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,249
Scott: What the fuck do I know about D&Ds?

409
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:09,568
Rym: Ravenloft is its own hidden shadow dimension potentially created by some bullshit with Vekta, but don't quote me on if that's still canon or not.

410
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,350
Rym: Anyway.

411
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,630
Scott: But anyway, the point is like many D&D campaign settings, such as Al-Kadim, right?

412
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,399
Rym: Oh God, Al-Kadim.

413
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,793
Scott: It had a lot of, it had a lot of, Dark Sun, right?

414
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:23,822
Scott: Had a lot of problems in the racism and sexism and other departments of not good, right?

415
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,148
Scott: So trying to play a Ravenloft game by the book in 2020 isn't great.

416
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:31,086
Rym: Yeah, Ravenloft had issues that were obvious in the 80s.

417
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,471
Scott: Right.

418
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:37,876
Scott: So, you know, I guess props to WotC.

419
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,317
Scott: You're still far from perfect.

420
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:51,890
Scott: You got a lot of issues, but there's a new Ravenloft book and it seeks to correct and get rid of many of those very bad things in the Ravenloft campaign setting.

421
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:54,037
Scott: And obviously I have not read this book.

422
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:55,763
Scott: It just came out or it's coming soon.

423
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,148
Scott: You should be able to get it.

424
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:21,210
Scott: And I believe that they may have succeeded based solely on the fact that when I look at the credits on this book of who wrote it, who is involved in it, it is top tier peoples who I know of, or know, at least one of which I've played games with and trust to make this not shit.

425
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:30,829
Scott: So if you want to play, if you're still playing D&D for some reason and you want to do some Ravenloft or you just enjoy reading D&D books, which is perfectly cool.

426
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,050
Rym: I spend more time reading D&D books than playing D&D until I hit late middle school.

427
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,010
Scott: Right.

428
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:45,210
Scott: I think I can recommend to you this book, despite never having read anything other than this section of who was involved in the creation of this book.

429
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:53,690
Scott: And if you are doing any Ravenloft action, I would recommend going by this book and throwing out all the old books for a better Ravenloft time.

430
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:55,051
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:58,756
Rym: And I scrolled through like all the all the details of what they changed.

432
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,564
Rym: And it looks like it's really mostly some of it is just positive in that it removes harmful.

433
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:07,810
Rym: stereotypes like the Vistani as a "race" were deeply problematic.

434
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:23,950
Rym: But also they've made some aspects that were drawing like naively and vaguely and incorrectly from like ancient Egyptian culture and made them more just fantasy sci fi interesting and less tied to real peoples and histories and cultures.

435
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,050
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,334
Scott: I mean, that's good.

437
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:26,595
Scott: Right.

438
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:32,090
Scott: Not only are you getting away from, you know, racism, but it's like you actually just made it more interesting and better.

439
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:40,850
Scott: It's like so regardless of whether you're you know, even if you're a racist white dude, for some reason listening to this show, I don't know why.

440
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,569
Rym: We've had a few over the years we've excised.

441
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:44,871
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:46,475
Scott: If you are, fuck you.

443
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:51,490
Scott: But you I guess you'll also benefit from this improved Ravenloft.

444
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,270
Rym: Yeah, you can play your Ravenloft now.

445
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,930
Scott: It'll be a better game than the other one, whether you care about, you know, that other shit or not.

446
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:03,329
Rym: So briefly, we didn't talk about this because happened a little while ago, but in April wasn't that long ago.

447
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,170
Rym: But Twitch did a thing and we haven't really seen the full ramifications of it yet.

448
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:20,330
Rym: They basically identified seven point five million accounts that they believe were breaking the terms of service by follow botting and view botting.

449
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,710
Rym: And they took action against all of those accounts.

450
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:33,990
Rym: And they even warned everyone in advance that they might see their subscriber counts drop because these bots were likely part of botnets designed to fake viewership numbers.

451
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:34,870
Scott: Yep.

452
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:39,890
Scott: So if you don't know, view bot follow bot is basically make a fake Twitch account.

453
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,210
Scott: And normally if you make a fake Twitter account, you're doing it to like tweet right to tweet spam and stuff like that.

454
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:52,590
Scott: If you make a fake Twitch account, you might not be trying to run a fake Twitch channel or go into chat and spam.

455
00:24:53,111 --> 00:25:02,870
Scott: You might just be following someone else on Twitch to increase their numbers because Twitch rewards people for having bigger follower numbers, bigger subscriber numbers.

456
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,390
Rym: There's an incentive to have more followers.

457
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:13,370
Scott: And it's like if I made if I made if I made a thousand fake Twitter egg accounts and all they did was follow me just to make it so that I have a thousand more followers than I do right now.

458
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,851
Scott: Right.

459
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:18,785
Scott: I just want to make the number go up and people know this gets really complex.

460
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,330
Scott: is the whole world that I want to get into.

461
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:30,910
Scott: But not only will people make view bots to get their own numbers up to help themselves out, you know, Twitch career wise, but also they'll do it to attack other people.

462
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:39,910
Scott: It's like, hey, that guy's, you know, thinking they're more popular than they are or they're getting in trouble because they've got, you know, bots following them.

463
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:40,552
Scott: Right.

464
00:25:40,612 --> 00:25:45,170
Scott: And it looks like they're trying to be, you know, to get their own numbers up when actually.

465
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:45,955
Scott: Right.

466
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:47,208
Scott: It's me doing it to them.

467
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,290
Scott: It's really complex scenarios what people do with all these bots.

468
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:53,639
Rym: I saw one thing here.

469
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,350
Rym: There's one famous-ish account.

470
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,732
Rym: I don't know.

471
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:58,129
Rym: I'm not going to name it because I don't know if it's a good account or not.

472
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,089
Rym: A lot of Twitch accounts are bad news.

473
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:11,030
Rym: But there's a bunch of screenshots in this thread showing how this one account that is genuinely popular lost almost three million subscribers when they did this purge.

474
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,210
Rym: Instantly three million subscribers disappeared from an account that that wasn't three million.

475
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,350
Rym: They lost one point five million of their three million subscribers.

476
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:22,489
Scott: OK, so half their audience.

477
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,370
Rym: So half their audience.

478
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:31,150
Rym: This account is legitimately big, but it was also literally twice as big as it deserved to be based solely on these fake accounts.

479
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,558
Scott: Mm hmm.

480
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:33,230
Rym: Yep.

481
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:48,490
Rym: Now, this is a good thing, but I don't know if this is a battle that can be won because much like with denial of service attacks, there is no real like objective way to tell the difference between a fake person watching your thing and a real person.

482
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,329
Rym: There's naive heuristics, but bots can be more clever.

483
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:57,647
Rym: And the real problem is that Twitch really drives all of its monetization based on this number.

484
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:58,570
Rym: that is easily gamed.

485
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,573
Scott: I'm basically constantly.

486
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:06,610
Scott: this is a problem I'm always thinking about, but there's no answers, obviously, of how can you make an application?

487
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,502
Scott: It doesn't have to be a Web application, any application whatsoever, some software.

488
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:12,610
Scott: that where people make accounts.

489
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:13,593
Scott: Right.

490
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:17,370
Scott: And you can verify that it's one account per real human being.

491
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:17,812
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,430
Scott: And it's easy to do that.

493
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,409
Scott: That's so far.

494
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,651
Scott: You can.

495
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:26,450
Scott: This is very easy to do, but is not arduous for people to make an account.

496
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:26,891
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:27,332
Scott: Right.

498
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:33,510
Scott: Is not like prohibitive, is not discriminatory, is like and now suddenly becomes impossible to do this.

499
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,550
Rym: But coupled with putting the Twitch has a vested interest in showing very high numbers of users.

500
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,070
Rym: Twitch has a vested interest in showing very large numbers of subscribers for popular accounts that they monetize.

501
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:55,230
Rym: And Twitch has gated access to all of its monetization features on people juicing those numbers on their own, thus creating kind of like how a lot of banks got in trouble.

502
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:03,630
Rym: Because while the bank didn't tell their junior bankers to do crime, they did tell the junior bankers to achieve literally impossible targets.

503
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:11,970
Rym: And those junior bankers, fearing being fired, did dubious and likely and oftentimes literally illegal things to juice those numbers.

504
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:16,049
Rym: At no point did anyone say do illegal things, but they incentivized it.

505
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,990
Rym: Twitch, by the nature of how Twitch works, incentivizes viewbotting.

506
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:25,229
Rym: Doesn't mean they want viewbotting, but the system incentivizes it.

507
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,429
Rym: You always have to separate.

508
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,450
Scott: But the fact that they fought it off, at least they did a big purge is good.

509
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,530
Rym: Twitch making a big purge is a big deal because a lot of services refuse to make these big purges because it'll hurt their numbers.

510
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:37,535
Scott: Mm hmm.

511
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:37,990
Scott: That's true.

512
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,400
Rym: So I support Twitch in this.

513
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,308
Rym: I hope they continue it.

514
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:41,503
Rym: Mm hmm.

515
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,469
Rym: In some other little news, we're not going to talk about Epic Games versus Tim Apple, because that...

516
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,670
Scott: Yeah, we talked about it when it started.

517
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:49,576
Scott: And it's now.

518
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:51,510
Scott: all you have to know is that it's now rolling.

519
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,330
Scott: And as a result of its rolling in court, there is, you know, because court stuff is public.

520
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,810
Scott: Everyone can see what's happening in our, you know, courts.

521
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,730
Scott: That's our government, right?

522
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,229
Scott: We're supposed to know what's happening there.

523
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:08,610
Scott: Lots and lots of previously secret information is being introduced to the record as evidence and is becoming public.

524
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:18,930
Scott: So even though you might not be able to report on the result of this case for a while until it finishes, every time there's like evidence released, it's like stuff we didn't know before.

525
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:23,650
Scott: And it's like these other unrelated news stories about Epic and or Apple come out.

526
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:27,770
Scott: And one of them was of particular interesting notes.

527
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,370
Rym: Yep.

528
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:33,810
Rym: So what's going on here is some people have numbers now on things like what was Epic's revenue.

529
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:37,970
Rym: And it was like five point seven billion dollars in twenty eighteen.

530
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:41,130
Rym: It's down to like five point one billion dollars in twenty twenty.

531
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,910
Scott: But I still keep in mind that's revenue though, not profits.

532
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,552
Scott: That's revenue.

533
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:48,530
Rym: Ninety seven percent of that was Fortnite in twenty eighteen.

534
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,722
Scott: That's obvious.

535
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:49,987
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,689
Rym: Eighty eight percent of it was still Fortnite the following year.

537
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,510
Scott: OK, so they managed to actually a good sign because it means they are diversifying their income sources away from Fortnite.

538
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,730
Scott: So they're not just a one trick pony.

539
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:01,991
Rym: Yep.

540
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:03,989
Rym: So at least in twenty nineteen and twenty, not enough.

541
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,810
Scott: Eighty eight percent still way too high, but they're getting they're making progress.

542
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:16,462
Rym: In twenty nineteen to twenty twenty, despite that revenue, they were not profitable, losing one hundred eighty one million and two hundred seventy three million in twenty nineteen and twenty twenty.

543
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:22,790
Rym: just on EGS specifically, which gets to the final interesting point.

544
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,478
Rym: The Epic Game Store that we have poo pooed.

545
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:29,110
Rym: A lot of people have poo pooed where they try to trick you in with free games.

546
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:40,170
Rym: We have the numbers only seven percent of all the people who have installed the Epic Game Store at any point have bought even one game.

547
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,292
Scott: Yep.

548
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:45,270
Scott: I mean, the vast majority of it's something we already knew, but now here's absolute proof.

549
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:45,611
Scott: Right.

550
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:49,410
Scott: And with legal documents that submitted to court as evidence, you know, under oath.

551
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,631
Scott: Right.

552
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:50,974
Scott: You can't otherwise be fake.

553
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:58,150
Scott: evidence tampering is that, yeah, people who installed it were either a playing Fortnite, in which case they're probably just playing Fortnite.

554
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:01,919
Scott: And as with all free to play games, most people playing Fortnite are paying no money.

555
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:06,950
Scott: And it's probably supported by whales, although there are probably a large number of whales because the user base is large.

556
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:11,950
Scott: And then there are people who installed it to get a free game because they gave away so many free games.

557
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,557
Scott: But people installed to get a free game.

558
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:18,550
Scott: So only seven percent of those people went on to buy some other game.

559
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,070
Scott: They were just installing the Epic Store to get the free games and never buying anything.

560
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,391
Rym: Yep.

561
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:25,824
Scott: And the epic, you know, people basically admitted.

562
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:26,507
Scott: Right.

563
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:27,390
Scott: It's documented.

564
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,050
Scott: They basically admitted that the whole thing is just a price predatory pricing operation.

565
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:33,811
Scott: Right.

566
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:43,470
Scott: Where they're like, you know, it's they're on purpose losing money in order to try to get people away from steam and away from other stores over to their store.

567
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:45,153
Scott: It's completely intentional.

568
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:53,550
Scott: And the problem is, is that the actual predatory pricing, you know, is technically illegal under certain circumstances.

569
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,718
Scott: But the law on that in the U.S.

570
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:00,510
Scott: is really, really weak, which is why everyone keeps everyone keeps getting away with it.

571
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,214
Scott: Uber, Amazon, everyone's doing it.

572
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:09,390
Rym: It's also complicated because ostensibly steam had for a long time a near monopoly on online game distribution.

573
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:17,110
Rym: GOG and other things have filled in like there's a better ecosystem, but steam still is like the Uber place to buy.

574
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,177
Scott: But they're not suing steam.

575
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,009
Scott: They're suing Apple for the Apple Store.

576
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,132
Rym: Yeah.

577
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:21,873
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:29,170
Rym: And at the same time, if they try to like use this pricing to get people to move to their store, their store kind of sucks.

579
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:36,250
Rym: Like from the consumer, having multiple stores is just worse because it doesn't bring prices down.

580
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:36,893
Rym: It doesn't.

581
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,521
Rym: it actually gives you a worse experience.

582
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,350
Rym: You have to triage between all these differences.

583
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,710
Rym: Where do I buy this game versus that game?

584
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:53,450
Rym: So from a consumer standpoint, like I buy every game either on the Nintendo store because it's a Switch exclusive or I buy it on steam because I do trust that I will be able to play my steam games in 10 years.

585
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,529
Rym: I don't think the Epic Game Store is going to exist in 10 years.

586
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:57,872
Scott: Who knows?

587
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:03,030
Scott: But yeah, there's definitely that does speak to a larger issue of something that's happening.

588
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,617
Scott: You know, I guess it's been happening for a very long time.

589
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:05,837
Scott: Right.

590
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:10,549
Scott: But real stores, physical brick and mortar stores do this, too, where they try to make it.

591
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:22,210
Scott: So, you know, use various tactics to make it more convenient for you to keep shopping at the same store, even if there's some other store that has what you want, maybe even at a lower price.

592
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:30,710
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, things like loyalty cards store, you know, brand credit cards, you know, all customer loyalty programs.

593
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:31,729
Scott: I guess that's the same thing.

594
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:37,810
Rym: Oh, those things do something even more insidious that I didn't know about or at least didn't think about.

595
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,358
Rym: But it's obvious in retrospect because I got a bunch of training.

596
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,260
Rym: I've learned a lot of.

597
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:44,390
Rym: I've had about a formal training on the current science of pricing lately.

598
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,410
Rym: And one of the one of the things those loyalty cards, while what you said is true, that is definitely a reason they're used.

599
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,790
Scott: The primary reason they're used is track all your purchases.

600
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,732
Rym: No, no, no.

601
00:33:55,853 --> 00:34:00,150
Rym: It's so much more sinister that there's different terms for it in different industries.

602
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:10,330
Rym: But effectively, it's proof that that person, the person who deals with the bullshit of the loyalty program is very price sensitive.

603
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:15,750
Rym: They're willing to give up time to get benefits or slightly lower prices.

604
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:22,250
Rym: People who ignore the loyalty programs are willing to pay whatever price you publish because they value their time more than their money.

605
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,868
Rym: There's some data to back this up.

606
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:33,029
Rym: So generally, loyalty programs are how you identify the people who might need to be given discounts or incentives to keep them in your ecosystem and to keep them paying you.

607
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:42,989
Rym: And you can tell how price sensitive they are by how many arbitrary and meaningless hurdles you can put them through and they'll still do it.

608
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,306
Rym: Meanwhile, people who ignore the loyalty programs, you can just raise your prices on them.

609
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,230
Rym: They'll probably pay it.

610
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,310
Rym: They value your service and they specifically avoid time wasting nonsense.

611
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,353
Scott: That's a good point.

612
00:34:55,393 --> 00:35:00,750
Scott: But yeah, so real stores try to make themselves sticky for customers, right?

613
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:12,650
Scott: But digital stores selling software or music or whatever have it even better and that it doesn't really hurt you too much to go from one grocery store to another.

614
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,093
Scott: It's a plenty of location, right?

615
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:21,010
Scott: But if you have Steam, to install another store on your computer, it's just like, ugh, how many stores am I going to fucking install, right?

616
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,250
Rym: I already got a Blizzard specific app just for Overwatch.

617
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,059
Scott: And you got the Microsoft store comes with Windows.

618
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,970
Scott: It's like you don't want more stores on your computer.

619
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:38,530
Scott: Ideally, there would be some sort of store that comes with the operating system, but that store should be forced open, right?

620
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,710
Rym: I was about to say, it can't be the Tim Apple store.

621
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,032
Scott: Right, exactly.

622
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,839
Scott: The Tim Apple store is sort of that good solution.

623
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,423
Scott: We're like, yeah, there's just one store.

624
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,170
Scott: No bullshit of having 10 stores and hurting the customer.

625
00:35:49,531 --> 00:36:00,310
Scott: Apple wants to protect the customer, but yeah, now they're using that one store to sort of hold the other end, all the app makers over a barrel, right?

626
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:08,467
Scott: It's a very one-sided deal, the same way Amazon treats the customer very well to hold people selling products over a barrel, right?

627
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,088
Scott: So, yeah.

628
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:10,591
Rym: Yep.

629
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:12,658
Rym: I don't know where this is all going to go.

630
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:13,883
Rym: We're not going to talk about it a lot.

631
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,830
Rym: You can make a whole podcast just around this fight.

632
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:20,170
Scott: It'll be a huge news when there's some sort of decision made.

633
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:21,591
Scott: Yep.

634
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,253
Scott: Never mind.

635
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:30,830
Rym: And that decision is totally orthogonal to this whole conversation about whether or not Epic Games business model even makes sense or is ethical, independent of their fight with Apple.

636
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:37,570
Scott: This is going to be a nonstop fountain of news until it's over, and it's going to be a huge news when it's done, whatever is decided.

637
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,526
Rym: This is as big for gaming as that whole Java situation was.

638
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:51,370
Scott: It has ramifications, I think, for everyone, whether they realize it or not, but obviously, technological and tech people and gaming people are paying the most attention.

639
00:36:57,496 --> 00:36:57,877
Rym: Yep.

640
00:36:58,277 --> 00:36:59,559
Rym: Things of the day.

641
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:00,500
Rym: So, I have a rule.

642
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,081
Rym: We both have a soft rule.

643
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:07,587
Rym: We try not to just use the same account, or we'd both be like, "Oh, I got another lock-picking lawyer for you.

644
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,809
Rym: That's the best thing I saw

645
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:09,089
Rym: today.".

646
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,592
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:17,030
Scott: If you find a YouTube channel that's got good videos, like the one I had the other week with the animations made with wool, right?

648
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:17,260
Scott: Yep.

649
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,599
Scott: You can't just be like, "Well, this YouTube channel is amazing.

650
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:21,803
Scott: All its videos are terrific.

651
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:22,646
Scott: It has 10 videos.

652
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,609
Scott: That's 10 things of the

653
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:23,910
Scott: day.".

654
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,740
Scott: It's like, "No, it's not.

655
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,368
Scott: It's one thing of the

656
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:25,530
Scott: day.".

657
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,630
Scott: Yep.

658
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:32,430
Rym: So, I've used Worth It Kids before because they made some great animations, and then they made that clown thing that was above and beyond.

659
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:38,481
Rym: They have somehow exceeded expectations yet again.

660
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:41,628
Rym: They uploaded a video on April 30th called "Captain

661
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:42,189
Rym: Yajima.".

662
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,193
Rym: It looks like stop-motion.

663
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,256
Rym: It looks like it was made in Blender.

664
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:50,970
Rym: This is CG, like computer animation, but it looks like old-style stop-motion.

665
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,434
Rym: It is eight minutes long.

666
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:59,744
Rym: It is a full episode of a fake anime-looking television show.

667
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,907
Rym: It looks like a '60s anime.

668
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:03,550
Rym: Very well done.

669
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:11,270
Rym: If you didn't know anything about what they were parodying and you just watched this, it's legitimately good, honestly funny, has real characters.

670
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:12,876
Rym: This is amazing.

671
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,128
Rym: If they turned this into an actual show, I would watch it.

672
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:21,375
Rym: Watch all eight minutes of episode one.

673
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:23,759
Rym: I doubt they're going to make more.

674
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:31,870
Rym: I'm pretty sure this is a standalone one-time thing, but the character names alone will make it clear that this is amazing.

675
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:32,997
Rym: Just watch it.

676
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:34,089
Rym: I'm not even going to say anything else.

677
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:46,910
Scott: In 2004, when we were close to leaving college, the furthest thing from our non-TV-watching minds was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.

678
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:52,442
Scott: I can't think of a more boomer organization than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

679
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:55,950
Scott: I guess we could rant about Hall of Fames in general, but that's off-topic.

680
00:38:57,232 --> 00:39:04,730
Scott: Anyway, at the 2004 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, a legendary performance occurred, and I didn't know about it until recently.

681
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,009
Rym: I didn't know about it until you sent me this link.

682
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:15,668
Scott: Right, but obviously other people, I'm sure, who were more in tune with that music world would have known about this for the past 14 years.

683
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:19,750
Scott: I only found about it just this week, right?

684
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:30,470
Scott: But, you know, what happened was is that the producer of the 2004 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, like, program, right?

685
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,522
Scott: This guy, I think Joel Gallin, some, like, movie director of some kind.

686
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:34,546
Scott: I don't know anything about him.

687
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:35,630
Scott: I just got his name from the internet.

688
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:43,544
Scott: He took that legendary performance and he put it up on YouTube after remastering it.

689
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:46,410
Scott: The new director is cut, and that's why this is in the news again.

690
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,178
Scott: So you need the backstory to understand how amazing this is.

691
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:54,750
Scott: So what happened is that year various people were being inducted, right?

692
00:39:55,411 --> 00:40:00,730
Scott: And one of the inductees was George Harrison, who was at the time deceased, you know, from the Beatles, right?

693
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:07,310
Scott: And also Prince, who is now deceased, but at the time was not, and some others.

694
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:16,190
Scott: And one of the performances, the one in this video, is they're going to perform the Beatles song "While My Guitar Gently Weaves" by George Harrison, right?

695
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:16,932
Scott: A famous song.

696
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:18,036
Scott: You know the song.

697
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:21,730
Scott: If you don't know the song by the name, as soon as you hear it, you're going to know it.

698
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,610
Scott: If you still don't know it, what the fuck?

699
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:28,690
Rym: If you saw Kubo, they use a cover of it in the closing credits.

700
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:29,892
Scott: Exactly.

701
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:33,242
Scott: And on stage, they have such people as Tom Petty, right?

702
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:35,769
Scott: They got Jeff Lin, the ELO guy, right?

703
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,596
Scott: You got Steve Winwood from Traffic.

704
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:41,290
Scott: You got Danny Harrison, George Harrison's, you know, kid, right?

705
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:42,673
Scott: And Prince.

706
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:47,430
Scott: And you got this other guy, who I forget his name, and he's off to the side.

707
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:56,090
Scott: And basically the original idea that they had for this performance was that, you know, Prince, legendary guitar player, would play those little guitar solo bits.

708
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,022
Scott: You know, that are like, you know, throughout the song.

709
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:02,430
Scott: And then there's the big solo towards the end of the song, right?

710
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,354
Scott: So that like Prince would do that part.

711
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:05,899
Scott: And they went to rehearse.

712
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,809
Scott: And when it came time to do that part, and Prince is going to play it.

713
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:11,916
Scott: This other guy, I forget his name.

714
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,303
Scott: He goes and plays it and he plays it.

715
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:16,570
Scott: And it sounds exactly like the original.

716
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:24,810
Scott: This is some, I forget the dude's name again, but he was some guy that would play with like, you know, George Harrison and his wife back in the post Beatles days, right?

717
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,652
Scott: He was like close to them.

718
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:26,976
Scott: That's why he was there, right?

719
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:31,790
Scott: And that's why he was able to play that so perfectly because he's been playing it for who knows how long.

720
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:40,350
Scott: So then basically, you know, Prince at the rehearsal, they're like, ah shit, Prince isn't going to come back, is he?

721
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:43,076
Scott: It's like, we told him he would do this thing.

722
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:43,919
Scott: He didn't do the thing.

723
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,246
Scott: And Prince basically is like, yeah, don't worry.

724
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,390
Scott: I got it covered, right?

725
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:51,410
Scott: He's like, let that guy play the first few and I'll just, I'll come in at the end, right?

726
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:54,381
Scott: So in this performance, you can watch what happened.

727
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:56,870
Scott: No one really knew what was going to happen, I guess, except maybe Prince.

728
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:02,230
Rym: I feel like that has happened at multiple points in Prince's career.

729
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,330
Scott: Right.

730
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:09,850
Scott: So they come, you know, this huge, this, it's one of those stages like full of way too many musicians that don't need to be there, right?

731
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,601
Scott: It's like, you know, you got basically almost, I guess, all or most of the heartbreakers, right?

732
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:18,370
Scott: Because Tom Petty's there, you know, they're all amazing musicians, even the, even the weird guy.

733
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:25,630
Rym: It's the kind of stage set that is designed to attract like the boomer audience for a rock and roll whole thing.

734
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,318
Scott: It's a special, you know, it's a special ceremony.

735
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:32,270
Scott: So let's put together like this huge, amazing, you know, crazy group of people, right?

736
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,080
Scott: So you see Prince, you know, Prince is coming, but you don't see him.

737
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,343
Scott: He's not there.

738
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:40,466
Scott: They're playing the song.

739
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:42,350
Scott: They're playing it very serviceably, right?

740
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:45,177
Scott: And, you know, Prince isn't there.

741
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:50,230
Scott: You don't see him on stage and then he's there and then he is there until the ending part.

742
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:57,690
Scott: And you, if you want more details about what exactly went down, you can read the same shit on the internet that I read to get even more details.

743
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:01,862
Scott: But this is very much well worth your six and a half minutes.

744
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,290
Scott: Don't try to fast forward to when Prince shows up.

745
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:06,796
Scott: Don't, don't end it before it's over.

746
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:12,410
Scott: Cause it's legendary up until the literally the last second, um, legendary things are occurring.

747
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:18,830
Scott: And I guess the best part of this is not necessarily the performance itself, although that is incredible.

748
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:24,230
Scott: It's that you look at the people up there and most of them are just like, you know, just doing it right.

749
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:31,570
Scott: What they're like, it's their job, except for Danny Harris and George Harrison's kid who was looking at Prince and is like, do you see this shit?

750
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:37,560
Scott: And it's like, it's like, you're like, you just feel yourself.

751
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:42,950
Scott: Like Danny Harrison is like the, the avatar for the audience of like, Holy shit.

752
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,842
Scott: Everyone else is not Holy shitting when they should be, you know?

753
00:43:47,244 --> 00:43:48,849
Scott: And then Prince is, you know, feeling himself.

754
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:49,070
Scott: Right?

755
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:54,040
Scott: So in that moment, nothing's new.

756
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:57,367
Rym: Got our shots, but it's still COVID time.

757
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:58,590
Scott: So, uh, that's right.

758
00:43:59,111 --> 00:43:59,371
Rym: Yeah.

759
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,353
Rym: No cons coming up.

760
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:04,099
Scott: The book club book is still the tale of Genji.

761
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:10,310
Scott: The first novel ever written by human beings in the history of human beings that is known to us.

762
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,915
Rym: I got a little busy the last week.

763
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:16,010
Rym: Didn't read much more, but it'll be warm enough for me to read on the balcony.

764
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:21,683
Scott: And the reading speed has accelerated above zero, but is not, uh, at a hundred percent.

765
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:24,250
Rym: We didn't hit lift off velocity because we had a lot going on.

766
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:25,851
Scott: Yeah.

767
00:44:26,152 --> 00:44:36,390
Scott: Uh, I, you know, I think, you know, I will never say that as the book club continues, we will never have, you know, cause you look at history, there's no way I can promise that we will read all the books promptly in the future.

768
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,570
Rym: Right?

769
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,779
Scott: Some books have taken us like a month and some have taken us a year.

770
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:43,110
Scott: Uh, this book has already definitely taken us longer than any other book ever.

771
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:46,681
Scott: I can't promise that we won't have a slow book ever again.

772
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:48,969
Scott: That will take us a very long time, perhaps months.

773
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:59,630
Rym: But to make it clear, COVID really changed our lives to the point that reading this kind of fiction long form is like low on the priority list.

774
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,630
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,545
Scott: I'm not, I would like a lot of those book club books I read on my phone on the subway.

776
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:05,950
Scott: I'm not taking a subway anymore.

777
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,069
Rym: I would read a chapter on the way to work and every day on the way home from work.

778
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:09,871
Scott: Right.

779
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:10,793
Scott: It's like, I'm home.

780
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,514
Scott: Why am I real?

781
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:20,173
Scott: But anyway, I can promise that when we eventually finish this, when, as long as we survive, I got the next book picked out.

782
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:21,637
Rym: Uh, we'll read it pretty quick.

783
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:26,870
Scott: I think that no future book will take as long as this one.

784
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:28,417
Scott: It might be one day less.

785
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:31,510
Rym: Oh, Nostradamus here making a bold prediction.

786
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,643
Scott: No book club book in the future will take as much time as this one.

787
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:37,330
Scott: They will all take at least a day less.

788
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:41,350
Rym: Now I want to read my next book, The Count of Monte Cristo, and just see, I'll read it.

789
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,869
Scott: I'll be able to read that faster than I'll be able to read.

790
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,346
Rym: Unless there's another pandemic or something.

791
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:50,270
Scott: Barring some ridiculous circumstance like that, yes.

792
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:51,393
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:52,215
Rym: So let's get right into it.

794
00:45:52,757 --> 00:45:56,850
Rym: Uh, we've never actually talked about Super Mario 3 on GeekNights before.

795
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,870
Scott: Well, at least not by itself.

796
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:06,250
Rym: We've talked about Mario World and other Mario games, but also I recently just beat it for a lark like over the last week.

797
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:12,650
Rym: Like I just idly played it until I beat every single level and every single normal secret.

798
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:19,275
Rym: I didn't get like every coin ship or anything because frankly I was never that good at Mario 3.

799
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:19,969
Scott: I believe you're not.

800
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:26,790
Rym: The first coin ship is pretty easy to get, but I struggled even as a kid when I cared a lot about getting all the coin ships.

801
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:29,659
Scott: I only know how to get the first and second one.

802
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,310
Scott: I can get the first one more reliably than the second one.

803
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,984
Scott: The second one I can get maybe like 25% of the time.

804
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,000
Rym: I got the first one when I did this replay.

805
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:39,550
Rym: I used a couple of save states because I'd miss one coin.

806
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,376
Rym: I'd be like, nah, fuck it.

807
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:41,929
Rym: I'm not going to die and do that again.

808
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,190
Scott: But yeah, so I would just want to set the context for anyone younger than us who doesn't really understand, right?

809
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,290
Scott: So if you're in the US at the time, you don't have a lot of information about what's happening.

810
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,709
Scott: You have magazines if you even have those, right?

811
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,290
Scott: So you got Mario and you know, Super Nintendo's don't exist yet.

812
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,557
Scott: There's no Super Nintendo's.

813
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:02,890
Scott: They might be in Japan, but they're not in the US, right?

814
00:47:04,413 --> 00:47:07,850
Scott: And then you've got Mario one and Mario two comes out and it's different.

815
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:15,170
Rym: And you hear rumors that there's a different Mario two, but you don't know about making it up.

816
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,250
Scott: You don't believe that you do not know about the doki-doki panic thing.

817
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,939
Scott: You have no information whatsoever.

818
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:22,030
Scott: As far as you're concerned, Mario two is Mario two.

819
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:26,790
Scott: And all you want is more Mario like Mario one, right?

820
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:34,318
Scott: It's like that was, you know, even though it's only been a few years of your life, you know, Mario two, it's still, it feels like a different thing.

821
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:39,789
Scott: You have nostalgia for hitting the question block, even though that was only a year ago or two years ago.

822
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,470
Scott: You don't have the shy guys and, you know, versus the goombas.

823
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,750
Scott: Like you don't have the feeling for the shy guys you had for the goombas, right?

824
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:51,770
Scott: It's like Nintendo to make more Mario would be a thing.

825
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,310
Scott: And then this movie, the wizard comes out, right?

826
00:47:55,411 --> 00:48:04,250
Scott: And you see at the end of the movie, there's Mario three in the movie, which was actually the reveal of Mario three in the U S right.

827
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,278
Scott: And you're like, Holy shit.

828
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,001
Scott: Right.

829
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,150
Scott: I, that is a big fuck.

830
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,596
Scott: I want that so bad.

831
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:17,508
Scott: And then it's like, when you realize it's real and it's like, there was no like firm release date like there was for things today.

832
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,830
Scott: Right.

833
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:19,539
Scott: It's like, when is it coming?

834
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,243
Scott: Is it coming?

835
00:48:20,303 --> 00:48:21,107
Scott: When can I get it?

836
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:21,570
Scott: Where are you?

837
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:27,623
Scott: Like you didn't really, it's like eventually you're going to go to toys and rest and it'll be there, but you don't know when it could be next year.

838
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:28,066
Scott: You don't fuck.

839
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:28,489
Scott: You don't know.

840
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:36,130
Rym: All you had to go on was if you were Nintendo power, which was catalog in the newspaper, right?

841
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,549
Scott: Sears catalog, JC paint catalog, something like that.

842
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,897
Scott: You'll see it listed in there.

843
00:48:40,937 --> 00:48:43,390
Scott: Maybe you knew it was coming at this point.

844
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:52,030
Scott: You just didn't know when it's like another Mario game that not only is it just like Mario one, but the question blocks, you know, the real Mario, right?

845
00:48:52,191 --> 00:48:58,116
Scott: Not the Mario two nonsense, but also Mario can fly is still fire flowers, but he can also fly.

846
00:48:58,136 --> 00:49:00,025
Scott: It's like with the, with the tail.

847
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:01,050
Scott: It's like, Oh my God.

848
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,144
Scott: It's like, this is the greatest thing you've ever seen.

849
00:49:03,164 --> 00:49:15,115
Rym: It was, I think at the time the best selling game period in the history of the NES, all told it was the third best selling game ever beaten only by now.

850
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:17,307
Scott: This is why I've got Mario one and duck hunt.

851
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:17,769
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:24,943
Rym: The two games that beat it were duck hunt and super Mario because they were bundled with the early consoles on a single.

853
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:25,485
Rym: Okay.

854
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:25,927
Scott: Okay.

855
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,944
Scott: But yeah, Mario three is like, didn't come.

856
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,510
Scott: I think you might've, I think it might've come if you bought a top loader.

857
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,086
Rym: And if you bought the way later NES as it was bundled, they sold might've been some.

858
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:40,069
Rym: that has been, they sold more than 18 million copies of super Mario three.

859
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:41,032
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:49:41,052 --> 00:49:44,005
Scott: That might not sound big today, but it was, this game was enormous.

861
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,887
Rym: Tetris on the NES sold 8 million copies.

862
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:49,390
Scott: Yeah.

863
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,686
Scott: Mario three was the thing, right?

864
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:57,889
Scott: So, uh, and I, if you look at any as games now, you know how many hold up?

865
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,646
Scott: It's like Mario three is a game that can hold up forever.

866
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:01,088
Scott: Right?

867
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:01,290
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:02,518
Rym: And I just played it.

869
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:03,101
Rym: It holds up.

870
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:06,217
Rym: I have minor gripes, but those gripes are all just.

871
00:50:06,258 --> 00:50:08,390
Rym: game design has gotten better as a craft gripes.

872
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:09,150
Scott: Yup.

873
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:14,415
Rym: But like, so the other thing that happened is when you finally got it, which was hard to get.

874
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:22,006
Rym: this game when it came out costs either 65 or 79, not late eighties dollars.

875
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:22,770
Scott: Yeah.

876
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,229
Scott: I might've told this story on the show before, but I'll tell it again.

877
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:28,488
Scott: I got it for Hanukkah one year, I guess the year it came out.

878
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:28,730
Scott: Right.

879
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,590
Scott: And my, my parents gave it to me.

880
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:37,079
Scott: It was in this box that was not shaped like an NES game and I unwrapped it and it's a Jay-Z penny on it.

881
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,470
Scott: Like there was clothes inside.

882
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:42,029
Scott: And then I opened that and then inside the tissue paper was the Mario three.

883
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:48,642
Scott: It was such a big deal that my parents, you know, felt it was necessary to, you know, pull a gag to, to deliver it.

884
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:50,350
Rym: as another piece of context.

885
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:57,512
Rym: That's worth knowing is that Zelda two, which was similarly anticipated because we didn't know what it was going to be like.

886
00:50:57,573 --> 00:50:58,037
Rym: interested.

887
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:58,663
Rym: Oh shit.

888
00:50:58,703 --> 00:50:59,430
Rym: Another Zelda game.

889
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:02,428
Rym: It came out almost around the exact same time.

890
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:08,890
Rym: So this was like a particularly important era for just gaming globally.

891
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:11,746
Scott: This is peak NES Mario three Zelda two.

892
00:51:11,827 --> 00:51:22,354
Rym: And then when you, if you got Mario three, the first time you turned it on, it, the scope of that game dwarfed pretty much anything that had ever been on the NES before.

893
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:23,197
Scott: Yup.

894
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:27,610
Scott: If you, you know, it used, was the MMC three, I think whatever what it, right.

895
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,330
Scott: So there was a chip that you could use in an NES cartridge.

896
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:39,170
Scott: I think Kirby's adventure also definitely used it and maybe some other games on that I can't think of right now, but the games that had that chip in the cartridge, right.

897
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:45,730
Scott: Were just beyond, you know, what the other games were graphically, you know, sound wise.

898
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:52,110
Scott: I don't know if they were actually better sound wise, but you know, the music that was in Mario three is a lot better than the music of Mario one.

899
00:51:52,771 --> 00:52:03,830
Rym: And to talk about that, the MMC one chip is what allowed any as games to be not like, I don't know, balloon fight like to get the NES to be better than an Atari 7,800.

900
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,530
Rym: The MMC two chip, like the next evolution was used for one game.

901
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:09,769
Rym: Mike Tyson's punch out.

902
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:13,488
Rym: And the MMC three was the next revolution.

903
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:17,567
Rym: All the, all the later mega man games used it and Kirby's adventure used it.

904
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:25,724
Rym: And then stuff after that enabled like maybe Castlevania three and like fire emblem games and all sorts of other nonsense.

905
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:26,550
Scott: Right.

906
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:39,270
Scott: But the point is Mario three was like one of the first, one of the earliest games to use this chip and was there for, like it looks like it came from a different console than the other Nintendo games before it because it was so much more advanced.

907
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:49,916
Rym: Like you had in Mario once like, all right, I got depending on the nomenclature was kind of weird and shifted, but you had like stages and boards or boards that you had like worlds, like your two worlds.

908
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:50,217
Rym: Yeah.

909
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:51,062
Scott: And levels.

910
00:52:51,665 --> 00:52:51,886
Rym: Yep.

911
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:52,550
Rym: Or boards.

912
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:57,570
Scott: People use different, he will use different words for it, but the official words I believe are worlds and levels.

913
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:06,009
Rym: I've seen that world one level times, partly because when Mario three came out, the world concept got a lot bigger.

914
00:53:06,632 --> 00:53:08,486
Scott: Well, Mario world was just one world.

915
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:08,829
Scott: Yeah.

916
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,529
Scott: So Mario three has eight worlds.

917
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:18,994
Rym: So you had a world with a bunch of levels in it, but you could navigate this map and choose how you progressed through that world.

918
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:19,477
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:27,610
Scott: That sort of overworld thing, which Zelda two also kind of had, but not quite the same was really a sort of a newish invention.

920
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:43,264
Scott: I don't want to say Mario three invented that, but Mario three like polished and cemented it the same way that like, you know, uh, the iPod wasn't, the iPod wasn't the first MP3 player, but like, you know, it might as well have been right.

921
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:55,055
Scott: Mario three, it wasn't the first for a lot of things, but it might as well have been because it was the first to do a lot of these things well enough and polished enough to sort of set the standard that exists to this day.

922
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:55,297
Rym: Yeah.

923
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,611
Rym: Lolo two came out in 1990.

924
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:05,529
Rym: So this was definitely the like earliest days of that construct, especially for a game that was a platformer when you got into the actual levels.

925
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:15,546
Rym: And the other thing that was fascinating about it was it had so many secrets relative to other NES games up to that point.

926
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:18,843
Rym: Uh, like Mario one, like what secrets were there?

927
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:26,468
Rym: Find a mushroom block, find a one up block, find some coins in a pipe, find the war zones, warp zones.

928
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:26,569
Scott: Yeah.

929
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,070
Rym: Mario three, like you'd be playing like you're a kid, you know, you're dumb.

930
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,164
Rym: You don't have the internet or anything.

931
00:54:32,204 --> 00:54:32,610
Rym: you're playing.

932
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,104
Rym: And then all of a sudden you find a tanuki suit.

933
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:36,030
Rym: What the hell is that?

934
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:38,780
Scott: Yeah.

935
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:39,970
Rym: You get hit and it's gone.

936
00:54:40,271 --> 00:54:41,739
Rym: You have no idea how to find it again.

937
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:43,709
Rym: And you're obsessed with finding it again.

938
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,650
Scott: There was stuff in the game that was not in the instruction manual.

939
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:50,310
Scott: If you bought the legendary, you can get a PDF of it online for free.

940
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:50,652
Scott: I think.

941
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:55,281
Scott: Oh, we had that book, the strategy guide, which had like cardboard pages.

942
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:56,450
Scott: The card stock was so thick.

943
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,029
Rym: I had that thing memorized.

944
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:07,210
Scott: It had full screenshots of every map in the whole, every single level in the whole game, just showing you everything where it was in every single question block.

945
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,862
Scott: It's like it showed you 100% of the game like full on.

946
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,299
Scott: No, nothing was hidden from you.

947
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:17,363
Scott: If you had the strategy guide, which I had, uh, it was like the only strategy guide I had.

948
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:18,530
Scott: cause I was right.

949
00:55:19,075 --> 00:55:24,035
Scott: And it's like that revealed to you, it's like, you didn't know there was a hammer suit unless you had that strategy guide or you got it.

950
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,989
Rym: And getting it was unlikely.

951
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,630
Scott: And there was all sorts of stuff levels.

952
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:31,709
Scott: You could fly up into the sky and it'd be a secret stuff.

953
00:55:32,552 --> 00:55:40,770
Scott: There was duck on a white block long enough and go behind the stage to exit and get the whistle, which we learned from the wizard, right?

954
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,042
Scott: Pipes that go to weird places.

955
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Scott: It's just like, you know, the level in the desert world using the hammer to smash a block at the edge of the map to go off the screen into where there's a hammer bro that you couldn't see normally.

956
00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:10,510
Scott: Just like all this stuff that like, it really felt like a, you know, as a kid playing it, not knowing anything, not having internet, it really felt like this sort of, you know, like just this world of like mystery of like, Oh my God, there's just so much stuff in this game was huge compared to other games.

957
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:16,569
Rym: It felt like it would go on forever, especially till you got a warp whistle and like you could go to the end, but you'd see how many worlds there were.

958
00:56:17,015 --> 00:56:21,150
Rym: And then when you get to them, the cool thing about the game design is they put so much work into this.

959
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:26,150
Rym: Every world is radically different in how it plays and how it feels.

960
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:26,671
Scott: Yep.

961
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:33,890
Scott: And there were so many, every different thing you were, it wasn't like Mario one where it's like, okay, another night world, another flying fish world, another water world, right?

962
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:38,190
Scott: It was like each place you went was like, like a whole new thing.

963
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:39,536
Rym: It's like a giant world.

964
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:42,190
Rym: The goomba is literally as big as full size Mario.

965
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:42,954
Rym: What the fuck?

966
00:56:43,135 --> 00:56:43,356
Scott: Right.

967
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:46,696
Scott: There was something, every place you went, it's like every few levels.

968
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,075
Scott: there would be something new and magical to experience.

969
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:57,132
Scott: Like I'm suddenly, I'm going into a pyramid, I'm climbing a tower and I get to the top of the tower and now I'm in a cloud world.

970
00:56:57,192 --> 00:56:58,679
Scott: at the bottom was a ground world.

971
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:00,468
Scott: I can get the tanuki shoe, right?

972
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:08,130
Rym: Currybo shoes going on up there, which the game doesn't even like, no one tells you like, no one understood what that thing was as kids.

973
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,638
Rym: We were all obsessed with trying to get it out of that one world you could get in it with.

974
00:57:11,658 --> 00:57:12,247
Rym: Yep.

975
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,849
Rym: I really wanted to take it with me and the game wouldn't let me.

976
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:15,873
Scott: Right.

977
00:57:15,893 --> 00:57:18,810
Scott: These, you'll get to the last world, these hands come out and grab you.

978
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,590
Scott: You do all this stuff, fighting all these tanks.

979
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:26,289
Scott: And suddenly it's like on the third screen, it's like world eight one after you've already gone through all this hell.

980
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:28,962
Scott: It's like, here's eight one.

981
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:29,626
Scott: It's like, what?

982
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:30,129
Scott: Yep.

983
00:57:30,471 --> 00:57:34,950
Scott: It's like, I thought this is going to be, you know, it's like, oh my God, the sun that comes down from the sky.

984
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:39,510
Scott: It's like, you're just every place you go is something new and exciting.

985
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:42,730
Scott: Just keep you, everything felt fresh.

986
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:48,864
Scott: It's not like games today where like the beginning of the game is fresh and then it's scat Gulch and there's a big ending.

987
00:57:48,884 --> 00:57:49,588
Scott: Yeah.

988
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:49,830
Scott: Right.

989
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,842
Scott: It's like the whole game is fresh.

990
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:58,503
Scott: Every level, every world, something new to do some new enemies, some new kind of special thing is happening.

991
00:57:58,523 --> 00:58:03,650
Scott: It's just like, you know, every different Koopa kid bosses is slightly different doing something different.

992
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:05,726
Scott: It's ridiculously challenging.

993
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:25,157
Rym: It's not hyperbole to say that Mario three for a lot of people, a huge number of people, they sold 18 million copies, but a huge number of kids played these games, this game in particular, and had an awakening about what games could be because it was so far beyond what they were used to.

994
00:58:25,177 --> 00:58:26,204
Rym: Yeah.

995
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:31,630
Scott: When it came out, it was like just be compared to the other games that existed at the time.

996
00:58:31,971 --> 00:58:34,910
Scott: They just all looked like nothing, you know, next to Mario three.

997
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:42,349
Scott: And for a long time until Mario world, pretty much there was, and honestly, Mario world almost did the same thing all over again.

998
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:48,940
Scott: Sort of, you know, Mario world, I actually think the gap between Mario three and what came before it was bigger than the gap between.

999
00:58:49,021 --> 00:58:49,770
Scott: I would agree with that.

1000
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,531
Scott: Yeah.

1001
00:58:50,551 --> 00:59:07,194
Scott: Mario world has got more than Mario three, obviously because he has a super Nintendo came later, but it's like Mario three felt like the real revolution in Mario world felt like a, I don't want to say just an increment, but just like a big increment on Mario three versus the revolution that Mario three was.

1002
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:07,516
Rym: Yeah.

1003
00:59:07,536 --> 00:59:12,765
Scott: So, so I, one of the thing in Mario three that no one talks about, right.

1004
00:59:12,785 --> 00:59:15,819
Scott: Uh, is the two player mode.

1005
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:18,090
Rym: I have a lot to say about that two player mode.

1006
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:23,735
Scott: Cause my brother and I don't know in Mario, if you played Mario one, two player, right.

1007
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:29,563
Scott: It would just be like, you know, okay, Mario, then Luigi, Mario, then Luigi, you can game over independently, whatever.

1008
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:35,368
Scott: Uh, or, you know, and other games at the time that were two player would be directly competitive, like a sports game or a fighting game.

1009
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:39,047
Scott: Mario three was one of the first games to have a two player mode.

1010
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,850
Scott: that was interestingly, sort of not competitive.

1011
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,810
Rym: It was cooperative competitive together.

1012
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:49,564
Scott: Sort of the way it worked is Mario or Luigi.

1013
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:50,630
Scott: It'd be your turn, right?

1014
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,385
Scott: So you'd be on the overworld and you choose a level to go to.

1015
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:55,639
Scott: And if you do it, okay, you did that level.

1016
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:59,019
Scott: If you succeed or fail, well, now it's the other guy's turn, right?

1017
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:16,390
Scott: You know, the other Luigi's turn now, but in what you could do is instead of, uh, doing an, a level, you could go to wherever the other guy was standing and you would play against them in original Mario brothers, not super Mario brothers.

1018
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:21,914
Rym: And there were a bunch of different versions of that Mario brothers that you could play.

1019
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,466
Scott: And whoever won it would.

1020
01:00:24,507 --> 01:00:30,530
Scott: basically now, if you won that battle, you would, it would be your turn to play a Mario three.

1021
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:35,647
Rym: And you stole one of the other players cards that you use to collect sets to get one ups.

1022
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:36,892
Scott: Yup.

1023
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:37,621
Scott: Exactly.

1024
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:38,390
Scott: Oh, that's right.

1025
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,310
Scott: The game also introduced like having an inventory of items that you could activate before entering a level.

1026
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:42,471
Scott: Oh yeah.

1027
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:46,510
Rym: I didn't even think we'd try to catalog all the unique and novel things that Mario Brothers 3 did.

1028
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,121
Scott: So many unique novel things.

1029
01:00:48,242 --> 01:00:48,665
Scott: Oh my God.

1030
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:49,330
Scott: Just incredible.

1031
01:00:50,090 --> 01:01:03,690
Rym: Um, but so that mode, like here's how, like the immersion, like I don't know what they intended for that mode to be because sometimes my friends would use those cards on purpose to align.

1032
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:11,899
Rym: Like if I had fire flowers and one star, like a fire flower and a star, I try to knock the star out of myself so he could pick it up cause he had two stars like that kind of thing.

1033
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:12,988
Scott: Mm hmm.

1034
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:13,250
Scott: Clever.

1035
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:17,897
Rym: But also say there was a mushroom hut that we both knew could have a tanuki suit in it.

1036
01:01:18,768 --> 01:01:24,329
Rym: Uh, I would refuse to play any level that would let him get to that mushroom house.

1037
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,830
Rym: He would refuse to play any level that would let me get to that mushroom house.

1038
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:39,015
Rym: I would go into this mode and die on purpose to make it his turn and we'd escalate or I would like threatened to just go fight the boss and give up on that mushroom house.

1039
01:01:40,324 --> 01:01:54,266
Scott: unless there were, there would also be situations on the map where I, I don't remember a hundred percent if this is true, but I feel like it's true where if you beat someone in the Mario Brothers game, they would get sent back to the start of the map.

1040
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:54,810
Scott: Is that right?

1041
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:59,922
Rym: They would get sent back to, I think the last level they beats, I forget exactly how the logic works.

1042
01:02:00,164 --> 01:02:05,970
Rym: So if you would like, if they had like used a cloud to skip over a level, you could force them back behind the hard level.

1043
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:14,573
Scott: If there was a cloud, rock or pipe situation, I wonder if it was possible to send someone back and therefore like get away from them.

1044
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:15,641
Rym: Yes, you definitely could.

1045
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:23,174
Rym: I once sent, hit my brother, he used a cloud to get past a hard level and I used a cloud to also get past that hard level.

1046
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,490
Rym: Then I fought him and sent him back before the hard level.

1047
01:02:26,232 --> 01:02:28,950
Scott: I'm going to go see if there's any 2P speed runs of Mario.

1048
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:32,208
Rym: I feel like the 2P speed run, I don't know.

1049
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,506
Rym: I'd like to watch one of those on an AGDQ.

1050
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,263
Scott: Yeah, any sort of 2P anything.

1051
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:36,546
Scott: I don't know.

1052
01:02:36,647 --> 01:02:36,889
Scott: Anyway.

1053
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:45,619
Rym: But the game overall, like I played the whole thing just recently, like last week, every single level I beat them all.

1054
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:48,516
Rym: I used save states occasionally, but not much.

1055
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:50,510
Rym: And I didn't cheat otherwise.

1056
01:02:50,752 --> 01:03:02,829
Rym: I didn't get everything like every coin chip, but the game not only hold up, held up super well, but I'd forgotten about a lot of things until I got to those levels and memories came flooding back hard.

1057
01:03:03,472 --> 01:03:12,127
Rym: But I think this game is worth playing even if someone has no nostalgia for it whatsoever, has never played it before, literally like never even touched an NES.

1058
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,810
Scott: There's not a lot of platformers as good as this even today.

1059
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:29,829
Rym: But the points where it falters, where game design has progressed is one, it commits the sin of giving you extremely rare items with a random chance of getting those items.

1060
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:37,310
Rym: But those items are also so ephemeral that you all, even a very skilled player is unlikely to get to use them even a little.

1061
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:38,871
Scott: Yeah.

1062
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:43,810
Scott: So like there's the P wing, which, you know, I think is one of the things that maybe not, not be in the instruction book.

1063
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:46,001
Scott: Maybe it's the most important item.

1064
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:47,368
Rym: It's the most powerful item by far.

1065
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:47,932
Scott: Yeah.

1066
01:03:47,953 --> 01:03:52,029
Scott: The P wing just lets you fly over a whole level, like permanent P for the whole level.

1067
01:03:52,191 --> 01:03:56,949
Rym: As a kid we'd save those up to fly over those stupid tanks and airships at the end of the game.

1068
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:02,139
Scott: My strategy for beating Mario 3 as a kid was using warps, not beating every level.

1069
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:03,430
Scott: I couldn't do that as a kid.

1070
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:07,370
Rym: I had a path to minimum number of P wings to get past all those ships.

1071
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,850
Rym: And then I'd teleport to the end.

1072
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,573
Scott: Exactly.

1073
01:04:09,593 --> 01:04:11,810
Scott: I would use the whistles in such a way.

1074
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:26,009
Scott: And I figured out where some P wings were before I had the strategy guide even, and such that I would collect enough P wings to skip, or in clouds, to get over all the levels I had a hard time with, like especially the air force level.

1075
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,342
Rym: Clouds were risky though.

1076
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:27,909
Rym: Don't die.

1077
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,472
Scott: Exactly.

1078
01:04:30,255 --> 01:04:34,450
Scott: And then I had strategy of which levels to use the P wings.

1079
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:37,150
Scott: And I couldn't just whistle straight to the end of the game.

1080
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,272
Scott: I wasn't good enough to beat it because I wouldn't have enough items to do it with.

1081
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,470
Scott: I needed those P wings.

1082
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:44,550
Scott: I would like beat level five and then P wing to level eight.

1083
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:48,790
Scott: Because when you beat the sky world, which I could do, you get a P wing.

1084
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,370
Scott: And that was the last P wing I needed.

1085
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,810
Rym: One of the P wings is in a random hammer brother.

1086
01:04:55,572 --> 01:04:55,794
Scott: Yep.

1087
01:04:55,895 --> 01:04:57,510
Scott: There's all kinds of stuff going on.

1088
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:02,069
Rym: But it's interesting because when I played it as a kid, on one end I was trying to beat the game.

1089
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,989
Rym: And I successfully beat the game pretty early with warps.

1090
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,023
Rym: Didn't really have this urge to 100% it.

1091
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,730
Rym: My kid brain just didn't quite care.

1092
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,109
Rym: But my interest in the rest of the game was mostly to explore it.

1093
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,350
Rym: Because it felt like there were secrets hidden everywhere.

1094
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,690
Rym: And I wanted to find every weird thing.

1095
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,731
Scott: Yeah.

1096
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:25,110
Scott: It's like even if someone told me there was a coin ship and how to get it, it's like I want to see the coin ship.

1097
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:26,169
Rym: I didn't necessarily trust them.

1098
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,190
Scott: I want to experience the coin ship.

1099
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,716
Rym: And the game did shit.

1100
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:32,955
Rym: like you get to world five and there's a normal looking world and you play it.

1101
01:05:33,257 --> 01:05:34,970
Rym: But then at the end of the world there's a weird tower.

1102
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:37,470
Rym: And you actually go up the tower inside the tower.

1103
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,530
Scott: I already talked about the tower.

1104
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,449
Rym: But then when you're in the cloud world, you can actually fuck up and fall back down to the regular world.

1105
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,719
Scott: That's true.

1106
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:45,330
Scott: You could do that.

1107
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,477
Rym: And if you would use clouds again to like skip some stuff, well guess what?

1108
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:50,703
Rym: Now you're all the way back down there and you're going to beat all those hard worlds.

1109
01:05:50,723 --> 01:05:51,269
Rym: you skipped again.

1110
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:51,932
Scott: Yeah.

1111
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:53,790
Scott: It wasn't a game that was trying to be easy, right?

1112
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,483
Scott: It was exactly the right amount of challenge I think to where.

1113
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:57,910
Scott: it's certainly beatable.

1114
01:05:58,352 --> 01:06:00,449
Scott: But it's not easily beatable.

1115
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:02,769
Scott: You know, at least by someone who's not amazingly good.

1116
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:05,290
Scott: But it's not like you're never going to beat it.

1117
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,330
Rym: I beat it within a month or two of getting it using warp whistles.

1118
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:10,109
Rym: Like that was pretty straightforward to do.

1119
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:15,569
Scott: If you keep trying and you maybe figure out where some secrets are, you're gonna beat it.

1120
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,609
Rym: The only thing I would suggest is honestly...

1121
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,229
Scott: You get plenty of lives, you know.

1122
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:27,850
Rym: Well the game, like if you even play like reasonably well, you'll have like 30 or 40 lives by the time you hit like world 4 if you're trying to beat everything.

1123
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:31,450
Scott: Now to keep in mind, as a kid to beat it meant beating it in one save.

1124
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:32,390
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't save your game.

1125
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,469
Scott: You could not save this game.

1126
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,890
Scott: So that's why it was very hard to beat as a kid.

1127
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:44,330
Scott: But today, even if you don't use cheating save states, you can still just save your game from the world map and you'll beat it eventually.

1128
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,809
Rym: And especially if you use warp whistles, it's like you'll beat it pretty quick.

1129
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:48,741
Rym: You don't have to 100% it.

1130
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:55,470
Rym: But it is eminently worth exploring every world in this game semi-thoroughly.

1131
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,110
Rym: Like you'll just see some things that you didn't know, didn't expect.

1132
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:06,910
Rym: You'll find them interesting, secrets in weird places, novel concepts that even sometimes didn't really get used again in later Mario games.

1133
01:07:07,974 --> 01:07:09,501
Scott: World 1 is normal Mushroom Kingdom world, right?

1134
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:13,109
Scott: And then World 2 is a desert world.

1135
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:15,824
Scott: And then World 3 is the water world.

1136
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:16,790
Scott: Everything's really different.

1137
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,810
Scott: World 4 is the giant world, which is even more ridiculous.

1138
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:22,629
Rym: As kids, we were obsessed with giant world.

1139
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:25,369
Scott: Yeah, 5 is the sky world.

1140
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:29,990
Scott: 6 is the ice world, where you can actually melt ice with your fire flowers.

1141
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,330
Scott: It's like really out there.

1142
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,589
Scott: 7 is the pipe world, which is a crazy maze going down.

1143
01:07:35,152 --> 01:07:38,590
Scott: And then 8 is the lava hell world at the end of the game.

1144
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:42,329
Scott: And then Koopa's Castle is really out there, way at the end of that.

1145
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,690
Scott: Koopa's statue shooting lasers at you.

1146
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:50,730
Scott: All sorts of out there stuff that makes it really feel special.

1147
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:55,730
Scott: You're always encountering something new you've never seen before in the game.

1148
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:00,131
Scott: And it brings the Bob-ombs from Mario 2.

1149
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:06,670
Rym: So, I would recommend, unless you're gonna get mega into it, save states are fine.

1150
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:13,789
Rym: Especially, use save states to get the good items from mushroom houses, because that's just RNG, there's nothing you can do.

1151
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:17,649
Scott: Even strategy guide is fine, because some of the secrets are kind of not.

1152
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,470
Scott: You don't need to get a coin ship.

1153
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:23,550
Scott: To learn how to get a coin ship is like you will never just discover.

1154
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:28,510
Rym: Yeah, you would literally never figure out how to get a coin ship on purpose.

1155
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:32,970
Scott: Before I knew how to get it, I got it once or twice as a kid by accident.

1156
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,765
Scott: It suddenly appears, and you're like, "What is

1157
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:36,008
Scott: that?".

1158
01:08:36,371 --> 01:08:37,770
Scott: You have no idea how you got it.

1159
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,569
Scott: And White Mushroom House, you will never figure out how to get White Mushroom House on your own.

1160
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:46,029
Rym: The first time I got a White Mushroom House by accident, my brother and I were looking at it.

1161
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:47,549
Rym: We called our friends, they literally didn't believe us.

1162
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,130
Rym: They didn't believe there was a White Mushroom House.

1163
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:50,518
Scott: Why would you?

1164
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:51,550
Scott: I wouldn't believe it.

1165
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,429
Rym: If someone called me and was like, "Yeah, it's a White Mushroom

1166
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:53,569
Rym: House!"

1167
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:55,529
Rym: I would have just assumed they were lying.

1168
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:02,173
Rym: The same people who lied and said that in Mario 1, you can warp to the Secret World 9.

1169
01:09:02,173 --> 01:09:03,470
Rym: All those made up kid rumors.

1170
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:10,090
Scott: Yup, it's like, no, there really is a White Mushroom House that you can get to appear and get stuff out of it.

1171
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:10,756
Scott: It's really good.

1172
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:12,089
Scott: Good luck finding it.

1173
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,622
Rym: But the controls feel tight.

1174
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:15,868
Rym: The platforming works.

1175
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:23,930
Scott: I like the controls in Mario 3 better than the controls in Mario World, and better than the controls in Mario Maker, even though those are both great.

1176
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:30,709
Scott: Mario 3 for me is the best controls of any Mario, like any platformer even, maybe.

1177
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:31,170
Scott: Period.

1178
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:31,611
Rym: Yup.

1179
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:34,529
Scott: There is one thing I don't- They should have just kept them that way.

1180
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:45,837
Rym: I think what I don't like so much is using a tail to knock out a block that is one high as opposed to zero high requires oddly fiddly timing.

1181
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:49,370
Rym: that could have been made easier because that is one of the most common blocks you want to break.

1182
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,170
Scott: Yeah, you press A and B at sort of the same time.

1183
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:57,467
Rym: Yeah, that could have been made easier considering how often you want to do it.

1184
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,245
Rym: But other than that, we've already illustrated all our complaints.

1185
01:10:02,305 --> 01:10:03,250
Rym: There aren't that many more.

1186
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,047
Rym: This game is one of the greatest games ever made.

1187
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,030
Scott: Yeah, Mario 3.

1188
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,826
Rym: So if you've never played it, go play it.

1189
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,911
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why I haven't played Mario 3.

1190
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:26,688
Rym: There was that live streamer who was a young kid who had never played any NES games, and his shtick was he was playing every NES game in alphabetical order with not reading anything.

1191
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,910
Rym: He would start the game cold, and he would play until he got a game over and then never play that game again.

1192
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,422
Rym: And he would end the stream immediately.

1193
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,170
Rym: That was his whole shtick.

1194
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:40,503
Rym: And he got to Mario 3, and that was the kid from which I have that famous line.

1195
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:44,717
Rym: I like to quote a lot of the observer just saying, "Please pick World 4.

1196
01:10:44,717 --> 01:10:45,784
Rym: Please pick World 4.

1197
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:46,307
Rym: Please pick World

1198
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:46,953
Rym: 4.".

1199
01:10:46,953 --> 01:10:49,872
Rym: And he does indeed pick World 4.

1200
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:54,090
Rym: He game overs in World 1 in Mario 3.

1201
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,256
Rym: 'Cause he didn't know how Mario games work.

1202
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,341
Rym: Like, how would he?

1203
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:57,708
Rym: Never played NES games.

1204
01:10:57,749 --> 01:10:58,030
Scott: He's young.

1205
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,950
Scott: He only Mario 1 before Mario 3.

1206
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:02,162
Rym: Yeah, he game over pretty quick in Mario 1, too.

1207
01:11:02,484 --> 01:11:03,510
Rym: And Mario 1 is so great.

1208
01:11:03,751 --> 01:11:09,770
Scott: He actually engaged with Mario-- All the way up until M or S if he considers it to be an S for Super.

1209
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,810
Scott: He didn't play any platformers and get good at them?

1210
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,148
Rym: Nah, didn't look like it.

1211
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:14,550
Rym: Okay.

1212
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:17,838
Rym: Also, Mario 3 introduces a lot of interesting things.

1213
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:30,069
Rym: that if you'd only ever played Mario 1, and you didn't have, like, the ga-- I don't know, the desperate gamer trying to understand this game impetus, I see why he failed at the things he failed at.

1214
01:11:31,332 --> 01:11:35,666
Rym: Like, Mario 3 introduced the auto-scroller to Mario.

1215
01:11:35,687 --> 01:11:36,750
Rym: That wasn't a thing before.

1216
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:38,109
Scott: That's true.

1217
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,950
Rym: And auto-scrollers, even when I was a kid, were terrifying.

1218
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:45,490
Rym: When I first went into World 1-4, I died almost instantly.

1219
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:49,270
Scott: 1-4 is a very hard level, which is why-- 1-4 is a rite of passage.

1220
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,917
Scott: Notice how well the game is designed, though.

1221
01:11:52,378 --> 01:11:54,686
Scott: World 1-4 is entirely skippable.

1222
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:55,829
Scott: You do not have to do it.

1223
01:11:56,631 --> 01:12:00,850
Scott: But if you do do it and do it so well, that's the way to get the first white coin ship, right?

1224
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:05,179
Rym: But you can skip it and beat World--.

1225
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,970
Rym: you can beat a different World in World 5 and also get that Mushroom House.

1226
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:09,434
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1227
01:12:09,474 --> 01:12:11,330
Scott: You can beat World 1-3 to get to the Mushroom House.

1228
01:12:12,873 --> 01:12:15,430
Rym: You can also skip that whole wing and go straight for the castle.

1229
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,400
Scott: Yep, you can skip the whole thing.

1230
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,310
Scott: You don't want to get the Mushroom House.

1231
01:12:20,032 --> 01:12:22,210
Scott: Such a good game design there, right at the beginning like that.

1232
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:26,730
Scott: One last thing, just to emphasize how significant this was.

1233
01:12:27,531 --> 01:12:30,341
Scott: When Mario 3 came out, the Mario Bros.

1234
01:12:30,381 --> 01:12:32,830
Scott: Super Show was airing and being watched, right?

1235
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:37,364
Scott: So this is like the height of Mario as a kid's thing in the '80s, '90s time, right?

1236
01:12:39,891 --> 01:12:41,213
Scott: And the Mario Bros.

1237
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:51,390
Scott: Super Show, the cartoon that they showed during it, had to transition from being based on Mario 2 stuff and characters to being based on Mario 3 stuff.

1238
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,595
Scott: Mid-cartoon.

1239
01:12:53,675 --> 01:12:56,830
Scott: Like, suddenly there were leafs in it and Mario was getting there at Coontail.

1240
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,269
Scott: Yup, which wasn't in the cartoon prior to that.

1241
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:02,958
Rym: Oh my god, that reminds me.

1242
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:03,803
Rym: It's a total aside.

1243
01:13:03,823 --> 01:13:04,810
Rym: We can end because I'm getting hungry.

1244
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:10,949
Rym: But you saw that thing where we found some answers as to why the Zelda cartoon was the way it was?

1245
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,170
Scott: No, I didn't see that thing.

1246
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:20,989
Rym: Official reports of specific decisions that were made and why about that show have made it to Twitter, like in the last couple days.

1247
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,269
Scott: I don't know if they're believable, but they'll probably be fun.

1248
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,413
Rym: They're pretty vetted.

1249
01:13:25,473 --> 01:13:32,269
Rym: And the one thing that was notable, because I wonder how much that was true for Mario 3, most of the people involved in the show did not have NESs.

1250
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:34,550
Scott: Makes sense.

1251
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:41,290
Rym: In fact, one of them said they rented a console so they could at least play the game to know something about it.

1252
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:47,530
Rym: Most of the cartoon was designed based on the Zelda 1 instruction booklet and the instruction booklet alone.

1253
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:49,067
Scott: Makes sense.

1254
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:52,269
Rym: Which actually explains a lot if you look at that instruction booklet.

1255
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:53,420
Scott: Sure.

1256
01:13:54,570 --> 01:14:02,572
Rym: So I would love to know how many of those people in the Mario Super Show played Mario 3 versus read the instruction booklet to Mario 3.

1257
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,337
Scott: I would also just like to point out one thing.

1258
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,588
Scott: If you want to watch Mario 3, the person is Mitch Flowerpower.

1259
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:21,810
Scott: Mitch Flowerpower, the famous Mitch Flowerpower speedrunner, is basically, I guess, considered among if not the best Mario 3 player there is.

1260
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,190
Rym: And his dreams are a delight to watch.

1261
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:24,651
Rym: Right.

1262
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:35,330
Scott: So if you want to go to YouTube or Twitch, find Mitch Flowerpower, and you will see the pinnacle of Mario 3 skill play that there is.

1263
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:40,910
Scott: There's also Mario 3 Randomizer and all kinds of stuff coming down in the Mario 3 communities.

1264
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:42,672
Rym: But don't worry about that.

1265
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:50,010
Rym: Just futz around and explore the surprising depth of this relatively early Nintendo game.

1266
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:51,171
Scott: Yep.

1267
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:51,999
Scott: Early.

1268
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:53,109
Scott: It was towards the end of the NES.

1269
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:54,488
Rym: I said Nintendo, not NES.

1270
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,265
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

1271
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:57,372
Rym: Nintendo the company.

1272
01:14:57,412 --> 01:15:05,470
Rym: Like this was a transformative step for Nintendo, the company, and game design, but this was basically the height of the NES.

1273
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:13,477
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1274
01:15:13,517 --> 01:15:18,490
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1275
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:23,890
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1276
01:15:24,151 --> 01:15:26,838
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1277
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:31,030
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1278

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1279
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:39,440
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1280
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:42,530
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1281
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:55,799
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Eiji, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Crane, Patek, Old Man, Saved Desp, Peacock, MindSnack, just like a dude guy,

1282
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,141
Scott: Kashyaya85,

1283
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:11,270
Rym: Rebecca Dahn, Ren from New Zealand Review, MadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Servin Von Horrell, Taylor Braun, you hold the key to my heart, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1284
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:14,979
Rym: I'm feeling pretty good, despite being a little down from that shot.

1285
01:16:15,841 --> 01:16:19,250
Rym: I look forward to hearing from all of you, slowly getting your vaccines.

1286
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:34,468
Rym: Hopefully we'll all meet in the real world in a pack someday in the future, but for now, before I go off and have some food and maybe go to bed a little early, though you might see me playing a little bit of Overwatch, I want to see if I can get out of Bronze and DPS before the end of the season, I leave you with...

1287
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:43,111
Scott: Hello?

1288
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:49,432
Rym: I'd like to order a butt.

1289
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:50,753
Scott: Like, is this thing on?

1290
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:51,593
Scott: Woah, that sounds cool.

1291
01:16:51,613 --> 01:16:52,133
Scott: Hey Beavis, is that you?

1292
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,093
Scott: I'm in the drive-thru, dumbass.

1293
01:16:53,353 --> 01:17:05,635
Rym: Get out here, this thing makes you sound really weird.

1294
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,122
Rym: Really?

1295
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:38,888
Scott: Cool.

1296
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,674
Rym: I'll be right with you, thank you drive-thru.

1297
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:43,417
Rym: Ow!

1298
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:44,780
Rym: This is gonna be cool.

1299
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:50,359
Rym: I'm sorry, what was that again?
