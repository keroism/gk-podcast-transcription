1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,338
Rym: It's Thursday, October 14th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:09,579
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:13,526
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,174
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,907
Rym: Tonight we are talking about aliens, UFOs, and stuff.

6
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:19,930
Rym: Not the movie.

7
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,707
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:28,590
Rym: So, uh, hockey got off to an auspicious start for the Rangers.

9
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,887
Scott: Uh, yeah, they got destroyed.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,170
Scott: Whatever.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,106
Rym: That was, that was, that was a...

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,041
Scott: That's how things go in New York.

13
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,330
Scott: That's what did you expect, right?

14
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:36,652
Scott: Yep.

15
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:37,478
Rym: Uh, you know what?

16
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:39,269
Rym: I expected, honestly, exactly that.

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,230
Rym: And the whole game, like from the very beginning, all I could think was, wow, we're getting out, out, uh, played.

18
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:46,730
Rym: They're, we're not like, they're dominating.

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,880
Scott: Well, we didn't get outplayed in the first 30 minutes.

20
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,649
Scott: They just got some luck in the first 30 minutes.

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,178
Scott: So actually we had lots of shots.

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,270
Scott: We had, it looked like we had a lot of zone time.

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,910
Scott: They scored goals in, you know, their first few goals in very little zone time.

24
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:03,010
Scott: But then after those first few goals, I guess we stopped playing that same way.

25
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,188
Scott: And then they just took over the game after that.

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,491
Rym: Yeah.

27
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:12,526
Rym: But the problem was, so that in the last, second half of the game, they had all the zone time, but also they could score pretty quickly when they had zone time.

28
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,390
Rym: And we just couldn't.

29
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:14,674
Scott: Yeah.

30
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,149
Scott: Well, you know, that's how it goes.

31
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,671
Rym: Yep.

32
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:17,475
Rym: That's hockey.

33
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:20,390
Rym: So, uh, we'll see how this game, this upcoming game goes.

34
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,067
Rym: The game that we gave the tickets away for.

35
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:26,609
Scott: We keep getting, well, you know, we have these tickets, we can't return them.

36
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,709
Scott: Uh, we can't, you know, get our money back.

37
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,510
Scott: So all, you know, it's like, that's a sunk cost, right?

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,150
Scott: So even if I give the tickets away for free, I'm not losing anything if I can't sell them and we're not, we don't feel comfortable using them.

39
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:50,570
Scott: If someone else wants to use them, I mean, you know, my risk calculus is I'm not going, but if someone else's risk calculus is not the same as mine, I'm not going to judge them or deny them.

40
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,930
Scott: It's not, you know, I don't feel I have to morally, you know, enforce my, you know, it's like, I don't, I'll tell people don't ski.

41
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,470
Scott: I suggest not skiing.

42
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,370
Scott: I won't ski, but I'm not going to go to like the ski resort and be like out there trying to stop people from skiing.

43
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,330
Rym: Well, like I'll even be honest, like I'm not that worried about my personal safety at Pax Unplugged.

44
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:18,009
Rym: Say the main reason I'm not going is that I did, there's a lot of other reasons why it's too soon for me to go to a convention like that.

45
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,890
Scott: I mean, there is, that is definitely part of it, right?

46
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:37,070
Scott: It's like, even, you know, I might feel that I might not get sick, but, you know, it's sort of like, you know, I recognize as someone who doesn't drive a car, that if you drive a car, you are the traffic.

47
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,870
Rym: Yeah, that the whole moral hazard situation.

48
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:40,731
Scott: Right.

49
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:48,310
Scott: So it's like, even if I drive, you know, if I'm in a car and I drive on the road, it's like, oh, this traffic, well, you, you caused that.

50
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,290
Scott: It's you, it's not some external thing, right?

51
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,049
Scott: So it's like, I think there shouldn't be crowded places, right?

52
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,449
Scott: Because crowded places are dangerous to all of us.

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,090
Scott: Now, there shouldn't be, we should try to avoid making crowds.

54
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:11,190
Scott: If I go, even if I'm not in danger in the crowd due to vaccination and discipline and mask wearing, I'm making a crowd and I don't think there should be a crowd.

55
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:20,210
Rym: Especially considering we're at this point now where basically from what everyone's saying, all these unvaccinated people are just going to get it and there's nothing we can do.

56
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:26,810
Rym: But eventually they're all either going to get it and die or get it and be at least a little immune for a while.

57
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,250
Rym: And that's what's going to drive the numbers down eventually.

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,210
Scott: Yeah.

59
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,930
Scott: I mean, if the numbers were down to like the way they were in June, the numbers were down and I almost was like, you know what, it's they've been staying down.

60
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:38,690
Scott: They stayed down long enough.

61
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,230
Scott: Maybe I'll come outside maybe.

62
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,892
Scott: And then they went up.

63
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:46,289
Scott: And if it was like two more weeks, I would have just gone like, tore the mask off or whatever.

64
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,509
Rym: At least in New York, what's extra sad is that in New York City, the numbers are slowly dropping like at this very slow.

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,650
Scott: So, so tiny.

66
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,289
Scott: It's like it's like pretty down.

67
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:10,190
Rym: If you look at New York State or like almost anywhere else in the country, flat or up and in red states like I think I looked at Missouri and Mississippi and those places like skyrocketing.

68
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,209
Scott: Oh, let's talk about Missouri.

69
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,626
Scott: What a great place that is.

70
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,114
Rym: Missouri.

71
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:16,762
Scott: So this isn't.

72
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,290
Scott: this is a story that happens a lot.

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,709
Scott: We could have done this as a Monday news, but, you know, whatever.

74
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,249
Rym: I had it queued up as a Monday news.

75
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,330
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:40,830
Scott: So some journalist out in Missouri found out that on one of the state websites, you can read the details that if you view if you log in and view source on certain pages, there was like you could see people's Social Security numbers were in the HTML, even though they weren't visible on the page.

77
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,910
Scott: And that was a big information leak problem.

78
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,630
Scott: That's huge, especially from a state system.

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:55,630
Rym: Now, it's not a what that means is that their website was sending those Social Security numbers to anyone who looked on the website.

80
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:08,890
Rym: They just happened to people to people who shouldn't have been able to see them where they just happened to not appear on the screen in a regular Web browser, but they likely could appear in a lot of other ways.

81
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,649
Rym: You can look at that same data that they sent you.

82
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,970
Scott: Well, they were, for example, they were transmitted to the person's computer.

83
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:23,950
Scott: So let's say somebody visited that website who wasn't, you know, nefarious in any way, just honestly using it in good faith and never saw a Social Security number with their eyeballs.

84
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:32,610
Scott: Their browser cache is on their laptop or whatever is or phone is now full of Social Security numbers that are there and who knows how secure that device is.

85
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:41,890
Scott: So now they have to go to everyone's devices who are using this system and clear all those browser caches and then, you know, see what's what anyway.

86
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:51,090
Scott: So the journalist who discovered this went through all of the ethical and proper procedures for notifying disclose.

87
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,150
Scott: No, not disclosing the newspaper was like, well, we're going to write a story, but we're not going to publish it until you fix it.

88
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:58,428
Scott: You know exactly what you're supposed to do.

89
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:06,450
Scott: But of course, the people who run the state of Missouri, the governor, the attorney general, all Republicans, it's like whatever they have over there.

90
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,870
Scott: Yeah, all old white Republicans who, A, despise the media and think it's left wing conspiracy bullshit.

91
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,174
Scott: So they want to hurt the media.

92
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:19,930
Scott: and B, don't understand computers at all, have decided to like, you know, they're threatening.

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:28,190
Scott: They haven't charged yet, but they're like investigating and threatening this journalist, you know, with like hacking crimes and whatnot.

94
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:31,290
Scott: Which is like absurd, obviously.

95
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:33,455
Scott: But it's a whole thing.

96
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,950
Scott: And this is not the first time this kind of thing has happened.

97
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,990
Rym: This was a very common story in the late nineteen hundreds and like the the the aughts and late nineteen hundreds.

98
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:52,310
Rym: Some kid referred to the late nineteen hundreds like a month ago on social media complaining about millennials and boomers.

99
00:06:52,891 --> 00:07:00,730
Rym: And not only did it strike me in my heart and destroy me and turn me into dust, but I felt like I had to spread it because I really liked the sound of that.

100
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,329
Rym: I grew up in the late nineteen hundreds.

101
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,490
Scott: Okay.

102
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,635
Rym: Anyway, but this was like I neared.

103
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:19,470
Rym: like every few months there'd be a story of some high school kid gets in trouble because they went to a website and changed the URL and like saw secret biz because websites basically were all geo cities back then.

104
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,735
Rym: Like none of them were made well.

105
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,430
Rym: And apparently Missouri still has websites like that.

106
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:31,870
Scott: Like another really common thing that happens is not just the information in the HTML that you view source and you can see it.

107
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,490
Scott: But another common one is you look at the URL and you see some number in there and you change the number and now you're looking at someone else's account.

108
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,277
Scott: Right.

109
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,629
Scott: That happens all the time.

110
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:45,750
Scott: And it's like, can you consider that, you know, hacking?

111
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,410
Scott: That's I guess that's a Monday discussion.

112
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:53,970
Scott: Yeah, but you don't have overly broad laws covering these sorts of things, which is now a legal discussion.

113
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,530
Rym: I would argue that the definition is pretty simple.

114
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,170
Rym: Again, not the technology definition.

115
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,674
Rym: And we are not lawyers, but I always go with.

116
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:11,270
Rym: if it's accessible to a to a person using technology directly and they have not done something specifically illegal, it's fair game.

117
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,049
Scott: But anyway, so this is a big thing happens all the time.

118
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,370
Scott: It's some fucking bullshit.

119
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,368
Scott: So I guess there's nothing more to say about it.

120
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,950
Rym: So here's the other thing going on here.

121
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:29,310
Rym: What's crazy is that this is such an egregious breach that Missouri has probably itself broken laws.

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,175
Scott: Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,390
Scott: Just just negligent in making a shitty system.

124
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,008
Scott: Yeah, for sure.

125
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,732
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:39,490
Scott: But especially because it is whoever's whoever's information was exposed could probably sue the state.

127
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,254
Rym: So it's so bad.

128
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:45,970
Rym: in the source of the page were a hundred thousand Social Security numbers.

129
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,130
Rym: It was a lot of Social Security numbers.

130
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,119
Rym: They were all just there because the site was extremely like.

131
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,227
Rym: I can't imagine how this would happen unless you were doing.

132
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,270
Rym: I didn't look at the code myself.

133
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:07,950
Rym: Unless you were doing something like have a I don't know, a form that's going to react to something you type and put all the Social Security numbers in the source to drive some aspect of that form.

134
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:10,348
Rym: Like it's that level of egregiousness.

135
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:19,550
Scott: That is this is just the fundamental problem we have and that we're running our society with computers and we do not have enough computer experts.

136
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:27,890
Scott: And even if you have computer experts, they are often not given enough time and resources to do things in the proper way, even if they know how.

137
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:36,590
Scott: And there's just systems, even simple systems that do something not too complicated functionally are still architecturally complex.

138
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:41,130
Scott: And you have to get a whole team of like expert people or otherwise it's a disaster.

139
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:48,570
Scott: I mean, a lot of this is built up and we've built our entire information society on these fragile, not perfectly made pieces.

140
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,310
Rym: But we also can't let all these individual states do all this stuff themselves because they clearly are incapable of it.

141
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,430
Scott: That's why if you look at the best technology stuff in the world, it's like it's annoying that we have these tech monopolies.

142
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,014
Scott: We don't like that.

143
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:02,970
Scott: We want more diversification, more choices.

144
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:03,593
Scott: Right.

145
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:06,770
Scott: We don't want everyone to be using Adobe or everyone to be using Microsoft.

146
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,582
Scott: But if there are if there's only so many people in the world who can make a video card driver, it's like, I guess we're all.

147
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:19,630
Scott: we're all better off using the same video card with the driver made by the people who know how to fucking do it.

148
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:25,990
Scott: Then there's 10 video card drivers and but nine of them are made by teams of people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.

149
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:31,430
Scott: It is because there are enough people to make 10 good ones that are all different.

150
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:40,429
Rym: Yeah, I guess what's most amazing to me is that I expect there to be vulnerabilities like this, especially in like to be kind of I don't.

151
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,070
Rym: this isn't big.

152
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:44,090
Rym: I expect this from red states more so than blue states.

153
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,589
Rym: And history has proven that to be true.

154
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,390
Scott: I respect it from also from the blue state.

155
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,889
Scott: The only difference about money is they won't go after you in this.

156
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,730
Rym: Well, also.

157
00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:01,210
Rym: But the difference is when these things happen, usually it's it's more complicated, like it's a cross-site scripting attack or like a bad TLS.

158
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:06,510
Rym: Like it's usually a more difficult to detect and resolve problem.

159
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,390
Rym: This is the kind of problem that even in the late nineteen hundreds was really easy to avoid.

160
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,709
Scott: This is probably an old system.

161
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:18,390
Rym: Yeah, but it's amazing to have this degree.

162
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:28,350
Scott: Also, if someone else had discovered it, right, if it had been some white supremacist, right, the governor or the wouldn't be going after them, they would have done something different.

163
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:33,843
Rym: So, yeah, but it's that confluence of anti media and anti technology.

164
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,048
Rym: ideas tend to correlate to the newspaper.

165
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:41,509
Scott: Suddenly this excuse to harass the newspaper fell on their lap, so therefore they do it.

166
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,770
Rym: But it goes into a bigger thing.

167
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:56,870
Rym: So notice, remember how there were all these different social media platforms that came up around the time of the election and after Twitter and other media platforms started banning certain right wing like racist nonsense, then suddenly all these social media platforms come up.

168
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:07,110
Rym: And it turns out that it's very hard to hire enough Nazis to run any technology compared to hiring people who are just regular old unethical or maybe even ethical.

169
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:15,030
Rym: So you get this sort of concentration of places with conservative ideas also have broken technology more so than other places.

170
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,290
Rym: Not that the technology is not broken everywhere.

171
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,290
Rym: It's just so much more broken in a place like Missouri.

172
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:28,310
Scott: Well, because, you know, that just being authoritarian, right, of any kind means fighting against facts, right?

173
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:35,250
Scott: You can't be a fact based authoritarian, so therefore you're going to be with your authoritarian powers.

174
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,450
Scott: You're going to be against people who are smart because smart people believe in facts.

175
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:49,010
Scott: And thus the people who are working for you and are actually trying to make things that you want to happen happen are not fact based people, which means they're going to fuck up, right?

176
00:12:49,411 --> 00:13:01,990
Scott: That's why, you know, you look at a lot of shitty countries that have, you know, authoritarian rulers and you'll see like how many big projects they have that are just like Pajamkin's villages and those sorts of things or even actually get anything done.

177
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:18,770
Rym: It might be a little too on the nose, but a big part of when the Nazis came to power in Germany in the 30s was there were a lot of professionals who were angry mostly because they were being overlooked for promotions or were not listened to or respected in their professions, especially in government.

178
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,290
Rym: And those are a lot of the people who ended up joining the party.

179
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:30,170
Rym: And when they affected their takeover, they got the positions of power they'd craved for so long and they mostly just fucked it all up.

180
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:38,110
Rym: And a big part of why the war progressed the way it did was that a lot of very incompetent people were suddenly endowed with absolute power.

181
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,530
Rym: Hermann Göring was a gigantic dumbass who was very bad at his job.

182
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:51,050
Rym: But that's not the image fascists like to show and portray, but that's the reality of how they end up being in civil service.

183
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,590
Rym: So in some really good news, and there's a lot here, we can't cover it all.

184
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,315
Rym: We are not experts.

185
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,130
Rym: Go read a book or talk to an old person.

186
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,070
Rym: So IATSE, the I A T S E, we talked about.

187
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:04,829
Scott: Not the five dice game.

188
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:14,868
Rym: No, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, basically the union that does everything related to most of the media you care about.

189
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:15,730
Rym: that are not games.

190
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,018
Rym: They threatened to strike.

191
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,010
Rym: They have very reasonable demands.

192
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,370
Rym: And the union voted recently.

193
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:29,510
Rym: We talked about on the show with 98 percent plus in favor of striking if their demands were not met.

194
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:34,229
Rym: They have now set a date and that date is real soon.

195
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:41,662
Rym: On October 18th, which is this coming Monday at 12.01

196
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:42,062
Rym: a.m.,

197
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:46,630
Rym: if they do not have their demands met, they are striking.

198
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:47,670
Scott: Good.

199
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,730
Rym: This might be the biggest strike in modern American history.

200
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,453
Rym: I don't know.

201
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:53,949
Scott: I don't know how size is.

202
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,582
Scott: This is huge.

203
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,129
Rym: Also, I don't think this union has ever struck before.

204
00:14:59,111 --> 00:14:59,770
Scott: I don't think it has.

205
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:01,170
Rym: This is a very old union.

206
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,996
Rym: It's one of the biggest.

207
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:02,943
Rym: It's very important.

208
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,669
Rym: It's not on the level of the AFL-CIO, but it's it's up there.

209
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:18,050
Scott: I mean, if the teamsters just went on strike and just no trucks moved, like just shut down the entire, you know, domestic economy of the United States because trucks aren't moving.

210
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,190
Scott: They could just ask for anything.

211
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,650
Scott: They could be like, you know, so you know what, if only they would do that.

212
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,334
Rym: So you know what?

213
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:24,889
Scott: Netflix and ask for good things.

214
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:36,710
Rym: Netflix and all the studios and everyone who rely on IATSE workers are doing right now is they are now forcing everyone to work double overtime to try to finish as much as they can before the strike happens.

215
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:47,830
Rym: And it's gotten to the point where the union is trying to help people like get hotel rooms to survive and not like drive home too tired after an 80 hour workweek.

216
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:57,590
Rym: And there's a whole like shit show going on to the point that we might have to have a lot of boycotts tied in with this strike, depending on how the union tells us.

217
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,030
Scott: You know, because, you know, it used to be easy to not cross the picket line.

218
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,998
Scott: It was physical, right?

219
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,330
Scott: It's in front of a factory.

220
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:03,733
Scott: Right.

221
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,130
Scott: In this day and age, the picket line is virtual.

222
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:13,010
Scott: So it's a lot harder because like you can't like deface the Netflix website and, you know, like put a thing up.

223
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,929
Scott: So nobody, most people like won't even know.

224
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,284
Scott: So that's that's a problem.

225
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:17,810
Scott: Number one.

226
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,570
Scott: And two, even if you do know, you got to figure out how communication wise.

227
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:24,312
Scott: Right.

228
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:28,590
Scott: What do the union want you to do and not do to help them out?

229
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:37,690
Rym: So, for example, complicated because some unions are legally barred because of really fucked up laws in America from calling for boycotts.

230
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,010
Rym: So they may want a boycott.

231
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,109
Rym: They cannot say that out loud or they're in deep shit.

232
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:45,250
Rym: So you have to just look what the union says.

233
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:55,110
Rym: You have to look at what closely aligned, but not formally aligned advocates and organizers say to do, even if they are not actually members of the union.

234
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,270
Scott: And sometimes those people aren't saying the same thing.

235
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,410
Scott: They don't get their message together.

236
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:00,569
Scott: And it's really it's hard to try to not cross it.

237
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,349
Rym: Sometimes the union has to say out loud, do not boycott, even though what they're actually saying is please boycott.

238
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:07,311
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:10,127
Scott: So another thing is that I'm seeing right.

240
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,770
Scott: We've been seeing this app slowly building up, but now it's really coming.

241
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,477
Scott: Not just this.

242
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:15,509
Scott: This is the biggest strike.

243
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,296
Scott: But Kellogg.

244
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,550
Scott: Kellogg's is still on strike.

245
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,422
Scott: The cereal company.

246
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:18,727
Scott: Right.

247
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,776
Scott: John Deere.

248
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,010
Scott: They got a strike going on.

249
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,648
Scott: That's UAW people, I think.

250
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,291
Rym: Yeah.

251
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:27,284
Rym: That just there's that the UAW strike like that's.

252
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,589
Rym: that's hot in the news right now.

253
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:29,773
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:33,309
Scott: Piezo Publishing, who makes Pathfinder the tabletop RPG.

255
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,230
Scott: There's like 30 people working there.

256
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:39,609
Scott: They're not striking, but they made a union for their little tabletop company.

257
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,340
Rym: So that's cool.

258
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:49,870
Rym: The as of today, the United Farm Workers have formally expressed their solidarity with the IATSE strike.

259
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:54,570
Rym: They have not called for their own strike, but that is a notable development.

260
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,548
Rym: And I'm going to keep a very close eye on any news related to the UAW.

261
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,785
Scott: Bread and circuses on the same team.

262
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:01,269
Scott: Watch out.

263
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:02,874
Scott: So.

264
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:07,790
Scott: So, yes, I think what's happening here, I don't know, might be too soon to say this or maybe too late to say it.

265
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,100
Scott: But, you know, there was an industrial revolution and then there was a huge labor movement after the industrial revolution.

266
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,190
Scott: that sort of made things a little better, a lot better, but not quite good enough.

267
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,530
Rym: But we have 40 hour, five day work weeks and a minimum wage.

268
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,429
Rym: Not nearly enough.

269
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:23,770
Scott: Yep.

270
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,192
Scott: That's the.

271
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:30,590
Scott: that's the part we were able to keep, because after that labor movement, they got so much and then gradually lost it all.

272
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,770
Scott: And then now we had the information revolution.

273
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:34,512
Scott: Right.

274
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:42,570
Scott: And now there hasn't been until now, it's taken a couple of decades here, a few of them to have another labor movement.

275
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,290
Scott: And the labor movement isn't even necessarily related directly.

276
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,270
Scott: These aren't computer people on strike here.

277
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,970
Scott: Some of them, I guess, are digital artists, maybe, and things like that.

278
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:57,930
Scott: But these are not information workers who are going on strike because what's going on here is information workers don't have unions, which is another problem.

279
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,810
Rym: But what's going on here is not even so much like the revolution of information so much as like that world.

280
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:18,730
Rym: It's more that the wages and conditions of labor have gotten materially worse as the depredations of capitalism globally have gotten worse to the point that we're reaching a weird crisis point where a lot of jobs are fake because there isn't enough work for people to do.

281
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:24,830
Rym: But at the same time, lots of necessary work is not respected enough to pay any real amount of money.

282
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:36,890
Rym: And the entire system is broken to the point that more and more people are starting to realize not working at all might be better for them than working a job that destroys them for almost nothing.

283
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,779
Rym: Coupled with the two big people have just died due to COVID.

284
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,930
Rym: and how many people don't want to reenter the workforce because it's not safe because of COVID.

285
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,351
Scott: Well, it's mostly.

286
00:19:48,371 --> 00:20:00,670
Scott: I think it's more so, you know, the things that are putting pressure on working conditions are other countries, right, you know, the Kellogg strike, it's because they're going to move that that factory out of the U.S.

287
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,310
Scott: to like Mexico or China or something.

288
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:02,690
Scott: Right.

289
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,810
Rym: So it's because of fiduciary duty and like a race to the bottom on pricing and to automation.

290
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:09,555
Scott: Right.

291
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,109
Rym: So but there's more there, too.

292
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:23,790
Rym: The pricing race to the bottom is partly because society as a whole is poorer as wealth has become so concentrated that most people can't afford to buy things anyway and they have to force prices down to be able to sell to the dwindling middle class.

293
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,570
Rym: Thus, the people who make the things the middle class buy get paid less and less and less.

294
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,690
Rym: I mean, I'm a product manager professionally.

295
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,004
Rym: I've been doing product management as a formal discipline for 13 plus, like 15 years.

296
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:50,570
Rym: And the weirdest thing about my job and it's bothered me for like six or seven years now is that if I look at anything outside of the capital markets where I have a job, any idea we could ever have any job, any product, anything.

297
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:54,982
Rym: If I put on my product management hat, all I can say is there's fucking.

298
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:57,730
Rym: there's no way to make money doing that thing ethically.

299
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:58,692
Rym: Full stop.

300
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:05,290
Rym: If you follow the law, if you follow the law and make this product ethically, you literally cannot make a profit.

301
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:06,410
Rym: It is impossible.

302
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,630
Scott: Yep.

303
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,870
Scott: Because other people aren't being paid enough to be customers.

304
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,790
Rym: There's a reason why we haven't started a company, because everything we look at would be impossible to do with even like the barest hint of ethics.

305
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,131
Scott: So, yeah, the last thing.

306
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:31,850
Scott: Well, you know, just the last thing here to note about labor that you can, you know, take home regardless of your labor situation is, well, I guess if you have a job of any kind right now is that you need to realize that inflation in the U.S.

307
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,027
Scott: this year was like 5 percent ish.

308
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,591
Scott: Right.

309
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:43,170
Scott: So if you're if you get an annual raise and it's 5 percent, that actually means that you're just breaking even.

310
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,989
Scott: They're keeping your salary the same.

311
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:45,512
Scott: Yep.

312
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:45,853
Scott: Right.

313
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:49,949
Scott: If you don't get a raise of more than 5 percent, you're getting a pay cut this year.

314
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,930
Scott: So if they come to you and like 4 percent raise, that's a 1 percent pay cut.

315
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,934
Scott: So you should say something.

316
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:58,909
Scott: You should be like, no, that's actually 1 percent pay cut, even though.

317
00:21:59,611 --> 00:21:59,772
Scott: Right.

318
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:03,168
Scott: So, for example, if you made ten dollars last year.

319
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,072
Scott: Right.

320
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:07,006
Scott: And that allowed you to buy 10 pizzas, pizzas.

321
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:08,735
Scott: They were a dollar each.

322
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,550
Scott: And this year you get a 4 percent raise.

323
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,213
Scott: You got one hundred.

324
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,044
Scott: You got 14, 10 dollars and 40 cents.

325
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:16,031
Scott: Right.

326
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:23,709
Scott: You think you could buy 10 pizzas plus a fourth of a pizza, you know, four tenths of a pizza or whatever it is.

327
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,451
Scott: Right.

328
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:33,690
Scott: It's like actually because of the inflation, even though you'll get ten dollars and 40 cents this year, you'll actually be buying like nine and a fraction.

329
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,435
Scott: Pizzas.

330
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:38,130
Scott: You'll be making less pizzas this year, even with more dollars.

331
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:53,510
Rym: The other thing you should really internalize is that right now is a moment that will not last forever, where for all these reasons and more we didn't even talk about, labor is way more powerful today than it was at any point in recent history in America.

332
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:04,190
Rym: So if there are strikes and then those strikes lead to more strikes, potentially leading to a general strike, the more people are involved, the more powerful it is.

333
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:12,910
Rym: And labor's power right now means we have a moment to force change, even if the political system does not support other ways to get that change.

334
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,250
Rym: One person striking, one small union striking usually is just a risk and a danger to that small group.

335
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:24,130
Rym: But labor is at a moment where the risk is lower and the rewards are higher.

336
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,655
Scott: So it's also one of the only ways.

337
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:32,650
Scott: all these, you know, the inequality, the wealthy people, their money is mostly tied up in the stock market.

338
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,351
Scott: Right.

339
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:40,840
Scott: So if we have enough labor go on strike, you can crash the market enough and that will actually.

340
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:48,270
Scott: that's like one of the only ways short of crimes and assassination or other ridiculous things that you could hurt such rich people.

341
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:52,530
Scott: Yeah, probably the only ethical way to hurt such rich people.

342
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,446
Scott: So there you go.

343
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,800
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

344
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,722
Rym: So check this out.

345
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:08,994
Rym: This is a short animated film from Yugoslavia in 1958 called The Great Fear.

346
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,600
Rym: And it's just a short minute and a half film about some dude reading a horror story, getting a little too into it.

347
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:26,300
Rym: And it's pretty funny and cute, but I don't think I've ever seen Yugoslavian animation before.

348
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,479
Rym: And I just stumbled upon this and it's really neat.

349
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:36,000
Scott: All right, so it's October, which is everyone's favorite because the anniversary of GeekNights' Month.

350
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,428
Rym: October 31st, what, 16 years now?

351
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,399
Rym: I forget how many years.

352
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,140
Scott: It's also the best holiday, Halloween, everyone's favorite holiday.

353
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:49,860
Scott: I feel like we've done a good job as a generation, the millennials specifically.

354
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:59,960
Scott: I'm going to give us credit for making other holidays, especially Columbus Day, less important and making Halloween, extending it for about 30 more days than it used to be extended.

355
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:03,899
Scott: You know, everyone hates to see, you know, we're going to see it.

356
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:05,040
Scott: November 1st is coming.

357
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,057
Scott: You're going to see a Christmas tree there on November 1st.

358
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,759
Scott: But we don't like to see that.

359
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,867
Scott: But we love to see a pumpkin.

360
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:14,580
Scott: on September 1st, even August 31st, I'll see a pumpkin.

361
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,060
Scott: Bring on the pumpkin, right?

362
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,159
Scott: No one's upset about that.

363
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,600
Rym: I love me, over the garden wall season.

364
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,960
Scott: No one complains about Halloween starting too early.

365
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,674
Scott: They complain, right?

366
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Scott: So we're doing a good job, everybody.

367
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,440
Scott: So in honor of the Halloween, the ambassador of Halloween, the late great Vincent Price.

368
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,278
Scott: Let's find some Vincent Price things of the day because there's about 10 infinity of them.

369
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:38,838
Scott: Here you go.

370
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,191
Scott: The excellent movie from 1950. what?

371
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,079
Scott: What year was this movie from?

372
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,880
Rym: Oh, 1959.

373
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,640
Rym: This is one of my favorite movies.

374
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,400
Scott: Yes, it's an old movie.

375
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,995
Scott: Rym loves it.

376
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,360
Scott: There's a remake from 1950.

377
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
Rym: Yeah, like don't don't bother.

378
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,479
Scott: It's called House on Haunted Hill.

379
00:25:56,081 --> 00:26:02,840
Scott: And you may not know this, but despite being from the year 1959, this movie is in the public domain.

380
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:04,780
Scott: You could do whatever the fuck you want with it.

381
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:12,780
Scott: You could read, you could take the credits of the movie and put your name on it and say, you know, you could say like, oh, yeah, the part of that character that was played by Scott Rubin, not Vincent Price.

382
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,338
Scott: No, no, no.

383
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,780
Scott: No one can stop you.

384
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:15,400
Scott: Public domain.

385
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,720
Scott: You just do whatever the fuck you want.

386
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,940
Scott: Remix it, re-share it, make your own edit, you know, whatever you want.

387
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,618
Scott: Go nuts.

388
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,980
Scott: But because of that, somebody has chosen to do one of the other things that is you're legally allowed to do with public domain works.

389
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:38,260
Scott: Just put them up on YouTube in full so you can just watch the whole goddamn movie on YouTube in full zero dollars because public domain.

390
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,200
Scott: And it's even like HD, a really good version.

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,680
Scott: I don't know if they upscaled it or scan the film or what they did, but looks great.

392
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:45,984
Scott: Looks great.

393
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:46,286
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:47,695
Scott: For a black and white 1959 movie looks terrific.

395
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,200
Rym: This movie, if you've never seen it, all I'll say is that it's unintentionally really funny.

396
00:26:55,021 --> 00:27:00,772
Rym: It is intended to be a 100 percent serious thriller, but it's got a skeleton.

397
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:04,880
Scott: and you might think you every time you love a skeleton, you know, we love a skeleton.

398
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,880
Rym: But the way this skeleton is one of my favorite skeletons and you'll see music with some bones on a on a rib.

399
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:11,800
Rym: Now, that's one of my favorite skeletons.

400
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,320
Rym: This is more of the skeleton keeps coming back.

401
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,420
Rym: The skeleton pops up more times than you'll expect.

402
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,560
Rym: And also this fucking house just has a vat of acid in the basement.

403
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:29,339
Rym: And nobody like every character is just like, oh, I guess that's just a thing in this house and they don't think too hard about it.

404
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,840
Rym: Chekhov's acid vat right there.

405
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,421
Rym: Yeah.

406
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:47,960
Scott: And I guess I'll just end by saying, you know, if there's a. if there's a strike by Yahtzee and they don't want you to, you know, if they tell us not to, you know, to cancel our Netflix and our HBO Max and our everything, you know, public domain YouTube doesn't make anyone any money.

407
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:53,380
Rym: In the meta moment, Geek Dice Book Club Book is still the tale of Genji.

408
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,518
Rym: We are powering through our last panel at PAX East Online 2021 Atari Game Design.

409
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,240
Rym: It's just on YouTube.

410
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,455
Rym: You can just watch it.

411
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,960
Rym: We will not likely be at any conventions in the foreseeable future.

412
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,040
Rym: And we're trying to do a bunch of stuff online that we're not talking a lot about until we actually deliver.

413
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,480
Scott: So, yeah, I don't really.

414
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:26,780
Scott: And I guess if you live anywhere within a safe range of Madison Square Garden and you would like to go to see New York Rangers hockey and we don't we still don't feel safe going.

415
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,160
Scott: There's a we have tickets to half the home games.

416
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,641
Scott: I don't.

417
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,579
Scott: I can't go through the whole schedule right now.

418
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,020
Scott: But if you look at the home schedule, there's a 50 percent chance we have ticket to tickets to any of those games.

419
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:39,924
Scott: Let us know.

420
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:43,080
Rym: Yeah, just we're not using them.

421
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:50,680
Scott: It's better that someone else who's willing to go goes then just and no one's going to buy them will just know if those numbers go down enough.

422
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,879
Rym: Then, yeah, we're using all of them again.

423
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,100
Scott: But, yeah, I mean, a listener went to the game tonight, that game that starts in 20 minutes.

424
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:00,539
Scott: So, yeah, they're probably there already.

425
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,620
Rym: The one thing is, I get the impression because so many tickets are on sale, I wonder if it won't be crowded.

426
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,800
Scott: I don't know how crowded it'll be.

427
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,824
Scott: We're going to see it.

428
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:13,999
Scott: We'll see on TV and we'll ask the last the listener and let me know how crowded it was.

429
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,900
Rym: I mean, we'll see via the way that all New Yorkers know to watch Rangers games that I will not share on the podcast.

430
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,000
Rym: But if you live in New York, you've heard of it, you know, that's what we're watching.

431
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:30,900
Rym: So, yeah, when I was a kid, I 100 percent believed in UFOs and aliens.

432
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,840
Rym: I was so sure they existed.

433
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,840
Rym: I blame same.

434
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,640
Rym: I blame television.

435
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,460
Rym: I blame adults who did not disavow me.

436
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:47,300
Rym: I blame magazines, news, like the fucking real newspaper would have articles about a UFO sighting.

437
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,880
Rym: And I would be like, well, it's in the newspaper.

438
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,039
Scott: I don't remember the real newspaper having it.

439
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:54,128
Rym: So when I was a kid, because I grew up in Michigan, there was.

440
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:58,740
Rym: I don't it was this was like nineteen eighty six or eighty seven.

441
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,140
Rym: But a big thing happened in the sky one night.

442
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,360
Rym: And like all the papers were like UFOs.

443
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,087
Rym: Holy shit.

444
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:05,919
Rym: Like it was a whole thing.

445
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:08,099
Rym: Like and we saw him like everybody saw him.

446
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:09,840
Rym: Obviously, they were not UFOs.

447
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:11,139
Rym: But I was a kid.

448
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:12,719
Rym: I saw a weird light in the sky.

449
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:16,960
Rym: And the next day the newspaper was like aliens over Macomb County.

450
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,850
Rym: Holy shit.

451
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:18,540
Scott: Right.

452
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:22,980
Rym: Never mind the fact there's an airbase there and like military flights there.

453
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:23,900
Scott: Right.

454
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,980
Scott: There is one additional thing that I blame, which is that, A, I was a kid who didn't know anything about things that fly.

455
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,852
Scott: Yeah, obviously.

456
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:31,339
Scott: Right.

457
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:35,440
Scott: And B, I would look at the sky and I'd see lights at night during the day.

458
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Scott: You could see it's a plane, obviously, but at night you see planes flying and you just see lights blinking in the distance and flying and all the different planes had different fucking lights.

459
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,700
Scott: So, you know, I'd be like, you know, sometimes you see a common light pattern.

460
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,709
Scott: I'd be like, oh, it's a plane.

461
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:53,700
Scott: But then I was a kid.

462
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:54,527
Scott: I didn't know shit.

463
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,080
Scott: So I was just so convinced.

464
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,459
Scott: I was like, that was like that one's blinking white, red, white, red, white, red.

465
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:01,359
Scott: What kind of plane fucking does that?

466
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,241
Scott: See, I never.

467
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:15,360
Rym: I never went down that road, but I think it's because because of what my family knew and because we live next to like a military like Air Force Base, I was used to seeing a lot of planes flying all the time, day and night.

468
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,439
Rym: So I never thought I saw one.

469
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:21,400
Rym: I just thought they existed because I trusted adults and I watched unsolved mysteries.

470
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,859
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that was mostly it also.

471
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,600
Scott: But yeah, just that one additional thing there also.

472
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:27,482
Scott: Right.

473
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:32,900
Scott: One another thing I would blame is that, you know, I go to the library because I was so interested in alien shit.

474
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,201
Scott: Right.

475
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,920
Scott: So I went to the library and I got like an alien book just in the library.

476
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,139
Rym: Oh, I had some of those books.

477
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:43,480
Rym: The last one, the last one that got me was written in 1968.

478
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,840
Rym: But I read this fucking book in middle school and like part and then I read it again.

479
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,419
Rym: I actually had a copy of it.

480
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,450
Rym: So we went to RIT by then.

481
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,800
Rym: I was I realized.

482
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:06,160
Rym: But Chariots of the Gods and all the books that cite it are like this cesspool of really plausible sounding stuff, especially if you're a kid before the Internet.

483
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:13,240
Rym: But that even one degree of research beyond this book, you find out that, oh, they just made shit up.

484
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:16,159
Rym: Oh, they got kicked out of Egypt because they figured something out.

485
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:20,520
Rym: Meanwhile, Egypt's like, yeah, we kicked these American nut jobs out of our country because they're nut jobs.

486
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:31,120
Scott: Yeah, but also even very good books that in no way were trying to make you into like a UFO conspiracy believer, something like, you know, contact.

487
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:31,687
Scott: Right.

488
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:32,480
Scott: I only saw the movie.

489
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,086
Scott: I didn't read it.

490
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,398
Scott: But even so.

491
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:35,161
Scott: Right.

492
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:45,760
Scott: Just, you know, the extraterrestrial idea in popular culture with a kid brain only, you know, affirmed my very wrong beliefs at the time.

493
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,559
Scott: Something else I did right is, you know, I saw so many Roswell things on fucking TV.

494
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,900
Scott: And in the early days of AOL, there was actually like a form you could fill out, like to make FOIA requests.

495
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:01,460
Rym: I did the same thing.

496
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:03,240
Rym: I asked for all the info on UFOs.

497
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:04,221
Scott: Yep.

498
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:11,700
Scott: And the government actually sent me like a brown envelope with a stack of papers with redacted shit in it that I didn't actually read.

499
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,638
Scott: But I was like, oh, man, look at this.

500
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,499
Rym: Well, never mind.

501
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:20,460
Rym: In the 90s, this was like 1995.

502
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,540
Rym: Remember the alien autopsy?

503
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,479
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'd actually I knew about it, but I didn't actually watch it.

504
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,121
Rym: Yeah.

505
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:32,200
Rym: So I. it was obvious it was fake to me even as a kid, like like a middle schooler.

506
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,400
Rym: Yeah.

507
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,120
Scott: I mean, it's even though I believe that there were UFOs and whatnot, I didn't you know, obviously I didn't believe everything.

508
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,281
Scott: Right.

509
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,340
Scott: It's like I see National Enquirer type stuff.

510
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,827
Scott: Anybody else?

511
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:42,400
Scott: That's bullshit.

512
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,900
Rym: But don't let people gaslight like who are trying to back away from this who were involved.

513
00:33:48,700 --> 00:34:02,602
Rym: That alien autopsy thing, when it was announced like before, like there were months of real news talking about it like it might be real before Fox television eventually like was here it is.

514
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:10,400
Rym: We're broadcasting it like it was a media event and a lot of people were treating this like it was an Al Capone vault situation.

515
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:12,260
Rym: It was an Al Capone vault situation.

516
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,659
Rym: I will be shocked if any of you are young enough to remember that people remember.

517
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:18,380
Rym: Yeah.

518
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:26,260
Rym: But I remember this alien autopsy and I knew a lot of people, including adults, who thought it was real.

519
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:31,159
Rym: And then when the autopsy actually aired, they didn't say, oh, I guess I was wrong.

520
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:32,998
Rym: They just never talked about it again.

521
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:35,460
Rym: And if you asked them, they'd be like, oh, of course, that was fake.

522
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,367
Rym: No one believed that.

523
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,900
Rym: It was just a publicity stunt.

524
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:39,518
Scott: Or they still believe it.

525
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,529
Rym: Or they still believe it.

526
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,359
Rym: They're trying to cover it up.

527
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,958
Rym: But, you know, they're they're shame.

528
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,440
Scott: Or people will say, oh, that was fake.

529
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,819
Scott: But I still believe, you know, it's like.

530
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,500
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,610
Rym: Well, the other thing that messed me up as a kid, just like you said, was that on one hand, I had adults and media

532
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,391
Scott: acting

533
00:34:54,451 --> 00:35:14,400
Rym: like there is something to extraterrestrial life and UFOs coupled with being really deep into like astrophysics and space stuff and things like the Drake equation and things Carl Sagan would say would give me this plausible like, oh, yeah, statistically, even if they haven't come to Earth, they're definitely out there.

534
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:16,080
Rym: Like there's math 100 percent.

535
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,762
Rym: They're out there.

536
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:20,859
Rym: So you can see why the plausibility like snuck in.

537
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:21,784
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:23,740
Scott: You have to look at like the specific questions.

539
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:24,084
Scott: Right.

540
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:25,460
Scott: So it's like, what is there?

541
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,640
Scott: Is it likely that there are other living organisms in the universe?

542
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:31,240
Scott: It's likely, probably.

543
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:31,741
Scott: Right.

544
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,540
Rym: It's like, well, there's some real talk.

545
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:40,860
Rym: So I recently watched a bunch of PBS specials on the current state of the art of astrophysics and this stuff.

546
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:44,900
Rym: And there's an interesting, relatively recent theory about that.

547
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,642
Rym: But anyway, go on.

548
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:51,540
Scott: I mean, you know, it's possible that we're the only thing, but it's it's you know, it's not impossible.

549
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,081
Scott: Right.

550
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:55,420
Scott: If someone said, oh, yeah, some bacteria on this other galaxy.

551
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:55,705
Scott: Yeah.

552
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:56,438
Scott: But like, I believe it.

553
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,365
Scott: Yeah, that's believable.

554
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:59,399
Scott: You know, there's nothing wrong with saying that.

555
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,436
Scott: Has it visited us?

556
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:03,682
Scott: Right.

557
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:15,620
Scott: Something you're telling me something out there, either A, has faster than light travel, B, some kind of wormhole travel or C, has been traveling for so long that it got here.

558
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,483
Rym: Yeah.

559
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:18,906
Scott: And some of those things are.

560
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:24,620
Rym: they always find a redneck somewhere and like harass him specifically while he's drunk in the middle of the night.

561
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:24,983
Scott: Yeah.

562
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:26,560
Scott: None of those things are possible.

563
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:26,801
Scott: OK.

564
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:33,580
Scott: The government has somehow contacted them and but is is not revealing them to the rest of society somehow.

565
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:35,033
Scott: Not that's not.

566
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:35,520
Scott: there's no way.

567
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:43,280
Rym: What what what conspiracy has ever actually been kept for real secret where there was a secret to reveal for that long?

568
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,499
Rym: Never mind something so big.

569
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:46,396
Scott: Yeah, it's like that.

570
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:56,079
Scott: What would be the motivation of such aliens and the government in making some sort that kind of arrangement and that the other governments of the world, which are?

571
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,660
Scott: it's like, you know, the U.S.

572
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,819
Scott: government doesn't run the whole world.

573
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,099
Scott: You're telling me that like these aliens came and only went to the U.S.

574
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:05,500
Scott: They ignored China.

575
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:10,980
Rym: Why are the angels only attacking Tokyo and not any other place on earth for some reason?

576
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,320
Scott: Well, because there's something underground there.

577
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,619
Rym: Oh, yeah, of course.

578
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,260
Rym: But there was really a thing underground.

579
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,026
Scott: Right.

580
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:18,520
Scott: You know, Area 51.

581
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,780
Scott: It's like, yeah, the secret defense projects at Area 51.

582
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,059
Scott: Obviously, the government doesn't even hide that fact.

583
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:26,445
Scott: Right.

584
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:27,259
Scott: Everyone knows that.

585
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,120
Scott: But it's like, have they tried to make something like a flying saucer?

586
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:35,220
Scott: They probably tried because it would be really useful if you could make something that flies that way.

587
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,540
Scott: Yeah, that would be fucking sweet.

588
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:40,560
Scott: Better than fucking what we have now in terms of VTOL aircraft.

589
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:40,963
Scott: Right.

590
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:43,380
Scott: But has any of it been successful?

591
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:45,999
Scott: If it has, they haven't fucking used it.

592
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,600
Scott: And if if it was successful, they probably would have.

593
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,679
Scott: And they wouldn't be wasting trillions of dollars on F whatevers.

594
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,092
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:37:54,473 --> 00:38:06,579
Rym: But I think what there's a generational divide here that I find fascinating, specifically in that we grew up in an era where cam good cameras were very hard to come by generally for most people.

596
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:12,420
Rym: Media was very tightly controlled and limited and very mass market.

597
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:14,080
Rym: There wasn't really an Internet.

598
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:27,679
Rym: So basically, for every whatever, all of American history, like up until that point, it was very easy for a message or an idea to be popular without anyone really having any good way to debunk it specifically.

599
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:35,019
Rym: So as kids, we'd see all this media and adults and all this stuff, and it would seem very plausible that this stuff is real.

600
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:51,680
Rym: But a kid growing up today, even if they read Fade magazine because their grandma had it under the coffee table like I did and they watched Unsolved Mysteries on YouTube, they could type a couple words into any computer on Earth and everything's debunked instantly.

601
00:38:52,140 --> 00:39:01,180
Scott: Yeah, it is interesting how the Internet at first in the AOL days, all helps, right, help to affirm my alien belief.

602
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:10,920
Scott: In fact, one of the first when I was learning HTML, right, and like, you know, middle school times, I made I got like some alien animated gifs and shit, right?

603
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
Scott: I was making like an alien kind of Web page.

604
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:14,072
Rym: Oh, I was type.

605
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,680
Rym: I was about to say Googling.

606
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:29,682
Rym: I was all to visiting for information about ancient Egypt to figure out if this the Orion constellation was because aliens came to Egypt, because that was all plausible to my kid brain.

607
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:30,103
Rym: And guess what?

608
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:36,831
Rym: If I went on the Internet, real people didn't have Web sites yet, but crackpots had Web sites and crackpots over.

609
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:39,080
Rym: the Internet was full of crackpots back then.

610
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:44,622
Rym: But there wasn't any other source of information, unless except like the library or the encyclopedia.

611
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:50,802
Scott: that also said the library steered me wrong because I found alien books at the library.

612
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:56,220
Rym: My middle school library had chariots of the gods in the nonfiction section.

613
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,064
Rym: Like what the fuck?

614
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:04,762
Scott: If you if you just go and look for aliens in the card catalog, they books that that are about aliens, you're not going to find books that are like aliens aren't real.

615
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:11,242
Rym: So, you know, but then the Internet got better and suddenly it was very easy.

616
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:22,540
Rym: Like all the weird things I believed as a kid basically evaporated as soon as I had access to the modern Internet, pre-Internet, like Web 2.0, because I had access from like AOL metaphysics chat room, right?

617
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:24,809
Scott: AOL.

618
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,658
Scott: Well, that was too many gory's.

619
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:35,658
Scott: That one specifically, AOL had only a few different kinds of chat room categories, and some metaphysics is one of them.

620
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,600
Scott: And that's where, you know, crackpots.

621
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:38,262
Scott: Right.

622
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:45,959
Scott: And then it's like as soon as you weren't on the AOL anymore and you're on the real Internet and then it's like the Internet got better.

623
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:49,660
Scott: It's like, well, I guess that was a bunch of nonsense.

624
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,580
Rym: Yeah, but now we've reached a point where the Internet is full of crackpots again.

625
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:54,742
Scott: Yep.

626
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:58,279
Scott: The difference is people are on Facebook instead of on AOL.

627
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,842
Rym: But we're in this weird situation where we grew up in a world where we had a lot of false information.

628
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:10,360
Rym: It was lent a lot of credibility to us and we didn't have alternative sources of information.

629
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,706
Rym: Now we have access.

630
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:13,380
Rym: Then we had access to real information.

631
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:14,959
Rym: We figured a lot of stuff out.

632
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,479
Rym: Everyone has access to more real information now than we ever had.

633
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:23,600
Rym: We have more access to information than any humans have ever had in all of history.

634
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,020
Rym: And yet about 40 percent of the population actively chooses the crackpots.

635
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,911
Scott: So one other thing I want to add is that, you know, it wasn't just the information that was available.

636
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,256
Scott: Right.

637
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:40,040
Scott: It was also just what is what was popular culturally.

638
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:41,083
Scott: Right.

639
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:44,300
Scott: So in the 90s, X-Files was the biggest fucking deal.

640
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,260
Rym: Everybody watched the X-Files.

641
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:52,785
Rym: No, young people have not experienced a world where literally everyone is watching the same show.

642
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,600
Rym: Like you think Game of Thrones was big?

643
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,703
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

644
00:41:55,903 --> 00:42:07,800
Rym: When we were watching X-Files as kids, every teacher we had and watched X-Files, our doctors, our orthodontist, anyone you met, someone who was not watching X-Files was a weird aberration.

645
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:08,641
Scott: Right.

646
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:20,300
Scott: Now, the shows that come out these days, there may be shows that have bigger overall viewership than those shows did just because the population of the world is bigger and things have more reach and they're in more countries around the world.

647
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:32,435
Scott: But in terms of like percentage wise, it's like if you have a group, if you take a group of 100 random Americans, just at random and say, and hey, like, all right, how many of you have watched Game of Thrones?

648
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,639
Scott: It's like, how many is it going to be?

649
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,546
Scott: It's not going to be 10.

650
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:44,640
Scott: But if you do the same thing in 1998, maybe, I don't know what year, 90 something, and like how many of you watch X-Files, right?

651
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,477
Scott: It's like it's going to be more than the Game of Thrones, even if you said how many what's the number of Americans that, you know, what?

652
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:52,421
Scott: Yeah.

653
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:59,660
Rym: Or back up further, like when X-Files was first on, like early 90s, like 94, like that's when that show started.

654
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:03,720
Rym: There was there weren't that many shows on at any given time.

655
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,420
Rym: Like there weren't that many new shows at any point in like TV history.

656
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:10,699
Rym: So there'd be a set of shows that would be on.

657
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Rym: And around the X-Files era, alien UFO stuff was just very popular.

658
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,680
Rym: So it like it just filled out all of pop culture.

659
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,414
Rym: Aliens and UFOs were like an undercurrent.

660
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,159
Rym: that was just there.

661
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,160
Rym: And generally not saying everyone believed in aliens, but they were always like an easy topic of conversation you could have with anyone.

662
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,243
Scott: It was.

663
00:43:33,263 --> 00:43:34,560
Scott: And also it goes back further.

664
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,299
Scott: You got My Favorite Martian going on.

665
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,124
Rym: Yeah.

666
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,874
Scott: You got all the pulp stuff in the 50s.

667
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:40,262
Scott: Right.

668
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,400
Scott: You got, you know, there's just so much of it.

669
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,469
Scott: And then in the 2000s.

670
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:46,183
Scott: Right.

671
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:48,820
Scott: It's not like there's no alien stuff at all anymore.

672
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,559
Scott: But these sort of extraterrestrial stuff, I think, was reduced a lot, I guess, maybe around, you know.

673
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,040
Rym: You know, it's hard to say because that's around the time when I saw the zombies, the zombies took over and they haven't let go.

674
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:02,584
Scott: I don't know.

675
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:04,300
Rym: We did a show on this years ago.

676
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,060
Rym: We talked about like the era of aliens and how it shifted into the era of zombies and that vampires were big for a while.

677
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,040
Rym: And we were like, when's it going to be sexy werewolves?

678
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,540
Rym: Like, when's it going to keep going around?

679
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,740
Rym: And that trend just keeps continuing as we loop through what it's never got.

680
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,292
Scott: I don't think it's gone back to like.

681
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,300
Scott: aliens aren't a thing.

682
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,160
Scott: Like how many movies in the movie theater are about aliens?

683
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:30,439
Scott: There are some that are like, you know, alien predator like, OK, it's about an extraterrestrial thing.

684
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:32,185
Scott: Right.

685
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,020
Scott: You know, but it's it's not about.

686
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:34,923
Scott: Right.

687
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:38,020
Scott: It's it's not like a flying saucer, Earth visiting.

688
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,660
Rym: There's occasional ones like there's the one where the aliens are like teaching the woman the language like there's a handful of them.

689
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:51,115
Rym: But it's not like multiple long running pop culture sensation television shows constantly dripping it out there.

690
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:58,799
Rym: Also, the long tail of there's a wider variety of entertainment and people have fractured into various different things.

691
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:06,739
Rym: You don't have a monoculture of literally everyone I knew on Earth was watching The X Files in the early 90s while I was watching it.

692
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:11,540
Scott: But, you know, it's also just what are, you know, people these days.

693
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:11,962
Scott: Right.

694
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,516
Scott: It's like what do they usually, you know, you're trying to make?

695
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:18,479
Scott: this kind of stuff is usually in the horror zone, kind of.

696
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:18,741
Scott: Right.

697
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:21,520
Scott: There's an overlap for sure, especially since it's October.

698
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:25,859
Scott: So aliens used to be a thing people would be scared of.

699
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,481
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:26,803
Scott: Right.

701
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:33,358
Scott: Whereas now you're more scared of, you know, AIs run amok and we see plenty of AIs run amok stories going on.

702
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:34,081
Scott: Right.

703
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:41,001
Scott: But also a big part of why Independence Day wouldn't really be a hit today, I don't think.

704
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:47,780
Rym: I think a big, big part of why alien UFO crackpot conspiracy nut jobs actually went on a steep decline.

705
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,391
Rym: But eating the horse paste and all this other stuff went on.

706
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:57,660
Rym: a big increase is partly that everyone has a really good camera now all the time.

707
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:05,398
Rym: And you see a direct correlation between how many cameras people have and how few photos of UFOs continue to come out.

708
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:12,680
Scott: So I always say, like, man, if there's a Bigfoot out there, Bigfoot must have this amazing anti HD technology.

709
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:15,260
Scott: I want some of that so that it can avoid surveillance.

710
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:18,379
Scott: Security cameras could only see blurry, Scott.

711
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,279
Scott: Like whatever Bigfoot has to always be blurry when people have 4K cameras in their pocket, like I want what Bigfoot's got.

712
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:40,433
Rym: So in terms of actual alien life, as in for real life that did not come from Earth, on one hand, like you're talking about earlier, there's an idea that it it's definitely out there, like 99 percent chance.

713
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:42,820
Scott: I can't say definitely.

714
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,540
Rym: Well, it's not like ninety nine point nine, whatever repeating chance just from the ideas spawning from the Drake Equation Conversations.

715
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Scott: The idea that ninety nine percent on a bacteria somewhere that's not on Earth.

716
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:57,734
Scott: So something some, you know, might not be carbon based, but some sort of.

717
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,806
Scott: so something that I guess looks like the thing is.

718
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:12,960
Rym: the idea was that we can make some assumptions about, you know, the universe is so big because remember, we didn't even discover the fact that there's more than one galaxy until relatively recently in human history.

719
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:26,440
Rym: Like it's if you're if you're young, you might not realize that, like when they got that first photo from Hubble, like out in space or like the pale blue dot photo and all that, that was all new relatively recently.

720
00:47:26,882 --> 00:47:30,020
Rym: And we did not know the extent of the universe and we still don't know it to a degree.

721
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:38,199
Scott: But yeah, it wasn't until the first year and Edwin Hubble discovers another galaxy Andromeda in nineteen twenty four.

722
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:38,863
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,059
Scott: So not even one hundred years ago.

724
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:44,520
Scott: So more than one hundred years ago, we thought there was only one galaxy.

725
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:52,079
Rym: And then we rapidly got to the point of, oh, there's billions, at least of galaxies, billions and billions and billions out there.

726
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,440
Rym: So the Drake equation was like, all right, let's do some Fermi calculations.

727
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,679
Rym: We have a rough sense of how many galaxies seem to exist.

728
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:10,116
Rym: And based on our own galaxy, we can say like, what if point oh, one percent of all those galaxies have a solar system that's even remotely like ours?

729
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:15,080
Rym: and then point oh, one percent of those have a planet that's remotely like Earth.

730
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:18,320
Rym: And you do these extremely pessimistic calculations.

731
00:48:19,261 --> 00:48:31,399
Rym: Even then, there are so many galaxies and there's so much time that it puts the odds of life being out there like at ninety nine point like plus percent just by the sheer scale.

732
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:37,262
Scott: And that makes the pessimistic assumption also that the life will be similar to our kind of life.

733
00:48:37,283 --> 00:48:40,379
Scott: It could be life that does not resemble our kind of life.

734
00:48:41,720 --> 00:49:02,300
Rym: So the more modern data has made that a much more challenging conversation because the Drake equation got all the way down into the time in which it could take in the most pessimistic state for electromagnetic radiation to come out of one of those civilizations and the time it would take for it to reach us from anywhere in the universe.

735
00:49:04,062 --> 00:49:07,760
Rym: And even then, the odds are that we should have seen something by now.

736
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,240
Rym: And that is a recent conversation that seems to be happening among astrophysics.

737
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,820
Rym: It's leading into this lonely Earth hypothesis.

738
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,160
Rym: It is weird that we've never seen anything.

739
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:20,757
Scott: And I just don't know how.

740
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:26,698
Scott: Don't know how is an interesting question, though, because there's something we don't know still that they can't reach us.

741
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:27,964
Rym: Exactly.

742
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:37,522
Rym: So there's where that's where we start to talk about the idea of great filters, like is life actually common or not or is the bending of space keeping the signals from reaching us?

743
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:39,933
Scott: or is life using a different kind of signal?

744
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:41,600
Rym: or is life common?

745
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,642
Rym: And the fact that life is unlike is much less likely to get to a certain state of advancement.

746
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:52,158
Rym: But the weird part is that even accounting for all those things, we just look at our own galaxy.

747
00:49:53,381 --> 00:50:00,200
Rym: We should have detected something like the horizon of how far out we're very, very connected, something and not recognized it.

748
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,002
Rym: Well, the idea the horizon of how far out we're pretty sure there is nothing is slowly growing.

749
00:50:06,685 --> 00:50:13,240
Rym: And the data we have so far really fucks up our understanding of the Drake equation and the statistical odds.

750
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:22,520
Rym: The lonely Earth hypothesis is a new one that's starting to gain some track or not new, but it's gaining some traction and it's really leaning on the Anthropic principle.

751
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:31,268
Rym: And it makes one argument that a universe capable of creating observers must create observers.

752
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:32,800
Rym: Otherwise, that whole concept is moot.

753
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:34,860
Rym: We exist and we observe.

754
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,240
Rym: Therefore, it is possible for universes to spawn life like full stop.

755
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,780
Rym: And it's all the assumptions we can make.

756
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:42,427
Scott: That's true.

757
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:43,479
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

758
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:46,674
Rym: But it's important to say that out loud and agree on it.

759
00:50:46,975 --> 00:50:48,802
Rym: to move on to all this other complex math.

760
00:50:49,505 --> 00:51:17,819
Rym: So based on the data we have from our own galaxy and the galaxies we've been able to study, it appears that if we look at life like our own slimeball planets, which Earth was one, planets that are even remotely like Earth, capable of generating the kind of life that became us, Earth is likely one of the earliest of those planets to have formed in the universe, as in it's in the first eight percent of all of them that are likely to ever form.

761
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:25,040
Scott: So we just might be the first life and that like if we could wait a trillion years, there would be life all over the place?

762
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,722
Rym: That is power.

763
00:51:25,742 --> 00:51:34,601
Rym: In the very least, we are early so that even if other life is happening, our signals are going to reach other civilizations before theirs could possibly reach us.

764
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:47,079
Scott: That is, I mean, it is entirely possible that if you had a universe, if you made a new universe and you made it so big and that with such odds of life and life was going to happen, there would still be a first life.

765
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:47,683
Rym: Yeah.

766
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:50,180
Scott: And on a galactic time scale.

767
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:50,723
Scott: Right.

768
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:51,870
Scott: How would that life know?

769
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,560
Scott: it was the first life if it was?

770
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:54,542
Rym: Exactly.

771
00:51:54,702 --> 00:52:03,502
Rym: It almost turns into like not the halting problem, but you get into similar types of problems that there are no answers to calculate due to the scale and due to the unknowns.

772
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:11,239
Rym: But we have a pretty good idea that Earth like planets, our planet might literally be one of the earliest of them to form.

773
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,119
Scott: Could be it's possible.

774
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,580
Scott: Yeah, which sounds like it's but it's it's a plausible explanation.

775
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,264
Rym: Exactly.

776
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:21,560
Rym: But there's other things we've learned.

777
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:32,099
Rym: The Drake equation almost wasn't pessimistic enough because we've learned some other things about Earth that make planets that are Earth like shockingly more rare than we had assumed for a long time.

778
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:38,198
Rym: And the two things that make Earth super weird are one, we have an.

779
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,840
Rym: we have an electromagnetic field that shields us from dangerous radiation.

780
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:44,528
Rym: We've learned relatively recently.

781
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:51,958
Rym: almost all the Earth like planets we've discovered when we were saying, oh, yeah, there's billions and billions of them out there do not appear to have that shield.

782
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,914
Scott: They're just so they have.

783
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:54,560
Scott: they've water.

784
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:55,363
Scott: They have water.

785
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:01,520
Scott: They're like a good distance or good distance from a nice star, but they're just getting blasted by the star all the time.

786
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:01,860
Scott: Yep.

787
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:11,423
Rym: And two, Jupiter, almost no galaxies we have observed have a Jupiter like planet also there.

788
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:16,522
Rym: And Jupiter is the main reason asteroids don't constantly hit Earth even today.

789
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,140
Scott: Well, you want to talk about alien conspiracy.

790
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,859
Scott: I got to go watch hockey and eat food.

791
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,172
Scott: But let's just end on people always talking about that.

792
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,168
Scott: Planet X used to exist between Mars and Jupiter.

793
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,300
Scott: And now it's an asteroid belt.

794
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,520
Scott: It got some alien war, some shit.

795
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,525
Scott: That's an old story.

796
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:35,418
Rym: We would have detected that, though, by gravity.

797
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,401
Scott: I'd hope.

798
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:44,640
Scott: Yeah, if there if there used to be a civilization, if there was a planet there and it had a civilization, we would have seen artifacts on it with a telescope.

799
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,142
Rym: I guess.

800
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:46,700
Rym: Well, we'll end the show shortly.

801
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:58,140
Rym: But what I'll show the cool thing about the rare Earth hypothesis, like the next sort of interesting bit, is that even with all the pessimistic shit I just said, we know how fast life evolved on Earth.

802
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:08,580
Rym: And the thing that I didn't really internalize until very, very recently was how quickly on a galactic scale Earth went from no life to shit tons of life.

803
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,520
Rym: Earth turned into a giant slimeball like so fast.

804
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:22,959
Rym: It is unreasonable, which implies that any planet even remotely like Earth would almost inevitably rapidly be filled with slime life.

805
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,420
Scott: Well, but also how long does the civilization last, right?

806
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:39,341
Scott: If you look at a galactic time scale, right, if we end ourselves and Earth goes extinct from climate change or who knows what, then all life on Earth will basically have been a blip.

807
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:39,522
Scott: Right.

808
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,480
Scott: The dinosaurs were like an extremely short period of time.

809
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:42,702
Scott: Right.

810
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:43,650
Scott: It could have been dinosaurs.

811
00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:44,679
Scott: They did go extinct.

812
00:54:45,242 --> 00:54:47,879
Scott: If nothing came after the dinosaurs, if that was the end of Earth.

813
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:49,760
Scott: Think about how short that would have been.

814
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,324
Scott: So if there's a bunch of other planets, they could have all had really short periods of life.

815
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:55,157
Scott: And that's it.

816
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:55,623
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:54:55,703 --> 00:54:57,340
Scott: And there's how would we how would we detect those?

818
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,780
Scott: There could have been one hundred planets that all had dinosaurs and then went extinct.

819
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,465
Scott: And that was the end.

820
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:03,120
Scott: So we would have seen any of them.

821
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,888
Rym: We do have some ways to detect that.

822
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,744
Rym: there's some interesting ways that are pretty plausible.

823
00:55:08,046 --> 00:55:09,779
Rym: But there's two big theories about that.

824
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:12,680
Rym: One is that there's some filter that we don't know about.

825
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:17,100
Rym: And then the debate is, are we before that filter or after that filter?

826
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:21,580
Scott: Like the four days, that kind of filter, I'm always going to bet on before.

827
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:21,922
Scott: Right.

828
00:55:21,942 --> 00:55:22,184
Rym: Yeah.

829
00:55:22,204 --> 00:55:24,200
Rym: But it's that's a complicated question.

830
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,125
Rym: There's a lot of debate around.

831
00:55:25,145 --> 00:55:32,177
Rym: like one of the great filters might be the formation of eukaryotic life as opposed to prokaryotic life, because that might have been that one.

832
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,479
Rym: That but that might be a fluke.

833
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:43,920
Rym: It might be that life is really common, but eukaryotic life that can become more complex might be a extremely rare event like it happened once.

834
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:46,019
Rym: And we got really lucky that that one thing didn't die.

835
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:58,560
Rym: But the other complication of this is that based on that data about slimeball planets, Earth being one of them, we can see a lot of planets.

836
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:10,340
Rym: There's evidence of a lot of planets like in our area that for all we know should have been slimeball planets and we should have been able to detect signatures of some sort of life or some sort of metabolisms.

837
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:28,022
Rym: And so far, we have not found any evidence, not even the most remote evidence of a slimeball planet anywhere we can see, despite the fact that statistically, based on our own formation, they should be extremely common, like way more common than the Drake equation even implied.

838
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:47,480
Rym: And one theory, the lonely Earth theory, is that there that we as observers exist and it is extremely unlikely that observers could exist, not impossible, but unlikely, we must exist in a place that is rare in the universe.

839
00:56:48,261 --> 00:56:51,700
Rym: The kind of place that can support life like us is rare.

840
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:58,180
Rym: But us being here is not weird because this is the only place we could afford.

841
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:02,400
Scott: Yeah, it's like you have a winning lottery ticket.

842
00:57:02,701 --> 00:57:04,800
Scott: It's not weird that you have a winning lottery ticket.

843
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,160
Rym: Yeah, one in a billion, one in a trillion, trillion chances.

844
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:07,721
Rym: Yeah.

845
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:12,649
Rym: If you already know you have a winning lottery ticket, then you know how rare that event was.

846
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:13,420
Rym: That's the theory.

847
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,240
Rym: We know we exist, so we might just exist in an extremely rare situation.

848
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:24,786
Rym: And I think that's enough alien talk because I would like to eat some food and watch a hockey game.

849
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:25,700
Scott: Good.

850
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,480
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

851
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:35,600
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

852
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:41,020
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

853
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:48,700
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

854
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,216
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

855
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

856
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,640
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

857
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:26,780
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Mikegidred, Lily Tenerbrite, a bunch of people who don't want me to say their names, and Chris Reimer and Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Kishiahigh85, Rebecca Dunn, Reviewed, Madbull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin VonHarl, Taylor Braun, The Iron Front, You Old, The Key to My Heart and a whole bunch of other people who don't want me to say their names.

858
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,060
Rym: So we just finished the last episode of season two of Lower Decks.

859
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,979
Rym: That show is a full on Star Trek and you should all watch it.

860
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:37,900
Rym: Scott hates Star Trek, so he'll probably never watch it or talk about it on the show.

861
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,999
Rym: But for now, I leave you with... This is a sub-manifold casting stone.

862
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:43,536
Rym: A what?

863
00:58:43,881 --> 00:58:46,099
Rym: We can use it to broadcast our voices to other planets.

864
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,158
Rym: What's that good for?

865
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:48,819
Rym: Yeah, like what are we going to do?

866
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,879
Rym: Prank call Armis?

867
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:57,909
Rym: I wish I had someone to torture.

868
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:58,745
Rym: Hey, Armis.

869
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:03,130
Rym: You look like a big bag of crap.

870
00:59:03,391 --> 00:59:03,947
Rym: Who said that?

871
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:04,728
Scott: Show yourself.

872
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:06,149
Scott: I am Armis.

873
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,850
Scott: This is my domain.

874
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,950
Rym: We already know you're Armis, dummy.

875
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,208
Rym: Come and find us.

876
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,389
Rym: We're catching your stuff.

877
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,044
Rym: What stuff?

878
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,828
Rym: Stop that.

879
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,710
Rym: When I find you, I'm going to kill you with a flake of my power.

880
00:59:18,111 --> 00:59:19,565
Rym: I am a skin of evil mouth.

881
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,988
Rym: More like a puddle of... Damn you!
