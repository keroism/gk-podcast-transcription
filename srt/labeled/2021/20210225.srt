1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,258
Rym: - It's Thursday, February 25th, 2021, I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,549
Scott: - And I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,170
Rym: - And this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,430
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about leftovers.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,028
Rym: If you have any idea for a Thursday show for the love of Satan, tell us.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,827
Scott: - Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:40,780
Scott: - Not only are we low on show ideas for especially Mondays and Thursdays, as usual, we're low on opening bits 'cause we don't go anywhere or do anything.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:50,040
Rym: - Anything that could happen to me is something that primarily happens on the internet, usually because I've read an article or in social media that Scott has also read.

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,619
Scott: - And that would be news or thing of day, it wouldn't be opening bit.

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,020
Rym: - Exactly, opening would be like, so I was riding my bike, but that's not gonna happen.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,899
Scott: - It has to be something that, I don't know.

12
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:07,979
Scott: So I guess the only thing I got for an opening bit is that it's becoming, when we first got locked in the house, right?

13
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,257
Scott: You know, I guess I worked in the house all summer, right?

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:25,160
Scott: But for some reason, I didn't have a problem with this particular thing, right?

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,434
Scott: But now, as the winter is ending, the Earth moves, right?

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,319
Rym: - Oh, are you having sunlight coming in on your monitor?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,339
Scott: - Yeah, so the sunlight's come in and hitting me in the face at like, you know, earlier in the day.

18
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:44,037
Scott: And it's hard to work, but I can't-- - Close your blinds.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,279
Scott: - They are closed.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,934
Rym: - Then they're not blinds.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,699
Scott: - Well, they're not, you know, they're not, you know, the ones that we haven't-- - You need curtains and blinds.

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,560
Rym: There's multiple layers you need in there.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,080
Scott: - But we never had those in this room, in the office room.

24
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,280
Scott: We have them in the bedroom, right?

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:08,220
Rym: We don't have them in this room, and I can't like-- - We got some ones that are, they diffuse the light enough to where no amount of it can generate glare if they're down, but it doesn't block all the light.

26
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
Scott: - Your window faces like a building.

27
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,400
Scott: There's no light coming in.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Rym: - No, there is actually, there is a narrow channel, and just as every spring, like around this time of year, that channel where there's an unblocked view all the way past Queensborough Plaza Station, a beam of light would come in, and previously it would hit my monitor directly.

29
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:36,200
Rym: But the way things were shifted around, it kind of goes between our two monitors now, but it is gone if I just close that little blind.

30
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,840
Scott: The point is, is I can't get someone to come install a blind or a curtain.

31
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:43,180
Scott: If I could do that, then I could go to the office.

32
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,313
Rym: It's like, there's no-- - Install it yourself.

33
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:46,420
Rym: It's real easy.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Scott: - It's not that easy.

35
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,760
Rym: - It's real easy, but I've installed many of them.

36
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,979
Rym: I almost said, "I'll come and help you,".

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,599
Rym: but no, that's the whole point, and I can't.

38
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:55,900
Rym: That's the problem.

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,380
Scott: - In my previous apartment, I installed it on my own, and it was not the greatest.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,399
Scott: It was a little, you know, a little dodgy.

41
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:10,499
Rym: I don't know, maybe I'm better at that, or maybe you have a weird window?

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:21,219
Scott: - I think the problem is, is that a lot of these, you know, in these apartments, right, the space on top of the windows is just like a concrete thing.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,680
Rym: - Ah, I only mount things to the sides on either side of the window, and in this apartment-- - Oh yeah, I used to have a, I had a tension rod.

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,480
Scott: I guess I could do the tension rod again, which, no-- - No, not a tension rod.

45
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:38,280
Rym: I put mounting brackets on both edges of the window on the sides, and then I mounted the thing on those brackets.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,900
Scott: - There's already a rolly thing with brackets in that spot.

47
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,300
Scott: This is like-- - So put something in front of the rolly thing.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,700
Rym: - Or take the rolly thing down.

49
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,460
Rym: I just tore those rolly things down.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,339
Rym: I tore the shitty things out, and I buried them in the back of a closet, and if we ever move out of this apartment, I'm gonna put 'em back and take my nice curtains with me.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
Scott: - Well, that's, you know, that's the story, is that it's hard to work late in the day with the sun.

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:15,560
Rym: - It is, it's funny, though, because I have a similar problem of, I've been, I was planning, like literally, right after PAX East, I was going to hire one of those services to have someone come and mount a TV on the wall so I could, like, make more floor space--.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,398
Scott: - I know a guy, you gotta get my guy.

54
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,576
Rym: - And I was also gonna have them mount that monitor we have in the kitchen on the wall there, so it doesn't have to, like, sit.

55
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
Scott: - My guy, my guy Abe, he'll hook you up.

56
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,798
Rym: - That's exactly what I was gonna do.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,120
Rym: Like, I had this plan, these three screens I wanna mount, because I could do that by myself, but fuck if I want to do that by myself.

58
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,080
Rym: And also, unlike a curtain, the consequences of me doing it poorly are far more severe.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Rym: - Yeah, you know, and my guy Abe-- - I don't wanna wake up one night to, what was that sound, to discover that my TV is broken?

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,457
Scott: - I mean, in my previous apartment, he hung the bike on the wall, and it never fell on me while I was sleeping, right?

61
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,239
Scott: And he's hung two TVs on the wall that have not fallen down on any people.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,220
Rym: - Yeah, basically, I wanna mount--.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Scott: - And he hung these two long shelves on the wall in this office here, and they're not moving.

64
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,120
Rym: - I was gonna mount ski racks way up by the ceiling.

65
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,920
Rym: I was like, I got like 10 things, well, I got like seven things I wanna mount.

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:16,039
Rym: And literally, I have this to-do box in my Google key that lists, like, mount the things, and it lists these seven things.

67
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:20,660
Rym: And the date when I was gonna do this is the weekend after PAX East.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,580
Rym: So here I am with the old TV still sitting there on the thing.

69
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,740
Rym: And also breaking, that TV's starting to die.

70
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:38,159
Rym: It's getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer, and whatever LED drives the optical audio out just doesn't light up anymore.

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,429
Scott: - Okay.

72
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:40,959
Rym: - Yep.

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Rym: So I guess we can get right into news and such.

74
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,980
Rym: It's Thursday, it's the lounge, we can talk about anything.

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,340
Scott: - Sure, your lounge.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,086
Rym: - I have got--.

77
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,319
Scott: - Let's talk about lounge, let's do a Thursday show on lounges.

78
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,800
Scott: Can you talk about the whole episode about lounges?

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,860
Rym: - I can talk a lot about lounges.

80
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:02,340
Rym: In fact, I have very, I have a lot of opinions on what I like about lounges compared to bars.

81
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,991
Scott: like, a lounge in your house, or a lounge as a place to go?

82
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,780
Rym: - I'm talking about, like, a lounge that you would go to and have drinks in.

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,260
Scott: - There's a lot of things that count as lounges.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Rym: - I like loungewear, like leisure clothes.

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,813
Rym: I like lounges.

86
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,239
Rym: - A lounge chair.

87
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,534
Rym: - Chase lounges in particular.

88
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:17,979
Scott: - Lounging.

89
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,439
Rym: - I like lounging.

90
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,678
Rym: What I like the most, I think, an adjacent topic.

91
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,359
Rym: there is sunken conversation pits.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Scott: - What's the etymology of the word lounge, anyway?

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,309
Scott: - Lounge, probably.

94
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:28,996
Scott: - Could be French, French?

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,320
Rym: - It's probably Latinic, if I had to guess.

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,137
Rym: Oh, look it up right now.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,459
Rym: Lounge, etymology.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Scott: - I'm already good with it.

99
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,080
Scott: Early 16th century.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,332
Rym: - It's gotta be Latinic.

101
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:38,719
Rym: - Something.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,550
Rym: - To move indolently.

103
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,320
Rym: (laughs) - (laughs) - I'll tell you, if there's a--.

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,300
Scott: - Latin, long, longus, long.

105
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,920
Rym: - Lungus, a slow, lazy person.

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Scott: - Old French, elongie, lengthen.

107
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,079
Scott: So there is some French Latin there.

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,078
Rym: - Yep, lungus, a slow, lazy person, which came from an earlier term, longus, an idle, stupid dreamer.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,295
Scott: - Okay.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,390
Rym: - So, you know, if I'm gonna do something, there's two ways I like to do it, energetically or indolently.

111
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,120
Rym: (laughs) I guess grudgingly is the third way.

112
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,700
Rym: Sometimes I do things grudgingly.

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Scott: - Anyway, all right, so here's the news.

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,279
Scott: There's a lot going on with this news, even though it's a K-pop news, it actually, none of the discussion around this news has to do with actual K-pop, really.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,239
Rym: - All right, I-- - And a lot-- - I skip this and don't understand it, so.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:41,998
Scott: - And a lot of what it is is, you know, some of the things are, I can't confirm, 'cause obviously, A, I don't speak Korean, B, I've never been to Korea, and C, I gotta take some hearsay from people who claim to on the internet, right?

117
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:43,238
Scott: But here's the deal.

118
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:49,540
Scott: Going back in K-pop time, right, well, first of all, just some foundational work, right?

119
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:56,539
Scott: If you are a celebrity in the United States, you can commit relatively heinous crimes and maintain a career, right?

120
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:59,900
Scott: You can be a rapist, you can be a cult leader.

121
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,300
Rym: - You can literally commit murder and lose a civil case.

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,718
Scott: - You can murder people, right.

123
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:11,238
Scott: And it's like, you can, you know, you could like, you know, the first one that always comes to mind for me are people like Mike Tyson, right, you know?

124
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,540
Scott: And you can rehabilitate your career and get extra chances that you may or may not deserve.

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:24,539
Rym: - There's a reason why in American lexicon of celebrity, there's the concept of like the apology to her, like that's a thing.

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,240
Scott: - And my opinion on that is basically like, yes, people should have second chances, but not until everyone gets a first chance, right?

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,099
Rym: - Reconciliation comes after consequences.

128
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,880
Scott: - You give somebody else a second chance, you just denied someone a first chance, right?

129
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,299
Scott: 'Cause there's a limited number of chances.

130
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,780
Scott: So give everyone a first chance, then we can talk about second chances.

131
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Scott: Anyway, in South Korea, the culture is much, much less lenient in these regards.

132
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:07,820
Scott: If you commit or like not even necessarily convicted of a crime in like jail, but like if you just like got in trouble doing something, you know, slightly bad, your career is basically over.

133
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:20,099
Scott: You have to, at minimum, like, you know, extremely apologize and like go into hiding and disappear from the public spotlight for an extended period of time until you believe it is safe to return, right?

134
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:23,460
Scott: And sometimes this is warranted, right?

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,278
Scott: 'Cause people do still commit heinous crimes and then their careers are over, right?

136
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,259
Scott: And that's kind of good.

137
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:33,900
Scott: But on the other hand, people do things that basically shouldn't even be crimes.

138
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,020
Scott: So recently a member of the boy group B2B, right?

139
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,830
Scott: Got caught with weed.

140
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:43,779
Scott: and in South Korea, you think weed is criminalized here, right?

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,940
Rym: It's way more criminalized there, right?

142
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:51,520
Scott: Actually got caught doing weed, basically career over permanently, right?

143
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,899
Scott: It's like, you know, meanwhile, if he had just lived in the US, he could weed it up, no problem.

144
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:00,940
Rym: In fact, if anyone's state he's in, he could do it live on TV and no one could say anything.

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:09,036
Scott: Right, so that's, you know, there's a whole, we could go down that road, but regardless, this opens two doors, right?

146
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,820
Scott: You know, door A, if a celebrity does something, right?

147
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,739
Scott: Then, you know, somebody could, you know, report it and ruin their career and they may or may not deserve that.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,020
Scott: But also people can falsely, right?

149
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,195
Scott: Accuse celebrities of wrongdoing.

150
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:40,799
Scott: If, you know, perhaps they're just trolls and they hate that celebrity for whatever reason, you know, some teenager and there's like a band they don't like, they can, you know, accuse them.

151
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:50,240
Scott: And, you know, if they, it might be hard to disprove and you could seriously disrupt somebody's career just by making some accusations.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Scott: Also, they don't have freedom of speech there.

153
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:58,140
Scott: Like you wanna talk about censorship, like their TV is literally censored, right?

154
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,259
Scott: The government says, no, you can't show that on TV.

155
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:06,758
Scott: And also, you can't just comment whatever you want on the internet there, right?

156
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:22,980
Scott: If you comment and you say like false rumors, you spread false rumors on the internet there, you can like get sued and, you know, whoever you spread false rumors about can take you to court and you could be in actual real trouble for doing that, which is good and also bad.

157
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,420
Scott: But that's not even the topic we're going to yet.

158
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:41,437
Rym: - Yeah, it looks like it's actually a little bit better than like the defamation rules in the UK from skimming this because it does separate defamation upon false claims from true claims, which is complicated and weird and I don't know enough about Korean law and I'm trying to like learn more about this now.

159
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,079
Scott: - There was actually a YouTube video about that particular subject with some lawyers answering questions that I could maybe find the link to again, maybe.

160
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,680
Scott: But this is the topic, right?

161
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,720
Scott: So recently, you know, over time, there have been accusations of various idols, right?

162
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,240
Scott: 'Cause idols are usually people who are, you know, maybe high school age, maybe just college age, right?

163
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,579
Scott: So they're still pretty close to their school days.

164
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:15,840
Scott: And there were at least a few idols who when they were in school, were bullies and shitty people, right?

165
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,260
Scott: Who would harass classmates and abuse classmates to various degrees.

166
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:24,940
Scott: And they just happened to end up being celebrities after school, right?

167
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:30,820
Scott: And in Korea, you know, bullying is not just like, you know, light teasing, right?

168
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,417
Scott: If someone says bullying, we're talking about like, you know, usually hitting someone, right?

169
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,999
Scott: You know, like really, you know, like demeaning and treating someone like a piece of shit on a regular basis.

170
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,140
Rym: - I mean, like that is how a lot of bullying is here too, but there is a-- - Exactly.

171
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,879
Rym: - But there's definitely, there is a, in Korea in particular, there has been a, there's a lot of news you can read about this.

172
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,699
Rym: Like don't think I'm trying to claim to be an expert on Korea.

173
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,359
Rym: Bullying, especially in the equivalent of high school, is a specific societal problem that's trying to be addressed there.

174
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,880
Scott: - Yeah, it's a big problem.

175
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:15,040
Scott: And there, you know, it's like, I've seen some people who have said that the, who, I haven't seen any data for this and I don't believe it, that, you know, they used to have corporal punishment in schools, right?

176
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,879
Scott: You used to just beat the kids in Korea a lot more recently than you were able to beat the kids in the US.

177
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,139
Scott: I guess maybe, or maybe not, right?

178
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:22,669
Scott: - Yep.

179
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,980
Rym: - It wasn't that long ago that you-- - Fun fact, I was beaten in school 'cause I went to a Catholic school.

180
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:29,279
Scott: - Right, sure.

181
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:37,140
Scott: But there are people who are saying like, yeah, since that went away, kids were, now can bully and the teachers can't do anything about it.

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,880
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, I'm pretty sure the kids are probably, I'm pretty sure the kids are bullying before then also.

183
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,660
Rym: - Yep, and also like in America at least, the teachers could do something, they just don't.

184
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,300
Rym: And we've talked about that on GeekNights before.

185
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,659
Scott: - Right, so that's yet another topic, right?

186
00:13:52,101 --> 00:14:07,420
Scott: But what's happening now is there were a few cases where people, you know, had the victims, right, they had the courage to call out the idols who bullied them accurately and they ruined people's careers, right?

187
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,878
Scott: Perhaps deservingly so.

188
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,420
Scott: But now what has happened is there are floodgates.

189
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:27,800
Scott: Like there is, they had to make a mega thread because so many idols have been accused of bullying with varying degrees of, you know, truth or supporting evidence and whatnot, right?

190
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,540
Scott: Basically it's like, well, whose career is over now, right?

191
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,840
Scott: Is it real, is it not?

192
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:34,420
Scott: Is this a troll, right?

193
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,140
Scott: Normally under normal circumstances, you just believe the victims, right?

194
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,100
Scott: That's the default, right?

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,877
Scott: Believe the victims.

196
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,540
Scott: But when you, this is like a special area where it's like, yeah, I wanna believe all the victims, of course.

197
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,140
Scott: But there is such a large culture of anti-fandom, right?

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,840
Scott: Where, you know, and there are so many people who have also been shown to be crying wolf, right?

199
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,486
Scott: Like there is.

200
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:06,680
Scott: some people were like, they accused someone of bullying and a whole bunch of people come out and they're like, actually I was in school with that person, you're full of shit, right?

201
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,975
Scott: And so now you can't know, it's harder to believe the victim no matter how much you want to, right?

202
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:21,680
Scott: It's like, even if you keep telling yourself to believe the victim and like, you know, all the wolf crying infects your brain.

203
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,440
Rym: - Yeah, the intersection of celebrity and modern connected fan culture makes this a like perfect storm of difficult situation.

204
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,780
Scott: - So now it's like, there's just this flood of constant accusations against various peoples.

205
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,500
Scott: And it's like, well, is this person bad or not?

206
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,519
Scott: I saw one the other day and based on internet, you know, text I read on the internet, which is nothing, right?

207
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,100
Scott: It seemed like it was false.

208
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,539
Scott: And there was another one I read today.

209
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,199
Scott: that seems way bad, like it's true, right?

210
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:56,820
Scott: You know, based on the text I read on the internet, which is, right, who knows, right?

211
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,680
Scott: I never met these people.

212
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
Scott: I don't speak their language, right?

213
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:11,060
Scott: So now the other interesting thing, and I don't know how true this is, but regardless of whether this is true, part of it is true and it's very interesting.

214
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,800
Scott: So in Korea, they have Naver, which is basically Korean Google, right?

215
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:22,580
Scott: You know, Webtoon, that thing we talk about frequently, Naver runs that, Naver runs a lot of stuff.

216
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,777
Scott: But if you're doing a web search in Korea, you're using Naver, you're not using google.com, right?

217
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:33,759
Scott: And on the Naver homepage, they have, it's not like the Google homepage where it's just a search box.

218
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:40,039
Scott: They list like, here are the top 10 things people are searching for right now, real time search rankings.

219
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,679
Scott: And that's kind of a big deal.

220
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,700
Scott: Like people, you'll see celebrities be like, woo, I released my song and I was number five in the real time search rankings, right?

221
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,460
Scott: It's like people are paying attention to that thing more than we pay attention to like Twitter trending topic.

222
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:06,339
Rym: - Yup, I mean Twitter trending topic is ignored unless, the only time I've ever clicked on one is when I can't fathom what is trending around that word.

223
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:20,619
Scott: - So a true thing is that they're actually going to be removing, I don't know the exact details 'cause I can't read the homepage, but one of those trending sections is like gonna get removed from the Naver homepage.

224
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,596
Scott: Like they announced this.

225
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,819
Scott: So someone suggested that it could be possible, right?

226
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:41,380
Scott: That the flood of accusations are coming because once that thing is gone, you won't be able to get the attention on your accusation anymore.

227
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:45,720
Scott: And people are rushing to make the accusations while that thing is still there.

228
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:51,819
Scott: So I don't know if that part is true, but the part about the trending thing being a big deal there and it being removed soon is true.

229
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:55,900
Scott: But that's just really fascinating, right?

230
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:06,939
Scott: Like imagine if Twitter was like, we're gonna remove Twitter trends next week, what would people do this week in terms of manipulating Twitter trending topics while it was still a thing?

231
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,900
Scott: - I think the differences-- - How would people's behavior change next week after it was gone?

232
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,073
Rym: - I think the difference is generally.

233
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,560
Rym: American fan cultures have never been like organized around trying to make things trend.

234
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:34,958
Rym: It's mostly been like bots driving that sort of thing, usually for political purposes or like or K-pop stuff often gets forced that way often from the fans, but I bet nothing would change and nothing would be different because Twitter trends are not the cultural touchstone here that a lot of people seem to think they are.

235
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Scott: - What if the Google homepage showed you the top 10 things people are searching for right now in real time?

236
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,598
Rym: - Yup, I wonder what that would look like.

237
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,200
Scott: - Yeah, I know, there is that other page they have, the Google whatever, Google trends or whatever.

238
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,659
Scott: that shows you stuff, but no one goes there, right?

239
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,199
Scott: Would that change people's behavior?

240
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:14,660
Rym: - This is why this is such a, like there's so many topics here in this news because like that microtopic of like fan culture and like organized fan activism for the intellectual property that they happen to enjoy and how weirdly organized and rabid they're getting about it as time goes on.

241
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,299
Rym: Like there's a whole week of GeekNights episodes about just that.

242
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:28,076
Scott: - Right, I can just say, all I can say is that A, it's one of those cases, much like GameStop where someone has found a way to push the buttons on their keyboard, right?

243
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,929
Scott: Do nothing, don't have to leave your chair, you can just push buttons on your keyboard and cause real consequences for real people in the real world.

244
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:41,560
Rym: - I mean, we had that news the other week where someone added a bunch of poison to the water supply by just touching buttons on a keyboard.

245
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,200
Scott: - Sure, but that was a more difficult button pushing.

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,219
Rym: - Well, apparently it wasn't, but anyway.

247
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,139
Scott: - Well, for someone who has to have some amount of technological prowess, right?

248
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,900
Scott: This is literally like you can tweet and cause problems in the world, right?

249
00:19:55,625 --> 00:20:02,800
Scott: You can sign up for an E-Trade account and push a button and cause GameStop stock to, you know, cause Wall Street to panic, right?

250
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,279
Rym: - Well, it gets down to a fundamental thing.

251
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:12,740
Scott: - That power of being able to put just, without that much technological knowledge, just being able to touch your phone in a pattern, right?

252
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:22,776
Scott: Just rub the face of your phone and the world changes is so alluring that whenever it's possible, whenever someone finds a way to do that, people will do that.

253
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,540
Rym: - Well, we talked about this, in 2016, we did a panel at a PAX called The Grind.

254
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:40,437
Rym: We're talking about grinding in games, but we talked a lot about the problems that arise in any system, doesn't have to be a game, when the incremental cost of taking an action that has some sort of meaningful effect approaches zero.

255
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:52,459
Rym: Couple that with the way social media lets people organize those basically costless transactions, the costless actions they can take.

256
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:04,459
Rym: It's very, instead of an old day where you would have to hit that button a million times, you can hit a button once and 999,000 other people will each then hit that button once and have the same effect.

257
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:10,040
Scott: - Yep, well, it is a cyberpunk tale, the likes of which GeekNights cannot ignore.

258
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,615
Scott: And that is the news.

259
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,479
Rym: - I'm sure we'll be talking about topics and fallout from this for some time to come.

260
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:30,478
Rym: So if there was ever a news that was a like, where if we brought up the topic or like this came up in conversation, a random listener or Scott or anyone who knows me would say, wow, that's a really Rym thing to be talking about right now.

261
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:31,998
Rym: This news will be up there.

262
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:36,899
Rym: This would be up there with things like, we're talking about how nuclear weapons are made or how to set clocks.

263
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,920
Scott: (laughing) - How to make annoying noises.

264
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,147
Scott: - Wah.

265
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
Scott: - If the clock on the trumpet was set improperly.

266
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:55,540
Rym: - So this, if you're not familiar, Scott, with the mystery and I'm making quote fingers here of Dyatlov Pass, like have you ever heard of that thing?

267
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,438
Scott: - No.

268
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,179
Rym: - Really?

269
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,479
Scott: - Maybe I don't.

270
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,060
Scott: Maybe I do know it and I just don't know the name of it.

271
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,396
Rym: - You might.

272
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:10,480
Rym: So this is the kind of thing that people tell ghost stories and have conspiracy theories about it, but the thing itself really happened.

273
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,800
Rym: Basically in 1959, and I know a lot about this because it's fucking Rym, like it's me, what do you want?

274
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,699
Rym: You'll see why this is up my alley in a minute.

275
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,717
Rym: - Uh-huh.

276
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:28,537
Rym: - A bunch of kids like went out on a hike into the wilderness in 1959 in some mountains in Russia and they never came home.

277
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,833
Rym: So people were like, oh, like.

278
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:33,097
Rym: they sent a search party to go find out like what happened to these kids.

279
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:43,840
Rym: And they eventually found in the Dyatlov Pass, which is an area they were gonna be hiking through, they found their naked, mutilated, radioactive bodies.

280
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
Scott: - Okay, I have not heard this story.

281
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Rym: - It was like the biggest news in 1959.

282
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,120
Rym: Like this was a mystery.

283
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,039
Scott: - Well, I wasn't around then, so.

284
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,220
Rym: - But yeah, so in the Soviet Union, like this was a big deal.

285
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,340
Scott: Like it was a mystery.

286
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,728
Scott: - I'd say so.

287
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,220
Rym: - What the fuck happened to these people?

288
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:08,593
Scott: - That's probably, that's an even bigger news than the kids trapped underwater that happened a little, you know, when was that, 100 years ago?

289
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,411
Scott: - Yeah.

290
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,420
Scott: - It was Thailand, right?

291
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,320
Rym: - Yeah, I recall.

292
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,460
Rym: - That feels like it was from a different time and it feels like it happened right after Dyatlov Pass.

293
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Rym: - So anyway, this was a real mystery that was solved for, like it is solved and has been solved for a long time from a. this is probably what happened standpoint, but there were so many weird attributes of the story that no scientists could say, yes, 100%, this is what explains like weird part of the--.

294
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Scott: - You can't 100% explain anything.

295
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,233
Rym: - Exactly, solipsism, fuck it.

296
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:46,858
Rym: Drop the mic.

297
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,960
Rym: But conspiracy people and UFO people in the '60s were obsessed with this, so.

298
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,439
Scott: - Of course, why wouldn't you be?

299
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,600
Rym: - And to this day, people are obsessed with this.

300
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:14,080
Rym: There is an article that came out recently like this year where the part of this that was actually unexplained is pretty definitively explained thanks to Disney's Frozen, the movie.

301
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,038
Rym: Literally, no joke.

302
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,080
Rym: Yeah, this article is fascinating.

303
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,079
Rym: I can break it down pretty quick 'cause I'm a weird nerd.

304
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:29,200
Rym: So here are the things that were strange about the incident when they found their bodies and I can explain them all with common sense.

305
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,020
Rym: One, the bodies were all naked.

306
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,180
Rym: That makes sense.

307
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,380
Scott: - They were probably fucking in the woods.

308
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:36,220
Rym: there's a thing called paradoxical undressing.

309
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,559
Rym: Humans will just take off their clothes.

310
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,647
Scott: - Okay.

311
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:40,300
Scott: - That's interesting.

312
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,379
Rym: You didn't know that?

313
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Scott: - I knew a lot about hypothermia, but I didn't know that about hypothermia.

314
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
Scott: - Okay, so if you are ever-- - Thank you voyage of the Mimi.

315
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,722
Scott: - All

316
00:24:47,742 --> 00:25:01,277
Rym: right, my advice to you, Scott, in case this ever comes up, 'cause I think this might've been important that you didn't know this, if you are ever really cold and then with nothing changes, you start to feel too warm and you feel like you should take your clothes off, fucking don't.

317
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,920
Rym: Your body is lying to you because it's broken.

318
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,380
Rym: People who are experiencing hypothermia will literally undress themselves.

319
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,759
Rym: Like it's like, that is a thing.

320
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Rym: So obviously hypothermia, that's why they were naked.

321
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,980
Rym: Two, their eyes were missing.

322
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,588
Rym: Coyotes or something.

323
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:19,498
Rym: just ate them, like duh.

324
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,899
Rym: That's like animals will go after the eyes first.

325
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,840
Rym: But I can see why that would have been creepy.

326
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,920
Rym: They found these bodies and their eyes were missing and they were naked.

327
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,279
Scott: - Weren't there other animals chewing on other parts?

328
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,460
Scott: - They were like a little bit.

329
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,500
Scott: - When you see bite marks near the eyes or something?

330
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,299
Rym: - There were some bite marks and things too, but like the eyes were missing from literally every body and people were like weirded out by that.

331
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,759
Rym: Also remember, some of these things, only conspiracy nut jobs were weirded out by.

332
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,559
Rym: The Soviet like researchers who like were studying this explained these things pretty straight away.

333
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:57,220
Rym: Mystery three, all the people had suffered severe blunt traumas, like they had been beaten with baseball bats.

334
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,800
Rym: That was unexplained at the time.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,539
Scott: - Someone beat them.

336
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,320
Rym: - One of the theories was they were murdered 'cause they got close to some Soviet like military thing or UFOs or whatever.

337
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:08,680
Rym: But that's the part they solved.

338
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,079
Rym: That was the one unsolved part.

339
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,619
Scott: That was actually unsolved.

340
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Scott: - Has "Frozen" solved that part?

341
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,038
Rym: - Science has solved that part with the movie

342
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:15,220
Rym: "Frozen.".

343
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,300
Scott: - "Frozen" solved that part.

344
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,536
Rym: - Yes.

345
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,460
Rym: So part four, the bodies were found scattered across a wide area.

346
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,519
Rym: Like a few of them were found way down in the woods.

347
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,999
Scott: A few of them were found- - They were trying to walk for help and they died in different places.

348
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,820
Rym: - Yep, the ones who weren't beaten to death were running to get help, or at least get somewhere like in the trees to then try to make a fire and warm up before they died.

349
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,460
Rym: Some of them were dragging bodies- - Makes common sense.

350
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,678
Rym: - Or trying to rescue the other people who were hurt, et cetera.

351
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,160
Scott: - I'd be surprised if they all died in the same spot.

352
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,699
Scott: Like if you're sitting there with your, I don't know, eight friends and they're all dead, are you just gonna keep sitting there?

353
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:58,039
Rym: It's like- - Yeah, if you find a campfire with eight skeletons sitting around it, that is suspicious as fuck.

354
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,659
Scott: - Yeah, that's way more suspicious than some bodies around.

355
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,682
Rym: - All right, the bodies were radioactive, which was a sensible, like.

356
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:13,320
Rym: that seems to be true that the bodies, there was radiation- - It's Soviet Russia, there's uranium just in the woods.

357
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,813
Rym: - Nope.

358
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,160
Scott: So there's a lot of- - They ate too many bananas, all bananas.

359
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
Rym: - There's a lot of nut job conspiracy theories about that.

360
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,260
Rym: The answer is pretty simple.

361
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,597
Rym: This is another thing that anyone who camps would already know.

362
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,860
Rym: Camping lights are radioactive.

363
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,299
Rym: Like there's thorium in them.

364
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:28,097
Rym: That's how they work.

365
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,248
Scott: - Oh, well in 1950 something, yeah.

366
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,400
Rym: - Even today, you can get camping lights, unless you're- - Not if it's a lithium LED thing.

367
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,280
Rym: - No, but if it's powered by kerosene.

368
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,660
Scott: - Sure, but no, you're not using those.

369
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,144
Scott: 1958, in 1958 you are.

370
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,538
Rym: - Yeah, but even in modern times, there are often use cases for a kerosene lantern because they also provide heat.

371
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:51,260
Scott: - Hmm, maybe.

372
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,040
Rym: - And they're way brighter than LEDs.

373
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,000
Scott: Like for how much- - Depends on the LEDs.

374
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,479
Rym: - For how much fuel and weight you have to carry with you.

375
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:06,840
Rym: Anyway, the way camp lanterns work is they don't actually, it's not the fire that is providing the light.

376
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,099
Rym: The fire is actually really small.

377
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:13,400
Rym: There's a metal mantle around it that gets heated up by the fire and then it radiates light.

378
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:19,734
Rym: They use thorium and other nonsense that happens to glow with more visible light and less infrared light.

379
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:21,679
Rym: Like that's that.

380
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,539
Rym: That explains the radiation, but the radiation is also the thing that the UFO nut jobs are all obsessed with.

381
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:33,419
Rym: So this article explains why the bodies looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to them.

382
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,640
Scott: Originally, common sense people assumed- - That's what happens to your flesh when you get frozen?

383
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,420
Rym: - Nope, so common sense people had assumed there must've been an avalanche, they were sleeping in their tents and avalanche happened.

384
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,400
Rym: They were like pushed down the mountain and hurt severely.

385
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,780
Rym: And then they tried to like make a fire, get help, help their friends and slowly- - How long did it take them to find the bodies?

386
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,480
Rym: - Weeks, months.

387
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,200
Scott: - Then you'd still, you'd see evidence of an avalanche, I think.

388
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:04,400
Rym: - So that's where it gets complicated.

389
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:13,439
Scott: Possibly not because avalanches are not that well understood, especially- - You'd see that up on the mountain there wasn't enough snow and there was too much snow down by the bottom.

390
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,840
Rym: - Avalanches aren't around, there was snow there and now it's down here.

391
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,980
Rym: They're more around a surface in layering of snow shifts.

392
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:25,760
Rym: And if you're not an expert and depending on the terrain, like that is not as straightforward as you would think.

393
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:36,680
Rym: But also all the data we had as of like last year showed that avalanches don't cause that severity of blunt trauma.

394
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Scott: Like they don't beat you up- - You just get buried in snow and suffocate and freeze.

395
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Rym: So how come these people looked like they were beaten to death and then some of them froze to death?

396
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,618
Rym: Like one, an avalanche couldn't really cause that.

397
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,880
Rym: And two, the terrain they were on shouldn't be able to have an avalanche.

398
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:58,599
Rym: At least not to the scale that would have been necessary to cause this disaster.

399
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:12,520
Rym: Effectively, the snow that was used, the effects in the movie "Frozen" led to developments to do avalanche simulations that were much more precise and accurate than we had done previously.

400
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:33,640
Rym: And researchers were able to simulate the kinds of conditions in this particular region and determined that in the right conditions, it's rare but not impossible, an avalanche and that type of terrain, which would seem impossible even to experts, could happen suddenly and would cause that kind of blunt trauma specifically.

401
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:47,400
Rym: - They were killed by a freak, like one in a million avalanche because where they happened to camp was a place that by all knowledge of experts at that time and until recently, should not be able to have an avalanche.

402
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:48,840
Rym: They miscalculated.

403
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,440
Rym: They just got really unlucky and set up camp in the wrong spot and were murdered by a ridiculous avalanche.

404
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,920
Scott: And this article- - That's a good reason to stay inside in the winter and not go skiing or do anything else stupid in the mountain.

405
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,259
Scott: - So, sorry- - The lesson here is don't ski.

406
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Rym: - Sorry, weird nerds.

407
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:14,680
Rym: It wasn't a natural uranium reactor that formed in this ravine due to the shape of the mountain nor was it UFOs.

408
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,240
Scott: - Don't ski, don't hike, stay inside.

409
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,570
Rym: - But anyway, things of the day.

410
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:33,270
Rym: So a few of you, more than one person and fewer than 10 people have been commenting on my beard over the course of this.

411
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,929
Rym: 'cause I generally don't wear a beard and during quarantine, I've been wearing a beard.

412
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:46,690
Rym: So the annoyance of a beard is that it's actually, assuming you are lucky enough if you want a beard to have the kind of hair that will grow into a nice beard.

413
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,021
Rym: 'cause some people just can't grow a beard even if they want one.

414
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,550
Rym: - That's true.

415
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,089
Rym: - Assuming like you're past that point.

416
00:31:52,870 --> 00:32:01,390
Rym: The other problem with a beard is if you just, most people, if you just let a beard grow naturally, you're gonna look like a deranged mountain man eventually.

417
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,435
Rym: Yeah.

418
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:08,509
Rym: You might look like someone who knows a lot about posix and eunuchs, like.

419
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:18,187
Rym: - But if you try to trim a beard, it is very easy to fuck it up and then you have to get rid of the whole thing.

420
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:37,770
Rym: Beards are actually like, they're much like much, the reason why people who style hair have to get certifications and get some training is one, for racism that we'll talk about in another episode someday, but two, because it is a skill, like dealing with hair is, and like styling it is really difficult.

421
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,848
Rym: There's a reason why everyone's hair looks like shit right now.

422
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:53,830
Rym: 'cause we can't go get haircuts from people who know what they're doing and it's really hard to do that right at home unless either someone you know is an expert or two, you have a really simple hairstyle that you can achieve without having to have much knowledge or skill.

423
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,967
Rym: So I had to learn how to take care of my beard better without just going to a barber to do it.

424
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:05,429
Rym: for me and of all the videos and things I found, this one's the best.

425
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:17,345
Rym: This is like, this is a 10 minute video that will explain in like very specific detail exactly how to shape a beard if you want to have a beard, kind of like the one that I'm sporting right now.

426
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:23,230
Rym: And I learned a bunch of tricks and it made it way easier to manage my beard during quarantine.

427
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,630
Scott: - My major beard problem was not a problem with the beard itself, it was face skin problems.

428
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,110
Rym: - Oh, this talks about that too, about like beard oil, all the different ways to keep face skin.

429
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,429
Scott: - I tried that shit, it didn't work.

430
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:38,668
Scott: It partially worked.

431
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:48,569
Scott: It's much easier to take care of my face skin, it was much easier to shave the beard and rub shit on my face skin than to do.

432
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,890
Rym: - I'll get stuff in like my chest hair area but I'm very lucky in that I don't have any like face skin problems at all.

433
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,470
Scott: - I don't either, if I keep shaving my face and applying things to my face.

434
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:13,489
Rym: - But the one takeaway, if you don't watch this video and you are the kind of person who has a beard but the beard just feels like it looks messy and shitty, it's shaping a beard requires kind of constant upkeep.

435
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:19,389
Rym: but people who have beards that you might think, oh, they look really good, it's because they're literally doing this like every couple of days.

436
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,648
Rym: You can't just have a beard unless you're really lucky, you actually got to do stuff to it.

437
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:36,188
Scott: - I think the other thing is that, regardless of your shaping, is like you have to start the beard, you do just sort of have to like, let it go until it reaches point X and then you do the shape of the beard.

438
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,929
Rym: - This video actually talks about that, let it go until it hits that point.

439
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,770
Rym: 'cause if you try to shape it before then, it's gonna look terrible.

440
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,270
Scott: - Exactly, you just gotta let it go until you have the beard.

441
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,609
Scott: then you can start doing it and then you have to keep doing it.

442
00:34:48,389 --> 00:35:02,390
Rym: - But the main reason I make this my thing of the day is that everything they tell you in this video, you can do at home if you have any sort of clipper and any way to shave yourself, like you don't need specialized equipment or like anything super fancy.

443
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,250
Scott: - You need something sharp.

444
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:10,749
Rym: - Yeah, and it's aimed at you doing it to yourself in front of a mirror, it doesn't require another person to help you.

445
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,670
Scott: - That is something that's different about a beard versus hair, right?

446
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,269
Scott: It's all in the front.

447
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,369
Scott: Hair, you gotta do the back.

448
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,231
Rym: - It even solved the problem and it was an obvious solution for me that I always have of.

449
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:30,430
Rym: I try to make the two lines like the same size on both sides of my face and then I make one of them too short, I try to make the other one match, I made it too short and then the whole beard's gone.

450
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:33,770
Rym: I have avoided that for months thanks to this video.

451
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,469
Scott: - Oh, good, all right.

452
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:36,769
Scott: So I got a thing of the day here.

453
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:45,990
Scott: All around the world people are playing sports that they shouldn't, but I guess there's nothing I could do to stop them really, so I'll whatever.

454
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:52,570
Scott: One of the sports, a sport I don't pay attention to often but I have some amount of respect for is rugby.

455
00:35:54,972 --> 00:36:02,670
Scott: And there is a team of rugby players that I didn't know existed called the Kaiviti Silk Tails from Fiji.

456
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:15,469
Scott: They're the Fiji professional rugby team and under normal circumstances they would play and I guess it's the NSWRL, I guess that stands for New South Wales Rugby League I imagine.

457
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,509
Rym: - I'm pretty confident you are correct.

458
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:29,969
Scott: - And the coach of the Kaiviti Silk Tails is a person named Wes Nyguama, I think I'm pronouncing the name correctly because I heard an announcer at a rugby game say it on YouTube.

459
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:34,810
Scott: And he is a famous former rugby player.

460
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:43,529
Rym: - That's always dangerous though because I literally had a teacher in high school when we were learning about Goethe who pronounced it-- - Goeth.

461
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,209
Rym: - Goeth and I had another teacher at RIT, a professor who also pronounced it Goeth.

462
00:36:52,210 --> 00:37:11,209
Scott: - Yep, but I know for a fact though that like for example, if you're a hockey announcer you gotta pronounce a lot of names, French Canadian names, European names and I know for a fact that the hockey announcers go and they talk to the players or have someone else do it and they get the correct pronunciations and practice them at least if they're any good at the job.

463
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,149
Scott: So I trust a sports announcer pronunciation more than a teacher pronunciation.

464
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,797
Scott: Anyway, so this team wanted to play in the season.

465
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:24,890
Scott: that was happening in Australia, right?

466
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:26,848
Scott: But you know, they're in Fiji.

467
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:30,489
Scott: So what the fuck they gonna do with this pandemic going on?

468
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:31,770
Scott: They got a situation.

469
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,910
Scott: The pandemic I guess is less bad down there but it's not non-existent.

470
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,249
Scott: They still got a quarantine and such.

471
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,447
Scott: So the plan was this.

472
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:42,542
Scott: They would go to Sydney.

473
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:47,907
Scott: I assume they had like a flight or a boat or something just to themselves as guy, right?

474
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:53,126
Scott: They went to Sydney and they went to this hotel and they stayed in that hotel, right?

475
00:37:53,690 --> 00:38:01,770
Scott: Pretty much with no one else for 14 days and they survived a quarantine for 14 days to prove that they didn't bring any COVID from Fiji.

476
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:08,530
Scott: and then they can go about engaging in their rugby play according to whatever protocols that league has set up, right?

477
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:11,530
Scott: That seems all perfectly normal, right?

478
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:14,212
Scott: And for 2021.

479
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:16,490
Scott: So what the hell about this is a thing of the day.

480
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,381
Scott: Here's what it is.

481
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,490
Scott: Before, after they finished their quarantine, right?

482
00:38:22,392 --> 00:38:27,089
Scott: The team, the hotel architecture just happens to be really conducive to this.

483
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,689
Rym: - Oh wow, yeah, you're right.

484
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,288
Rym: Look at that.

485
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:47,890
Scott: - The team came out and to thank the hotel staff for taking care of them in their 14 days of isolated quarantine in the Sydney hotel where presumably no one else was staying other than them and the staff and presumably the staff weren't leaving.

486
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,730
Scott: 'Cause I guess they must've been quarantined in there with them, right?

487
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,849
Scott: Otherwise it makes no sense.

488
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,369
Scott: The staff could have just brought in some COVID, right?

489
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:58,270
Scott: They sang the staff.

490
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:00,889
Scott: I'm sure they paid them also, but I hope they did.

491
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:07,368
Scott: But they sang the staff this congratulatory song or thank you song, I guess.

492
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:12,910
Scott: And it's like, yeah, let me see your professional sports team sing, right?

493
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,789
Rym: - God, I just imagine like trying to hear the Rangers sing something together.

494
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,428
Rym: - Kratty could play the piano at least.

495
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,164
Scott: - They can barely sing like a holiday song to play on the jumbotron.

496
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,009
Scott: How are they gonna sing a thank you song to the hotel staff?

497
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,790
Scott: But yeah, really good singing here.

498
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,690
Scott: They could form a little choir on the side.

499
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,329
Scott: A little chorus, yeah.

500
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:33,905
Rym: - Cool biz.

501
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,204
Rym: In the meta moment, can't fucking go anywhere.

502
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,867
Rym: So let's get right into it.

503
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,509
Rym: Leftovers, one, it's a food show.

504
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:44,170
Rym: Somehow we haven't talked about this.

505
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,069
Rym: We got another food show.

506
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,810
Scott: - Yeah, leftovers could refer to a lot of other things that are leftover, but we're talking about food leftovers.

507
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,770
Rym: - Yeah, food leftovers.

508
00:39:51,650 --> 00:40:00,947
Scott: - The common use of the word is when you had some food and then you didn't eat all of it, there's some leftover food and you eat it later or you don't eat it later.

509
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,850
Rym: - Yeah, that latter one's important.

510
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,370
Rym: But there are two distinct classes of leftovers.

511
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,050
Rym: Leftovers you get from a restaurant, like a doggy bag and food you made.

512
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,388
Scott: - Yup, and you made too much.

513
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:28,609
Rym: - But what's interesting about this topic, I think the reason why it actually kind of makes sense to talk about it now is that if I look at my life, my entire childhood, leftovers were really important because as a family, my parents were busy and cooking food was a pain in the ass and we didn't always have time.

514
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,930
Rym: Leftovers were a great way to plan meals in such a way that they didn't have to cook as much for a family.

515
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,089
Rym: And then-- - Yeah, my mom would cook.

516
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:42,350
Scott: She would cook one night and then two days later, we would eat the food from two days previous.

517
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,230
Scott: You know, so she doesn't have to cook again.

518
00:40:44,450 --> 00:41:02,209
Scott: It's like, yeah, why should, you know, if you cook, even if a smaller portion or a larger portion doesn't significantly increase or decrease the cooking effort, depending on what you're cooking, obviously, but you know, it's like, you know, if I'm making cookies, for example, right, putting more flour into the mixer doesn't take longer.

519
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:08,970
Scott: I can make more cookies in the same amount of time as long as I don't have to do a second mix, right?

520
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:19,929
Rym: So then, leftovers became extremely important to me personally when I was at RIT because I was poor as shit and couldn't even afford food.

521
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:27,470
Rym: So making a meal that was big enough to eat like three more times was really important to my survival.

522
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:39,569
Rym: Like I would plan my meals, or like I'd cook that giant beef bolognese like spaghetti thing and you and I would eat it for like three or four days sometimes, get a little dodgy toward that fourth day.

523
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,509
Scott: - Regardless, yeah, that's how it goes.

524
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:55,769
Rym: - And that continued into like our lives in Beacon when we had to commute 'cause we didn't have time, like our whole life was structured around, let's cook few meals that can then be re-eaten on later days so we don't have to cook every single day.

525
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:58,824
Rym: 'Cause we had to take a train home for an hour and then record GeekNights.

526
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:00,749
Rym: 'cause back then we did GeekNights four nights a week.

527
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,670
Scott: - Yeah, you get that crock pot going, right?

528
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:06,550
Scott: And that's gonna feed you for like a few days, right?

529
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:16,750
Scott: And the thing is, there's a question of like, when is it, it's sort of an arbitrary distinction of like, when is it leftovers and when is it just meal prep, right?

530
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:37,650
Scott: 'Cause that's what a lot of people, I know a lot of people is like, I've even heard of like families doing this where like they'll do meal prep, like they'll spend, it was a guy I worked with years ago, at least 10 years ago and his family, whole family would like, parents, siblings, on Sunday, they would do meal prep and cook a shit ton of food and like fill their fridge with cooked meals.

531
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:40,589
Scott: And I don't even know if they would eat one of those meals on Sunday.

532
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,250
Scott: It would just be, and then the rest of the week, they wouldn't cook anything.

533
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,669
Scott: They would just be eating those, you know, for lunch, dinner, whatever.

534
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,810
Rym: - My line, I have two lines there, I think.

535
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,210
Rym: Like when it, by default, everything is food prep.

536
00:42:53,531 --> 00:43:00,970
Rym: It is leftovers if you ate some of it and then you put the rest of it away, like after you ate that.

537
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:07,149
Rym: You get a big casserole out, you're eating a bunch of it, you look at what's left and you package up, put it back in the fridge, leftovers.

538
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,450
Scott: - Right, well, the ultimate leftover is when you have a family feast of some kind, a Thanksgiving, a Seder coming up, right?

539
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,210
Scott: Some kind of holiday feast, right?

540
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,550
Scott: And you make stuff during those feasts, like a whole damn turkey or a whole big blob of potato.

541
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,729
Rym: - Cal and a stuffing.

542
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,950
Scott: - Yeah, you make like a pile of food, right?

543
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:36,964
Scott: And then people just sort of serve themselves from that buffet family style and there's gotta be leftover, it's unavoidable, unless you invite way too many families.

544
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:37,790
Scott: and then, right?

545
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,470
Scott: And that's the ultimate leftover.

546
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,189
Scott: 'cause that is the tastiest food.

547
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,790
Rym: - Well, 'cause also it's usually the special food that you don't make that often in your normal life.

548
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,167
Scott: - Oh yeah.

549
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,029
Rym: - Like I like stuffing, I don't make stuffing like that often.

550
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,628
Scott: - It's also conducive to reheating.

551
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,590
Rym: - Exactly.

552
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:08,330
Rym: - But where something also becomes leftover is, even if you did the meal prep, if all you really like ate some of it, but maybe you like cut it in half first and put one half in the fridge and ate one half right away.

553
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:14,489
Rym: If the only thing you have to do to it is just reheat it, might also just be considered leftovers.

554
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:23,550
Rym: But if it's like, you've gotta actually do a primary cooking or a primary kitchen thing to it, other than just reheating it, then it might've been more meal prep.

555
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:32,910
Scott: - Right, 'cause like you might make meatballs and then you might sauce up half the meatballs and then just put some bare meatballs in the fridge.

556
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,370
Scott: And those are still, I think, an ingredient, right?

557
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:50,549
Scott: And there's still an ingredient because when you finally go to eat them, hopefully they don't go bad, you might, for example, put them on a bread and make a meatball sub, which wouldn't be a leftover, 'cause the first time you use the original meatballs or some other dish.

558
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,203
Rym: - And then, well, basically in terms of my life though, to get back to what I started with, why I think this is an interesting topic.

559
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:20,809
Rym: right now, as we moved to the city and I didn't have to commute and there's more local grocery stores and I can walk to places and food delivery and everything, I got to the point to where we didn't, leftovers, I liked them, but they weren't that important because we tended to start buying a lot of food to cook fresh and cooking a meal that is enough for both of us.

560
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:28,570
Rym: We didn't generate as many leftovers and there wasn't as much time pressure in my life where I needed to make sure there were leftovers.

561
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,666
Scott: - Well, I think that comes to-.

562
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,130
Rym: - And now leftovers are an important part of my life again, 'cause I got to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in this apartment seven days a week.

563
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,490
Scott: - Yeah, there's a few things going on there, right?

564
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,990
Scott: It's like, depending on the number of people you have, if you only got one person, oh, I got hiccups.

565
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:51,910
Scott: If you only got one person, portion sizes in the US are gonna be too much for a meal, right?

566
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:59,229
Rym: So it's really hard to go on- remember that RIT where I'd cook, I'd heat up a can of green beans and eat a ham steak.

567
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:08,650
Scott: - But it's like, even if you go on the internet and you search meals for one, it is really hard to cook a meal for one person, one serving, right?

568
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,330
Rym: - Breakfast is doable, not lunch and dinner as much.

569
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:23,730
Scott: - Yeah, it's like, you could make one sandwich, but it's like you bought ingredients for that sandwich and those ingredients don't, you can't really buy a number of slices of cheese for one sandwich.

570
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,669
Rym: - If you're making sandwiches for one and you buy some ham, you're having ham sandwiches for a week.

571
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,280
Scott: - You go to the deli, you're like, "I want an eighth of a

572
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,725
Scott: pound.".

573
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,450
Scott: It's like, you get a quarter or a half.

574
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:43,909
Rym: - When we were at RIT one time in Wegmans, I did actually get an eighth of a pound of sliced ham and an eighth of a pound of cheese because I could not afford to buy more food.

575
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,029
Rym: Those were rough times.

576
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,249
Scott: - Anyway, but yeah, once you get two people, it's like, there's a lot of meals you can cook.

577
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,309
Scott: that are two servings, right?

578
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,609
Scott: If I get a Blue Apron, we're doing the meal boxes, see our previous episode, right?

579
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:00,330
Scott: All those meals are mostly two serving meals.

580
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:05,830
Scott: If there's two people who are home and eating, cooking and then eating, there's no leftover, right?

581
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:06,888
Scott: It's a two serving meal.

582
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:15,290
Rym: - But it's also very easy to, for two people, double that recipe to four and then have a meal plus that meal again on another day.

583
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:20,390
Rym: But with one person, doubling a meal to two is not nearly as straightforward and easy.

584
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:27,849
Scott: - Yeah, when I was one person, I would cook a Blue Apron and I'd eat half and I'd put half in the fridge, right?

585
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:31,190
Scott: If you got two people there, that doesn't happen, right?

586
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,850
Scott: You just eat them both, leftover doesn't exist.

587
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:47,330
Rym: - But above that scale, I find the only leftovers that tend to be useful, like when a bunch of people are around, are the one pot or big mush type meals, like a big stew, a big casserole, a big pizza, that kind of thing.

588
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,070
Scott: - Oh yeah, pizza slice leftover.

589
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,224
Rym: - Yeah, that's what I had for lunch today because we ordered pizza last night.

590
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:54,888
Scott: - Ooh, exciting.

591
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:06,250
Rym: - The other kind of leftover, the restaurant one, I don't want to give that short service, we talked about this on "GeekNights" years ago, but we first went to Australia for our, like that first PAX Australia.

592
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,890
Scott: - Australia coming up two times today.

593
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,208
Rym: - Right?

594
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:11,050
Rym: We went to this Mexican restaurant.

595
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,423
Rym: Now, we both know better now, never go to a Mexican restaurant in Australia, holy shit.

596
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,630
Scott: - We went there because that was the only place that was open at that time of night, pretty much.

597
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:31,370
Rym: - We went to this Mexican restaurant late at night on like Phillip Island, and we ordered what we thought was a reasonable amount of food, and it was like, it was an inordinate amount of food.

598
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,349
Rym: - Yup, way too much food.

599
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,869
Rym: - They brought us like a comical amount of food.

600
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:44,027
Rym: And then we were like, whatever, like we just had, the whole time we were like, well, we'll just wrap this up, take it back to the hotel and like heat up in the microwave and like, cool.

601
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:53,210
Rym: And then at the end of the day, like at the end of the meal, we asked for the check and we're ready to leave, and we asked if we could have a doggy bag, and the waitress is like, no, it's illegal.

602
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,488
Scott: - And I didn't think she said it was illegal, she just said no.

603
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,609
Rym: - Yeah, well, she said no, and she's like, she said we're not allowed to, 'cause that restaurant had a policy.

604
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:08,710
Scott: - Yeah, I don't remember anything about being illegal, but she definitely said no, and definitely did not let us take the food.

605
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:14,266
Rym: - Yup, and we were like, okay, you're just gonna throw all this away, and she's like, yup, and I was like, okay.

606
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:23,129
Rym: But I encountered this, 'cause I've been to Australia many more times, I've encountered this, I've had restaurants tell me it was illegal straight up, like all sorts of nonsense.

607
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:31,329
Rym: The deal is, a lot of countries other than the US have way better food safety rules, though a lot of countries have worse rules.

608
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:44,430
Rym: Australia actually is a lot more on target about the dangers of takeaway food from restaurants, because a terrifying number of Americans get food poisoning from leftovers, like it's a big problem.

609
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,081
Scott: - Really?

610
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:45,230
Scott: - Yeah.

611
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,710
Scott: - I did not know, this is news to me, how do you get food poisoning from a leftover?

612
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,529
Rym: - By not chilling it fast enough.

613
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:54,848
Rym: Most people, it sits out on the table for a long time, but they're not home.

614
00:49:55,471 --> 00:50:22,950
Rym: The difference between being at home and being at a restaurant is that most people, when they eat at a restaurant, have to travel a decent distance to get back home, probably dessert and other things, so the food that they are going to take home with them in the doggy bag has been sitting in the danger zone for a significant amount of time, and when they get it home, they're not weird like me, they don't crash cool it before they put it in the fridge, they might let it sit out for a little while, or they put it in the fridge and it takes a long time for it to get to a safe temperature.

615
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:26,770
Rym: It's real easy to fuck yourself up with leftovers from restaurants.

616
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,188
Scott: - Okay.

617
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:40,490
Rym: - So in Australia, it's like culturally expected that you wouldn't take food home from restaurants, and many restaurants will tell you they won't let you, 'cause they don't trust you to not get food poisoning and then try to come after them for it somehow.

618
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:47,429
Rym: In America, if you try to go after a restaurant, because the leftovers you took home made you sick, you are not gonna win that case.

619
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:54,190
Scott: - No, but you'd have to get sick from the food while you're in the restaurant, and you'd have to prove it was the food's fault and nothing else.

620
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,230
Rym: - And even then, you probably are not gonna be able to get any recompense from that restaurant.

621
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,582
Scott: - Yeah, if you wanna get recompense, you have to get burned by coffee.

622
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:02,026
Scott: that's 1,000 degrees.

623
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,910
Rym: - Yup, which again, that case was justified.

624
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,670
Rym: That specific case.

625
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:12,630
Scott: - Exactly, I'm saying, it would have to be something so egregious and obvious, like coffee that's way too hot.

626
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:20,469
Rym: - Yup, because even in the year of our lower 2021, I hear people misrepresent what happened with that McDonald's case.

627
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,101
Scott: - It's easy to do.

628
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:37,330
Rym: - Yup, but honestly, living in the city, just for personal anecdote, living in New York City, leftovers from restaurants are one of my favorite things, 'cause I can get home real quick and I know food safety.

629
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:43,010
Rym: I am confident that I can safely transport those leftovers home and reheat them later.

630
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:57,762
Scott: - I mean, I just put them in the fridge immediately as soon as I get home, and I never really thought about the food safety aspect of it, but I guess it hasn't been a problem because most of the time, even pre-pandemic, the leftovers from restaurants would have been delivered to my house anyway, so I'd

631
00:51:57,843 --> 00:51:58,125
Rym: eat them,

632
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,410
Scott: and then they wouldn't even have time to be in the danger zone traveling home.

633
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,188
Scott: They're already home.

634
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,915
Rym: - Yup, 'cause that's another thing that's changed in my life.

635
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:05,609
Scott: - Just go right in the fridge.

636
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:24,389
Rym: - I don't know about you, but definitely, as I've lived in New York City, which is no more time pressure in my life, but also, at least not from commuting, but also, as I ate at better restaurants and had a little more money, fancier and better places tend to have smaller portions when you eat out, so leftovers are less of a thing,

637
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:25,974
Scott: and

638
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:31,709
Rym: the kinds of places I get leftovers from are the kinds of leftovers that are very easy to safely reheat.

639
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,728
Rym: We're talking about things like dumplings or a pile of Indian food.

640
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:50,189
Scott: - Yup, well, it's like, they're also, because of the cost of delivery and eating out, I kind of actually want the extra food, so if I order Indian food, I will order samosa, and they give you two samosas.

641
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:55,150
Scott: I'll order some sort of meal that will be dumped onto rice for eating.

642
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,228
Rym: - Which is already usually at least two people's worth of food.

643
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,650
Scott: - Right, and then maybe some naan and maybe a mango lassi.

644
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,250
Scott: It's the first time I eat, when I eat the food immediately, I eat one of the samosa, right?

645
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,307
Scott: I'll eat some of the stuff on rice, whatever the food I got was, right?

646
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:17,046
Scott: Some sort of curry or who knows what, and then I'll tear the naan in half and eat half of it 'cause it's enormous, right?

647
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:18,849
Scott: And then I'll drink the whole mango lassi.

648
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:22,835
Scott: And then the second time, it's like, well, I don't

649
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:23,180
Rym: have mango

650
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,661
Scott: lassi anymore, but I have a half a

651
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,444
Rym: naan,

652
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:39,550
Scott: and if I ate all the rice, I could just make more rice in my rice cooker or heat up the old rice, and then I still have the food in a plastic container that I can dump on the rice, and I got another samosa that I can heat up in the toaster oven or the microwave.

653
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,170
Scott: And it's like, it's perfect.

654
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,930
Scott: It's like, yeah, it costs a lot of money, but I actually divide it by two, very reasonable.

655
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,370
Rym: - Yeah, like same with the pizza.

656
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:55,490
Rym: Like I'll order a whole pizza, though lately in COVID times, 'cause we don't, like can't eat out that often, there's a very limited type of food I can get delivered easily.

657
00:53:56,474 --> 00:54:09,090
Rym: So whenever there's a food like pizza that scratches an itch that I can't easily scratch by going out like I would in pre-COVID times, sometimes we just get into goblin mode and eat the whole pizza, even if we were planning on having leftovers.

658
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,810
Scott: - Yeah, the number of slices I've been eating has been varying.

659
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,790
Scott: Like sometimes I'll be eating two, and sometimes I'll be eating four, and the pie we usually get has eight.

660
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,787
Scott: - Yep, four.

661
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,109
Scott: - It's a big difference whether I go two or four.

662
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:30,269
Rym: - I find that as I'm getting older, I'm hitting that point of four slices of pizza, if it's too late, is a recipe for heartburn and indigestion.

663
00:54:30,956 --> 00:54:33,390
Rym: 'Cause I am hearing 40.

664
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,170
Scott: - Sometimes it happens though.

665
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,749
Rym: - Have a little red wine with it, and then yeah, where it's thumbs time.

666
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:49,230
Scott: But leftovers- - Yeah, I think leftover wise, there are some foods that are like good as leftovers.

667
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,970
Rym: - Oh, we could do like a tearing of leftovers.

668
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,790
Scott: - Yeah, like there's some foods that like they don't reheat well.

669
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:01,730
Scott: It's like, yeah, okay, you got some leftover, whatever it is, but it's like, what are you gonna do with it, right?

670
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:02,806
Scott: It's like, eh.

671
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,190
Rym: - Well, that's like the bottom right.

672
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:12,750
Scott: - Sometimes you have some leftover, yeah, you have some food that's leftover, but it's like, how are you gonna reheat that?

673
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,205
Scott: It's kinda, you know, what are you gonna...

674
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,850
Rym: - Well, that's the transformative nature.

675
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:22,570
Rym: Like there are foods that you cannot really reheat to be the same thing again, like fried chicken.

676
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:33,370
Rym: You cannot reheat fried chicken to the same level of like expected quality, but you can use fried chicken to do something in a dish that is not just fried chicken.

677
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:43,910
Rym: Like I'll scrape the chicken off with a fork and like mix it up into something and cook it like in an omelet or make a sandwich out of it, but I won't try to reheat the fried chicken to then bite into a drumstick.

678
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:55,150
Scott: - Oh, I mean, I will do that, but I just won't expect it to taste and be as crispy as it was originally, but I will use the toaster oven and it will be much crispier than it would have been using microwave.

679
00:55:55,432 --> 00:56:05,870
Rym: - No, but like the S tier, the foods that are the easiest to reheat where the quality is similar to, or if in some cases identical to the original.

680
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:10,310
Rym: Pizza, as long as you do it right, pizza reheats so well, just do not...

681
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,149
Scott: - You gotta make a real, real hot oven.

682
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,830
Rym: - Make your oven like however hot, unless you know the temperature, my advice is simple.

683
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:25,410
Rym: However hot you think you need your oven to be for pizza to reheat it, just make it hotter than that and put it in for a shorter time than you think is necessary.

684
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,109
Scott: - Just watch it and when you see the cheese move, - As soon as the cheese is bubbling a little bit, take it out, it's good to go.

685
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,590
Rym: Like 400 degrees, that's pretty good, but you could go hotter.

686
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:37,090
Scott: - Yeah, 500, nothing wrong with that.

687
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,129
Rym: - High temperature, short time, that is the way to do pizza.

688
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:48,190
Rym: The only alternative like way to reheat a pizza, but it's a pain in the ass, is to put it on like a cast iron griddle.

689
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:49,427
Rym: That actually works pretty well too.

690
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,769
Scott: - That works too, 'cause it's basically a pizza.

691
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,069
Rym: - Microwave turns a leftover pizza into just disgusting poison.

692
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:57,889
Scott: - Yep, pretty much.

693
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,789
Rym: - Like the cheese turns like kind of translucent, it gets like slimy and chewy.

694
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,650
Rym: And so many people make the mistake of doing the load.

695
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:11,630
Rym: A lot of people generally with leftovers will try to do low temperature long time, 'cause it feels like--.

696
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,248
Scott: - No, that's the danger zone that we talked about.

697
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:22,489
Rym: - Yep, not only is it the danger zone, but the bacteria, but too, that feels safe, 'cause like in a sous vide, oh, I can't overcook it.

698
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,689
Rym: You can definitely overcook things at a low temperature for a long time.

699
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:27,870
Rym: But it's like a pizza in the oven.

700
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:28,749
Scott: - You can also dry the fuck out.

701
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,630
Rym: - At like 300 for an hour, and see what comes out of your oven.

702
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,747
Rym: You're not gonna wanna eat that thing.

703
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,570
Scott: - It'll be way too dry, way too dry.

704
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:51,969
Rym: - But like Indian food in particular, but also a lot of like Chinese dishes, like kind of take out delivery Chinese in America at least, the best way to reheat it in my opinion is to put it in a sauce pan with some oil, and again, high temperature, short amount of time.

705
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,988
Scott: - It depends, you know.

706
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:59,150
Rym: - Unless it's a saucy thing, like a soupy saucy thing, then just reheat it like you would a sauce.

707
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,750
Scott: I never wanna put that stuff in the microwave usually.

708
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,730
Scott: - That is the, you know, you hate a microwave for any use, but actually that is the use of a microwave, is that particular thing.

709
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:27,310
Rym: - It depends on what's in the dish, 'cause if the dish has a significant amount of inconsistent thicknesses or ingredients, like an Indian dish that is a sauce with large chunks of chicken in it, the chicken will get dried out even as the sauce gets overcooked in a microwave.

710
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,910
Rym: But if it's just like a sog with nothing else in it, the microwave could actually do it pretty well.

711
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,430
Rym: 'cause you don't have these like inconsistent areas.

712
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,829
Scott: - You just gotta do like 30 second mix, 30 second mix if you're really worried about that.

713
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:43,841
Rym: - But that will not solve the problem of if the chunks of chicken meat are too large, they will dry out.

714
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:44,469
Scott: - Bust it up.

715
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,630
Rym: - They also will not get hot enough in the center in a microwave.

716
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,229
Scott: - Bust it up in advance.

717
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:54,110
Rym: - Or, but if you don't wanna bust it up, you could just put the whole thing in a sauce pan and let it steam for a while, it'll taste way better.

718
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,050
Scott: - Microwaves a lot less work and you don't have to clean a sauce pan.

719
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,770
Rym: - Sauce pan goes in the dishwasher.

720
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,810
Scott: - I usually don't put the pans in the dishwasher.

721
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,429
Rym: - Why, they just work?

722
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,090
Scott: - 'Cause there's not enough room in there for all dishes.

723
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,157
Rym: - I got, what, how?

724
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,769
Scott: - Gotta run it two times with them.

725
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,649
Rym: - You don't have to run it two times, what the hell?

726
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,598
Scott: What are you doing?

727
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:14,849
Scott: - You don't have to run it one, 'cause not all the things would fit in one shot.

728
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:16,802
Scott: I'd have to run it once and then--.

729
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,250
Rym: - It's one sauce pan.

730
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,549
Scott: Just one, just one in the sauce pan.

731
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,530
Scott: - Yeah, but that means the dishwasher would fill much more frequently if I was putting large things in it.

732
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,770
Rym: - One sauce pan takes the space of like four cups.

733
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,589
Scott: - It's got that big, long handle on it.

734
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,250
Scott: It takes a long handle.

735
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,650
Rym: - I can just put stuff over the handle.

736
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,409
Rym: The handle doesn't actually impede the water at all.

737
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:43,350
Scott: - No, it doesn't impede the water, but it impedes, I can't like put a plate where the handle is.

738
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,589
Rym: - Yeah, but I can put other cups over where that handle is.

739
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,990
Scott: - I guess my dishwasher, just the sticks on the racks in the dishwasher are not great for putting large things.

740
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:53,629
Scott: - I might be lucky.

741
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,729
Rym: Our dishwasher, like the sticks are really, when we first moved into this apartment, it was a weird layout.

742
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:05,830
Scott: - I mean, you can adjust some of the sticks in our dishwasher, which is handy, but you can't adjust them in a small area.

743
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,170
Scott: It's like you adjust it and you've adjusted half the rack.

744
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,490
Rym: - I guess it's a total aside, but I remember when we moved into this apartment, I remember thinking the layout in our dishwasher is weird.

745
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:21,910
Rym: Like it wasn't like any other dishwasher I'd ever seen or used, like it's just kind of weird, but it seems like it's just better.

746
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,470
Rym: Like it's way easier to cram it full of stuff and everything cleans just fine.

747
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,770
Scott: - I mean, I can cram it full of stuff.

748
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,630
Scott: I usually just don't put big old pans in there, you know?

749
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:32,302
Scott: I just put every plate we own instead.

750
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,790
Rym: - But some things require specific technique to reheat well.

751
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:45,310
Rym: Like if you have just like a biryani and you try to put that in a microwave, it's gonna get dried out and weird.

752
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,330
Scott: - Hmm, you can add a little water.

753
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:57,650
Rym: - Yeah, if you add a little water and put it in a microwave, it will reheat in a very inconsistent way and you'll literally run into like peas that are still cool while there are pieces of rice that are effectively burned.

754
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,109
Scott: - And so you got to do 30 seconds in the stir and do 30 seconds to stir it.

755
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:08,610
Scott: - Yeah, what I've found, what I do now-- - Or do like three minutes in the microwave, then the whole thing is so hot, nothing's uneven.

756
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:17,390
Rym: - Nah, I just look online to find professional chefs and their advice for how to reheat different kinds of things and I make a very simple evaluation.

757
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,549
Rym: Is the method they describe too much of a pain in the ass?

758
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:26,510
Rym: And does the result significantly, is it significantly different from the shitty way I might've done it otherwise?

759
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,909
Rym: And that's how I decide how to reheat different things.

760
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:36,850
Scott: - The one thing is that in a fancy restaurant, right, they have those little like, it's sort of like the little broiler that like hangs from the top, right?

761
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,749
Scott: And it's just like, you can just slot something in.

762
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:39,949
Scott: Like I forget what that's called.

763
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,410
Scott: It's like a little, it's basically like a little broiler, but it's just got a little slit opening, basically, like a little hatch that opens in the front.

764
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:50,230
Scott: It's above, it's not below, like with your oven, right?

765
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:57,910
Scott: And that is a super good way to reheat stuff or keep stuff hot, especially like, you know, like a piece of meat or something.

766
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,009
Scott: It's like, those things are way good, but you don't have one of those.

767
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,529
Rym: - Yep, convection ovens are really good for reheating stuff too.

768
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,530
Rym: Way better than an oven for many purposes, except pizza.

769
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,750
Scott: - But they could also dry things out, so you can, yeah.

770
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:14,810
Rym: - But you can get away with shorter time in a convection oven for reasons, depending on the dish.

771
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:19,010
Rym: Like a samosa in a convection oven will reheat pretty well, actually.

772
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,849
Scott: - Yeah, that's a good use for it, 'cause it's a fried thing to begin with, right?

773
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:29,529
Scott: it's like a lot of people call the convection oven an air fryer, which I think is, you know, I think that should be illegal to do that.

774
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,349
Rym: - I remember being so mad about that.

775
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:36,650
Rym: I just always assumed that air fryers would like mist something with hot oil in some way, just use less oil.

776
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:38,247
Rym: Then when I learned that it's nothing.

777
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:40,050
Scott: - Yeah, it's nothing.

778
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:49,342
Scott: But if you have an already fried thing, like a samosa, right, or French fries, and you put them into an air fryer, convection oven.

779
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:49,690
Rym: - They got you.

780
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:50,323
Scott: - Right?

781
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:51,328
Scott: Yeah, they got me.

782
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,510
Scott: If you put it into a convection oven, it's like, well, it's already been fried.

783
01:02:54,950 --> 01:03:00,610
Scott: That's gonna actually be a decent way to reheat it and maintain its crispy nature.

784
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:00,965
Rym: - Yeah.

785
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:18,850
Rym: So in terms of the food safety thing, one thing that I never did when I was younger, but I do now, because I learned a lot more about food safety, is that most leftovers, you actually got to reheat that shit all the way to about 160, or you might take in a significant bacterial load.

786
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,529
Rym: - That is something I never, I used to just heat things until they were warm enough.

787
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:25,890
Rym: And sometimes I'd even eat things cold.

788
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:33,647
Rym: But now I do, when I read leftovers, I make sure I use a meat thermometer and I actually make sure I got it to a safe temperature long enough to kill whatever might be in it.

789
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:48,329
Scott: Something else is if you, depending on what you're cooking, you might be able to increase the food quality and safety, perhaps as well, by preparing, knowing it's gonna be a leftover.

790
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,149
Scott: So let's say you wanna make a chicken parm.

791
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:57,689
Scott: So most of the work of the chicken parm is frying the chicken.

792
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,350
Rym: - Fry a few eggs for chicken.

793
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:07,069
Scott: - So you pound out and fry, say like four chicken boobs, and you can only gonna eat one chicken boob.

794
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,669
Scott: And you got three extra chicken boobs.

795
01:04:10,632 --> 01:04:12,328
Scott: So you're only gonna eat one right now.

796
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:17,008
Scott: So put some sauce and melt some cheese on that one right now that you're gonna eat.

797
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,309
Scott: Don't sauce and cheese the other three.

798
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,762
Rym: - Yep, same point.

799
01:04:20,782 --> 01:04:21,206
Scott: - Put those in.

800
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,500
Rym: - You wanna make a salad?

801
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:23,170
Rym: - Put those shit away.

802
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,330
Rym: - And have salad leftovers.

803
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:29,690
Rym: Don't put the croutons in the whole salad 'cause they're gonna turn into just mush if you put that salad in the fridge.

804
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:34,489
Scott: - Exactly, so you make the salad, but you don't put the crouton in there.

805
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:42,230
Scott: That way, you only put the crouton in at the table and you're gonna have a better leftover salad experience.

806
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:42,847
Scott: - Exactly.

807
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:46,690
Scott: - You might not even wanna put dressing in the salad in advance, only put it at the table.

808
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:54,989
Rym: - The other thing that I do now, I learned this when I worked in restaurants, but I started applying it to my own life a few, like several years ago.

809
01:04:55,515 --> 01:05:04,750
Rym: And it's actually helped a lot because if you adequately crash cool something, like a proper leftover, you cooked it, and now you wanna just put the whole thing away.

810
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,990
Rym: Consumer fridges can actually cool things down that quickly.

811
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:18,250
Rym: And in fact, if you put something that's too warm in your fridge, it might make other things that are next to it in your fridge unsafe in a way you don't realize.

812
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:27,561
Scott: - Depends, usually just one little- I mean, it's possible, but it's like, yeah, you put one little container of food in there that is a little bit warm.

813
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:28,250
Scott: - Well, here's the example.

814
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,910
Rym: If you have a whole pot of hot soup and you put it in the fridge and it's next to your milk, your milk's probably fucked.

815
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,550
Scott: - Yes, that would be a bad situation.

816
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:40,728
Scott: But I think most of the time you're putting in like a little reusable container with some stuff in it, that's fine.

817
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,670
Rym: - Yeah, it's a little bit, 'cause if it's a larger amount of leftovers.

818
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:52,910
Scott: - If you put in a giant, still hot cauldron of chicken soup into the fridge, yeah, you're gonna significantly cause some trouble.

819
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,650
Rym: - But here's the sort of the rocket fuel equation.

820
01:05:56,512 --> 01:06:06,610
Rym: If you let a larger thing, like say you ate half a casserole, you want for the other half in the fridge, if you let it sit out until it's cool enough to safely put in the fridge, it's been in the danger zone too long.

821
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,389
Rym: There's too much bacteria growing in there.

822
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:12,529
Rym: But if you put it right in the fridge, it's gonna fuck up your fridge for like four hours.

823
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:18,270
Rym: The way to do it is there's two techniques that I learned from professional chefs.

824
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:27,830
Rym: One, you take whatever the dish, whatever it's in, like say it's a big pot of soup, dump it out into another pot that is at room temperature.

825
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,009
Scott: - Nope, there's a lot of heat in the pot.

826
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,430
Scott: - And you can just get rid of all that heat instantly.

827
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,750
Rym: - And then you just put that second pot right in the fridge.

828
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:49,009
Rym: Or number two, take that second pot and stick it in a bowl of ice water and let it sit there outside of your fridge for like 10 minutes first to crash cool it, to get it through the danger zone as fast as possible before you put it in the fridge.

829
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:54,130
Scott: - Yeah, I basically never put anything in the fridge in its like original container.

830
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,650
Scott: I always, I have these like reusable glass lock things.

831
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,268
Scott: - Yep, yep.

832
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,989
Scott: - It's basically just a glass food container with a plastic lid that snaps on.

833
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:14,669
Scott: They also have a little hole that you can open and close and that's really useful 'cause that way you can just open the hole and put it in the microwave or close the hole and put it in the fridge and whatnot.

834
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,810
Scott: Or you can take it with you to eat if you actually go to a work or something.

835
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,110
Scott: You know, that kind of thing.

836
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:34,225
Rym: - Yep, and I guess in terms of like left, the thing that I think everyone does is there'll be a leftover that you like, it's might be safe to eat, but you're not 100% sure.

837
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:39,408
Rym: So you choose to just not eat it and eat something else instead, but you don't throw it away yet.

838
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:45,930
Rym: And then a couple of days later, well, now it's definitely bad and then you feel a lot better about throwing it out.

839
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:47,190
Rym: I feel like that's a pattern.

840
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,288
Scott: - Yeah, we had a recent meal.

841
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:53,430
Scott: It wasn't from, it was the sun basket box, right?

842
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:58,889
Scott: And the meal came with these two sweet potatoes and they were fucking huge sweet potatoes.

843
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:05,970
Scott: And the way it had me cook the sweet potatoes was a good way, but I think their proportions were way off.

844
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:10,469
Scott: I had to like, you know, it was like, you know, we're mixing honey in there to sweeten them up and stuff.

845
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,669
Scott: And I added more honey 'cause they were so big, but it still kind of wasn't enough.

846
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:18,488
Scott: And we kind of got full and there was still a lot of potato left.

847
01:08:19,154 --> 01:08:27,709
Scott: So I put the sweet potato, you know, back in the fridge, right, in a different container, but it's like, there was no opportunity to just eat some sweet potato.

848
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:30,948
Rym: - Yup, like that's gotta be like a side dish to another whole meal.

849
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:41,749
Scott: - Right, it's like, we would have had to, you know, we were unexpected to have them and there was no plan to make something to go with them, right, and we were eating other things that were planned to eat.

850
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:45,902
Scott: And so the sweet potato had to go, it outlived its welcome.

851
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:46,850
Scott: sadly, right?

852
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:59,669
Rym: - My rule now is basically 48 hours, or if I look in the fridge and I wanna eat a leftover, but I balk at all, like, I feel it's like, oh, I wonder if it's actually still safe.

853
01:09:00,331 --> 01:09:09,969
Rym: If my instinct is I don't wanna eat it right now and I choose to eat something else, I assume I should just throw it away 'cause it's gonna be like the banana that never gets turned into banana brew at that point.

854
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,460
Rym: - This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

865
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,678
Rym: I'm gonna post something to the forum.

866
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,720
Rym: I'm gonna make a little Google thing, like a survey to fill out if anyone wants to join.

867
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,979
Rym: We started a game a long, long time ago.

868
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:36,297
Rym: that was all good fun in Civ V. I wanna do it again in Civ VI.

869
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:38,059
Rym: So keep an eye out from that.

870
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,699
Rym: I'll probably post that out there tomorrow.

871
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,657
Rym: But for now, I will leave you with...

872
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,939
Scott: - Oh my God.

873
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:44,930
Rym: - What?

874
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,019
Scott: - Did you just kill him?

875
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,379
Scott: - Yeah, I guess I did.

876
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,119
Scott: - I mean, that guy's single-handedly killed hundreds of our men.

877
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,559
Rym: - I mean, he was just standing there.

878
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,320
Scott: - I mean, did you punch him hard?

879
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,117
Rym: - I guess.

880
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,059
Rym: Just a standard punch.

881
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,119
Scott: - I mean, do we still stand guard?

882
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,499
Scott: That guy was the guy.

883
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,559
Scott: - Yeah, that was the guy.

884
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,360
Scott: - That was the guy this was all about.

885
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,919
Scott: I mean, it's not like there's another guy.

886
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,420
Scott: - I guess we should tell the boss.

887
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,900
Rym: - Yeah, okay, sure.

888
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,517
Scott: - Cool.

889
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Scott: - Hey, boss?

890
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,279
Rym: - What do you want?

891
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,420
Rym: You should be guarding.

892
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,960
Rym: He could show up any minute.

893
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,440
Rym: - That's kind of the thing.

894
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,914
Rym: He already was here.

895
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,137
Scott: - Well, bring him in.

896
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:26,958
Scott: I want to see him.

897
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,140
Rym: - Well, we already took care of him.

898
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,577
Rym: - You what?

899
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,480
Scott: - Well, he was just standing there and I punched him and he died.

900
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,780
Scott: - This is same guy who chased us across seven continent.

901
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,198
Rym: - Yep.

902
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,659
Scott: - Same guy who took down 30 of our helicopter.

903
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:47,120
Scott: The guy we shot with RPG and he fall out the plane into ocean attacked by shark on boat and boat explode.

904
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:47,959
Rym: - That's the one.

905
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,520
Scott: - You punched him and he died.

906
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,078
Rym: - Yeah.

907
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,840
Scott: - Okay, I guess that's good.
