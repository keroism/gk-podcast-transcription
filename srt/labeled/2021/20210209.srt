1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,259
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:10,500
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:14,109
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,714
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:21,990
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about asynchronous play in games as opposed to synchronous play.

6
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,828
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:30,190
Rym: So, uh, I don't need to say, "Oh, I've been playing some Overwatch," because I'm pretty much always playing Overwatch.

8
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:43,170
Rym: Like, if I'm actually at my computer playing a video game, I'm either playing a co-op game with, like, the Scotts, or I'm playing Overwatch, or I'm playing Hades, or I'm playing an asynchronous game like 18XX, but we'll get to that.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:53,937
Rym: But Overwatch now, they use their arcade, like, the non-competitive, non-ranked place you can go to just play a game, to try stuff out.

10
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:55,589
Rym: Like, they'll put weird modes in there.

11
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,350
Rym: And they kept putting all these different flavors of capture the flag.

12
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,925
Rym: Like, they're clearly trying to make capture the flag a thing.

13
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,330
Rym: I think I've even talked about this before.

14
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:14,095
Rym: Like, they know capture the flag, the sort of true genesis of the kind of genre of competitive FPS, that became Overwatch.

15
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,624
Rym: Like, the originator of that.

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,090
Rym: They want to make that work.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:29,013
Rym: And I think they're actually getting close, because over the last couple years, those CTF modes have just gotten, like, more and more playable, and more and more interesting, and more and more good.

18
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:38,285
Rym: And now, in the arcade, instead of different types of capture the flag just, like, coming and going, now capture the flag is its own category.

19
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:45,463
Rym: And in that category, it has two, like, arcade modes, and a ranked competitive mode.

20
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,203
Rym: I'm gonna start playing, more so than I've ever done competitive, like, regular Overwatch.

21
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:58,506
Rym: I'm gonna dive deep into competitive capture the flag, because that mode is my goddamn jam.

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,510
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:10,226
Scott:  The thing about capture the flag as a whole, right, is that when you play capture the flag video game, tribes, something like that, right, it's like the flag is like,

24
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,149
Scott: "Bruh-ver!"

25
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:11,410
Scott: Right?

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,595
Scott: Or, you know, TF2.

27
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,086
Scott: It's like, there's the flag, or the briefcase, or whatever.

28
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,774
Scott: It's in this holy location.

29
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:19,305
Rym:  You want, like, old Counter-Strike, where you could hide the hostages.

30
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,550
Scott:  No, right.

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,010
Scott: And, well, I mean, I'm saying it's about, you know, getting in there, past defenses, right?

32
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:29,363
Scott: Going fast, dodging, you know, killing enemies.

33
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:36,335
Rym:  They almost all have the concept of, there's a midfield, there's, like, an offensive zone for either side, and then a defensive zone.

34
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,320
Rym: Very much like hockey.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,804
Scott:  In real life, in real life, like, that capture the flag is kinda boring, right?

36
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:49,540
Scott: In real life, the good capture the flag is, like, enormous, enormous woods.

37
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,668
Scott: You don't even know where the fucking flag is.

38
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,093
Scott: It's almost, like, a hide-and-seek.

39
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,906
Scott: It's very zoomed in, like, "You're hiding behind a tree," right?

40
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,471
Scott: That kind of thing.

41
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:01,443
Scott: And no video game does that capture the flag at all, ever.

42
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:07,390
Rym:  I think one reason for that is that, in a video game, that would probably be boring as shit and difficult to make competitive.

43
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,375
Scott:  Yeah, obviously.

44
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,090
Rym:  I mean, even in real life, it's only fun because you're out in the woods.

45
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:25,050
Scott:  But the video game capture the flag comes from that experience, yet doesn't look like it, much in the same way that the JRPG comes from the D&D experience, and yet is nothing.

46
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,978
Rym:  Oh, that's a good way to think about it.

47
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,131
Scott:  It's like when they moved it over to video game, right?

48
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,302
Scott: It's like, "Oh, this is really fun to do in real life.

49
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,427
Scott: Let's make a video game of

50
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:33,548
Scott: it.".

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,311
Rym: Oops.

52
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,577
Rym:  Actually, so think of this.

53
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,061
Rym: Then we'll get into the news.

54
00:03:39,184 --> 00:04:03,828
Rym: So, games like Among Us and Fall Guys, like, low-investment, like, massively social games, are really popular lately, for a what if you made a game that was capture the flag, but instead of, like, what you described, but instead of trying to make it, like, a supremely competitive, deep experience, kind of just crank it out at the Among Us/Fall Guys level, and make it massive.

55
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,718
Rym: Like, it just makes server 40 on 40.

56
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:10,911
Rym: It's a giant, like, woods map, and people are sneaking around trying to get the flag.

57
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,915
Scott:  I played a game like that.

58
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:14,867
Scott: I think it might somewhat still exist.

59
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,336
Scott: I played a game like that way back in the day.

60
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,065
Scott: It was just a 2D overhead view.

61
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:21,290
Scott: You were in these little vehicles.

62
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:39,599
Scott: They were kind of, like, it looked like UFOs, maybe, and it would be, like, three on three, and you had, like, a laser, and you had, like, a grenade kind of item, and you had a little health bar, and you would move real slow, and you would, you know, you had a team, and you tried to go around and get the flag and bring it back to your base.

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,523
Scott: What was that game called?

64
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,335
Rym:  I don't know this game, but that sounds interesting.

65
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,442
Scott:  It was, like, a really tiny little game.

66
00:04:45,462 --> 00:05:01,963
Rym:  But I've realized that, well, not realized, we've talked about, we've done panels about this concept before, Horse Remorse, but a game like Fall Guys can be very fun, and people get weird, like, really competitive about it, even if a lot of it ends up being pretty random.

67
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:07,380
Rym: So I feel like there's a way to make a slow, zoomed-in capture the flag.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,186
Rym: that's just massively multiplayer.

69
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:14,610
Rym: that would scratch a social itch, even if it wasn't the kind of competitive game that we normally tend to like.

70
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,530
Rym: I don't know, I feel like there's a space there, there's an unfilled niche.

71
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:38,631
Rym: Anyway, and some news, we didn't talk about this when it happened, but I want to talk about it now, because it's been weighing heavy on my approaching 40 brow, but Counter-Strike, the game that we played from near its beginning, late last year.

72
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,566
Scott:  It was called ARK, Attack Retrieve Capture, A-R-C.

73
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:48,240
Rym:  So we should make bark better, Attack Retrieve Capture, and there we go, that's our game.

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,570
Scott:  Yeah, the game, you know.

75
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:57,220
Rym:  No, we call it bark, you're all dogs, you can only, wait, there's no map, it never shows you where the flag is.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,447
Scott:  Capture the bone.

77
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:07,351
Rym:  Yeah, but it's not like, Overwatch Capture the Flag, where like, it highlights like the flag, someone got your flag, it's fucking there, right there, go get 'em.

78
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:18,414
Rym: It's more like, someone's got your bone, you don't know where, and you can only see, like, other players can point at where they think it is, and you gotta like find them in the woods.

79
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:19,300
Rym: Anyway.

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,660
Scott:  It still exists, it's now called Armor Critical, armorcritical.com.

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,856
Rym:  Alright, so Counter-Strike on November 9th, last year, at the end of the year, turned officially 20 years old.

82
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,120
Scott:  Pokemon's older.

83
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:44,931
Rym: Yeah, but Pokemon has released a lot of single player experiences, and has a massively evolving culture of card games, video games.

84
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,171
Scott:  Counter-Strike has released like three games, four games.

85
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:53,680
Rym:  Counter-Strike has released Counter-Strike, slightly different Counter-Strike, and slightly differenter Counter-Strike.

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,589
Rym:  Pretty much.

87
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:13,980
Rym:  All I want to say about that, is that it is a testament to the core game loop of Counter-Strike as a competitive team-based first person shooter, the sheer fucking longevity of this game with very few changes over the years.

88
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:22,105
Rym: Like, it is fundamentally the same game now that it was 20 years ago when we were playing it on those beta servers.

89
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,539
Scott:  Yeah, pretty much.

90
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:42,940
Rym: But it's interesting to me how popular it still is, and how specifically it is still a, it was a viable esport before esports were really much of a thing, and it remains a significant and important competitive esport that people care about, and there's an ecosystem around it.

91
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,831
Scott:  No, it was a skill, you know, a skill-based game.

92
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:50,940
Scott: There weren't that many, you know, games where skill was, you know, there's not luck in Counter-Strike, really.

93
00:07:55,161 --> 00:08:01,739
Rym: So in some other news, so that Cyberpunk game had a lot of issues that I think we talked about.

94
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:02,961
Scott:  Oh yeah.

95
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:11,400
Rym:  But the company that made Cyberpunk had some issues that are very Cyberpunk adjacent just recently.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,430
Scott:  So it seems like they got hacked somehow.

97
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:29,898
Scott: Some of their internal system was compromised by some unknown means, and someone took a lot of confidential information and data, supposedly, and threatened to release it, and the company basically just, you know, did.

98
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:33,594
Scott: what I guess is what you should do, assuming you're already in the shit, right?

99
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:41,015
Scott: It should have not happened, but they already fucked up, so they basically said, "Yeah, this happened.

100
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:45,090
Scott: No, we're not gonna be, you know, pay the ransom, right?

101
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,311
Scott: Go to

102
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:45,692
Scott: hell.".

103
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:52,202
Rym:  Quote, "We will not give into these demands, nor negotiate with the actor, being aware that this may eventually lead to the release of compromised

104
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:52,483
Rym: data.".

105
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,773
Scott:  Yep, and then who knows?

106
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,240
Scott: Maybe we'll see some compromised data.

107
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,846
Rym:  I'm pretty confident we will.

108
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:07,169
Rym: It seems like it was a combination of data stealing, data theft, coupled with straight-up just ransomware on their whole network.

109
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:14,548
Rym: The thing is, if any of you have ever, I've never encountered ransomware.

110
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:22,791
Scott:  I've never seen it in person because no computer that I'm near is so poorly secured that that's gonna happen.

111
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:39,225
Rym:  But the one thing I have seen when ransomware attacks have happened is that typically, if the person who, like, gets attacked pays the ransom, often the person they pay, instead of giving them the code, will just say, "Oh, so you actually want your data back.

112
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:40,390
Rym: Send me twice as much

113
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:40,651
Rym: money.".

114
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,307
Rym: Like, there's no guarantee they're gonna give you the data back.

115
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:58,364
Rym: There are some hacker groups where they'll have, like, the verifiable hashes in the websites and the ways to, like, they really want to make it easy for you to pay them a small amount, but generally, these more independent actors tend to just continue to exploit you.

116
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,330
Rym: Like, if someone blackmails you.

117
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:12,940
Rym: If you pay someone who blackmails you money so that they stop blackmailing you, there's literally nothing that payment does to prevent them from just blackmailing you in the future, and it verifies for them that the blackmail's legit.

118
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,786
Scott:  Right, and it's also, you know, you always see, like, the famous, you know, movie hostage scene, which is kind of fake-ish, right?

119
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,213
Rym:  "I want a helicopter and a

120
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:24,755
Rym: pony.".

121
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,742
Scott:  "I got a briefcase of money.

122
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,670
Scott: You got some person tied up, right?

123
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,738
Scott: We come and put them in the middle and swap,

124
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:31,100
Scott: right?".

125
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,803
Scott:  "What do you

126
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,064
Scott: do?".

127
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,871
Scott:  "You show me the person.

128
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,076
Scott: I show you the case of money,

129
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:35,317
Scott: right?".

130
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,080
Scott: With these ransomware situations, it could be like, "Okay, I've up, you know, it's like, you give me money.

131
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,104
Scott: I tell you I've deleted the

132
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,444
Scott: data.".

133
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,295
Scott: "Okay, it's deleted.

134
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:50,655
Scott: Trust

135
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:50,796
Scott: me.".

136
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,479
Rym:  "Yeah, I did not upload a

137
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:52,780
Rym: torrent.".

138
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,534
Scott:  Yeah, or it's like, it's like, what, how can you, it's like, you're basically just giving someone money to hope that that person is true to their word.

139
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,581
Scott: It's like, you're not buying anything, right?

140
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,147
Scott: There's no guarantees or nothing.

141
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:16,018
Scott: How, in what way can you make that fair exchange where you know for certain that, you know, this is, that money has rescued the person somehow?

142
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:17,725
Rym:  But I do want to point out something else.

143
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:26,929
Rym: CD Projekt, for all the problems with that company, for all the problems with Cyberpunk, the one thing that they did right is they recovered fully from the.

144
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:40,086
Rym: If you lose data in a ransomware attack, that just means you fucked up real bad and didn't have any processes in place.

145
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:46,989
Scott:  Yep, they didn't have, so their security at protecting their, you know, systems was bad, but they had backups.

146
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,115
Rym:  Backups are so important.

147
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:56,421
Rym: The funniest thing, though, is the hackers, the email they sent them was like, "But we understand that most likely, like, you'll recover this data for

148
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:56,862
Rym: backups.".

149
00:11:56,902 --> 00:12:00,274
Rym: Like, they knew that the ransomware wouldn't probably get them.

150
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,241
Scott:  Now, that's another situation, right?

151
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:05,475
Scott: Let's say you were really bad, you didn't have your backups, right?

152
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:08,587
Scott: You really sucked and dropped the ball, right?

153
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:14,404
Scott: So now when you pay the ransom, you're hoping to get your data back, right?

154
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:20,645
Scott: So they send you, like what, an encrypted file, and they say, "Yeah, your data's in that encrypted file, right?

155
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,254
Scott: Pay us money and we'll send you the key to decrypt

156
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:23,394
Scott: it.".

157
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:28,211
Scott: You pay them money, and they go, "A," they just lol and don't do anything.

158
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,141
Scott: "B," they send you a key to decrypt it, it doesn't work.

159
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,939
Scott: "C," they send you a key to decrypt it, you decrypt it, and it's a text file that says,

160
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,120
Scott: "Lol."

161
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,729
Scott: Or a picture of a skull or something, right?

162
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,383
Scott: It's just like, and you can't get your money back, you get a refund.

163
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,889
Scott: It's not Amazon.

164
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:44,792
Rym:  There's a lesson here.

165
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:49,046
Rym: that's very simple and applies to everything, including this impeachment trial that started today.

166
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:57,614
Rym: Never, ever negotiate with someone where you believe and have reason to believe that they will act in bad faith.

167
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,020
Rym: There's literally no point.

168
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:07,206
Rym: Debating, negotiating, none of those things matter at all if the counterparty cannot be reasonably assumed to act in good faith.

169
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:15,754
Scott:  Right, if someone is acting in bad faith, the only thing, the only way that you can get them to do something that they don't want to do is by force.

170
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:18,482
Rym:  Force or collateral, which is just force.

171
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:22,436
Scott:  Force or just let them be, that's your other option.

172
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:28,354
Scott: Just like, ignore them, or if you can't force them to do something, you can't, right?

173
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:41,862
Scott: Only with someone who is acting in good faith where their word has value, where they will do what they say to some extent, where they will listen to what you are saying to some extent is the only kind of person that you can engage with.

174
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:58,275
Scott: If someone is just gonna lie, gonna not do what they say, is saying things but that aren't what they actually believe, they're just saying stuff, they're just gonna do what they're gonna do, don't waste any time on that person, right?

175
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:05,556
Scott: Whether it's a ransomware person or just some jerk you met on the internet, just don't do it, it's not worth it.

176
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:10,254
Rym:  So there's some other news that I want to dwell on a little longer than those other two things.

177
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:15,952
Rym: There was a game that came out, was coming out around the same time as Overwatch.

178
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:20,425
Rym: that had extremely superficial similarities to Overwatch.

179
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:32,708
Rym: If you didn't know anything about games and you watched trailers, you might have assumed they were similar in some way, even though they were actually as different as an FPS and a board game.

180
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,742
Rym: But there was a game called Battleborn and there's a game called Overwatch.

181
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:43,136
Rym: Battleborn, if you're not aware, failed catastrophically.

182
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,240
Rym: No one played that game.

183
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:50,051
Rym: That game just went downhill so fast, like it was kind of amazing.

184
00:14:51,033 --> 00:15:16,749
Rym: So 2K has announced recently, I think on January 31st, like in the last couple weeks, that after February 24th, 2020, which was a while ago, you can't like purchase stuff in the game anymore, on January 31st, which just happened a little while ago, the game servers will go down and at that time the game in its entirety will remain unplayable forever.

185
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:19,817
Rym: Single-player bugs doesn't matter.

186
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:23,427
Rym: The game itself to even launch it requires those servers to be up.

187
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:26,998
Rym: A little bit of a tribes 2 situation.

188
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:42,200
Rym: So there's a lot like this story, there's a lot going on and I think I want to highlight like all the different threads here because these are threads that you can pursue if you find them interesting that talk about like they speak to have greater truths in the game industry.

189
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:46,091
Rym: Point number one, games moving to this online.

190
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:51,025
Rym: only requiring a server to function at all model is kind of a problem.

191
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,945
Rym: How do you preserve a game like Battleborn for like posterity if it's literally gone forever?

192
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:07,330
Rym: If the client does not do anything anymore, it's not like there's any way to get the server to like run in a museum.

193
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,275
Rym: We know that doesn't work.

194
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,142
Rym: Copyright ensures that will never happen.

195
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,372
Rym: So basically this game just disappeared forever.

196
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:21,482
Rym: Even though this game was a competitive game, much like Overwatch, there really is not much of a single-player experience to speak of.

197
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:25,210
Rym: The fact that you can't interact with it at all is trouble.

198
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:42,235
Rym: Two, a lot of people are trying to make an argument that Overwatch coming out at the same time is why Battleborn failed and I don't think that is even a remotely credible argument.

199
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:45,463
Rym: Overwatch was a competitive first-person shooter.

200
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:49,556
Rym: Overwatch shares a lot with games like Counter-Strike or Quake.

201
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:57,602
Rym: The skill that game is testing is teamwork and clicking on heads and doing FPS stuff with a high degree of direct personal skill.

202
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:02,652
Rym: Battleborn is basically a MOBA, like straight up.

203
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:09,571
Rym: Individual skill at FPSing or third-person shooting wouldn't matter that much in that game.

204
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:17,335
Rym: If I just compare Battleborn to any other game, it's really more like Risk of Rain or Risk of Rain 2.

205
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,079
Scott: I've never played it so I don't know.

206
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:38,720
Rym: Yeah, it's basically Battleborn was a MOBA and my opinion on what happened is that a lot of game journalists, because the games had similar trailers and somewhat similar aesthetics like team-based shooter, they assumed that they were going after the same audiences.

207
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:43,983
Rym: But what appears to have happened is a ton of people started to play Overwatch when it came out and kept playing it.

208
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:50,830
Rym: A ton of people started to play Battleborn when it came out from the numbers I found, but didn't keep playing it.

209
00:17:51,172 --> 00:18:02,072
Rym: The situation was a ton of people tried Battleborn, didn't like it, and the player base dropped off catastrophically to the point that within a few months people couldn't even get like a single game going at most times.

210
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:18,819
Scott: So I think that's just a sign of, you know, something that we sort of know but people don't think about a lot is that there are some game companies, right, that are good at supporting their existing game.

211
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,690
Scott: They put a game out and then they take care of it, right?

212
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:35,861
Scott: So whether they do a good job or a bad job, right, and they make bad decisions, but the point is is that even if they're negatively active, right, they're doing bad things but they're still doing stuff, like they're still working all the time.

213
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:42,247
Scott: They got a team, it's on the game, they got patches, they got news, you might hate all the patches, but they're working on it.

214
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,977
Rym: Valve and Blizzard do this very well, right?

215
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:52,829
Scott: Valve, Blizzard, the League of Legends company, Riot, right, all the companies with the big successful online games, it's sort of a chicken egg, right?

216
00:18:52,909 --> 00:19:02,824
Scott: It's like, oh, we have a successful multiplayer game, therefore we keep care of it, or our game became a successful online multiplayer game because we take care of it, who knows?

217
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,188
Scott: But

218
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:04,609
Rym: I do

219
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:28,227
Scott: think that a Blizzard-like company, where you have this reputation of doing it over and over again on several different games, when you put out a new game, people trust that that's what it's going to be, that you're going to be taking care of it, and so then, therefore, that game can now build on the trust of the effort you put into your previous games, maintaining those services, right?

220
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,293
Scott: Whereas, who made Battleborn, right?

221
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,044
Rym:  Well, 2K.

222
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:49,731
Scott:  Right, so what other online, do they have a history and a community engagement of making online multiplayer games and keeping them going and working on them the way that a PUBG does, right?

223
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:54,531
Scott: Or even a Fortnite, Fortnite, the best at it, probably, right?

224
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:58,912
Rym:  Probably, they'll just radically fuck up their game because that's the audience.

225
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,945
Rym: they're going after, like radical changes, right?

226
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,520
Scott: They keep going, Minecraft, they got people who just keep working on it, right?

227
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,900
Rym:  Civilization VI just keeps getting kind of crazy updates.

228
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,931
Scott:  Right, so did Battleborn die?

229
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,740
Scott: I haven't played it, I don't know anything about what went on with it, but did it die because no one took care of it, or did they take care of it and it just sucks?

230
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,029
Rym:  So what I think happened there...

231
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:30,260
Scott:  And now, if they make any more games, if they try to make them online games with the community, that their rep is like ruined.

232
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,520
Scott: It's gonna be hard to get people to buy into the next one.

233
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,905
Rym:  I feel like what actually happened here happened so early, like the game came out and lost its player base almost instantly.

234
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:44,803
Rym: That implies a more fundamental dysfunction and a mismatch on who the game was targeted at.

235
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:50,407
Rym: That's a situation where, like, Team Fortress 2, when that came out, we were both really excited about it.

236
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:57,477
Rym: Like, I'd been waiting for that game, and when it first came out, I jumped in and I started playing it, and I was pretty disappointed.

237
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:58,280
Rym: It wasn't what I wanted.

238
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,943
Rym: I didn't like it.

239
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,791
Rym: I kind of stopped playing it pretty quickly.

240
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:07,320
Rym: That mismatch of expectation seems to be what happened here because the player base didn't, like, start strong and slowly decline.

241
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:21,860
Rym: It started strong and then, like, catastrophically and rapidly declined, implying that people who played it for the first time discovered that the core concept of the game was not something they enjoyed, or they expected it to be one thing and it ended up being something else.

242
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:26,058
Scott: I think what happened-- - I've never-- I don't think I've ever even seen the game.

243
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,085
Scott: I basically-- - We played it at a PAX!

244
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:33,500
Rym: I have a video of us sitting there, playing it, and talking about it.

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,171
Scott:  I don't think we played-- if we did, I don't remember it.

246
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,195
Scott:  We played one match.

247
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,526
Rym: I was bitching the whole time because I couldn't invert the mouse.

248
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,697
Scott:  I do not remember this at all.

249
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,485
Scott: I just know that there is a game-- - How do you not remember this?

250
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:44,490
Rym: Do I have to, like, get the video?

251
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,560
Scott:  I just know that there is a game called Battleborn.

252
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,303
Scott: That's all I know.

253
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:50,396
Scott: Until the news that it was gone.

254
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,440
Rym:  Here's what I think happened.

255
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:16,312
Rym: Games journalists superficially kept comparing it to Overwatch, so players thought that they would be equivalent games, so I get the impression that the Overwatch-- people who were playing Overwatch or would play Overwatch, people who like a competitive first-person shooter, thought that Battleborn would be some sort of first-person or third-person competitive shooter, but when they got into it, despite what it looked like, it was a MOBA.

256
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:23,756
Rym: Generally, the kind of person who plays a first-person shooter, competitively, is not equally enthused about a MOBA.

257
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:29,040
Rym: Like, they target-- while there's a lot of overlap, they do target fundamentally different game experiences.

258
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:38,080
Rym: I think people expected it to be more of a first-person/third-person shooter, and when they tried it, it was a very different kind of game, and that's why they bounced off of it so hard.

259
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,414
Rym: Meanwhile, Battleborn didn't do a good job of getting the word out that, "Yo, this is a MOBA.

260
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:43,916
Rym: MOBA.

261
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,863
Rym: Not shooter.

262
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:47,505
Rym: Trust

263
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:47,766
Rym: us.".

264
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:59,180
Rym: So the people who would have liked it probably didn't try it out early, and by the time they might have corrected that message for those people to try it, the game had already declined so far that it didn't have critical mass to keep going.

265
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:01,917
Rym: I don't think any amount of changes to the game would have saved it.

266
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:13,869
Rym: So, I guess one of those threads there is, be wary if you're a game designer or a game publisher, especially the bigger you are.

267
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:29,563
Rym: You have to make it very clear to the people out there who you want to play your game what the game is and who it's for, because if you don't make that crystal clear, lazy game journalists might tell people your game is something different from what it is, and that might destroy you.

268
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:38,198
Rym: So last, this kind of news happens a lot.

269
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:39,782
Rym: This is just the most recent one.

270
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:40,886
Rym: It's kind of a big deal one.

271
00:23:41,669 --> 00:24:00,720
Rym: Gearbox, who you may know from Developing Borderlands, was just bought for 1.3 billion dollars by Embracer Group, which is just one more step in the massive consolidation of developers and publishers in the games industry.

272
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,282
Rym: I expect eventually every single game made above like indies is going to be just one giant conglomerate.

273
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:11,046
Scott: I think the entertainment, you know, the major entertainment industry as a whole just keeps consolidating.

274
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,056
Scott: It's like, I'm surprised there isn't already just one.

275
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,422
Scott: It's like Disney's close, right?

276
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:17,191
Scott: But it's like, wow, there's still more than one company.

277
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:21,003
Rym: CVS Paramount, like Paramount Plus, they're really trying to make that a thing.

278
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:34,041
Rym: But the problem they have is how many people out there, like the mass market, think like could list things that Paramount owns the IP to as opposed to another brand?

279
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:35,566
Rym: Like who knows that?

280
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,492
Rym: Who's not already a nerd about this stuff?

281
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,925
Scott: They, you know, they try to teach people what they're marketing.

282
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,671
Scott: That's what that job is.

283
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:46,601
Scott: So, but yeah, so Gearbox got bought.

284
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:54,986
Scott: So this is interesting because, you know, it's, you know, it's been already so much conglomeration going on.

285
00:24:55,608 --> 00:25:04,176
Scott: And there's so much, you know, so many different industry ties in terms of, you know, this, this company is the developer and that company is the publisher.

286
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:14,031
Rym: Some publishers are developers, some developers are publishers, some publishers own developers, but also have their own developer companies and some publishers own publishers.

287
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:18,146
Scott: Like some publishers and or developers have IP licenses.

288
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:20,755
Scott: Some of them own the rights to IP, right?

289
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:23,384
Scott: It's like, there's all kinds of weird things going on, right?

290
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:26,252
Scott: So it's like the developers of Pokemon.

291
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:27,415
Scott: is Game Freak, right?

292
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,225
Scott: Is Game Freak just owned by Nintendo?

293
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:31,329
Scott: It's like, I think it is.

294
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,534
Scott: Do you know for sure?

295
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,840
Scott: What exactly is that relationship?

296
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,494
Scott: Who, oh, there's a, there's a company called the Pokemon company.

297
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:37,380
Scott: What the fuck do they own?

298
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,801
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:38,404
Scott: Right.

300
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:41,696
Rym: It's like, it's like, what if you're not in the industry, like?

301
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:48,947
Rym: I would struggle without looking it up again, just to be crystal clear, especially when there's like joint ownership or like stock swaps.

302
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,693
Rym: Like there's lots of nonsense that can happen.

303
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:55,688
Rym: The exact relationship between Gearbox, Take-Two, 2k and THQ Nordic, like.

304
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:03,536
Rym: summarize that quickly or Google around and count the time it takes for you to be able to summarize that succinctly.

305
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,183
Rym: It'll take you longer than you might expect.

306
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:06,247
Scott: Yeah.

307
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:10,381
Scott: It's like Super Smash Brothers was made by HAL Laboratory until 2001.

308
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:17,943
Scott: And then starting in 2008, it was made by Sora Limited and from 2014 to now it was made by Bandai Namco Studios.

309
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,748
Scott: It's like, wait, what?

310
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,556
Scott: Nintendo isn't making Smash.

311
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:23,840
Scott: Someone else is making Smash.

312
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,486
Scott: Nintendo publishes it and owns.

313
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:31,700
Rym: When you said Bandai, like I just realized something pretty, like, I don't think this is necessarily profound, but it stood out in my brain.

314
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:47,899
Rym: Whenever we were kids, like we were young and the AOL Time and Warner were all merged together into AOL Time Warner, how utterly alien and like fake that name sounded when it first appeared.

315
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:52,470
Rym: Like saying the words AOL Time Warner seemed ludicrous.

316
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:57,164
Scott: And yet now even at the time it seemed like that shouldn't be legal.

317
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:58,551
Scott: You shouldn't be able to, right.

318
00:26:58,631 --> 00:27:00,279
Scott: And now it's even worse than that.

319
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:02,529
Rym: The difference is now we're used to that.

320
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:07,049
Rym: I'll say like Bandai Namco and literally not even bad and I'll string together 10 proper nouns.

321
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,745
Scott: NBC, Comcast, who knows what the hell that company is now, right?

322
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:11,247
Rym: Right.

323
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:17,151
Rym: But that like word salad of a bunch of proper nouns that got merged doesn't, like it just rolls off the tongue now.

324
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,317
Rym: Like we're just used to that.

325
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:19,140
Rym: That's business as usual.

326
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,645
Scott: But anyway, it's bad.

327
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:32,204
Scott: But yeah, so the Gearbox got bought by some giant equity group that owns a fuck ton of stuff, but some of their stuff is published by other companies that are not purchased.

328
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:36,740
Scott: And so there's still the, now those relationships get kind of questionable, right?

329
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,187
Scott: Are they going to maintain them?

330
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:50,280
Scott: And you know, like for, it always reminds me of like what happens in the comic book world where like when Disney bought Marvel, because it was like there were other comic book companies, for example, until then Dark Horse did all the Star Wars comics.

331
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,223
Scott: Oh yeah.

332
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:59,452
Scott: And then when Disney bought Marvel, they basically waited until the license expired and they said, okay, Dark Horse, you kept making Star Wars comics.

333
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:02,383
Scott: Your license is up and now Marvel will make the Star Wars.

334
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:06,984
Rym: Actually, total aside, but with WandaVision, we talked about that last week on Wednesday a little bit.

335
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,290
Scott: Is there Star Wars in WandaVision?

336
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:12,623
Rym: No, but I realized, how the fuck are you going to do House of M if you don't have the X-Men?

337
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:19,778
Scott: They just do, you know, they never keep it true to the book, right?

338
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,609
Scott: If they kept it true to the book, I'd probably want to watch it.

339
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,730
Rym: If it was like House of M with the X-Men, I would be even more interested.

340
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:37,282
Rym: But like this article about this actually even like there's a few sentences here because nerds, like the fans, they don't care about the industry consolidation.

341
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:45,676
Rym: The only thing anyone who plays games seems to care about is what's going to happen to Borderlands because they don't know or care all these companies involved.

342
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,339
Rym: You know what they know?

343
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:54,093
Rym: They like Borderlands and they want another Borderlands to come and they don't want the next Borderlands to be bad because it was made by someone different.

344
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,378
Rym: That's all they care about.

345
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:07,555
Rym: So all these press releases are mostly spending a lot of time reassuring fans of the Borderlands IP that the Borderlands IP is fine, but the way they said it is kind of funny.

346
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:12,671
Rym: They said, quote, "We love our relationship with Take-Two and the 2K games

347
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:12,792
Rym: label.".

348
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,800
Scott: It's the same political language everyone uses.

349
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,094
Scott: It's like a copypasta for merging and buying companies.

350
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,219
Rym: The second one's better.

351
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:25,078
Rym: Quote, "A relationship with Take-Two where we've agreed on certain rights for exploitation of the

352
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:25,620
Rym: IP.".

353
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,746
Rym: The IP is a gearbox IP.

354
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,895
Rym: They frame it in terms of the exploitation of the IP.

355
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,641
Scott: Yeah, that's what it is.

356
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:38,707
Rym: That is what it is, but I don't usually see press releases using that terminology when they're aimed at the actual consumers.

357
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,634
Scott: I mean, at work, that's the language we use all the time.

358
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,578
Rym: That's the word I use at work.

359
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:45,592
Rym: Where was the copyright exploited?

360
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,380
Scott: Where's the exploitation territory, et cetera.

361
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:57,625
Rym: So, pretty sure the end result of this for gamers who like Borderlands is that literally nothing will change at all.

362
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:07,884
Scott: Well, I mean, so, you know, anytime any company buys another company, they always say to the employees, especially, but also everyone else, "Nothing will change.

363
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,512
Scott: You're just going to carry on business as usual.

364
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:10,094
Scott: We just bought

365
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:10,315
Scott: this.".

366
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,384
Scott: And it is 100% always a lie.

367
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:20,878
Scott: You don't buy something because you don't want to... It's like, "Yes, I want to buy that house and never live in it and not jack up the rent or do anything.

368
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,264
Scott: I just wanted to... Now I'm the owner.

369
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:22,827
Scott: Nothing else is

370
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,088
Scott: changing.".

371
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,334
Rym: But people literally do that.

372
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:25,380
Rym: Pita tears are a thing.

373
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,490
Rym: That's like a big chunk of the real estate in New York.

374
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,397
Rym: It's purely a place to park money.

375
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,460
Scott: But I'm saying you're making a... The point is even if you're parking money, you're making a change, right?

376
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,852
Scott: It was previously this and now it's something different.

377
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,259
Scott: It wasn't, you know, previously.

378
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,932
Scott: one person's money park and now a new person's money park.

379
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,042
Rym: Well, for pita tears, it usually is.

380
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:44,670
Rym: Very few people live in those apartments.

381
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:52,739
Scott: But I'm just saying is that you don't buy a thing because you don't... It's like you don't go to the Best Buy and buy something and leave it at the Best Buy unopened.

382
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,208
Scott: Okay, right?

383
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,558
Scott: When you buy something, you're going to do something to it.

384
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,230
Scott: So, never leave anyone who says, "Nothing will

385
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,571
Scott: change.".

386
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,841
Scott: Something will change, but who knows what.

387
00:31:04,122 --> 00:31:12,913
Rym: Sometimes you buy something that is printing a small amount of money and you just unplug it, take it home, plug it in, and ask it to keep printing that money for you.

388
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,404
Rym: Anyway, and it could be a situation like that.

389
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:21,240
Rym: Lionsgate is involved because of exploitation of like the live action move.

390
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:29,408
Rym: They're like, "Read this article and I dare you to draw a Charlie Day yarn map of all the companies involved in this Borderlands

391
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:29,950
Rym: situation.".

392
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,998
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

393
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,043
Rym: So, check this out.

394
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,168
Rym: I'm a big fan of speed runs.

395
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:54,242
Rym: Like, I don't watch video game streamers like at all, but I watch a lot of videos that go in depth on speed running like technique and the history of speed running records, etc.

396
00:31:54,764 --> 00:32:01,770
Rym: And this one is a really good explanation of one of the weirder kinds of speed runs or one of the weirder kinds of techniques.

397
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:15,218
Rym: Because when people speed run, both real time and TAS, there's certain types of techniques, certain types of exploits, certain types of like frame timing and sub pixels that like exist in multiple games and people become experts at these things.

398
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:24,525
Rym: One of those techniques literally involves fucking with the hardware and there's a lot of discourse on where the line is.

399
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:32,970
Rym: Like, on the N64, is it okay to open the cartridge and push your finger hard on the chip while you're playing?

400
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,729
Rym: Is it okay to break an NES controller so you get it left and right at the same time?

401
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:43,363
Rym: Is it okay to put your NES on a hot plate while you play?

402
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:49,825
Rym: Because that is the speed running technique that lets you get faster times in Dragon Quest 3.

403
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:56,610
Rym: Putting your physical console on a hot plate and heating it to a particular temperature while you play the game.

404
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:09,710
Scott: I would say that the hot plate technique would be allowed if there was someone on Earth, right, who basically it was naturally that temperature in their home, right?

405
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,429
Rym: Oh, I could plausibly say that the NES.

406
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:19,818
Scott: Right, because like it's like okay so-and-so lives on a tropical island and it's, you know, the sun is directly overhead.

407
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:20,742
Scott: It's that time of the year.

408
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,686
Scott: It's 100 degrees.

409
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,194
Scott: It's like, well, the air is 100 degrees.

410
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,619
Scott: The NES somehow still works.

411
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,628
Scott: So I live in Norway.

412
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:30,915
Scott: I'm going to heat up my NES to 100 degrees.

413
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,039
Rym: Yep, so it's fair.

414
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,427
Rym: I have the same situation as that nerd.

415
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:35,350
Scott: Right.

416
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:41,296
Scott: If you're heating it up like unnaturally, it's like, well, I might as well just play in an emulator and save state, right?

417
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:44,428
Scott: You're modifying the capabilities of the equipment, right?

418
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:47,870
Scott: Yep, but I would say that is not okay.

419
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:59,210
Rym: This video explains in enough detail exactly how and why this works for one particular game and it is fascinating and also pretty straightforward.

420
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:18,130
Scott: So anyway, so one of our favorite games that we, board games that we have played the most is Puerto Rico and we often point out how while mechanically this game is amazing and uh, Euro games, however, you know, it's, it's like the pinnacle of Euro games.

421
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:22,542
Scott: Uh, the theme of Euro games is often very loosely applied.

422
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:23,083
Rym: Yep.

423
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:32,889
Scott: Uh, and in Puerto Rico, the theme of the game is colonization slavery, even though it doesn't use the word slaves in it.

424
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:45,783
Scott: Uh, you are literally taking little wooden Brown discs off of a boat that are specifically in the though many other pieces are not called out by their color.

425
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:46,947
Rym: that bothered me then.

426
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,813
Rym: And it bothers me now, right?

427
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:51,704
Scott: They're called colonists, but they show up on a boat.

428
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:54,574
Scott: The more demand there is for them, the more show up.

429
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:55,600
Scott: They don't cost anything.

430
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,311
Scott: The mayor just distributes them evenly to everybody.

431
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:07,233
Scott: Um, and your plantations and your buildings don't function unless you put colonists in them.

432
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:15,862
Scott: And there's an expansion that adds different buildings that require, you know, nobles implying that the colonists are somehow not noble.

433
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,203
Scott: Right.

434
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:29,423
Scott: Anyway, so it's obviously slavery, even though the game, uh, doesn't say slavery or mention anything about it, it's just sort of there, you know, it's, you know, it's not great.

435
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:39,018
Rym: And so many Euro games, especially from the nineties and early two thousands, like they all, almost all of them just use European colonialism as their default theme.

436
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,362
Scott: Yep.

437
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:45,538
Scott: It's very common theme in a lot of games, especially, you know, from the two thousands anyway.

438
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:53,670
Scott: So here, this person made this amazing video that I think anyone who board games, especially Euro games, uh, should watch.

439
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:59,026
Scott: And basically the video, the video is how slavery is presented in board games.

440
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:14,707
Scott: And obviously Puerto Rico features prominently, but they go in depth examining several games and tabletop games overall of, uh, the different ways that slavery is represented both good and not good.

441
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:15,209
Scott: Right.

442
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,283
Scott: Cause there are games that represent slavery is like, it's in the game.

443
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,307
Scott: Here it is.

444
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:21,130
Scott: It's slavery.

445
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,058
Scott: Oh, and it's bad by the way, right.

446
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:27,997
Scott: We're teaching, you know, it's, it's a proper, well done, correct educational game.

447
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:29,723
Scott: Like, yeah, slaves are bad.

448
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:34,058
Scott: And there are other games where it's like, yeah, I have slaves.

449
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:35,061
Scott: It helps you win.

450
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:36,266
Scott: It's like, that's not so great.

451
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:41,404
Rym: There's this fantastic, like early on in the, in the video, he puts up this chart.

452
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,873
Rym: that is like a really good way to describe this problem.

453
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:47,125
Rym: It's a two dimensional chart where you can plot a game.

454
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,473
Rym: One axis is on the top.

455
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,178
Rym: Slavery is negative.

456
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:55,010
Rym: Like in the game, slavery is like shown to be a negative thing.

457
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:58,640
Rym: And at the bottom playing slavery is rewarded.

458
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,455
Rym: Like if you exploit slaves in the game, you're rewarded mechanically.

459
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,399
Rym: That's one axis.

460
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:09,318
Rym: And the other axis is on one side, the game says it's about slavery.

461
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,270
Rym: And on the other side, the game never acknowledges slavery.

462
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,050
Rym: And Puerto Rico is just in the, like the furthest bottom left of this fucking chart.

463
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,856
Scott: Pretty much so.

464
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:20,116
Scott: Yeah.

465
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:23,405
Scott: Uh, I think this is like necessary viewing.

466
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:33,392
Scott: And also if you are making games, uh, don't make your game theme fucking slavery, unless you are, you know, an expert on slavery

467
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:56,281
Rym: and do not mechanically reward players like, like games like, uh, you know, we always talk about John company or an infamous traffic because those games are a better like historical exploration of this fucked up situation as opposed to Puerto Rico, which is do these things and you will win in the meta moment.

468
00:37:56,301 --> 00:38:01,513
Rym: I, uh, I'm leaning toward reading that book, but I have not yet continued it.

469
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:02,657
Scott: Nope.

470
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,950
Scott: Cause I plan we've been, we've been that way for about a month or two now.

471
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:06,351
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:06,974
Rym: Yep.

473
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,222
Rym: So, uh, we'll just stay in that steady state.

474
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,897
Rym: Uh, otherwise we don't really have any online cons coming up for a while.

475
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:16,713
Rym: Pretty sure they're not going to be any cons in person for a long while to come.

476
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,862
Rym: So we're just stuck inside doing our thing.

477
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,955
Rym: Uh, I don't know what other meta bits we have right now.

478
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:26,695
Rym: Our forums are rocking or discords rocking, uh, every now and then we live stream some games.

479
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:29,889
Rym: I'm going to start playing overwatch CTF pretty competitively.

480
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:35,010
Rym: So if anyone's good at that mode and wants to join up with me, maybe we can, uh, hit that platinum.

481
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:39,234
Rym: That's all I got.

482
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:40,097
Rym: I got nothing going on.

483
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,805
Scott: There is nothing going on.

484
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,375
Scott: It's, uh, you know, we're waiting for the sun to come back.

485
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:44,837
Rym: Yep.

486
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:50,917
Rym: Both the literal sun and just a post COVID world, or at least a mitigated COVID world at this point.

487
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:52,320
Scott: Pretty much.

488
00:38:53,002 --> 00:39:08,873
Rym: So in our current COVID dystopian nightmare, one thing that has kept a lot of people going is the fact that even though we can't play games in person with our friends and loved ones, we can play games online with our friends and loved ones.

489
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:15,612
Rym: But it is despite the fact that no one can go anywhere and everyone's stuck at home.

490
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:28,449
Rym: It is still for reasons that we've talked about in panels in the past, shockingly hard to get a critical mass of an adult's friends together to play a game online at the same time.

491
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:33,064
Scott: People, uh, you're guilty by the way, I am guilty than I am.

492
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:33,525
Scott: Right.

493
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:37,175
Scott: As people don't prioritize, uh, gaming, right.

494
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,632
Scott: People have this vision in their mind, especially nerds at least who like games.

495
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:41,354
Scott: Right.

496
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:42,920
Scott: And they think in their mind, man.

497
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:43,021
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:49,225
Scott: It would be so awesome if we just like played, you know, I really want to play samurai sword slash Shogun slash Yakuza.

499
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:50,009
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,774
Scott: I really want to play some battle tech.

501
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:51,974
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:52,837
Scott: I really want you.

503
00:39:52,937 --> 00:40:00,299
Scott: You imagine doing it and you want to wake your ass up at 9.

504
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:00,480
Scott: Right.

505
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,966
Scott: Don't do anything else that day.

506
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,895
Scott: Get to your computer, get in the discord chat, right?

507
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:09,372
Scott: Get your TTS loaded, set all your stuff up and we'll fucking do it.

508
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,221
Scott: And it's like, then people don't actually do it.

509
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:14,475
Rym: But even in pre-covid times, like, oh, I have to go to a wedding.

510
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:16,603
Rym: My son has to go to the hospital.

511
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,369
Scott: You don't have to do that stuff now.

512
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,253
Rym: Yup.

513
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:21,638
Scott: You're stuck inside doing nothing.

514
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:21,919
Scott: Right.

515
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,429
Scott: It's like, you know, get your ass up and do it.

516
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,473
Scott: Make it happen.

517
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:26,739
Scott: Nothing's stopping you.

518
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,134
Rym: Except doing other things, working on GeekNights stuff in some cases.

519
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:31,639
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,329
Scott: If you're into the game will not happen unless you make it a priority.

521
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,478
Scott: You have to put it ahead of the other things.

522
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:44,069
Scott: You have to say when those other things come up, you have to, you know, like, oh, I was gonna, I don't know, go, you know, run or something.

523
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:44,952
Scott: You gotta be like, nope.

524
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:46,778
Scott: Um, I prioritized gaming.

525
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,826
Scott: I will not do the running or whatever.

526
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:53,326
Rym: As anyone who sees me at PAX has noticed, especially some of you have said hi to me at PAX Souths in the past.

527
00:40:53,346 --> 00:41:05,717
Rym: Cause that's the pax where it's, I'm the most visible doing it, but I get up in a run like every morning during any gaming con we go to, uh, I actually do prioritize running over gaming and I pretty much why you're not fucking gaming.

528
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,527
Rym: Cause I'm not gaming with you.

529
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,832
Rym: Cause you don't want to play Overwatch.

530
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:11,176
Scott: No, I don't.

531
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:12,600
Rym: That's what I'm mostly playing.

532
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:23,310
Scott: So one way to make things a little bit easier for people who have time, but don't have time at the same time is asynchronous gaming.

533
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:26,506
Scott: We've talked about it a lot, but we've never dedicated a whole show to it.

534
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:29,856
Scott: So the thing is, it's sort of a misnomer in a way.

535
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:38,785
Scott: And that, uh, in computer terms, you know, and I guess also just, you know, uh, semantic terms, synchronous and asynchronous.

536
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:41,837
Scott: synchronous just means one thing happens after the other.

537
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:42,218
Scott: Right.

538
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,530
Scott: And the one step B has to wait for step a to finish.

539
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:45,891
Scott: Right.

540
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:48,221
Scott: So I take root is a synchronous game.

541
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:48,884
Scott: I take my turn.

542
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:50,008
Scott: Then you take your turn.

543
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,534
Scott: Then next person takes their turn.

544
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:51,976
Scott: Right.

545
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,532
Scott: Uh, but race for the galaxy, even if you're sitting at a table, just playing.

546
00:41:56,573 --> 00:42:01,271
Scott: it is, I don't know if it's officially an asynchronous game, but it's an asynchronous game.

547
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,938
Scott: You all take your turns just together.

548
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:03,480
Scott: Right.

549
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,118
Scott: You're not waiting necessarily for the previous person to finish before you go.

550
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:08,901
Scott: Right.

551
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,993
Scott: Or, you know, you can do things during other people's turns.

552
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,378
Scott: It's asynchronous, right?

553
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:17,815
Rym: Now it's, this isn't just a scale of a game is either asynchronous or it's not.

554
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:21,527
Rym: This is more about how asynchronous is a game.

555
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:27,352
Rym: Cause this is actually a more complex topic than you might think if you actually look at specific games and specific mechanics.

556
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:32,146
Scott: But when it comes to the internet and digital multiplayer gaming, right.

557
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:50,114
Scott: Uh, people will use the term asynchronous, even if games are technically synchronous games where like, you know, you have to take your turn and the next person and before the next person could take their turn, there's no simultaneous or, you know, actual asynchronous play, but you don't all have to play at the same time.

558
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,323
Scott: You can take your turn whenever you have time.

559
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:56,817
Scott: And then the next person it's, it could be hours later.

560
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:57,843
Scott: It could be immediately.

561
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:58,928
Scott: It could be the next day.

562
00:42:58,949 --> 00:42:59,792
Scott: It could be the next week.

563
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:00,616
Scott: It could be the next year.

564
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,989
Scott: They log in and download or whatever they have to do.

565
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:11,737
Scott: And then they take their turn and then time goes by and then you basically just take your turn whenever you have time to take your turn.

566
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:11,958
Scott: Yup.

567
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,552
Scott: So you're, it could be still, it could be synchronous.

568
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:25,365
Scott: It could be asynchronous in terms of the true meanings of those words, but in terms of, you know, the meanings you use when applied to multiplayer internet gaming.

569
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:36,320
Scott: synchronous means everyone is sitting there playing the game at the same time, like counter-strike versus you log in and take your turn whenever you have time to do it like sieve.

570
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:37,043
Rym: Yup.

571
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:46,251
Rym: Now this is where what it really comes down to is how well, how well do the mechanics of the game support practical asynchronous play?

572
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:51,104
Rym: Because I could make Overwatch asynchronous frame by frame.

573
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:58,088
Rym: Everyone has to do their next frame and once everyone's done their next frame, the game clock progresses to the following frame.

574
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,012
Scott: Any game.

575
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,866
Scott: It's like, what are you going to do on this frame?

576
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:04,178
Scott: I'm going to press up and click my mouse button.

577
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:06,186
Scott: What are you going to do on this frame?

578
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:08,738
Scott: I'm going to press the jump button and the special attack.

579
00:44:08,798 --> 00:44:11,992
Rym: I will continue holding middle click, but now I'm also going to hit space bar.

580
00:44:12,855 --> 00:44:13,056
Scott: Yup.

581
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:15,585
Scott: I'm going to continue holding the forward button.

582
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:16,248
Scott: Actually that.

583
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,472
Scott: Continue holding the forward button.

584
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,360
Rym: I kind of want to see a fighting game like that.

585
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,414
Rym: Like Street Fighter frame by frame.

586
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:23,740
Rym: Everyone, you're just like that.

587
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,210
Scott: Well, I mean the fantasy, whatever, what is that called?

588
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:27,292
Scott: Oh, fantasy strike.

589
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:28,274
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,256
Scott: It's kind of like that.

591
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,799
Scott: It's slower, but not, you know.

592
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:38,395
Scott: But things like that in that nature.

593
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:40,763
Rym: But that's obviously reductive.

594
00:44:40,843 --> 00:44:45,621
Rym: So like on the other side of this, there are games that support it incredibly well.

595
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:53,606
Rym: Meaning the game will progress quickly and meaningfully despite larger numbers of players all taking their turns.

596
00:44:53,867 --> 00:45:05,482
Rym: What it comes down to is how much does the next atom of the game or the next unit of interaction in the game in this case rely on inputs and particularly interruptions.

597
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:11,339
Rym: So imagine a game where, like Civ, I take my whole turn then Scott takes his whole turn.

598
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:17,219
Rym: It actually supports asynchronous play pretty well in that I can complete my turn no matter what.

599
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,750
Rym: No other player ever has to do anything during my turn.

600
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:32,494
Rym: So we can support a long-term asynchronous game of Civ because it just goes turn by turn in a attacked another unit.

601
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,055
Rym: Whoever I attacked, that player had the option to do something, like to defend or like take some action.

602
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:50,536
Rym: Now, if I do that on my turn, my turn stops and now the game has to go around and deal with what all the other players could do even if they choose not to do it before it can get back to me.

603
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:55,091
Rym: And that can cause a problem that will grind a game to a literal halt.

604
00:45:56,073 --> 00:46:06,925
Scott: What's interesting is how game patterns that are actually bad for in-person play, right, so something like root where it's completely synchronous.

605
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:18,265
Scott: You take your whole turn and the only thing that could matter for someone else on your turn is like, I guess, the field hospital, an ambush car, or a battle where you just roll a die.

606
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:19,610
Scott: You don't really need someone to be there.

607
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,369
Scott: Maybe they allocate damage or something, maybe, you know, something like that, right?

608
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:28,190
Scott: But there's very little to do on other players turns and players have a lot to do on their own turn.

609
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:32,627
Scott: So if you play root in person, yeah, people play quickly enough and it's good.

610
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:37,042
Scott: It moves quickly enough, but you can end up waiting for your turn.

611
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:41,280
Scott: Like just, okay, go take a snack break and then come back, take your turn, leave and come back, right?

612
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:55,279
Rym: And part of that is because every time there's a fight at any point, the game has to stop and give anyone involved in a fight the opportunity to play one of those cards if they have them because that card can interrupt an existing action, right?

613
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:57,750
Scott: But what I'm saying is that in person, you have a lot of waiting.

614
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:58,612
Scott: that happens.

615
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:04,652
Scott: Whereas online, there isn't a lot of waiting because you don't actually sit there and wait.

616
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:09,352
Scott: You take your turn and then you know that it's not going to be your turn again for hours.

617
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:11,862
Scott: You don't sit there waiting and wasting your life.

618
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:13,348
Scott: You go and do something else.

619
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:17,342
Scott: Maybe take a turn in a different game, maybe, you know, right?

620
00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:20,613
Scott: And then whenever you have free time, you take your turn.

621
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:31,370
Scott: So it's like you actually, if you look at the sum total of time that, you know, you that the each player spent playing the game in total, it'll be a pretty similar.

622
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:40,641
Scott: But if you look at how much time each individual person dedicated to the game, it'll be way less because they subtracted all that waiting time, right?

623
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:42,408
Scott: I didn't waste less of your life.

624
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:47,179
Scott: if the game is, is, uh, supports this kind of play well.

625
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:47,660
Scott: Right.

626
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:53,897
Scott: Um, but you know, a game, uh, that has lots of quick turns, right?

627
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:59,380
Scott: So a game that's really good in person, I always use tickets to ride is to be another one, right?

628
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,283
Scott: And take it to ride.

629
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:04,441
Scott: It's like, yeah, you go around taking turns and take it to ride, but you do almost nothing on your turn.

630
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:08,457
Scott: You literally just like, you know, either take a couple cards or put trains at.

631
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:09,600
Scott: your turn is so small.

632
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:17,610
Scott: So it's like you're, you're taking this tiny, tiny turn and then you, what, wait hours for the person to take their tiny turn.

633
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,197
Scott: And then you take your tiny turn again.

634
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:21,467
Scott: It's like, that's a really bad experience.

635
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,133
Scott: You'll forget what the hell was going on.

636
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:25,601
Scott: Your w your right.

637
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,206
Scott: Your turns are so short.

638
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,253
Scott: You're better off just playing that live.

639
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:30,877
Scott: Everyone connected at the same time.

640
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:33,625
Scott: It'll zoom by a lot faster.

641
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,056
Scott: Um, but there's no reason to stretch that game out.

642
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:58,012
Rym: This is, I think where like the metric here and we're kind of spitball on this because we're thinking about this topic as we go, but that whole root situation, root, you can do a lot on your turn, but root games are significantly slowed down by the fact that there are a handful of potential interrupt actions, which means you can get less done during your turn.

643
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:02,912
Rym: I think the metric for how well a game supports asynchronous play is actually pretty simple in the end.

644
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:14,822
Rym: It is how much can one player progress the game state without any other player interactions before they must seed control to another player.

645
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:28,127
Rym: The longer that is, the more like stuff you can get done before you are forced to seed control, the better a game supports asynchronous play and the less, the less frequent control is seeded, right?

646
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,774
Scott: If it's constantly going back and forth a whole bunch.

647
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:37,333
Scott: Um, the other thing is that the longer the total game length, right?

648
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:53,050
Scott: The more advantageous it is to play asynchronously, because if you are playing in person, even live, even if you get everyone together, even if it's fast, if it's a five hour game, let's say playing in person live, um, you know, maybe after

649
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:56,781
Rym: like a Civ game, a live Civ game, that's five hours.

650
00:49:57,222 --> 00:50:00,695
Rym: I have done one fifth of that interaction on average, right?

651
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:06,989
Scott: It's like what it's like, what are the chances you're going to get all the, even if you get everyone together, can you get everyone together to the end?

652
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,556
Scott: Are you going to finish it?

653
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:16,726
Scott: It's like really unlikely that you're going to get even dedicated people who prioritize gaming together for that long period of time.

654
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:17,830
Scott: It's such a long game.

655
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:23,742
Rym: I'm 39, two AM runs around like I'm stopping, right?

656
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:29,056
Scott: So the asynchronous game is a way that a game can finish, right?

657
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:40,318
Scott: You can keep it going and it will, as long as everyone's dedicated and diligent about paying attention and taking their turns when they come up, you can actually finish the game and get the full experience.

658
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:49,552
Scott: You don't have to just keep replaying the beginning over and over again or save and come back to it and forget what the heck was going on, you know, anything like that.

659
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:58,180
Scott: You can so long, long games, uh, suit themselves much better than a game that's over in five minutes, like playing it asynchronously.

660
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,194
Scott: It's like, why we can just get together for five minutes, I think, right?

661
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:05,210
Scott: There's no reason to play deep sea adventure asynchronously.

662
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:08,293
Scott: It's really silly.

663
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:08,654
Scott: Yep.

664
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:20,393
Rym: And that's where, well, the thing that is not obvious is that to design a game that is asynchronous friendly actually like really limits the kinds of mechanics you can include in the game.

665
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:29,970
Rym: Any reactive thing is basically off the table, like ambush cards in route really hampered the ability to make that game play by mail in an effective manner.

666
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,090
Scott: Yeah.

667
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:36,216
Scott: Imagine the gathering, you know, is like the, the ultimate interrupting game has cards called interrupt, right?

668
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:40,734
Rym: You got to form the stack of how many interrupts got played and then like play through the stack.

669
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,802
Scott: You know, people play it online.

670
00:51:42,842 --> 00:51:48,062
Scott: They have a system for that, but it's like, you know, uh, it can even playing it live.

671
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,025
Scott: There's still some issues.

672
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,632
Scott: Netrunner had all kinds of issues.

673
00:51:50,672 --> 00:52:01,038
Scott: Cause it's like, when you play net runner, you go on a run and it's like, there's decisions like points constantly, like every step of the way, the other player has to constantly click, like, okay, not doing anything.

674
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:01,340
Scott: Okay.

675
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,903
Scott: Not doing anything.

676
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:02,205
Scott: Okay.

677
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:02,688
Scott: Not doing anything.

678
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:02,929
Scott: Okay.

679
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,084
Scott: Not doing anything, doing something, you know, you don't want to miss your chance.

680
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:34,490
Rym: And this is where a lot of board games that go digital, like root made some mistakes when dire wealth, they're a great company, by the way, they've done such a fantastic job with root, but when they brought root online in order to make the game like move faster and support asynchronous play, which they built into the game, they did a few things like if I attack Scott and Scott doesn't have any ambush cards that are applicable, it won't wait for him to say, no, it'll just do the attack.

681
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:44,557
Rym: Meaning if I attack Scott and the game pauses for a while or waits for Scott to consider options, I know for a fact, he has an ambush card.

682
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:56,439
Rym: The only fair way to do that without changing the rules of root for the online version and literally making it a different game would be to have the prompt of Scott is considering his options up here.

683
00:52:57,101 --> 00:53:02,134
Rym: Every single time I attack Scott, no matter what, always make Scott click.

684
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:05,423
Scott: Which hugely slows down the game.

685
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:06,145
Scott: Right.

686
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:09,795
Rym: And they made even worse mistake with the field hospital for similar reasons.

687
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:11,178
Scott: They fixed the hate field.

688
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:11,920
Rym: They did fix that.

689
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:19,723
Rym: They have used that information on purpose to my advantage in the past.

690
00:53:19,924 --> 00:53:20,626
Scott: I have as well.

691
00:53:20,827 --> 00:53:23,356
Scott: I'll attack a place with an ambush card.

692
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:23,838
Rym: Yep.

693
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:28,115
Rym: I'll send like, I'll do like one attack in a bunny clearing and it's, it doesn't do the prompt.

694
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:31,472
Rym: Now I know it can attack the much more important bunny clearing and they got nothing.

695
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:32,675
Scott: Yep.

696
00:53:33,738 --> 00:53:49,790
Rym: So, uh, another thing, like an advantage of asynchronous play that I'm finding, especially with like during COVID is you can have a lot of games going at the same time so that even if one of them slows down, like you always got something to do.

697
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:54,369
Rym: I got two different train games and four different sieve games all going at the same time.

698
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:55,513
Scott: Yeah.

699
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:57,162
Scott: It's like you got nothing to, you know, it's taking.

700
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:59,594
Scott: your turn takes like a minute, a few minutes.

701
00:53:59,674 --> 00:53:59,875
Scott: Right.

702
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,131
Scott: So you can queue up a bunch of games as long as you can keep them on your head.

703
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:08,855
Scott: It's like, yeah, you filled up your, all that free time during the day where you weren't doing anything meaningful.

704
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:13,754
Scott: You can now take turns in games to fill up your calendar there, you know, your schedule.

705
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:17,213
Scott: It's like, yeah, you know, you take a break, eat a snack, take a turn.

706
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:19,320
Scott: You know, what were you going to do otherwise?

707
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:19,622
Scott: Nothing.

708
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:21,810
Scott: You know, it's like, why not?

709
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,409
Scott: It's my, it's, you know, Phil, it's a much more exciting and better way to spend your time.

710
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,498
Scott: If you're going to be stuck at home, right.

711
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:34,355
Scott: Taking turns and playing games, uh, you know, which is what you would do anyway if you had free time.

712
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,382
Scott: Uh, why not?

713
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:37,525
Scott: It's, it's solely awesome.

714
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:38,509
Rym: Yeah.

715
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:50,306
Scott: Uh, I think, you know, one thing is that, uh, while we do have some async games to play, there are not nearly enough of them in the world and a lot of them are not done well.

716
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:57,207
Scott: Even sieve, it's like kind of broken and you need all these weird solutions did not support.

717
00:54:57,448 --> 00:54:59,356
Rym: Like there was that pit boss thing with the server.

718
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:00,883
Rym: That thing barely worked.

719
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:02,972
Rym: I've gotten that thing half working so many times.

720
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:03,394
Rym: It sucked.

721
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:18,387
Rym: Uh, and some independent third party made something called giant multiplayer robot that handles it for you and just works and actually still have to save five games that are just still going, but are like wrapping toward their conclusions over these many years.

722
00:55:18,407 --> 00:55:19,110
Rym: Yeah.

723
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:24,152
Scott: There's another one called player damn turn that works for sieve six and sieve five and some other games.

724
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:27,204
Scott: Um, but there's still, there's still hacks, right?

725
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,632
Scott: They work, but they're still kind of, they're not perfect.

726
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:36,674
Rym: But what bothers me the most is that civilization six in particular is so well suited to asynchronous play.

727
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:43,913
Rym: And yet the publisher and the developer refuse to support it in any meaningful way.

728
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,445
Rym: They, the things they've implemented don't actually work.

729
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:48,273
Rym: They failed like regularly.

730
00:55:48,614 --> 00:55:52,230
Rym: I've lost so many games to their play by cloud option that I just gave up on it forever.

731
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,802
Rym: And like there's such basic stuff like a civilization six game.

732
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,511
Rym: Here's a like ideal use case.

733
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:14,265
Rym: If I was like the game, uh, producer or product manager or designer, like trying to solve this problem, start a game, live, get it to a certain point and then convert it to us asynchronous game from that point onward, like blitz through the beginning, play async.

734
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:18,381
Rym: And then if you feel it like, and you all get together, turn it back into a live game.

735
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,131
Rym: They don't make that easy to do at all.

736
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,921
Rym: Like there is no button that would just make that happen.

737
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,265
Scott: You don't make money with that.

738
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,962
Scott: They make money if they sell you another DLC.

739
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:29,203
Scott: Right?

740
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,912
Scott: So that's what they spend all their time working on.

741
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,804
Rym: But yet they may play by cloud for some reason.

742
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,012
Rym: I don't know why they even made that at all.

743
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:37,096
Scott: Yeah.

744
00:56:37,136 --> 00:56:37,778
Scott: I don't know either.

745
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,765
Rym: Uh, especially cause it doesn't work.

746
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:44,039
Scott: You know, sieve is not really a balanced competitive game.

747
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,089
Scott: Uh, so it's like the multiplayer aspect of it.

748
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:53,346
Scott: You know, it's like people try to make it one, but it's not problems.

749
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:58,566
Rym: I enjoy sieve multiplayer more like an idea game in that I'm just interested in seeing like what happens.

750
00:56:58,627 --> 00:56:59,912
Rym: Like let's just play it.

751
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:05,997
Rym: It's fun, but I'm not trying to win super hard because winning is kind of random if you're playing like optimally.

752
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:09,970
Rym: So it's more like, I just, it's like a fun experience.

753
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:13,004
Rym: Like I actually don't like playing six single player anymore.

754
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:14,671
Rym: I only like playing it with people.

755
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:16,538
Scott: That's fine.

756
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:26,623
Scott: Uh, but yeah, asynchronous games, you know, it's like we bring up, you know, when they're good, they're not always good when they're good when, you know, sometimes different situations, but I definitely think there are enough of them.

757
00:57:26,663 --> 00:57:32,201
Scott: There are so many opportunities in this space that are just sort of forgotten.

758
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:44,844
Scott: There's anyone who's made a big long board game, even if it's a crummy board game that we don't like, it's like, you know how many people would like to play asynchronous risk just on the, with a phone app, right?

759
00:57:45,526 --> 00:57:59,609
Scott: Um, you know, how many people would play asynchronous twilight imperium phone app or something, you know, it's like, there's all the, all those things that people, uh, you know, nerds want, do want to play long games.

760
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:05,993
Scott: And some of them, you know, they don't prioritize it or for whatever reason, don't have friends or who knows, we can't get it together.

761
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:15,242
Scott: But if you have async with lobbies to join and play and you held people accountable to taking their turn somehow, right.

762
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:21,104
Scott: Or handle situations where people stop taking their turn, um, you know, or abandon a game and things like that.

763
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:24,496
Scott: There's, there's definitely something there to be tapped.

764
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:26,242
Scott: There is an untapped market.

765
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:32,402
Rym: I look in play your damn turn for six and I look in, uh, 18 X X games, 18 X X dot games.

766
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:36,997
Rym: There are a shit ton of people playing these async games with strangers right now.

767
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,985
Scott: Well, I think it helps.

768
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:53,319
Scott: people are at home, but even before that, this, there's a lot of, uh, you know, people who want this kind of thing, you know, it's just something to do throughout the day instead of, you know, instead of checking your Twitter instead of doom scrolling or Facebooking, right.

769
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:56,431
Scott: It's like, you can check this site for turns to take in a game.

770
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,918
Scott: I think that's much better for you as a person.

771
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:01,085
Scott: Uh, I would say, right.

772
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:04,558
Scott: Uh, you know, and it's like, you could make money.

773
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:06,346
Scott: These things are like kind of free ish.

774
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:07,170
Scott: Some of them, right.

775
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:10,260
Scott: It's like, and make this stuff.

776
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,922
Scott: People want it.

777
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,230
Rym: I think a big problem is a lot of game designers.

778
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,881
Rym: They don't think about the asynchronous use case at all.

779
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:21,397
Rym: So, so many board games have one or two mechanics that make async basically impossible.

780
00:59:22,883 --> 00:59:25,774
Rym: Like so many games that feel like they'd be such an asynchronous game.

781
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:31,440
Rym: If you actually try to build that, you're going to find there's one fucking mechanic that makes it not work at all.

782
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:32,645
Rym: And then you have a choice.

783
00:59:33,188 --> 00:59:36,480
Rym: If you make it asynchronous by changing that mechanic, you've made a completely different game.

784
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:55,050
Rym: So what I, the real advice I would have, if you're designing a board game that is moderately complicated, see if you can avoid the kinds of mechanics, mostly interrupts or short turns, or it like actions that require all the players to do something before the game can proceed.

785
00:59:55,472 --> 01:00:04,130
Rym: Try to make the unit of interaction of the player, like the individual player's atoms, be as big as possible before another player is obligated to take an action.

786
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,571
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: And now, cause I'm getting ready to play an RPG, I leave you with real work and grain.

798
01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:27,256
Rym: You can travel through the tunnel looped by the little lake.

799

Rym: Micro Machines, the real one, the original one.

800
01:01:29,929 --> 01:01:32,100
Rym: The Micro Machines Powertrain City comes with a five car train.
