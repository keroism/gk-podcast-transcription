1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,522
Rym: It's Monday, October 4th, 2021, I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,590
Scott:  And I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,050
Rym:  And this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,909
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about social media and that big Facebook outage.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,488
Scott:  Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,269
Rym:  So did something, there's a, there's one kind of milestone in life and that's a milestone of doing something you've never done before.

7
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:45,130
Rym: But there's another milestone that a lot of people don't think about until they get older and it's doing something you've done before, but doing it for the first time as an adult where you are the sole person responsible for the entire thing, like having a pet as an example.

8
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,110
Rym: We had dogs as kids.

9
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:48,118
Rym: I didn't do 100% of the dog work as a kid.

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,470
Rym: Like there were vet things that happened and nail clipping and stuff that my parents would just do.

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,670
Rym: And sometimes I was involved, but there was someone else to take up that slack.

12
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:01,510
Rym: But like having a pet for the first time here, we had to do literally everything.

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,429
Rym: If there was something we didn't know to do, we're just effed.

14
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,770
Rym: Like that's an adult thing.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,909
Scott: So this past week-- - I mean if you're a kid and you wanna go and like, you know, say to an amusement park, all you do is say I wanna go to the amusement park and then somehow you're there.

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,450
Scott:  Yup, and meanwhile, you're like oh yeah, I've heard it done.

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,750
Scott:  You gotta deal with the transportation and the tickets and the food and make sure nobody dies.

18
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:32,490
Rym:  Yup, like there's a difference between I wanna go to PAX and see Markiplier and how the fuck do I get four badges to this convention in Seattle?

19
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:33,789
Rym: How do we, when do we even fly there?

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,977
Scott:  Yup.

21
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:42,941
Rym: So this past weekend, Emily and I, she had never done this thing before and I have never done it as an adult and that thing is,

22
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:50,790
Scott: for real-- - The one thing you have done before is the GeekNights thing where you don't say the noun of whatever the thing is until the last possible second.

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,787
Rym:  Is that a thing that a podcast like this might have done in the past?

24
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,868
Scott:  Well, you know, maybe so.

25
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,789
Scott:  So we were camping.

26
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,990
Scott:  I don't think this is your first time as an adult withholding the noun to the last second.

27
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,729
Rym:  It is, in fact, not my first rodeo.

28
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,669
Rym: Actually, I have never been to a rodeo.

29
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:08,530
Rym: Anyway, so if I ever go to one, it would be my first, fuck rodeos.

30
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:10,530
Rym: Unless it's just clowns getting hurt.

31
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,390
Rym: Anyway, so we went camping, like proper backpack camping.

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:25,689
Rym: And Emily had never been camping in the woods before ever, but while I had been camping a lot and I'd learned a lot about camping, that was pretty much like Cub Scouts up until early Boy Scouts.

33
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,430
Rym: And from like mid-high school onward, I never went camping.

34
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:38,489
Rym: So this was the first time I ever went camping where I actually had to handle all the logistics to the point where if I fuck it up, we're gonna have a real bad time.

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:47,130
Rym: Like don't have enough water or it is literally too cold to survive the night out in the woods or don't have light, don't have food, like that kind of problem.

36
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,849
Rym: And super success, it was super fun.

37
00:02:50,591 --> 00:03:06,990
Rym: And I gotta say, I forgot how fun it is to go out into the woods and completely under your own power with just a backpack and your own two legs and sleep somewhere without going home and just be fine the next day, like waking up in the middle of the woods at dawn.

38
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:08,030
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

39
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,928
Rym: I missed it.

40
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,289
Scott:  Just do, why don't you just sell your apartment and then live in the woods?

41
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,790
Rym:  Oh, because, so sleeping in the woods-- - Find a woods with internet.

42
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,910
Rym:  Sleeping in the woods, there was no internet.

43
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,750
Rym: Literally, I had no internet access.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,189
Scott:  There are woods with internet though.

45
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,350
Scott: I know that one doesn't have it.

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:32,650
Rym:  Yeah, well like when most people think of camping, what they think of is people drive a car up to a campsite, they pitch a bunch of tents in a campsite that's right there, they have a cooler and like all this stuff.

47
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:40,089
Rym: This is more like I'm carrying the not most comfortable bed with me 'cause I have to be able to physically carry it 10 miles over mountains.

48
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:49,650
Rym: So while I like camping, I also very much like being back in my own bed in a nice apartment in New York with internet at the end of camping.

49
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,589
Scott:  You don't say.

50
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,816
Rym:  Just like I like visiting upstate New York, but I like being in a place where I can order Korean food at 3 a.m.

51
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:58,309
Rym: if I want to and it will show up.

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,730
Scott:  It's like picking up a heavy rock and then picking up the not so heavy rock.

53
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,169
Scott: Like ah, I feel so strong.

54
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,050
Rym:  Yup, but it also really gives you an appreciation for like this kind of camping.

55
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,410
Rym: Something that I did not appreciate as a kid was water.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,709
Rym: Having enough water to cook and drink and wash and everything that is safe.

57
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,890
Rym: One, it's a lot easier than it used to be.

58
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,090
Rym: When I was a kid, we were like putting chlorine tablets and bleach and water and drinking the foul concoction.

59
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,470
Scott:  You can carry the water, but water is heavy as fuck.

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,990
Rym:  So we carried on this trip, I carried a 33 pound bag and Emily carried a 30 pound bag.

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:42,410
Rym: And fully a third of that weight was water and that was barely enough water to make it two days.

62
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,029
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, let's see.

63
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,870
Scott: If you have eight, a gallon of water is like eight pounds.

64
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:51,990
Scott: So if you have a 33 pound bag, that's like a 25% of the weight is just water.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,680
Rym:  Yeah, it's hard to carry enough water.

66
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,760
Rym: So I actually also carry filtration systems to just get water in the woods.

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,199
Rym: But this time we also carried a bunch of water on our own to not have to rely on that.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,020
Rym: 'cause I've never used in the woods for real in a survival situation, modern water filtration techniques either.

69
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,819
Rym: All the ways I knew from Cub Scouts.

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Scott:  But you also have to find such a water source.

71
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,180
Rym:  Ah, that is actually easy.

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,241
Rym: So where we camped in Harriman, there's.

73
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:24,660
Rym: technically you're not allowed to camp there unless you're a thru-hiker, unless you camp within 300 feet of one of the lean-to shelters.

74
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
Rym: So there's areas you can camp.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:38,480
Rym: So I found a website where someone was like, for each one of these areas you're allowed to camp, here are the places on the map where there is water in order of best water to dodgiest water.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
Scott:  And someone put in a lot of effort to make that website.

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,500
Rym:  Oh yeah, because if you're a backpack camper, that is the most important thing.

78
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:47,480
Rym: That is the thing.

79
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Rym: You get to a campsite and the first thing you do is figure out-- - I was telling that one other person a lot.

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,780
Scott: I could just make such a website full of lies.

81
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,278
Rym:  Yeah, you could.

82
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:02,759
Rym: The thing is, in Harriman Park at least, there's actually a lot of safe water to drink, assuming you filter it.

83
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:06,340
Scott: So actually-- - Well, I mean, in New York State in general, we got plenty of water.

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:16,378
Rym:  Yeah, like if the springs were dried up or inaccessible, there's a lake within like two miles hike in any direction from like any point that I would more than gladly come up from.

85
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Scott:  It's also not like, pretty much anywhere in that park, you could walk to, there's a civilized part of the park you can get to very easily.

86
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:31,499
Rym:  With the caveat that you're either doing that on unblazed, often impassable trails or climbing over mountains.

87
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,760
Scott:  Well, it depends if you don't have to go straight, right?

88
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,740
Scott: But like, you know, Bear Mountain Park has like, you know, has stuff.

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,919
Scott: There's like employees and buildings and, you know, basketball, you know, that's not that far from pretty much anywhere in the park.

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,352
Rym:  Yeah, like we could hike out--.

91
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,220
Scott:  So like, if you exit the park in pretty much any direction, you're gonna be in some kind of town, houses, you know.

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,220
Rym:  Well, if you exit the park in certain directions, you will literally never find civilization because the Appalachian Trail goes through there and that's part of what we were hiking on.

93
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,660
Rym: You could just follow that down to like Georgia.

94
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,040
Scott:  Yeah, but it's like, you know, if you look at like satellite view, it's like, you know.

95
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:16,040
Rym:  I mean, it only took, we did a big loop, so while we hiked nine and a half miles-- - Well, I mean, there's the town of Harriman, right?

96
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,014
Scott: There's the town of--.

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,259
Rym:  Well, like if you get to the Anthony Wayne Center, you could probably get ahold of rangers from there to get help.

98
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,620
Scott:  There's something berg on the south to bike through.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,236
Rym:  The south would be too far to hike to, but anyway.

100
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,039
Scott:  It depends which part you're in.

101
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:52,779
Rym:  Yeah, so we were in a part where we hiked about 10 miles to get to the campsite over multiple mountains, but there was a continuing route that was only like five more miles that would get us back to where the car was, so about five miles was the maximum we would have had to hike to get help if we actually ran into trouble, but hiking in the dark is extremely dangerous and difficult if you've never done it before.

102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,840
Rym:  Just wait till the sun comes out.

103
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,939
Rym:  I might have, on the last Australia, two Australia trips ago, had to climb out of a gorge in the middle of the night in the pitch black.

104
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,020
Rym: It took me a couple hours to get out of there.

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,139
Scott:  Wait till the sun comes out.

106
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,099
Rym:  No, I was more willing to just climb out rather than wait, considering where I was and the fact that I didn't have a shelter.

107
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,096
Scott:  Anyway.

108
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,700
Rym:  Anyway, it was a super fun time.

109
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,091
Rym: So there's the news, there's a big news.

110
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:29,900
Rym: If you didn't notice, with the full disclosure, I didn't notice until some people told me and even in my Twitter feed, no one was really talking about it until people started making fun of it.

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,198
Scott:  Until everyone, yeah, no one was talking about it until everyone was talking about it, which, of course.

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
Rym:  Facebook is just fucking--.

113
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,580
Scott:  That's how things happen.

114
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,520
Scott: Before the thing happens, no one talks about it, then the thing happens, then everyone talks about it.

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,580
Rym:  Ah, but when the thing happened, I still didn't see people talk about it right away because for whatever reason, the people in my feed seemed to not use Facebook.

116
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:58,779
Rym: So the first indication I saw that something was wrong with Facebook was not someone saying, oh shit, Facebook is down or even Facebook trending, it was someone tweeting, ha ha ha, fuck Facebook, they're fucked now, and I was like, what?

117
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,320
Rym: Is this about the whistleblower?

118
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,259
Rym: And then I discovered, oh no, there's like three Facebook newses happening.

119
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,760
Scott:  Yeah, 'cause the whistleblower's been news all week.

120
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,717
Scott: They're still down, it's--.

121
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,660
Rym:  Oh yeah, Facebook might not come up anytime soon, actually, that's-- - We'll see how many hours.

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,499
Scott: How many, has it been, maybe it's 10 something, maybe it went down, I wanna say?

123
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,373
Scott:  Yep.

124
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,100
Scott:  There might be approaching eight hours by now, I'm guessing.

125
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,893
Rym:  So here's the news, and this is like breaking now, like dateline, 5.43 p.m.

126
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,179
Rym: Eastern time on October 4th.

127
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:31,200
Rym: We don't know a lot more than you do, but basically, Facebook made some change internally.

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,119
Scott:  Well, you listening in the future probably know way more than we do.

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,420
Rym:  Yep, which will be really funny.

130
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:43,920
Rym: I love, like during the election cycle, like after every election, I love to go back and listen to pundits to see how fuckin' wrong they were about everything.

131
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,199
Rym: once we actually know what went down.

132
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,680
Scott:  And if you hear someone who's fuckin' right, be like, whoa, who is that person?

133
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,457
Scott: Let's listen to this--.

134
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:58,540
Rym:  Case in point, though, make sure that person is right at least three times before you elevate them too much, otherwise you get an eight silver situation.

135
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,020
Rym: They gotta be right multiple times.

136
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,259
Rym: So yeah, Facebook went down.

137
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:31,080
Rym: The best indication we have right now as to the root cause is an error that Facebook made in an obscure part of the internet that I'm gonna try to describe succinctly, 'cause I am ostensibly well-versed in this, but I'll give you a bunch of caveats in a minute, but a thing that determines how traffic gets routed over the internet itself, like core internet infrastructure.

138
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:40,980
Rym: Facebook fucked something up so badly that they basically told the entire world they don't exist, and that seems to be the state of it.

139
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,379
Rym: Facebook has disappeared.

140
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,819
Scott:  So if you try to get packets routed to an IP address on Facebook's network, the internet is like, there's no route there.

141
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,818
Rym:  And when Scott says the internet, he means the internet with a capital I, the entire internet.

142
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Scott:  Right, the routers at your internet service provider and all the other internet service providers and all the switches and all the everything around the whole world are like, yeah, there's no such place.

143
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,320
Scott: It's like if you send a letter somewhere and it comes back, no such address.

144
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,780
Rym:  I think the analogy I gave at another Discord, but I'm gonna repeat it here, because this is the best way I can describe this.

145
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:25,399
Rym: Imagine if I called everyone I knew on the phone and said, yo, if you ever get a call from this number again, it's not me, do not trust it.

146
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:28,780
Rym: Also, never call me again, this is no longer my phone number.

147
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:31,099
Rym: So now, okay, I've done that.

148
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:35,019
Rym: So now, I realize, wait, I fucked up, I shouldn't have done that.

149
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,179
Rym: And I try to call Scott and be like, Scott, don't cut me off.

150
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,339
Rym: Scott's not gonna listen to me.

151
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,540
Scott:  But I already removed you from my contacts.

152
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,519
Scott:  And he blocked the number.

153
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Scott:  I have a setting on my phone that says, if you're not in my contacts, my phone doesn't ring.

154
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,420
Scott: And now, you can't call me.

155
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,540
Rym:  Yep, so the technology where the problem lies, this is a deep part of the internet.

156
00:11:55,961 --> 00:12:00,220
Rym: And it's one of those things that's both extremely simple and extremely complex.

157
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,879
Rym: And anyone who does Linux or network administration probably gets what I mean.

158
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,040
Rym: BGP, Border Gateway Protocol, I think is what it stands for.

159
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,909
Scott: I'm going off of like-- - Border Gateway Protocol is one of those things that you've heard of it, but you don't know it.

160
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:17,700
Scott: Only a few people know it.

161
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
Rym:  I learned it at RIT.

162
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,920
Rym: Like, I had to learn it fluently.

163
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,599
Scott:  Could you do a job where that's your job?

164
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,039
Scott: Could you fix what's wrong at Facebook?

165
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,520
Rym:  So, when I was younger-- - Could you do it now?

166
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,458
Rym:  Now, fuck no.

167
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:31,359
Rym: But I could have dealt with a problem like this.

168
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:31,838
Rym:  Anyway.

169
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:43,180
Scott:  Circa around 2003 through 2008 was about when I-- - But it's one of those things where you don't know it, but if someone brings it up, you know you're fucked.

170
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,546
Rym:  Yep.

171
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,578
Scott:  It's like, you don't, it's not, right?

172
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,140
Scott: It's like-- - It's like if you're a big company.

173
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,060
Scott:  If you're at the mechanics, right?

174
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,292
Scott: If you're at the mechanic and it's like, you know, you don't know how a transmission works, but if they're like, "I think the problem's in the

175
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,040
Scott: transmission."

176
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,940
Scott: Well, you know your wallet's gonna get hurt real bad.

177
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,853
Rym:  Like, if someone asks about the status of the generators at your data center, that's a way scarier conversation than to ask about the power, so.

178
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,460
Scott:  You go to the doctor and it's like, oh, you don't know what the spleen is, but they're like, "The problem is in the spleen.

179
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:14,691
Scott: "You know that's a bad

180
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,278
Scott: prognosis.".

181
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,019
Rym: (laughing) - Listen, we're gonna talk about your duodenum right now.

182
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:20,777
Rym: (laughing).

183
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:36,799
Rym: So, basically, BGP is an old routing protocol to the point that when I took classes on it in 2000 and 2001 at RIT, I treated it as something archaic that I didn't need to care that much about.

184
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,840
Rym: It was also extremely simplistic.

185
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:51,379
Rym: Most people, including myself, who have a working understanding of BGP, have only ever used it practically in toy networks or inside of networks that they have a lot of control over.

186
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,019
Rym: BGP actually has two different ways it works.

187
00:13:54,442 --> 00:14:02,700
Rym: It's used internally within your network for your routers to basically agree on how to route packets to any arbitrary IP address that they get told about.

188
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:07,160
Rym: And this is literally how the entire routing table of your entire network gets formed.

189
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:13,920
Rym: There are often other routing protocols that are used within that system with or without BGP helping, and it gets complicated.

190
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,860
Rym: But eBGP is how your entire network tells the rest of the world that it exists.

191
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:42,600
Rym: And the big reason this is a big deal is that the protocol is actually extremely complicated to the point that, in my experience, in a large network or a network where you don't control all the nodes, it is hard to predict the outcome of a particular change you might make to the actual behavior of the network.

192
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:49,540
Rym: I mean, the rules you put in a BGP configuration are actually pretty simple.

193
00:14:49,962 --> 00:15:01,620
Rym: They basically boil down to things like this quality level of connection is available for any traffic routed to IPs in this range.

194
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,800
Rym: And for all that traffic, these are all the ways you could possibly route packets that could get to that network eventually.

195
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:20,640
Rym: And it's not really worth explaining more, you can try to read the Wikipedia page, and unless you have a deep understanding, not just a piece of BGP-- is like the number one Wikipedia page today.

196
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,180
Rym:  I would not be surprised.

197
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:27,080
Rym: I was actually refreshing myself on it 'cause it's been a while.

198
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,440
Rym: I have not touched this protocol since like 2005.

199
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,100
Rym: So yeah, Facebook's in deep shit.

200
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,899
Rym: This is not the DNS outage.

201
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,420
Rym: everyone thought it was originally.

202
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,933
Scott:  Well, it just so happens.

203
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:39,740
Scott: their DNS is behind their routing, so you couldn't reach their DNS.

204
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,500
Scott: But you could reach the Instagram DNS.

205
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:55,800
Scott: Instagram apparently has their DNS on Oz still, which shows even the biggest companies like Facebook don't have their shit together in terms of unification, but they apparently don't have their shit together in terms of single points of failure either.

206
00:15:56,461 --> 00:16:19,219
Rym:  Yup, but it is shocking that Facebook is down so hard right now and has been for so long, partly because Facebook is both hugely important to a huge percentage of people in industrialized nations and a lot of non-industrialized or industrializing nations, especially outside of the US, where in some cases it is the sole way a lot of people talk to each other.

207
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:26,359
Rym: But in the US, there's an interesting dichotomy between people who rely heavily on Facebook and people who avoid Facebook at all costs.

208
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,800
Scott:  Well, there's a lot going on there, right?

209
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,340
Scott: So we always talk about antitrust.

210
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:44,740
Scott: So here's a problem, is that by allowing computer companies to combine so many things together and under one roof, whether that's a physical roof or a company roof or whatever, you now put too many eggs in one basket.

211
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:52,440
Scott: And this is a good argument why we shouldn't have allowed Facebook to get Instagram and WhatsApp and all these other things.

212
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,699
Scott: If they hadn't, then only one of the things would be down and not all three.

213
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Rym:  Yup, and Facebook, unlike, say, SMS, things like SMS, there are governments that force those things to keep working and there's a lot more engineering due diligence.

214
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,700
Rym: An SMS outage would be similarly catastrophic.

215
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,257
Rym: And guess what?

216
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,179
Rym: There are rarely SMS outages.

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,119
Scott:  Right, well, here's the thing, right?

218
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:18,940
Scott: So Facebook, we don't care that Facebook is down.

219
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:20,159
Scott: We don't like Facebook.

220
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,780
Scott: But we don't like WhatsApp and Instagram that much either.

221
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:33,340
Scott: But WhatsApp especially is like an essential communication mechanism for a lot of people, especially people with like foreign relatives or certain countries.

222
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,540
Scott: WhatsApp is like the number one way to communicate in certain countries.

223
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:45,060
Scott: So if you're in those countries or know anyone in those countries that you communicate with often, your basic communication has been cut off, right?

224
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:49,819
Scott: Like you can't talk to your relatives in India, for example, like you just don't know what's up with them right now.

225
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,600
Rym:  Oh, just now the Facebook website is reachable again.

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,465
Scott:  Wow.

227
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,000
Rym:  Literally just now.

228
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,120
Rym: I've been refreshing it off and on.

229
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,599
Scott:  It's not loading for me, but you know.

230
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,496
Rym:  It just loaded for me.

231
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,460
Scott:  It's doing something, it's doing something.

232
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,158
Rym:  Just now.

233
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
Scott:  Again, a white page.

234
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,660
Scott: It's slowly coming up.

235
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,760
Rym:  I can't log in and check 'cause I don't have a Facebook account.

236
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:07,960
Scott:  Oh no, it worked.

237
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:08,678
Scott: It just really slow.

238
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,319
Rym:  Damn it, I was hoping it would stay down.

239
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,610
Rym: Anyway.

240
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,640
Scott:  Yep, well that's sad.

241
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,240
Scott: But regardless.

242
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,740
Rym:  That's a shame.

243
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:25,180
Scott:  So the argument is A, antitrust of course, but B, even if WhatsApp was its own company still, just completely standalone, if it reaches the point where it's such an essential communication mechanism.

244
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,080
Rym:  It should be nationalized.

245
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:32,640
Scott:  It should be nationalized ideally, but if not, it should at least be regulated as utility because it's essential.

246
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,980
Scott:  Yep.

247
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,460
Scott:  But here's the other problem is, it's an international utility.

248
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,440
Scott: It's not a single nation utility which make things complicated.

249
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,500
Scott: Is there even a precedent for regulating an international utility?

250
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,420
Rym:  There absolutely are precedents and treaties and lots of ways to regulate international services.

251
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,060
Rym: It just takes a very, very long time.

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:03,478
Rym: And often those things get blocked entirely by frankly, countries like the United States that try to prevent regulation of tech companies that it cares about.

253
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,758
Scott:  Yeah, well and there's also every, certain countries are always gonna do something.

254
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:08,272
Scott: weird, right?

255
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,830
Scott:  Yep.

256
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:13,600
Rym: So there's a lot going on here and it's interesting.

257
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,860
Rym: Facebook is finally coming back online it looks like, which I guess is good for the people who rely on it.

258
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:24,400
Rym: But the underlying problem is Facebook should not and cannot remain as powerful as it is right now.

259
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,740
Scott:  Well, but you don't even talk, right?

260
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:36,540
Scott: So Oz is not just Amazon, but everyone who uses Oz, which is, imagine if Oz itself, all the regions and all the zones were down.

261
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,620
Scott: This is a complete global outage for Facebook.

262
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,340
Scott: Literally every Facebook thing was out, period.

263
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:52,799
Scott: So Amazon Web Services, you think that won't happen 'cause they have so many regions and zones and all this stuff going on that only some of it could possibly be down at once.

264
00:19:53,445 --> 00:20:00,240
Scott: And it's never all gone down at once, but is it possible that they could fuck up similarly and have all of Oz go down?

265
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,133
Scott: Not only would every Amazon thing be down, Twitch, their video game.

266
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,838
Scott: they just came out with, buying stuff, right?

267
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,320
Rym:  Yep.

268
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,580
Scott:  You know, everything, all the Whole Foods, you wouldn't be able to get groceries, right?

269
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:16,840
Scott: The point of sales at the Whole Foods would be down.

270
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:22,120
Scott: But also every company that hosts their shit on Oz would be down, right?

271
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,120
Scott: Like half the services on the internet would be down.

272
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,419
Scott: Instagram would be down still, even if the Facebook didn't fuck up.

273
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:40,200
Scott: So should that even be, like we've basically just accepted that risk because of the cost-benefit is, you know, and basically everyone individually made the choice for themselves.

274
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:54,699
Scott: Like yes, it's worth it for us to put our personal eggs in this basket, you know, and all those choices were probably correct on a cost-benefit ratio, but nobody considered the cost of everyone putting their eggs in the same basket.

275
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,479
Scott: We all put our eggs in the one basket.

276
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,060
Rym:  Yep, well kind of like how we look, we as a society like to look at the cost.

277
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,320
Rym: We talked about this on GeekNights a while ago.

278
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,420
Rym: The cost of coal power versus nuclear power in terms of dollars and like all these types of things.

279
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:12,279
Rym: But we often ignore a lot of the real costs like human misery or risk.

280
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
Scott:  Well, externalities, yeah.

281
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,319
Scott: So let's hope all of Oz never goes down 'cause that would be way worse than this.

282
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,100
Scott: It also shows you, right, you know, there's other angles to take a look on this, right?

283
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,800
Scott: So the other angle is like, yeah, Facebook's actually, you know, one person wrote an article this morning actually.

284
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:37,140
Scott: I think it might have been before they went down and they were like, yeah, actually the way I see this is Facebook's in deep trouble, right?

285
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,380
Scott: You know, look at the, you know, the whistleblower, right?

286
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,200
Scott: And Facebook's trying to do all these scams.

287
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,340
Scott: There was that thing about them like trying to get like kids to use Messenger on play dates and stuff.

288
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,260
Scott: Like targeting kids.

289
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,000
Scott: Why are you targeting kids?

290
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,259
Scott: 'Cause they know all their users are old and are gonna die.

291
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:07,860
Rym:  Yep, there's those internal studies we'll talk about with the whistleblower thing specifically showing that they knew and had documented evidence of material harm caused to teens, especially teen girls, using Facebook, like suicide.

292
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,120
Rym:  Instagram.

293
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,539
Rym:  Horrible, yeah, and Facebook as a whole, both.

294
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:20,720
Scott: And-- - You could interpret this as like, you know, it's just another example of, yeah, actually Facebook's not doing well.

295
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,679
Scott: They're not that strong.

296
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:26,260
Scott: The other tech companies look a lot stronger when you put them side by side.

297
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,823
Scott:  Yep,

298
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:39,379
Rym: and you wonder if part of it is, 'cause I know, I know for a fact Facebook is trying to hire a lot of people recently because I've had the recruiters coming after me a bunch and recruiters trying to recruit on their behalf and then I find out it's Facebook and I tell them to go away.

299
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:46,120
Rym: I know a bunch of people who have quit jobs in capital markets relatively recently to go work at Facebook.

300
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:58,240
Rym: And I would wonder and suspect, but again, do not know, I am not defaming any particular company or anything here, but what if they're losing a lot of good people?

301
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,520
Rym: What if people are leaving Facebook and the talent pool inside is weaker?

302
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:06,758
Rym: That can be the kind of thing that leads to an outage like this.

303
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:17,879
Scott:  Well, the funny thing I said that no one else, I think I said it first 'cause I didn't steal it from anyone else, was Facebook contributed to the global pandemic being worse than it could have been.

304
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:29,980
Scott: The pandemic in turn caused Facebook to have employees working from home and not at the data center and then something went wrong at the data center and there weren't employees there to fix it for this particular problem.

305
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,540
Scott: They needed to actually be where the computers are 'cause they couldn't reach them over the internet.

306
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,118
Rym:  Yep, so even funnier, we know based on people--.

307
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,100
Scott:  Facebook destroyed itself in this way.

308
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,799
Rym:  Based on Facebook people.

309
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,700
Scott:  Heard the backend part.

310
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Rym:  They reported that internally pretty much everything was down.

311
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,360
Rym: The company couldn't do anything.

312
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,559
Rym: People couldn't email each other.

313
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,620
Rym: They couldn't open conference rooms in some situations.

314
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,600
Rym: There's a bunch of reporting.

315
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:03,700
Scott:  I mean, that's what happens when you have everything powered by the net, every single thing you have requires a network connection which is why, and I see people doing this, right?

316
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,518
Scott: Is like people get their smart homes with their Nest thermostats or whatever, right?

317
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:15,999
Scott: It's like I get as few network-dependent devices as possible, right?

318
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:19,500
Scott: Any device I get, it's like, does this need to connect to the network?

319
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:21,899
Scott: No, then it's not going to, right?

320
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:31,980
Scott: The only things that connect to the network are computers and a Nintendo Switch that needs to download games, phones, tablets, which are basically computers.

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
Rym:  I was about to say, those are just computers.

322
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,540
Scott:  Just computers.

323
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:40,440
Scott: Nothing else I have connects to the internet or any kind of internet at all.

324
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:44,659
Rym:  I got one Sonos device that connects to the internet to stream music.

325
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,739
Scott:  I wouldn't get an internet-connected fridge.

326
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,296
Scott:  Nope.

327
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,500
Rym: If I did, I would not connect to the internet.

328
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,960
Scott:  I would be happy to get an automated programmable fridge that has a computer in it, but I would never connect to the internet.

329
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:57,139
Scott: I would just program the fridge.

330
00:24:59,141 --> 00:25:21,820
Rym: So we'll see what fallout there is from all this, but it is fascinating that this literally happened on the day that America was waking up to all the reporting on the whistleblower for Facebook going public, the 60 Minutes episode airing, and everyone's just starting to talk about this Facebook problem, and then suddenly Facebook is down globally.

331
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:22,835
Scott:  Yep.

332
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Scott: All right, so really tiny news.

333
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:33,116
Scott: This research group, they came up with this algorithm/software tool, and the goal of the tool is to

334
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:33,458
Rym: find

335
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:46,352
Scott: out who really owns a company, because a lot of countries, they have these laws where you can have a shell company, and then another company owns a thing, and then there's a subsidiary, and all that kind of nonsense.

336
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:55,140
Scott: offshore this, but the countries themselves do have databases full of all the registered companies, right?

337
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:56,880
Scott: The information is there.

338
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:11,008
Scott: The data is available, but to be able to go into the data and say who owns this company is a, to do it by hand is slow as hell, because you could be like 100 layers deep, who knows, and to do it with the existing algorithms was also.

339
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:29,300
Scott: they weren't that efficient, so they came up with a new algorithm called something, I don't know, they gave it a name, like something icon, I guess, alpha icon, I don't know, but yeah, they applied it to some company data from I think the UK or something.

340
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:37,426
Scott: You have a database of 4.2 million UK companies, and let's see, correctly determined the ultimate owner in 96% of the cases, right?

341
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:49,500
Scott: Which is, and the competing algorithm that already exists only was correct and found the right answer 89% of the time, so that's a pretty significant difference.

342
00:26:50,140 --> 00:27:04,660
Scott: So this is really useful, 'cause now we can take databases the governments have and find out who actually owns evil company X, and I think this has large consequences for justice, right?

343
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:17,660
Scott: Some company commits a crime, we can do, if they're in that percentage that wasn't being found, we can now find who the real owner is and go after them, if there is political will, which there usually isn't, but hey, one less excuse.

344
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:47,309
Rym:  So in one more news that is also a really big deal, we didn't even get to talk about this yet, just on the heels of the iPhones 13 coming out and still having a lightning adapter, Europe has announced that they will require basically all electronic devices that charge via any sort of cable, like USB, anything that's battery powered, there's a whole thing, it basically applies to smartphones, has to use USB-C.

345
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,630
Rym: USB-C is going to be the standard for the entire world.

346
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:59,629
Scott:  That's a good environmental move, 'cause it's like, hey, everyone use the same fucking cable, let's stop wasting time on all kinds of weird cables, everyone use this one, the end.

347
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:13,350
Rym:  It's absolutely huge news, because USB-C, the cable, the physical specification, is an extremely durable, capable specification that will probably survive decades, and that's the kind of spec you want to be the official standard.

348
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,613
Rym:  I'm sure

349
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:44,370
Scott: if they can get this law passed, considering how old USB-C is, which isn't that old, really, in the grand scheme, if they can update their laws this quickly, then I'm not worried that when USB-D comes out, they'll be able to update again, to re-standardize, if it ever becomes necessary, but USB-C will clearly be able to carry us for quite a long time, I mean, the regular USB, the rectangle one's been around since the late 90s, and it's still here, and still not gonna completely disappear.

350
00:28:44,791 --> 00:29:04,189
Rym:  Also, USB-C as a physical standard is a little bit complex, but it is extensible, and it's smart enough to deal with, you can upgrade it a lot, while still conforming to whatever these regulations eventually are, like now, you can plug any old, any devices just work, if you plug 'em into pretty much any USB-C charger, regardless of what the device

351
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:04,249
Scott: is.

352
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:14,290
Scott:  I can't really imagine an improvement on it, unless someone finds a way to make it way smaller, which seems unlikely, or B, just wireless, in which case, this law doesn't apply, so who cares?

353
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:25,490
Rym:  Well, arguably, wireless should, it's not clear if wireless will be banned, or can only be supplemental, because wireless actually introduces significant losses in efficiency.

354
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:32,408
Scott:  It does, but it also, significant gains in terms of, you don't have to have cables, material savings.

355
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,950
Rym:  Yep, so we'll see how that goes.

356
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,469
Scott:  Trash savings, you're not throwing out cables when they break.

357
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:52,929
Rym:  Yep, but it's really sad, Apple has just persisted, Apple is really mad about this news, and they've issued a bunch of statements how they're gonna fight it, where we remain concerned the strict regulation mandating just one connector stifles innovation, rather than encouraging it.

358
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:59,170
Scott:  I just, the thing that bothers me about that, is like, you know, that's clearly not a good faith argument.

359
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,443
Scott:  No.

360
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,829
Scott:  Right, it's like, right?

361
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,209
Rym:  USB-C exists.

362
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,248
Scott:  Right, it's like, Apple, you keep, first of all, you keep switching your devices to USB-C, you love USB-C, right?

363
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,830
Scott: You made your, you just came out with an iPad Mini that was USB-C, when before it didn't have it, right?

364
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:28,009
Scott: You keep switching things to USB-C from Lightning, so, but, so why are you so insistent on, it's like, you could just switch it all over now, what, you know, what, why are you waiting for even without this law?

365
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,830
Rym:  Yeah, like, why Lightning?

366
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:42,930
Rym: Lightning has zero material advantages, they make a big deal about how Lightning was how they made the iPhones thinner, I don't buy it, because these-- - Lightning is not, if you put 'em next to each other, the size difference is pretty small.

367
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,448
Scott:  Yep.

368
00:30:44,510 --> 00:31:03,570
Scott:  You know, it does not, I don't understand, you know, why, I guess, you know, they probably would have to change something in their designs, right, to accommodate this, and they don't wanna do that on the timetable set by some government, right, they wanna do it on their own timetable, but at least, you know, if you're gonna argue against it, tell us the good faith, real reason, right?

369
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:03,974
Scott:  Yep.

370
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:14,610
Scott:  You know, be like, yes, we don't want that because we make more money on Lightning cable licenses, you know, than on-- - What is the innovation Lightning has?

371
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:17,050
Rym: that USB-C does not, that materially affects.

372
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:28,190
Scott: but like, you know, it could just be in general, like maybe Apple's got another kind of cable in the works, like, you know, they already have Lightning and Thunderbolt, maybe like, I don't know, what's more than that?

373
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,830
Scott: Ball Lightning, maybe they got the Ball Lightning cable.

374
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,080
Rym:  The plasma cable.

375
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,121
Rym: 

376
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:48,150
Scott: Yeah, there's something, who knows what they got, maybe they got some other cable in the works, now they're gonna have to call that whole thing off, right, well, it's like, say that then, right, and then tell us how that's better, you know, it's like, don't lie and be like, stifle innovation with a bad faith argument.

377
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:56,970
Scott: If you want a government to not do something, at least just present a good faith argument of the real reason you're opposed, right, don't give a bullshit reason.

378
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:09,150
Rym:  Yep, so the proposed EU regulations apply to smartphones, tablets, cameras, phones, portable speakers, handheld video game systems, all of which have standardized on USB-C, except Apple smartphones.

379
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,765
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, all of those things are not even a problem, I can't, every camera now has USB-C, so yeah.

380
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:22,649
Rym:  So I wonder how Apple's gonna react to this, I feel like the directions they're gonna go are either--.

381
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:35,770
Scott:  They're already moving everything to USB-C, if they're forced to, they'll either, A, stop selling for a short time, B, move up their timetable, right, who knows, you know, if they got enough money, they can fucking deal with it, right.

382
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,490
Rym:  I can see them trying to go to completely wireless, and then the EU having to regulate that away.

383
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,669
Scott:  They'll fight the government, and then they'll see what happens, win or lose, and--.

384
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:57,030
Rym:  At least what I'm excited about most is that it's the European government, which can move a lot faster than the US government, and it's a market that's too big for Apple to just ignore, so they're gonna have to deal with it one way or another.

385
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,610
Scott:  But meanwhile, you just bought an iPhone, and now you have a lightning cable.

386
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,550
Rym:  I know, I just bought like four lightning cables to put in all the places.

387
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,390
Scott:  You could just use the wireless part, though.

388
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,830
Rym:  I guess I could, but that does charge slower, and is less efficient.

389
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,187
Scott:  Mm, that's true.

390
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,849
Rym:  Yeah, I'll talk about my iPhone, 'cause I switched, the hardware is good, other than that stupid lightning cable, but I'll talk about that another time.

391
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,932
Scott:  No, I mean, lightning cable would be fine, if even, lightning could have been USB-C, there's.

392
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:24,990
Scott: no, you know, it just wasn't, because Apple.

393
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,150
Rym:  All right, anyway.

394
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,590
Scott:  It's just inverted, basically, right, the pins, it's on the inside, and the pins stick out as opposed to a ring.

395
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,306
Rym:  And lightning has a bunch of features that arguably you could just do with USB-C.

396
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,689
Scott:  You could do every feature that, they're almost equivalent, I just think lightning doesn't have like the high-speed, high-power modes.

397
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,350
Rym:  But anyway, things of the day.

398
00:33:53,691 --> 00:34:08,688
Rym: So this is a Twitter thread, a while ago, like not even that long ago, people were making, there was a photo making the rounds at a hardware store somewhere, and it was a porcelain toilet, but the porcelain toilet was in the shape of a skull, like a big skull.

399
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,467
Scott:  It looked cool, I thought 50/50 it was Photoshopped, but you know, whatever.

400
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,630
Rym:  Yeah, but it was real, and it was just a thing, like all right, the skoilet.

401
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:34,610
Rym: So this Twitter thread, someone decided not just to track this thing down and figure out what it is, because apparently there is a whole world of skull toilets, there are multiple companies that compete in the skull-specific aesthetic of a toilet industry.

402
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,830
Rym: It is part of a luxury industry, this rabbit hole.

403
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:47,409
Scott:  Yet the people who have the skull toilets are not showing them off at all, 'cause we haven't seen them on the internet prominently until now.

404
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:53,050
Rym:  Yep, so this person's like, wait, here's Skull Pot, one of the companies that makes all sorts of skull toilets.

405
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:02,250
Scott:  If there's enough companies making skull toilets that it's a competitive market, there should be a lot of them out there, and the people who have them, I guess, are secretive people.

406
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:13,310
Rym:  So the other big one in France, there's a company, it's not clear what the company is, but the toilet they make is called The Water Throne, and it is designed to look like a floating black skull.

407
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,675
Rym:  Awesome.

408
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,810
Rym:  And the eyes light up when you open the lid.

409
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,490
Scott:  Maybe we just haven't seen it 'cause they're not on French internet.

410
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,248
Rym:  Maybe not.

411
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:27,489
Rym: These seem to be primarily of interest in Europe and the Middle East, and basically everywhere but the US.

412
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,950
Scott:  I just mean, if I'm making a haunted house, I'd put a few in there, right?

413
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:41,470
Rym:  Yep, it's hard to say what the demographic is if people are into this, but it seems to overlap with fart cars, and big bass, and nightclub life in particular.

414
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:56,950
Scott:  It would be really funny if you had one of those farms that made a corn maze hayride haunted house in October, but your toilets are there year-round, so you get all skull toilets, and then during apple picking season, this is in September, there's skull toilets.

415
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:02,690
Scott: Someone comes to pick something in the spring to come and get some whatever, and skull toilets.

416
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,708
Scott: It's like, yeah, those are for October, but there are toilets, so.

417
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:16,890
Rym:  So yeah, if you want a skoilet, this thread will show you all the luxury options you can pursue this dream of being able to poop and/or pee into a giant fake ceramic skull.

418
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,289
Scott:  All right, so my thing of the day.

419
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:26,209
Scott: I may have used this YouTube channel as the thing of the day a super long time ago, 'cause it seemed really familiar when YouTube recommended it to me.

420
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,090
Rym:  I'm already subscribed, so I'm pretty sure that's true.

421
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,550
Scott:  Yeah, but I got back into it, so it's called, it's Cracking the Cryptic.

422
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,070
Scott: If you haven't heard of it, you may have.

423
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:41,630
Scott: It has 400,000 subscribers, but it's like these puzzle experts, and they mostly solve Sudokus and do other things.

424
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,810
Scott: They were streaming Baba Is You, which is very puzzle adjacent, right?

425
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:49,390
Scott: But I know me, and also Rym, who likes puzzles even less than me, right?

426
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:53,410
Scott: But even me, I don't really like, I never really respected Sudoku that much, right?

427
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,730
Scott: I always felt like, you know, Picross is similar in that, yeah, you're just following this algorithm to solve the puzzle.

428
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:07,710
Scott: You're not developing an algorithm when you solve the puzzle, so it's just a process as opposed to a logic exercise.

429
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,950
Scott: And also, when you're done with the Picross, you got what, a grid of nine by nine numbers?

430
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:16,269
Scott: At least with the Picross, I mean, at least with Sudoku, you just have a grid of numbers.

431
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,650
Scott: With Picross, you get a nice picture.

432
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,989
Scott: There's like the surprise at the end.

433
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,070
Scott: It's a little more fun in that regard.

434
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:30,090
Scott: But on this channel, I discovered, I was like, oh, yeah, these people are like the best puzzler type people in the world.

435
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,530
Scott: Their whole community is puzzling.

436
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:33,130
Scott: They're Patreon puzzling, right?

437
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,290
Scott: It's sort of like lock-picking lawyer, right?

438
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,190
Scott: He picks a lock every day, and they solve a Sudoku every day, right?

439
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,009
Scott: Same kind of deal.

440
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,669
Scott: But regular old Sudoku's not enough for them, clearly, right?

441
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:49,870
Scott: They have taken the Sudoku to the next, the high, all the levels, right?

442
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:56,810
Scott: And I didn't, once I watched their videos, I was like, oh, and now my respect level went from negative to infinity positive.

443
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:01,768
Scott: Now it's like, whoa, I don't wanna do regular boring Sudoku, but I sure as hell wanna do those.

444
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:13,030
Scott: Basically, the way it comes down to is you have a Sudoku, and in normal classic Sudoku, mathematically, there has to be a certain number of pre-given numbers.

445
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,710
Scott: Otherwise, it's unsolvable, right?

446
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,410
Scott: There could be more than one possible solution to it.

447
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:29,750
Scott: So what you do to make Sudoku harder is you remove a bunch of numbers, and then you come up with some other rule set in addition to the regular Sudoku rule set, right?

448
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:31,830
Scott: They've got all these other ones.

449
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,590
Scott: They got, in this particular video, there's an XV rule set.

450
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:54,526
Scott: There's some that have thermo rule sets, arrow rule sets, cages, combinations of all of the above, all kinds of unique extra rule sets so that you often start out with no numbers at all or just a few numbers, and then you get really amazing puzzles that

451
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:54,910
Rym: are well worth it.

452
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,990
Rym:  Oh my God, this XV thing, I see what that is now.

453
00:38:58,995 --> 00:39:07,690
Scott: So the XV one, I pick this one for the thing of the day, although the whole channel is kind of the thing of the day, not because this is the best puzzle that was on the channel.

454
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:16,110
Scott: There are some other really, really good ones, but because this one involves Louis XV and is really amusing as well as being an amazing puzzle.

455
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:27,030
Scott: The last thing I wanna say about this channel is that the people who are on the channel solving the puzzles are, I wanna say, even better than lockpicking lawyer.

456
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:35,789
Scott: Maybe the best I've seen on YouTube in terms of doing a thing and explaining the thing they are doing at the same time.

457
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:44,670
Scott: It's like when he does, some of his videos, he'll do just a normal Sudoku in like 10 minutes, and he explains it in such a clear way.

458
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,050
Scott: You can totally follow all the logic, right?

459
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:53,970
Scott: And he matches his explanation to the level of difficulty of the puzzle.

460
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:59,930
Scott: And they also give you links in the video description so you can try the puzzle yourself first always.

461
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:01,570
Scott: And they make all their money.

462
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,109
Scott: Their business model is great.

463
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,790
Scott: They're selling puzzle apps that they made.

464
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,550
Scott: They got Patreon, which gets you puzzles, right?

465
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:22,970
Scott: It's like this is, I think, maybe, a lot of people, like I said, lockpicking lawyer, others are following this business model, but I think this is the perfect iteration of the 21st century business model, what they're doing here with these puzzles.

466
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,526
Rym:  Yeah, for sure.

467
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:31,790
Scott:  If you've got some kind of business going on that's any way like this, you wanna sort of copy what they're doing business-wise.

468
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:41,389
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book that we are powering through is "The Tale of Genji" as Genji sleeps and fucks his way through life.

469
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:42,956
Scott:  Hmm.

470
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,389
Rym:  That's pretty much what that book is about.

471
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,689
Rym: The longer you read it, it's just when and how.

472
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:55,030
Scott:  Yeah, moving right along, and I'm going outside less, reading more.

473
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:56,689
Scott: It's gonna happen.

474
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:58,109
Scott: It's been years.

475
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,849
Scott: There was a pandemic in addition to other issues.

476
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:08,370
Rym: Pandemic materially made us read a lot less because we're busy, and most of our reading was during travel.

477
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:44,084
Scott:  I do wanna say, though, that when this is done, maybe it might not be Rym's optimistic October, but I'm likely not going to work in December at all, or much at all, so December seems maybe likely, and then we can start fresh in 2022 with new books, and what's strange is that taking so long to read this book has given me guilt about reading any other book, and so, but I've had a hankering to read other books 'cause I've only read

478
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:44,550
Rym: this one book.

479
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,610
Rym:  I'm not looking as my book club book, which I think I shared with Scott already.

480
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,147
Rym: It's a good book.

481
00:41:48,530 --> 00:42:01,090
Scott:  All right, so I think once we finish this, I foresee, A, not picking such a long book again, picking but easier and fun, shorter books.

482
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,890
Rym:  B, no new global pandemic.

483
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,530
Rym: No brand new global pandemic, hopefully.

484
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,790
Scott:  Yeah, just the existing one.

485
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:27,229
Scott: So I foresee basically a rapid uptake in book club books, many of them, and then eventually we'll get back to, not that the rate was ever high, but the number of book club books per month of GeekNights, the rate will get back to where it was, we'll regress to the mean.

486
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:38,710
Rym:  But also don't forget, the entire book club is just online, like the episodes where we talked about the books, the full talk, even the forum threads, so you can pick any old book from the whole run of the book club up to this point.

487
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:45,750
Scott:  Yeah, if you haven't read some of the old book club books, you can go back and listen to the episodes, they're timeless.

488
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,110
Rym:  And we 100% support necromancy in our forum.

489
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:59,209
Rym: So if you read, I don't know, Player of Games, go find a forum thread, and if it's so old, it's only in the old forum, just make a brand new forum thread and keep the conversation going.

490
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,070
Scott:  Yeah, and link to the old one.

491
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,850
Rym: So yeah, otherwise, no conventions really coming up.

492
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,969
Rym: for obvious reasons, there's a global pandemic going on.

493
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:13,990
Rym: And today, with Facebook's outage, it's a good time to talk more generally about social media.

494
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:19,896
Rym: And I want to remind you about the leopard in space 2001, or 2001, colon, a space odyssey.

495
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:26,349
Rym: We talked about this when we did the book club book, is why I was thinking about it.

496
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,870
Scott:  Oh, look at that, look at that.

497
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,050
Rym:  Yeah, I'm bringing it around.

498
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:36,670
Rym: But the movie kind of left this subplot out, like it left out the detail that I think was very relevant to this conversation.

499
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:44,950
Rym: Because in 2001, the book, spoilers, I guess, the proto-humans learn how to use tools and weapons and hunt for the first time.

500
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,910
Rym: Now they have meat, they have more supplies of food.

501
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,128
Rym: And what happens?

502
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:56,590
Rym: A leopard breaks into their cave and almost kills them, almost ends this grand experiment in advanced technology.

503
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:04,610
Rym: A new technology brought definitive, objectively agreed upon boons, they had more food.

504
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:09,487
Rym: And it also brought unforeseen, unexpected, and new dangers.

505
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,349
Rym: The leopard actually came into our fucking house, that's never happened before, what do we do?

506
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,665
Rym: Social media is the leopard.

507
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:22,309
Rym: right now, just like in that book, AI was the leopard if you didn't get part of the main plot of that book.

508
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:37,450
Rym: So here we are, in the year 2021, it is very hard for anyone in the world to say that social media has been primarily a positive impact, especially even just on American society.

509
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,070
Scott:  Yeah, it's been a mixed bag, right?

510
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,585
Scott: So the way, the narrative that I see, 'cause I lived through all of it.

511
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,170
Scott:  Literally all of it.

512
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,823
Scott: We used Orca, the first one.

513
00:44:47,850 --> 00:45:02,548
Scott:  I'm qualified to say what the fuck happened, 'cause I was there the whole time, paying attention the whole time, is that in the 20th century, right, well I guess starting with the printing press, you finally had the ability to disseminate information widely, right?

514
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:11,265
Scott: And not just by word of mouth, and not just to a few wealthy, well even with the printing press, still just literate people, but eventually a lot of people were literate.

515
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,929
Rym:  It slowly democratized, it slowly expanded, it became ubiquitous.

516
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,970
Rym: 

517
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:44,730
Scott: Then you had your radio, your TV, all kinds of stuff, but even with all that in the 20th century, most of the 20th century, the ability to broadcast information widely was in the hands of a few, and it was still, even though there was freedom of speech, you needed, in order to broadcast your speech loudly, you needed a bigger megaphone, which cost money, and was regulated and centrally controlled to some extent.

518
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:50,930
Scott: You could have a local radio, but it's like, that's still, it's only broadcasting locally.

519
00:45:51,130 --> 00:46:04,470
Rym:  There were people doing these things, they were very much niche, like public access television, early live streams that were using not off the shelf, semi-bespoke technology, all these things were possible.

520
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:19,549
Scott:  Zines, someone copying their own VHS tapes, someone making mixed tapes on cassettes, but you couldn't, it was very hard to get wide distribution without, say, a record deal, and a giant company make prints a bunch of records for you.

521
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:51,550
Scott: In the late '90s, we got the internet, and finally, anybody, absolutely anybody, all you needed was a computer and an internet connection, which was much lower bar, could broadcast information and make it available to the whole world, but it was still difficult to do, you had to have specialized knowledge, even a GeoCities page, or a Myspace page, took some amount of skill and knowledge and effort, and something you want, right?

522
00:46:51,790 --> 00:47:06,430
Rym:  You have to imagine, when we were in high school, kids would teach each other HTML because they were like, I'm gonna make a website and post my thing, and that was secret knowledge that would be passed around.

523
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,990
Rym: I'm talking eighth, ninth, 10th grade for us.

524
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,569
Scott:  Yep, you can make a podcast, but who the hell was gonna listen to it?

525
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,190
Scott:  Yep.

526
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:22,028
Scott:  You can make a video of yourself, but it was just hosted on a web server, and someone would have to find it, and then download it.

527
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,830
Rym:  Moog recorded his Mega TF rant that only people who are in that one forum heard.

528
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:36,490
Scott:  Yep, so social media was basically, hey, we're gonna basically do the GeoCities thing, only make it way easier.

529
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,529
Scott: Facebook and whatnot, these things are actually kinda old.

530
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:50,510
Scott: Facebook came out when I was in college still, but at the time, you could only really use it with a big old desktop computer.

531
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,069
Scott: You had to know how to use it.

532
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:53,890
Scott: You couldn't do it wherever.

533
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:56,390
Scott: Maybe a laptop you could use it with maybe at the time.

534
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,408
Scott: Wi-Fi was a thing then.

535
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:58,190
Scott: Yeah, okay.

536
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:58,847
Scott:  Sort of.

537
00:47:59,952 --> 00:48:02,889
Rym: I remember, I couldn't afford a laptop, but I was in college.

538
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,849
Rym: Laptops were still pretty expensive to the point that-- - Oh yeah, I didn't have one, but other people did.

539
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:08,826
Scott: People had Power Mac G4.

540
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:14,410
Rym:  If I was on the other side of campus, and I wanted to get ahold of someone, we didn't even all have cell phones yet back then.

541
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:21,710
Rym: I would have to go to a lab, log in to AIM, and hope that whoever I wanted to talk to was also sitting at a computer.

542
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:22,689
Rym: Logged into AIM.

543
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:34,550
Scott:  So, and there were newsgroups, and forums, and BBSs, and all those things that were effectively social media of some kind, but they were only accessible to people who put in effort, right?

544
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:43,090
Scott: There were email, forward, newsletter things, all kinds of stuff, but their reach was still not that large.

545
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:58,290
Scott: It was people with the means, and the desire to seek them out, and get with them, so even though you could have, there were plenty with lots of misinformation, and other bad things going on, you know, it wasn't en masse, right?

546
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:05,470
Scott: It wasn't affecting all of society, and then the mobile phone came out, the smartphone, right?

547
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:14,270
Scott: The regular mobile phone had been around, and Twitter originally, the original Twitter, their idea, 'cause smartphones weren't a thing, was that it was SMS powered.

548
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:33,288
Scott: It would be a SMS thing, like you would tweet, you would send a text message to tweet to everyone who was following you, and they would get a text message, so you basically group texting, and then you would be getting all these group texts from one phone number, but everyone you followed, every time they texted, you would just get a text.

549
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:35,150
Scott: That was the original Twitter.

550
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:52,450
Scott: They thought it would be powered entirely by SMS, and it wasn't, it was thanks to basically, not just the iPhone, but the iPhone 3G, when they added the App Store, they could have a Twitter app, and then that's when they said, okay, you know, the SMS started to fade, and it was just app-based social networking.

551
00:49:52,670 --> 00:50:02,030
Scott:  Yup, and back then, like I didn't even use Twitter, but social media-- - It took me a little while to use it, but I used it still pretty early relative to most people.

552
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:02,273
Scott:  But

553
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:27,789
Rym: we're at this point now where there are very different kinds of social media, and I almost don't wanna talk as much today about like YouTube Twitch style live streaming compared to like the social media that's mostly built around a person's actual identity, like social media as in Twitter, Facebook, those kinds of equivalents where all of your communication is around an identity that many people, most people, tie to their real person.

554
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:32,297
Rym: Like not as much a brand, it's like Facebook.

555
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,390
Rym: is you on the internet, not me, 'cause I don't have a Facebook account, and I remember when Orkut first appeared.

556
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,170
Rym: It actually was the first social network like that.

557
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,748
Rym: It predated Facebook, and it was new.

558
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:54,189
Rym: I remember Scott and I and all of our friends were in college, and Orkut debuted in like January of 2000, what, five, four, I think it was four, and we were like, "Wait, what?

559
00:50:54,851 --> 00:51:00,210
Rym: "So I can just have my identity online, "tag all my friends, "and now we can have groups and share information.

560
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:02,570
Rym: "and like share photo albums and all this stuff.

561
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:03,469
Rym: "all into one place?

562
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,223
Rym: "Hell yeah, sign me up,".

563
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:05,950
Rym: and it was awesome.

564
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:14,210
Rym: For like six weeks, and then spam appeared on it out of nowhere, and then the platform just collapsed almost immediately.

565
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,890
Scott:  But it didn't collapse in Brazil, 'cause most of the spam was from Brazil.

566
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:24,830
Rym:  Yup, but basically, all these early social networks, Facebook and Orkut are the ones that are the most important to talk about.

567
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:36,310
Rym: They were both made without any thought as to how people would actually use these platforms when they were used by a wide range of people as opposed to a very small number of people.

568
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:44,070
Scott:  Right, well, I mean, Facebook's original goal was just like, "Hey, let's date college, "let's get college people to fuck," right?

569
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:44,661
Scott:  Yup.

570
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,470
Scott:  That was the goal of that.

571
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:55,710
Scott: It was college, when I saw Facebook for the first time, I think even when I made my account, it was like, "You could only sign up "with an EDU email address from a college.

572
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:59,609
Scott: "You had to be a college student, "otherwise you just weren't even allowed on Facebook,".

573
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,650
Scott: right, it wasn't open to the public.

574
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,117
Rym:  And I thought, "Well, I already have an Orkut, "why would I use

575
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:04,582
Rym: Facebook?".

576
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:10,281
Scott:  Right, and then the Orkut was just like, "Hey, we're just making this fun thing.

577
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:17,150
Scott: "so you can have fun with people, "either gathering with people you know "or people around a particular interest.

578
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,550
Scott: "with this fun little user interface," right?

579
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:27,701
Scott: Like Myspace, when they make those things, they didn't have a goal in mind, it was just sort of like, "Hey, this is a fun

580
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:28,909
Scott: application.".

581
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:29,241
Scott:  Yup.

582
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,350
Scott:  "Let's chat with people, right?

583
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:32,299
Scott: "Let's do

584
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,564
Scott: stuff.".

585
00:52:33,010 --> 00:53:13,390
Rym: So fast forward, what we learned from these networks, mostly, was that they did work okay without any guardrails or controls, as long as the communities and interactions within them were still very relatively segregated, but as they converged into a mass media type situation where everybody can see everything and everyone's interacting at scale, all these weird, unexpected, horrific, well, in many cases expected, but the people who expected them were ignored when they raised red flags and raised warnings, that there was this compounding of negative impacts, many of which we foresaw, many of which no one foresaw that are only accelerating.

586
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:44,063
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, you've just given the power that used to be only to broadcast information widely, something that was not possible for anyone who wasn't wealthy and/or regulated in the 20th century, and you just gave that ability to literally everybody, right, some teenage kid who just has a phone can now broadcast something as powerfully as the New York Times could in the '50s, right?

587
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:45,981
Rym:  Yep.

588
00:53:47,111 --> 00:53:49,429
Rym: So couple this with-- - That's dangerous shit.

589
00:53:50,010 --> 00:54:12,470
Rym:  So these platforms let anyone post anything, so of course, you've got the horse-paced eaters like posting their pro-horse-paced stuff now during COVID and anti-vaccination nonsense, but you also had a confluence of a lot of other technologies that really made this a problem, like algorithmic feed curation, like the advertising technology.

590
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:24,690
Scott:  Right, well, the original idea, right, 'cause it came from our Google Reader, right, it's like, okay, you have a lot of things you follow, right, and it's too much of a pain.

591
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:28,289
Scott: I used to go and be like, all right, web comics, open all in tabs.

592
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,028
Scott:  Tab, tab, tab, all right, there's 10 blogs.

593
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:35,889
Scott: I read, open all in tabs, is there anything new on this one, anything new on this one?

594
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:41,010
Scott: It's like checking every single, you know, your mail constantly, it's a pain in the butt, right?

595
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:48,750
Scott: Notifications and just combining them in one place is much more convenient, so Google Reader solved that problem, RSS solved that problem.

596
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,189
Scott: It's like, all right, I go to this one page, I refresh, and there's new stuff at the top.

597
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:58,010
Scott: Great, if some blog doesn't update for a month, I don't even go to it for a month.

598
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:58,323
Rym:  Yep.

599
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:11,850
Scott:  Perfect, so not only did the social media subsume sort of the, you know, replace like chatting, it also replaced, you know, not only the feed, but also the blog, right?

600
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:20,090
Scott: It's like, well, if I'm just gonna, you know, go on Twitter and put a link to my blog, I'll just make a Twitter thread in the first place.

601
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,450
Scott: Now I don't need the blog or the aggregate, right?

602
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:22,867
Scott:  Yep.

603
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:36,130
Scott:  So now you just go on to Twitter or Facebook or whatever you're using, and you follow everything you're interested in, and you doom scroll it, and it constantly updates, and you're getting all your info in one place, which is a good application.

604
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:38,247
Scott: That's what we want, right?

605
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:54,150
Rym:  Yep, but even if we forget the machine learning thing, so in the early days, before there was this algorithmic curation, and I saw there were a bunch of papers that showed this seems to apply to any kind of network, that Twitter was a good example that has the concept of retweeting or resharing.

606
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:08,950
Rym: The studies seem to show that if any one member of the node, like one node in the network, reshares something, then that thing materially becomes more likely to be reshared further because it got a boost, more people saw it.

607
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:32,110
Rym: But what that would mean in practice is that a small number of things, by mostly random chance, would become extremely widely shared to the exclusion of most other things, and this happens even if you make a fake network like Twitter, where every single fake account randomly decides what to like and retweet, you'll see the same effect.

608
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,526
Rym: A small number of things, like say, some of the early YouTube streamers who got really popular solely because of this effect.

609
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:49,210
Rym: probably, they randomly just get promoted by the fact that they happened to get promoted early, and were lucky in the random sea of the semi-random retweeting and resharing that happens.

610
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:57,470
Scott:  Well, that's the thing, is that the Google Reader, just the feed functionality, didn't have the resharing functionality.

611
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:02,430
Rym:  My reader was for me to read all the things I care about, not to share it with Scott.

612
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:12,330
Scott:  You personally choose what you want to see with intent, and you see only new content on channels that you have specifically chosen.

613
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,436
Scott: This is what we've wanted.

614
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:23,330
Scott: even before there was, we wanted to pay for cable TV and say, I want these channels, I only want to pay for those channels and I want any of the channels, right?

615
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:28,570
Scott: That's what we've always wanted, but that doesn't make anyone any fucking money.

616
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,029
Scott: You can't make money with that.

617
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,450
Rym:  So how does social media make money?

618
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:38,030
Rym: By pretty much selling your data or selling ads.

619
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,828
Scott: That's mostly it.

620
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:51,949
Scott: The thing is, is that even if you made what I suggested, you only follow things, most people wouldn't follow that many things.

621
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:52,590
Scott:  Nope.

622
00:57:53,270 --> 00:58:00,627
Scott:  People would follow their family and friends, and if your family and friends aren't big time posters, you're not gonna get a lot of content.

623
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:05,029
Scott: Only maybe a photo gallery now and then when someone has a party.

624
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,210
Rym:  Yep, so you're more likely to follow some celebrities and bigger topics.

625
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:16,350
Scott:  And the old Facebook days, the very old Facebook days when my family was on there, but it wasn't algorithmic yet.

626
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:23,910
Scott: Many years ago, it's like, I would open up Facebook and there would almost be nothing new 'cause I only followed my family and no one really posted anything.

627
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,227
Scott: So if no one's posting anything there, how often are you checking it?

628
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:27,650
Scott:  Yep.

629
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,569
Scott:  You're not, really.

630
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,809
Scott: And most people, so maybe you have a couple things you're interested in.

631
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,710
Scott: How often are those posting new content?

632
00:58:36,132 --> 00:58:38,710
Scott: Maybe you like metal and you follow five metal bands.

633
00:58:39,492 --> 00:58:41,530
Scott: How often does a metal band's album come out?

634
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,730
Scott: How much are they posting on there?

635
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:49,650
Scott: And if one of them starts posting too much, maybe of the five metal bands, four of them post when they have a new album and they're promoting it.

636
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:50,309
Scott: Okay, cool.

637
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,390
Scott: And one of them posts daily updates of in the studio, everything they're doing.

638
00:58:54,810 --> 00:59:00,425
Scott: Suddenly, you're following 30 things and one of them is taking up 90% of your feed.

639
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:02,190
Scott: 'cause it's not algorithmic.

640
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,210
Scott: It's just chronological, everything you follow in order.

641
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:07,190
Scott: And your whole feed is this one metal band.

642
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,610
Scott: You're like, shut the fuck up, one metal band.

643
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:11,230
Scott: I can't see my mom's whatever.

644
00:59:11,812 --> 00:59:12,590
Scott: It got buried.

645
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,670
Scott: So you unfollow that, right?

646
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:22,333
Scott: And so that's that scenario of what happens when you only have things you follow in reverse.

647
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:32,609
Scott: chronological order is not a lot of activity, people unfollowing things that are too active, people, if there's not a lot of activity on your feed, you don't need to open the app that much.

648
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,807
Scott: Maybe what, once a week, right?

649
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,509
Scott: How often you got, you can't sit there doom scrolling 'cause there's not a lot of stuff going on.

650
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:44,669
Rym:  And if they make their money via ads or selling your data, they need you to engage with the platform a lot in order to make that money.

651
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:49,270
Rym: So they're gonna do things to cause you to engage with the network more.

652
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:56,110
Scott:  Right, so the re-sharing is a huge one because now things are showing up in your feed that aren't things you follow.

653
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:03,830
Scott: There's something someone you follow follows and they've taken it from a feed that's two steps away and moved it all the way over to your feed, right?

654
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:13,970
Scott: So Rym likes hiking and I don't and he retweets a hiking thing 'cause he follows a hiking guy and now it's in my feed even though I don't give a shit about hiking, right?

655
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:23,283
Scott: And now suddenly my feed, 'cause I follow 20 things that I care about, is now filled not just with the 20 things I care about but the 20 things times 20, right?

656
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:25,639
Scott: So that's 400 things, right?

657
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,532
Scott: Yeah, 400?

658
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:33,808
Scott: Yeah, that's 400 things in my feed even though I only told them that I care about 20 things.

659
01:00:34,554 --> 01:00:35,910
Scott: And now suddenly I can doom scroll.

660
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:44,163
Rym:  Yep, they gotta get you to the point to where there is more content than you can consume so you won't think that much about.

661
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:45,170
Rym: did I miss anything?

662
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:47,410
Rym: Is something overrepresented in my feed?

663
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:52,780
Rym: And they wanna get you to like and retweet or whatever those options are.

664
01:00:52,821 --> 01:01:06,009
Rym: they have for you to engage because the more you interact, the more data they get about you, the more engagement they have to tell advertisers like yeah, look at all these eyeballs and the more your activity gets other people to doom scroll and repeat the process.

665
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:19,408
Scott:  Yep, now the second thing is what they're doing with the algorithms is not just sort of making sure there's always something to show you every time, getting as much stuff into your feed as they can so there's always something for you to look at.

666
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:26,670
Scott: In Instagram, which doesn't really have the retweet kind of thing, but also others, you get to the bottom, right?

667
01:01:26,914 --> 01:01:27,830
Scott: You've seen everything.

668
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:33,530
Scott: And when you get to the bottom, it just starts giving you suggestions, right?

669
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,090
Scott: And Twitter tried this with like.

670
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,810
Scott: here's people you should follow.

671
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,290
Scott: We recommend you follow the president.

672
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,790
Scott: We recommend you follow your favorite local sports team.

673
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,050
Scott: We recommend you follow your news anchor, right?

674
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:49,990
Scott: But that doesn't really sort of give you a sample of what following that person is like.

675
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:56,150
Scott: Instagram's just like oh, you've reached the end and it just starts showing, you can just keep scrolling and it's showing you shit you don't follow.

676
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:05,069
Scott: It's just giving you things the algorithm thinks you might like and it hopes that when you see a funny post down there, you'll follow it, right?

677
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:08,030
Scott: To increase what you follow and then learn more about you.

678
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,901
Scott: It doesn't just end like.

679
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:09,550
Scott: that's the end.

680
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:10,229
Scott: It's never the end.

681
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:10,989
Scott: There is no end.

682
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:16,150
Rym:  Now this all leads to, on one hand, as a user, these are almost dark patterns.

683
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:20,189
Rym: I'm being guided into behavior that I dislike that is unhealthy for me that I do not want.

684
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:22,370
Rym: Like the royal eye, I guess.

685
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:26,150
Rym: Like that's what, they're not catering to the users of the platform.

686
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:30,470
Rym: They're catering to the users of the monetization model of the platform.

687
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,390
Scott:  Yeah, if you're a user who's not paying anything, you're the product.

688
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:33,848
Scott:  Yep.

689
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:42,130
Rym: So if we back away from that aspect of it, just societally in general, I think what we've seen and people are talking about this more and more.

690
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,630
Rym: I've seen big threads lately that I'm not gonna address now of there was some zennial who was talking about like here's what millennials don't get about the internet.

691
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:53,550
Rym: and the funny part was they seem to think that no millennials ever use the internet.

692
01:02:53,910 --> 01:03:10,329
Scott: Like they seem to really, they have really an undue misunderstanding of like where technology actually is, - I mean, as a millennial, I'm gonna resent anyone else's opinion if they think that's how generations work, but at the same time--.

693
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,650
Scott:  This thread is right about something.

694
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:19,830
Scott:  Right, they definitely, being younger, they see it differently and I don't know how they see it and the way they see it is not invalid.

695
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:21,950
Scott: So I do wanna hear how they see it.

696
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:33,070
Rym:  So a big, a side part of that thread, one small part that did resonate is what they said was effectively we're the first generation to grow up online, but that's not what they meant.

697
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:46,710
Rym: What they actually meant was we're the first generation with social media because the big difference between our childhood and their childhood is literally we didn't share anything about ourselves online at all.

698
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,830
Rym: Like the online world was a different world.

699
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:55,350
Scott:  I mean, I did, but it was like GeoCities and I didn't share like that much, I would like share my--.

700
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,210
Scott:  I'll put it this way.

701
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,490
Scott:  I would write stupid opinion things about video games or whatever.

702
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,949
Rym:  Oh yeah, I did stuff like that, but guess what?

703
01:04:01,452 --> 01:04:04,910
Rym: Four people in my high school knew my GeoCities page existed.

704
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:08,770
Rym: My friends online, most of them didn't know what my real name was or where I lived.

705
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:13,590
Scott:  Yeah, I didn't write any, out of fear of the danger, I didn't write online.

706
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:16,729
Scott: Like you'd go into AOL chat rooms, they'd be like ASL.

707
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,065
Scott: It's like you might ASL, but you would never write my name.

708
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:21,950
Scott: is this, here's my address, right?

709
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:25,010
Scott: Or like, you know, like ASL was like the limit.

710
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:32,310
Rym:  But like, I would also-- - And the L would not be specific, it would be like U.S - When I was online-- - Connecticut.

711
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:39,209
Rym:  Depending on the context where I was online, I had different identities that were not traceable back to me.

712
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:40,230
Rym: No one could go find--.

713
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,670
Scott:  Not easily.

714
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:41,849
Rym:  Oh yeah, not easily.

715
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:47,269
Rym: It was definitely possible, but difficult, and also no one cared that much back then.

716
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:58,630
Rym: So whatever stupid crap I said, or bull viseo was bullied at school, that didn't follow me from the real world into the online world, and nothing I did in the online world followed me back into the real world.

717
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:02,290
Rym: That is not true for the generation after us.

718
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:08,950
Rym: The online world is right in their face, even if they're offline, and anything they do offline follows them online.

719
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:09,870
Rym: They can't escape from it.

720
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,979
Scott:  If Twitter came out in 2007, right?

721
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:19,030
Scott: If you're 14, 13, you could be tweeting right now, and Twitter is older than you.

722
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,650
Rym:  I already graduated college.

723
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:23,809
Rym: I already was at my second major job by then.

724
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,128
Rym:  Yeah.

725
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:29,650
Rym:  So now these kids, it's not that they're online.

726
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:43,950
Rym: It's that they grew up in a world where anything they do or say online is kind of tied directly to their own personal identity, that they are pressured to share things online, to not be left out of the way society functions,

727
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:45,236
Scott: and the

728
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:50,910
Rym: consequences of this have been terrifying and drastic and very difficult to understand so far.

729
01:05:51,790 --> 01:06:03,010
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, there are people who, it's like, you can think of it as like, you know, it's like this Twitter account, or whatever your social media account is, it's like on the one hand, it's this tool that's giving you that Google Reader feed.

730
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:03,333
Rym:  Yep.

731
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:03,519
Rym:  Right?

732
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:29,230
Scott: But it's also letting you know what all the people you care about are up to, and it's also when you post things, the collection of the things that you have cared enough to say and/or re-share, right, are now a stand-in, basically that collection of stuff is you, that is your avatar on that particular platform.

733
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,210
Scott: It's not an avatar like, you know, a 3D model.

734
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:34,929
Scott: It's an avatar, it's a whole feed of tweets.

735
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,408
Scott:  Yeah, they're-- - If someone comes and reads that, they're getting an image of you.

736
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:41,183
Scott: based on that, right?

737
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:52,410
Rym:  There was a Rym, and like a Necromancer14, and a Mephistopheles who had Final Fantasy V, all these different personas that were, like avatars that were out there.

738
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:54,430
Rym: Now, there's Rym Twitter.

739
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,850
Rym: That is just a Rym that's out there.

740
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,770
Rym: People know that's Rym.

741
01:06:58,172 --> 01:07:06,227
Scott: That Rym Twitter is just there for everyone to interact with and see for-- - And has some relation to the real Rym, but it's not the real, it's, you know, right?

742
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,730
Rym:  But it's a lot closer to the real Rym.

743
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:12,590
Scott:  You can't tell how, it's a lot harder to tell when that one's lying, at least.

744
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:18,024
Rym:  But it's also a lot closer to the real Rym than anything I ever did online before 2005 was.

745
01:07:20,056 --> 01:07:20,309
Scott:  Yep.

746
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:25,150
Rym:  So, that aspect of it is interesting, and we can't go too much longer.

747
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:25,870
Rym: This is gonna be too long.

748
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:41,590
Scott:  If you don't post anything, then there is no presence of you on the internet, which could be advantageous, but it's also disadvantageous in that, you know, you're sort of like a non-person.

749
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:42,568
Rym:  Well, I'll say this.

750
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:52,890
Rym: The game designers I am friends or acquaintances with who use Twitter, I talk to a lot and am very aware of what they're working on, even if we're just like mutuals or whatever.

751
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:58,449
Rym: Game designers who don't post a lot on Twitter, unless I go read an essay, I have no idea what the hell they're up to.

752
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:15,429
Scott:  Right, well, it's not just that, but you don't know, if you have two friends, right, and they're both close friends from school 'cause you're just some kid, and you, it doesn't matter how much you post, well, maybe you post a lot, okay, and you have another friend who posts a lot, and the second friend doesn't post a lot.

753
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:27,250
Scott: You spend time in person together, so you're pretty close, but you're gonna be closer with the other person who posts a lot because you have this whole, not only are your real selves interacting, your internet selves are interacting.

754
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,770
Rym:  Oh, my friends who don't use Discords.

755
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,850
Scott:  You're learning more about each other.

756
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:31,707
Scott: You know more about each other, right?

757
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:39,510
Rym:  Yeah, anyone I know who's not engaged with all the online social media I use, I just talk to way less in my life, full stop.

758
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:43,450
Rym: I even talk to my dad less than my mom 'cause my mom's more online than my dad.

759
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,430
Rym: Like, that happens.

760
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:52,529
Scott:  Yeah, it's like, I have friends who I care about a great deal, but who just aren't online as much, and I'm like, is that person still alive?

761
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,888
Scott: What do they, I don't know what they're up to, right?

762
01:08:55,452 --> 01:09:06,390
Scott: I don't know what they're doing these days, you know, unless I talk to them old school style, you know, I have to make an effort, or if they happen to reach out once in a while, right, it's just like a mystery.

763
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:13,149
Scott: But then the friends, even friends who I barely interacted with in real life, maybe like a convention friend.

764
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:16,250
Rym:  Well, like Daryl Surratt, like I talk to him a lot online.

765
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:21,029
Rym: I haven't seen him in person since like 2013.

766
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:31,288
Scott:  Right, some convention friend who happens to be more active on the same social activities as me and have mutual follows, right, I know what they're up to.

767
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:35,290
Scott: I grow closer to them, you know, because we're both active.

768
01:09:35,731 --> 01:09:42,370
Scott: So when you're not active, you become, right, like you're not as connected.

769
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:53,430
Scott: But if that's your only human connection, right, then you can get in like this dark world of loneliness where you're only having these sort of superficial internet human connections.

770
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,310
Rym:  Or even worse, parasocial internet relationships.

771
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,650
Scott:  Yeah, as opposed to actual ones, right?

772
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:03,250
Scott: Like say, okay, your two actual friends follow each other on Facebook and message all the time.

773
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:11,950
Scott: Okay, but now the only, but if you're really, your only people you follow are celebrity type people, Twitch streamers, who knows what, right?

774
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:17,330
Scott: So web comic artists, and you follow and tweet at them and not anyone else, right?

775
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:21,550
Scott: And that's, you're getting this sort of, you know, substitute human interaction that way.

776
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:21,936
Scott:  Yeah.

777
01:10:21,957 --> 01:10:22,509
Scott:  That's real bad.

778
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:26,150
Rym:  Oh, you could, that was the perfect opportunity to use one of my favorite words, Airsats.

779
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:28,652
Rym: (laughing) So.

780
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:30,230
Scott:  Airsats human interaction.

781
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:34,470
Rym:  But the last piece of all this, Airsats human interaction is actually kind of what I want to get into.

782
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:38,970
Rym: This is the broader, I think the fundamental thing, and I might be wrong, this is my personal opinion.

783
01:10:39,091 --> 01:10:39,750
Rym: You may even disagree.

784
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,990
Rym: I don't think we've talked about this much.

785
01:10:41,070 --> 01:11:06,309
Rym: I think the primary, well, one of the primary problems with social media right now, aside from the fundamental problems of capitalism, is that because social media is one big platform or a series of effectively one big platforms all next to each other, all conversations are decontextualized from communities and now have to weather the storm of every fucko online having an opinion about some random thing you said.

786
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,993
Scott: So.

787
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:08,550
Scott:  It depends on which network you're using.

788
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,730
Rym:  Yeah, but say you're on Twitter and you post.

789
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,490
Scott:  And how you're using it.

790
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,430
Rym:  You post a picture of, you cooked a nice meal.

791
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,490
Rym: You cooked, I don't know, I made bibimbap.

792
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,529
Rym: Like, I just made a bibimbap.

793
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:16,638
Rym: You'll get people.

794
01:11:16,658 --> 01:11:19,624
Rym:  A vegan comes up and is-- - You'll get a vegan who comes in and says, "Hey, that's

795
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:20,028
Rym: unethical.".

796
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:25,590
Rym: You'll get someone who says that cooking that food is appropriative at face value.

797
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:27,490
Rym: You'll get someone who says you cooked it wrong.

798
01:11:27,831 --> 01:11:29,510
Rym: You'll get someone who says you cooked it right.

799
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:34,043
Rym: You'll get someone who says, "Well, what you're not talking about this other kind of food, are you

800
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:34,427
Rym: racist?".

801
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:56,737
Rym: You'll get all this stuff decontextualized from the conversation you would have about that same topic among a group of people who have at least passing familiarity with each other and a passing marginal sense of good faith among those people, which is why I think a lot of younger people have backed away from a lot of social media networks and are increasingly going into

802
01:11:57,782 --> 01:11:58,183
Scott: walled

803
01:11:58,344 --> 01:12:02,029
Rym: off communities in discords where forums used to be.

804
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:15,130
Rym: Because then that's like social media where you have a community that itself is talking about topics, tends to behave very differently from social media where you have the world talking about topics publicly.

805
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:20,870
Rym: I don't have a lot of opinions on that about what to do about it or where to go next or anything.

806
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:25,929
Rym: I hate the fact that forums disappeared and got replaced by discord because it doesn't solve the same problem.

807
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:28,630
Rym:  But the subreddits, subreddits are just forums.

808
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:33,690
Rym:  But subreddits are still public in that the community is about the topic.

809
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:34,730
Rym:  Our forum's public.

810
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:42,190
Rym:  Yeah, I think our forum was for a long time until forums started to decline and a lot of the cool people left and we brought them back via discord.

811
01:12:42,911 --> 01:13:00,050
Rym: Our old GeekNights forum was an example of a community that is a generic community that is ostensibly on one thing but then has other conversations in the context of that community as opposed to having conversations free of all context or conversations with the sole context of the specific topic.

812
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:04,770
Rym: Neither of those two other ways I think produce productive conversations online today.

813
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:15,670
Scott:  Also the small community doesn't give you like, note with the small communities, nobody has this power of extreme broadcast.

814
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:16,201
Scott:  Yeah.

815
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:31,970
Scott:  If the whole internet world is divided into a bunch of discord servers and like that or subreddits, it's like you can't post, maybe there's a big subreddit but like you can't post something onto every single subreddit at once the way you can tweet to the whole world.

816
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,104
Scott: Now of course you tweet, not everyone's following you but there's that retweet.

817
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:36,810
Scott: that can happen.

818
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:43,910
Rym:  Well like one of the Yahtzee locals retweeted my support of them and then a whole bunch of people started interacting with me because of that today.

819
01:13:44,313 --> 01:13:46,230
Rym: That doesn't happen in the world we just described.

820
01:13:47,593 --> 01:14:05,590
Rym: But what does happen then is that you have a network of, I know something, say we have some conclusion about some political thing in our little like sharted off community, each of us are in multiple communities, we talk about that in those other communities and you have a more traditional grassroots spreading of information.

821
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,430
Scott:  Yeah but there are downsides to that also, right?

822
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,870
Scott: So let's say you're in the tech community, right?

823
01:14:12,055 --> 01:14:16,010
Scott: And it's like okay, the big thing you work on is database stuff.

824
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:19,170
Scott: so you're in the Postgres community big time, right?

825
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:25,050
Scott: But you also, you happen to code in Rust, that Rust language, right?

826
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:28,149
Scott: But you're not like into Rust, it's just the language you use.

827
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:36,350
Scott: You're not like in the Rust community but like if all those communities are like really strongly separated which they kinda are a little bit.

828
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:43,530
Scott: but there are also like tech news feeds that are just like fire hoses of everything going on in the world of tech, right?

829
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:46,830
Scott: So you're finding out about all this other stuff going on, right?

830
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:52,510
Scott: Like if there's a new language, you would never hear about it if you're only in the Postgres community, right?

831
01:14:52,690 --> 01:15:14,370
Scott: So you sort of, sometimes you need that worldwide broadcast aggregation because even though it's giving you a bunch of crap, it's also if you were in little silos, even if you're in many silos, that increases your odds but you're just not gonna get some of those golden nuggets that are only in the giant fire hose feed.

832
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:15,386
Rym:  Yup.

833
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,310
Rym: So what does your society do?

834
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:19,408
Rym: I don't know.

835
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:23,810
Rym: Social media is more dangerous than most people anticipated.

836
01:15:24,351 --> 01:15:28,850
Rym: It's under mostly the control of very large corporations that do not have your interest at heart.

837
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,050
Scott:  They only have a capitalist interest at heart.

838
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:31,268
Rym:  Yup.

839
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:35,009
Rym: Governments have almost no interest in doing anything about any of this.

840
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:40,629
Scott:  I think there is some interest in some governments but not enough political will.

841
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:41,128
Rym:  Yup.

842
01:15:41,374 --> 01:15:49,830
Rym: And meanwhile, the governments who are taking the most actions are actually doing the opposite and suppressing very good conversation that happens to be critical of their regimes.

843
01:15:51,310 --> 01:16:09,030
Scott:  Yeah, so I think that number one, the ability to broad, for anyone, literally anyone, to broadcast information very, very widely, especially dangerous information, right, I personally think needs to be regulated despite freedom of speech.

844
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:12,310
Scott: And also, I personally, I know that the law doesn't agree with this.

845
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:13,769
Scott:  Shut up all you lawyers, I know.

846
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:27,430
Scott: But I personally feel that under the existing idea of shouting fire in a crowded theater, right, a lot of things that people, if you tweet something, right, that's the same as crowded theater.

847
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,690
Scott: It's the same as shouting.

848
01:16:29,273 --> 01:16:36,427
Scott: And if it's a lie and it's a dangerous lie, that seems to meet the criteria in the book of God.

849
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:37,350
Rym:  Yeah, I agree.

850
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:46,050
Rym: I would argue that commercial speech is not free and should be heavily regulated, which already eliminates like a third of the problems with social media.

851
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,149
Rym: 'Cause like the horse paste stuff, you know where that came from?

852
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:51,269
Rym: People selling the fucking horse paste.

853
01:16:52,013 --> 01:16:53,710
Rym: Commerce, not free speech anymore.

854
01:16:54,130 --> 01:17:04,270
Scott:  You could also argue that since your tweet is being used for commercial purposes by Twitter, that even though you tweeted it because Twitter is using it for commerce, it's therefore commercial speech.

855
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,530
Scott: Legal arguments I don't care about.

856
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:15,070
Scott: I'm just saying in principle, right, I think there should be regulation of speech that is broadcast so widely that it could be dangerous.

857
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,770
Scott: There needs to be regulation on that.

858
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:19,209
Scott: I don't care about free speech purism in that case.

859
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:20,349
Scott:  Two, hate speech.

860
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,430
Scott:  I'm not saying put someone in jail because they're racist.

861
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:29,530
Scott: I'm saying stop them from saying things that are broadcast widely if those things are dangerous lies.

862
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,170
Rym: Like case in point, all this COVID stuff.

863
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:38,429
Scott: Two, essential communication mechanisms like we said during the news.

864
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:42,430
Scott: If something is so big, it becomes an essential communication mechanism.

865
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:44,970
Scott: The only way my family can talk is with WhatsApp.

866
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:49,330
Scott: That needs to be nationalized or at least regulated as a utility.

867
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:53,989
Scott: It shouldn't be something run by a company with a capitalist interest.

868
01:17:55,434 --> 01:18:03,510
Scott: If we need Twitter to get the news, then Twitter needs to be at least regulated to the point like the FCC regulated the news on television.

869
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,922
Rym:  Yep.

870
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:09,049
Scott: And for you-- - I think that alone goes a really long way.

871
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,646
Rym:  And how about for you day to day?

872
01:18:12,551 --> 01:18:16,010
Rym: My only advice to you out there using social media is really simple.

873
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:21,850
Rym: Block any account that even looks at you crosswise and never regret it.

874
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:26,710
Rym: That is probably the single most important thing you can do for whatever social media platform you use.

875
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,950
Rym: You gotta racist uncle, block 'em.

876
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,870
Rym: Just block 'em and walk away from their Facebook interactions.

877
01:18:32,395 --> 01:18:35,089
Rym: You got a friend who's eating the horse pace, block 'em.

878
01:18:35,851 --> 01:18:40,250
Rym: And if you do that, social media will be a lot less toxic for you personally.

879
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,670
Scott:  If you go to Reddit, Reddit's a shithole.

880
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,308
Scott: But you know what I do?

881
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:47,110
Scott: You make an account and then you unsubscribe from every single Reddit that's on there.

882
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:52,790
Scott: So you get a blank homepage and then you subscribe only to the Reddits that you really care about.

883
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:53,828
Scott: You're really into K-pop?

884
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,989
Scott: Okay, Reddit K-pop.

885
01:18:55,854 --> 01:18:57,250
Scott: I really like BTS.

886
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:58,708
Scott: All right, well there's a Reddit BTS.

887
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,349
Scott: You can get that one in there too.

888
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:02,710
Scott: And then you really like Minecraft.

889
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:03,770
Scott: So get the Reddit Minecraft.

890
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:04,909
Scott: That's it, stop.

891
01:19:05,493 --> 01:19:08,870
Scott: As soon as you're done with things you care about, don't add any more, right?

892
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,424
Scott: Minimize, these days--.

893
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,610
Rym:  What the fuck?

894
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,229
Rym: There might be breaking news about Taiwan, but keep going.

895
01:19:15,313 --> 01:19:16,389
Rym: There's some shit going down.

896
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,510
Scott:  We'll check that after we're done with this.

897
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,008
Rym:  Taiwan is preparing for a potential war with China after a series of increasingly aggressive military actions.

898
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,070
Scott:  Yep, what else is--.

899
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,748
Rym:  That's breaking news right now.

900
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,169
Rym: DVD on what's going on there.

901
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,850
Rym: I'm gonna do some reading after the show.

902
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,390
Scott:  It's 'cause Facebook went down.

903
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:34,510
Scott: They couldn't, the communications broke down.

904
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:40,650
Scott: So yeah, just to end the show before there is a war, World War III or whatever.

905
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:45,350
Scott: I hope that's not a prescient end to a podcast.

906
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,309
Rym:  Yeah, I hope not.

907
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:51,149
Rym: I hope this news is not nearly as big as what my feed is implying right now.

908
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,790
Scott:  Feeds, exaggerating a lot, right?

909
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,210
Scott: There was a lot of hoo-ha that was wrong about the Facebook thing today in the feed.

910
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,910
Scott: If you believed everything you read, right?

911
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:04,770
Scott: But yeah, I recommend unfollowing.

912
01:20:04,931 --> 01:20:08,690
Scott: I've only been unfollowing lately and not adding new followers.

913
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:11,890
Scott: I've been unsubscribing and not adding subscribers.

914
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:23,310
Rym:  Every time my Twitter feed gets too long for me to just read all of it, with obvious exceptions, like if I'm in the woods for a weekend or something, I just start unfollowing people until I can read the whole thing.

915
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:31,010
Scott:  My current criteria is basically, let's say I'm following something like a Gundam account.

916
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:37,850
Scott: I like Gunplas, I like Gundams, and I have a bunch up there behind me, but how often do I really build those?

917
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,169
Scott: How into it am I?

918
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:42,550
Scott: It's not my top five geekeries even, right?

919
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:44,229
Scott: I'm not into it that much.

920
01:20:44,992 --> 01:20:46,690
Scott: So, unfollow it, right?

921
01:20:46,952 --> 01:20:48,710
Scott: I don't need a constant feed of Gundam stuff.

922
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:50,109
Scott: I'm not that into it.

923
01:20:50,634 --> 01:20:52,010
Scott: Once in a while, but you know.

924
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:57,550
Scott: Bicycle stuff, on the other hand, is one of my top two, maybe top three at worst, right?

925
01:20:58,114 --> 01:20:59,009
Scott: Maybe even number one.

926
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:06,749
Scott: But a lot of bicycle stuff, I was following it, okay, good, but it wasn't, it's like, was it helping me?

927
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,229
Scott: Was it bettering my life?

928
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:11,530
Scott: It's like, I already have all the bicycle equipment I need.

929
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:14,409
Scott: I don't need to be sold anything, and there's nothing for me to learn.

930
01:21:14,991 --> 01:21:16,670
Scott: I'm not trying to be a pro cyclist.

931
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,247
Scott: I don't need bike coaching, right?

932
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,550
Scott: Or I don't care about fitness nonsense.

933
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:25,210
Scott: So, none of the bike information feeds had anything to offer me.

934
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:27,049
Scott: They weren't bettering my cycling.

935
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:29,230
Scott: I didn't need any more stuff.

936
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:33,129
Scott: So, I just unfollowed almost every bicycle thing, except for the ones that are like, fuck cars.

937
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:35,308
Rym:  One thing I will do-- - That's what I need, to fuck cars.

938
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:41,750
Rym:  In the destroy them sense, not in the planes, online, internet poisoning sense, I hope.

939
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:45,710
Scott:  Oh, maybe both senses, but regardless, right?

940
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:46,210
Scott:  Depends on the car.

941
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:50,430
Scott:  I recommend you strongly just go through all your things.

942
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:56,710
Scott: I've been doing this, I'm gonna do it for my third time, and just really cut back big time.

943
01:21:57,070 --> 01:22:22,030
Rym:  But too, as an aside there, when there's an emergent event, like right now, the IATSE strike that's coming, or when the Black Lives Matter marches in New York we're constantly organizing on a daily basis, I will often follow a lot of activists or people related to something I'm trying to help with or interact with during a crisis or an incident, and then I'll unfollow them later, or curate that feed back down later.

944
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:29,583
Rym: Like right now I followed a whole bunch, I followed all the IATSE locals, 'cause I really wanna stay on top of the strike that they voted to approve.

945
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:37,390
Rym: actually today, that's other big news we didn't get to talk about, to the point that the words breaking news are trending on Twitter because of all this shit that's happening today.

946
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:55,309
Rym:  Well-- - But seriously, unfollow and block like anything that looks at you crosswise or makes you unhappy and your life will be a lot better, and we as a society are gonna need decades to sort out whether or not humans are capable of using social media safely.

947
01:23:00,651 --> 01:23:02,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

948
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:07,930
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

949
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:13,290
Scott:  Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

950
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:16,229
Rym:  Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

951
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:21,009
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

953
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:31,870
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

954
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:58,770
Rym:  And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Egy, Dreadlily, Tenebrae, Chris Rimer, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, KaShiHi85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, Taylor Braun, UndergroundProLaw, Ed O. Pierce, RightSeed, EbbThread, Open, You Hold The Key To My Heart, and a ton of people who do not want me to say their names.

955
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:02,830
Rym: Yes, as many of you reacted, I did, in fact, get an iPhone.

956
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:04,329
Rym: I'm using one right now.

957
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:06,790
Rym: Pretty much the same as Android at this point.

958
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:12,470
Rym: They fixed all the things that made it different, and the hardware's better because Sony doesn't make small smartphones anymore.

959
01:24:13,191 --> 01:24:20,087
Rym: So yeah, I'll talk about what it was like to shift at some point, probably a future Monday episode, but for now, I leave you with.

960
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:25,450
Rym:  This can all be over if you just tell me what your bridge crew did.

961
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:26,930
Scott:  We can't tell you.

962
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:27,358
Rym:  Why, why?

963
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,588
Rym:  Because we don't know.

964
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:30,828
Rym: We never know anything.

965
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:35,180
Rym:  We're lower decks.

966
01:24:35,521 --> 01:24:37,560
Rym: No one ever tells us what's going on.

967
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,079
Rym:  We're not important enough to have anything to lie to you about.

968
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,078
Scott:  You're Starfleet.

969
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,820
Rym: Surely you must be briefed on every contingency.

970
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,818
Scott:  Yeah, I wish.

971
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,760
Scott: The senior officers don't always have time to keep us up to speed.

972
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:50,258
Rym: Hell, sometimes they don't even know what's going on.

973
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:51,459
Scott:  Impossible!

974
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,018
Scott: Human lies!

975
01:24:54,863 --> 01:24:57,820
Scott: You are the best of the best!

976
01:24:58,141 --> 01:25:01,820
Rym: Your senior officers are always in full control.

977
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:02,979
Rym:  No, they're not.

978
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:04,860
Rym: They mess up all the time.

979
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:07,079
Rym: Like whenever Q shows up.

980
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,039
Rym:  Shut up.

981
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:08,515
Rym:  Voila!

982
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,457
Rym:  Damn you, Q!

983
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,018
Rym:  There he is.

984
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:15,640
Rym: Hey, buddy.

985
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,659
Rym:  We're half of Ransom's alien dates that he doesn't do any research for.

986
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:22,200
Rym:  You are so funny, Marianne.

987
01:25:22,381 --> 01:25:24,360
Rym: How about we keep this party going in my quarters?

988
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,259
Scott:  Hey, hey, Jack.

989
01:25:25,561 --> 01:25:27,060
Scott: FYI, you're hitting on a salt vampire.

990
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:27,900
Rym:  Yeah, right.

991
01:25:27,981 --> 01:25:28,438
Rym: Nice try.

992
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,820
Scott: Salt vampires died out more than a century ago.

993
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,380
Rym:  All right.

994
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:32,240
Rym: Cool, be safe.

995
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,460
Scott:  Come on, Marianne.

996
01:25:33,622 --> 01:25:34,300
Scott: Let's get out of here.

997
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,280
Scott: I'll give you the tour of Casa de Ransom.

998
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:38,969
Scott:  Ah!

999
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:39,839
Scott: Salt vampire!

1000
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,780
Scott:  You're making this up.

1001
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,120
Scott:  Nah, I read all their logs.

1002
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,380
Scott: They're stepping in it all the time.

1003
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:45,520
Scott:  Captain.

1004
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:50,019
Rym: Captain, someone's replacing everyone on the ship with imposters who claim not to know me.

1005
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,600
Rym: We might be in a parallel dimension.

1006
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,798
Rym:  And you are?

1007
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,660
Rym:  Uh, wait, is this, is this not the Cerritos?

1008
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,420
Rym:  This is the Alhambra.

1009
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,199
Rym: Did you get on the wrong ship?

1010
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,539
Scott:  (beep) They all look the same.

1011
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,358
Rym:  Why are you doing this to me?

1012
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:08,500
Rym: I need you to tell me that your senior officers are infallible heroes.

1013
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,038
Rym:  Well, they're not.

1014
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:11,340
Rym: And that's okay.

1015
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:14,819
Rym: We all joined Starfleet to dive head first into the unknown.

1016
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,018
Rym: We're explorers.

1017
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,219
Rym: Of course we don't always know what's going on.

1018
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,939
Rym: Did Picard know about the Borg?

1019
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,860
Rym: Did Kirk know about that giant Spock on Phylos?

1020
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:23,584
Rym: Did Dr.

1021
01:26:23,665 --> 01:26:27,900
Scott: Crusher know about that ghost in the lamp thing from the Scottish planet that she hooked up with that one time?

1022
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:28,560
Rym: That whole thing.

1023
01:26:28,781 --> 01:26:34,560
Rym: You clearly want us to say that the captain and her crew messed up, but we simply don't have the full story.

1024
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:35,978
Rym: And that's the truth.

1025
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:39,120
Rym: Whatever they did, I guarantee you it was all for good.

1026
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,440
Rym: You have shown no evidence that they're guilty of a crime.

1027
01:26:41,742 --> 01:26:46,620
Rym: In fact, I find you guilty of trying to take them down with the sham of a trial.

1028
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,760
Rym: Drumhead!
