1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,779
Rym: It's Wednesday, November 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,160
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:13,629
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,893
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:21,310
Rym: Tonight, we are going to give our final spoiler-filled thoughts on the Rebuild Evangelion movies.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,187
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:34,990
Rym: So, uh, as you all know, I hope by now you have two, at least two or one, if it was the Johnson & Johnson COVID shots in your body.

8
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:39,630
Rym: If you're in America, there's literally no excuse to have not gotten them unless you have a medical reason, of course.

9
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:42,017
Rym: But we're hitting into the booster season.

10
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,190
Rym: And at least in New York, they just changed the rule.

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,650
Rym: So any adult over 18.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,468
Scott: So the rule is if you go ask for one, your doctor shouldn't say no.

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,938
Scott: And it's like, well, that doesn't help me, right?

14
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:58,062
Scott: It's like, you got to tell me.

15
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,210
Scott: It's like, yeah, I can get one now.

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:00,712
Scott: Okay.

17
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:02,116
Scott: But should I?

18
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,364
Scott: I need a doctor to tell me if I should.

19
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:05,809
Scott: It's like, you know, I don't know.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,149
Rym: The New York guidance was pretty much if you're an adult over 18 and it's been six months, you can do it.

21
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:12,417
Rym: You can.

22
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,990
Scott: Can is different from should.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,194
Rym: Yeah, I just will.

24
00:01:15,254 --> 00:01:17,425
Rym: There's a surplus of shots available.

25
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:18,470
Rym: So it's not like I'm taking one.

26
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,796
Scott: I mean, that's not a problem, right?

27
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:21,885
Scott: But it's still, it's like, should you?

28
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,009
Scott: Do you need to?

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,652
Rym: Yeah, you.

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,010
Rym: probably there's a lot of evidence that immunity from all the vaccines wanes over time.

31
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:31,290
Rym: And that seems to be a big part of the rise in infections in Europe.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,602
Scott: Well, then how come they don't just come out and say I should get?

33
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:34,990
Scott: they said I should I just go get it.

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,974
Scott: I'd be like, oh, OK.

35
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:40,069
Scott: But if they're saying you can, it's like, you know, well, now I don't know if I should.

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,619
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty much going to get it because I can.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,166
Rym: So I'm getting it next Monday.

38
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,090
Rym: I got an appointment.

39
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,990
Scott: I mean, I guess, you know, my doctor like the same policy I had.

40
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,722
Rym: I asked one medical, I asked one medical, like, hey, should I get it?

41
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,807
Rym: They were like, absolutely do it.

42
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,276
Scott: I guess I could ask my actual doctor.

43
00:01:56,356 --> 00:02:01,310
Scott: But, you know, last time I waited and without any prompting whatsoever, my doctor was like, come get it.

44
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,798
Scott: And now, well, there's been no such promptings.

45
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,389
Rym: I have in my entire adult life never been to the same doctor more than once.

46
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:17,070
Scott: I'm going to why I went to this one doctor, like, I guess after I moved to the city.

47
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,072
Scott: So I guess oh, nine.

48
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,135
Scott: Right.

49
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:19,916
Scott: Or maybe.

50
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:20,397
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,079
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

52
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,930
Scott: And that since late 2000s, I went to a doctor at this office, NYU office.

53
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,904
Scott: And then the doctor, like, was the best doctor ever saw.

54
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:31,390
Scott: Regular doctor, at least.

55
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,598
Scott: And then, like, I only saw him twice.

56
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,810
Scott: And then he went away to Florida to become like a big medical director.

57
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,379
Scott: And I was like, I guess he was too good a doctor.

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,150
Rym: Oh, what happened to me was every.

59
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:45,530
Scott: And then I just kept going to the same office and I just got shifted to another doctor in the same office.

60
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:46,253
Scott: And he's OK.

61
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,610
Scott: But I've been seeing that one doctor for, you know, many years.

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,910
Rym: See, I used to have an HSA like back when, you know, before Obamacare and ACA.

63
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,790
Rym: So I really never went to the doctor unless I was sick and I got a physical like every few years.

64
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:06,970
Rym: So every time I went to get a physical, whatever doctor had been my PCP had left the practice and I had to start all over with a new doctor.

65
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:12,230
Rym: And then I changed insurances and my doctor didn't take the insurance multiple times.

66
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,113
Rym: So that kept happening.

67
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:18,271
Rym: And then now in these times, I started getting a physical every year because I'm approaching 40.

68
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:24,529
Rym: And every single year, my PCP either stops being a doctor or like leaves the practice and I get a new doctor every single time.

69
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:29,050
Scott: Pretty sure my doctor is still there because he's still in the app from the office.

70
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,600
Rym: But even my doctor now said, yeah, you don't really need a physical every year.

71
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,844
Rym: There's nothing.

72
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,569
Rym: there is nothing wrong with you whatsoever.

73
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,733
Rym: She was like.

74
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,005
Rym: I was like, can I get a get a colonoscopy?

75
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:39,990
Rym: Like I'm approaching 40.

76
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,759
Rym: She was like, no, not at all.

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,609
Rym: There is literally no reason for you to do anything.

78
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,370
Rym: So, yeah, I might change doctors again just to get some.

79
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:54,950
Scott: I usually tell the doctor, you know, usually when I go to the doctor, they're like, I'm like, there's things wrong with me.

80
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,775
Scott: And they're like, no, there isn't.

81
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,170
Rym: Yeah, well, I don't know.

82
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:06,070
Rym: I have nothing wrong with me except some sports medicine stuff, but I have a separate doctor for sports medicine because of a program my insurance does.

83
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,592
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:08,770
Rym: But this is not to help you if you're sick or anything.

85
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,963
Rym: This is literally like medically driven sports, like athlete training stuff.

86
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,490
Rym: so I can get like my knee worked on and do running clinics.

87
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:23,729
Rym: I haven't done any of that because covid, but probably next year I'll start going into that clinic once a week to do like running studies and things.

88
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:25,692
Rym: Anyway.

89
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:25,793
Rym: Yeah.

90
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,789
Rym: Anyway, we got some news anime NYC.

91
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:31,394
Scott: Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,604
Scott: Anime NYC is happening this weekend.

93
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:34,509
Scott: We're not going there.

94
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:41,510
Scott: No, it's in the Javits Center and is a lot of good stuff that's happening there.

95
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,829
Scott: There's like there's another Bell preview screening, but I think it's separately ticketed.

96
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:46,813
Scott: So you have to.

97
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,840
Scott: I don't know if you need an anime NYC ticket.

98
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,542
Scott: I think you do.

99
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,990
Scott: And then you need to get the Bell ticket in addition.

100
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,890
Rym: We have never been to anime NYC.

101
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,121
Scott: I think they've got a My Hero Academia music guy.

102
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,446
Scott: He's like a big guest.

103
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:00,610
Scott: People are excited about.

104
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,709
Rym: That's a big show that I kind of bounced off of.

105
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:10,288
Scott: But yeah, there's a. you know, if you look at the anime NYC like stuff, it's like, damn, this shit is for real.

106
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:15,250
Rym: We have not been to anime NYC, but we have seen how it goes.

107
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,270
Rym: We've I know people who have gone to it and we know a lot of people work on it.

108
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,693
Rym: We know a lot of people who work on it.

109
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:27,450
Rym: And it's basically like a who's who of who knows how to fuck to run a convention from like the world.

110
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,717
Rym: Like it's kind of amazing the team they got together.

111
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:34,050
Rym: So all indications are this is like one of the best top tier anime cons there is.

112
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:35,813
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

113
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:43,010
Scott: But if you're a person who feels safe going to a convention in the New York City Javits Center this weekend, literally.

114
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:51,690
Rym: Yeah, the 19, 20, 21, you know, you got to be vaccinated, which is a plus and masking and like all the right stuff.

115
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,652
Rym: They're doing what they have.

116
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,941
Scott: It's right on the front of their website, all their policies and such.

117
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,665
Rym: So, yeah.

118
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,329
Scott: Yeah, there it is.

119
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:05,181
Rym: So in some other news, I'm not I'm still I'm not reserving judgment until I see it.

120
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:09,110
Rym: I'm going to watch the new Cowboy Bebop, obviously, so we can talk about it.

121
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,370
Scott: But something I held off my cancellation of Netflix just to watch that show.

122
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,707
Scott: And then as soon as I watch it, I'm going to cancel it because I'm on HBO Max right now.

123
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,491
Rym: Yep.

124
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:19,873
Rym: Same.

125
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,670
Rym: I switched HBO Max mostly because of Dune, but there's a ton of other stuff I want to watch there.

126
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:31,590
Rym: So Netflix, as soon as I finish Cowboy Bebop and we're watching the last season of Lupin, not Lupin the Third, but Lupin, that French show.

127
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,013
Scott: Yeah, I was going to watch that.

128
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:39,310
Scott: But once I learned that it was like had more seasons, I'm like, well, I'll just go back to Netflix when it's all got more seasons and watch it.

129
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,614
Rym: It's real good, though.

130
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:42,703
Rym: And I think I think the season we're watching is the end.

131
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,410
Rym: I haven't checked, but it's good.

132
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,193
Scott: Oh, OK.

133
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,359
Rym: I'll confirm for you.

134
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,510
Rym: So you'll know because then you could binge it before you shut off Netflix.

135
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:48,952
Rym: Yeah.

136
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,381
Scott: There's a lot of shows, for example, like Dragon Prince.

137
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:53,690
Scott: So I'm like, well, they said Dragon Prince is going to be eight seasons or so.

138
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,813
Rym: I can wait now.

139
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,799
Scott: That's like, well, I can cancel Netflix.

140
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,390
Scott: And then once season eight comes out, I'll turn Netflix back on and watch it, you know.

141
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:00,991
Scott: Exactly.

142
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:04,317
Scott: Because that's the thing is like I'm avoiding paying for cable TV.

143
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:10,750
Scott: If I sign up to eight subscription services all at once, I might as well get cable at that point.

144
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,814
Rym: Except cable doesn't have any of that shit.

145
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:14,117
Scott: Some of it.

146
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,630
Scott: But it's like I'm only really getting a good deal if I just go one at a time.

147
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:26,230
Scott: And as long as you know, there might be movies and things like that that they put up and take down from their services over time.

148
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:31,441
Scott: But the only reason to actually subscribe to one is for their exclusive shit.

149
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:35,530
Scott: And no one's going to take down their exclusive shit from their own platform.

150
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:36,071
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:36,292
Scott: Right.

152
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:43,430
Scott: That that live action cowboy beep boop is going to be on Netflix from the time it's ready until as long as Netflix exists.

153
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:43,991
Scott: Right.

154
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,415
Scott: Why would they ever take it down from the list?

155
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:47,878
Scott: There was some problem or something.

156
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,160
Rym: It's their show.

157
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,122
Rym: I generally.

158
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,084
Rym: we also like.

159
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,310
Rym: we rarely consume reviews of things like we were.

160
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,159
Scott: That would be like if Steam took Half Life 2 off of Steam.

161
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,262
Scott: Go get Half Life 2 on the Epic Store only.

162
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,832
Scott: Right.

163
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:02,826
Scott: That would be weird as hell.

164
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,530
Rym: But I tend not to read reviews of things like just in general because I don't read reviews of things either.

165
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:22,350
Rym: But it has been hard to ignore the fact that pretty much every review I have seen of the new Cowboy Bebop from any source, anime fans, non anime fans.

166
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,212
Scott: Well, I haven't seen any.

167
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,193
Scott: So I'm trusting you on this.

168
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,840
Rym: Small publications have ranged from mediocre to terrible.

169
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:33,789
Rym: And I have found zero positive reviews, which is a worrying sign.

170
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,318
Scott: So what I mean, it's not surprising.

171
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,409
Scott: I basically assume that all live action adaptations are met.

172
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:48,470
Scott: I think that, you know, if it is indeed met and what you're saying is true and the reviewers are correct and is bad, then that doesn't surprise me.

173
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:55,510
Scott: But what happened, what I do notice that I didn't watch too much of it, just like maybe one.

174
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,940
Rym: I watched the trailer and I went from the first trailer.

175
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,230
Rym: I got excited, like, wow, this might exceed expectations.

176
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,800
Rym: But the second trailer stylistically, it was amazing.

177
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,070
Rym: Like the style of how they shot it gave me all this hope.

178
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:17,390
Rym: But then when the actors started talking like the acting was really stiff, the dialogue was bad and stilted and it kind of sounded like a shitty anime dub.

179
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:29,330
Rym: Well, I mean, I didn't want to judge it based on that, but I like my danger sense suddenly started screaming at me like this is not going to be good.

180
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,962
Scott: I only watched one promotional item.

181
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,090
Scott: I don't know which of the many trailers it was.

182
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,870
Rym: Was it the one where Faye like grabs the frame around the scene and throws it away?

183
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,272
Scott: I don't remember.

184
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,076
Scott: It was so long ago.

185
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:45,550
Scott: But what I did notice is other people who I know who were closely following all the promotional material.

186
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:46,372
Scott: Right.

187
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:54,349
Scott: Were clearly a getting hyped, having positive feelings and B were there was a clear attempt.

188
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:55,453
Scott: Right.

189
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:59,770
Scott: Even from someone who only watched a little bit of the promotional material, rationalization.

190
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,011
Scott: Right.

191
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:14,490
Scott: There was a clear attempt by Netflix to make people who are already fans of the original believe that Netflix and the people who worked on this cared about the original a lot.

192
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,114
Scott: And we're trying to honor it appropriately.

193
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:17,895
Scott: Right.

194
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:28,370
Scott: So and if you took them in good faith, that's a reason as a fan of the original, which is still an all time masterpiece artwork like Mona Lisa level.

195
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,393
Scott: It's like that.

196
00:10:30,694 --> 00:10:35,983
Scott: the live action would not be like every other garbage live action anime adaptation ever.

197
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,850
Scott: But, uh, you know, I still have no idea.

198
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,112
Scott: I'm going to watch it and find out.

199
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:44,098
Scott: I didn't see any of these reviews that Rym is talking about.

200
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:50,110
Rym: So, yeah, what I'll link to is the most charitable review I could find, which was from the Atlantic.

201
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,557
Rym: What's lost when a classic anime is adapted by Netflix?

202
00:10:54,858 --> 00:11:00,290
Rym: The charm of the original Cowboy Bebop and many other Japanese animated series is not just in its style, but its storytelling.

203
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:09,685
Rym: And my prediction about how Bebop will be, we'll see if I'm right or wrong, I'll put this out there, is that it's going to be shot really stylistically well.

204
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:10,627
Rym: It'll look beautiful.

205
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,290
Rym: The music will be fantastic.

206
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:20,550
Rym: But I have this suspicion the writing story and dialogue is just going to be still too bad.

207
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,730
Scott: I mean, I basically assume that of all live action television productions, period.

208
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,074
Scott: Especially from the United States.

209
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,978
Rym: You're weird, though, because you don't watch anything.

210
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,584
Scott: Movies.

211
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,507
Scott: I don't know what it is.

212
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:35,649
Scott: I still can't explain it.

213
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:40,421
Scott: But, you know, movie acting is not the same as the vast majority of TV acting.

214
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,810
Scott: There's something about, you know, TV production.

215
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,583
Rym: What was the last live action TV show you watched to completion?

216
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:51,010
Scott: I guess The Mandalorian was the last time this stood out for me.

217
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,097
Scott: Where it was like, yeah, this is not like a movie.

218
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:55,580
Scott: See, I took the opposite.

219
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,649
Rym: It felt more like a Star Wars movie than any Star Wars movie that's come out since like...

220
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,910
Scott: I didn't even watch past what we watched to do that show on it and I have no desire to ever do that.

221
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,520
Rym: See, this is why I don't trust your opinion on this stuff because you don't watch anything.

222
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:09,507
Scott: Which is why I think you have bad taste.

223
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:10,250
Scott: You just like trash.

224
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,095
Rym: Yeah, okay.

225
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,845
Rym: You can continue to watch whatever it is that you watch.

226
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,190
Scott: Whatever other garbage you play.

227
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,415
Rym: But you don't play any video games either.

228
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,459
Scott: Yeah, I have very high standards.

229
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,781
Scott: I have a very short life.

230
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:22,543
Scott: I'm going to be living.

231
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,890
Scott: I only eat the finest goods, right?

232
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,204
Scott: If something is kind of good, nope, that's not good enough.

233
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:30,409
Scott: Get it out of here.

234
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,672
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

235
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:40,742
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

236
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:44,787
Rym: So, this Twitter account is... I appreciate it.

237
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,470
Rym: It's funny but not funny in the normal sense.

238
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:55,390
Rym: It's called "Simpson Crap Memes" and it does something that I haven't really seen anywhere else and I enjoy it.

239
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,322
Rym: It's almost similar to like, there was the vaporwave movement, which is a real musical movement.

240
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,910
Rym: And there was the, like, weird subgenre.

241
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,227
Scott: I don't know if it's a movement as much as a genre.

242
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:05,610
Scott: I don't know.

243
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,622
Rym: I would argue, and I've seen some arguments since the fact that it was a movement but a small one.

244
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:12,367
Rym: A very small one.

245
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,430
Rym: But many movements are small.

246
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:23,590
Rym: But there was the subgenre of that that was Simpsonwave, which was a legitimate subgenre with multiple people making earnest content.

247
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,410
Rym: Which is crazy that that existed and that I'm saying those words, but I do stand by them.

248
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:44,350
Rym: But what this account does is they make fairly complex memes from The Simpsons that mash up extremely obscure parts of The Simpsons in ways that are, like, accurate and true.

249
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,471
Rym: Like, they're not a stretch.

250
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:59,350
Rym: They are accurate and true and funny, but they require a terrifying amount of Simpsons, like, deep knowledge and memory of extremely obscure parts of The Simpsons to understand at all.

251
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,030
Rym: And this is the kind of humor that I appreciate, but I also understand why very few other people appreciate it.

252
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,452
Scott: That's the idea, right?

253
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:16,427
Scott: An inside joke is funnier to the people, but obviously it's inside.

254
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:17,950
Scott: Most people, it's not funny to them.

255
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:29,650
Scott: So the more inside the joke is, you actually sort of this hidden gold that only a few people can taste this amazing flavor.

256
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:36,378
Rym: If nobody but you and one other person, or even just you get it, then it almost fails.

257
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:45,770
Rym: Like some of those Jackbox social games where you're trying to get one other person, or dicks it too, to figure it out, but not too many people to figure it out, but not nobody.

258
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,930
Rym: This is like straddling that line in a way that is deeply pleasing to my soul.

259
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,351
Scott: Alright.

260
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:58,990
Scott: Anyway, so there's this person, and their name is on Twitter, is Magiteknight.

261
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:00,050
Scott: Goodnight.

262
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:03,050
Scott: You know, like Final Fantasy 6.

263
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,990
Rym: Two underscores, probably to get away from some other account with one underscore.

264
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,211
Scott: I don't know.

265
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:15,230
Scott: But this person makes, among other things, I assume, dioramas.

266
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:17,189
Rym: Dioramas are a fantastic hobby.

267
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:27,078
Scott: And they were commissioned by somebody with a lot of money to make a very large diorama of- Oh shit, that's a banana!

268
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,629
Rym: I just realized how big this thing is.

269
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:29,887
Scott: Yeah, it's huge.

270
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,390
Scott: If you go on the Twitter thread, there's photos without the banana.

271
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,890
Rym: It weighs thirty-five pounds!

272
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:39,653
Scott: Yeah, it's enormous.

273
00:15:39,673 --> 00:16:05,895
Scott: So yeah, they commissioned this person to make this very large diorama of the scene in Final Fantasy 6, where the Ultros attacks the party on the raft, and they, of course, I guess in accordance with the amount of money they were paid, which had to be a large amount, they did a large job, and you have to fucking see this thing, 'cause you don't have to pay for it.

274
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:09,970
Scott: Whoever's gonna keep it in their house can pay for it, and the rest of us can right-click it.

275
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,259
Scott: So, everyone's seen it.

276
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,770
Scott: You got all the same enjoyment out of it that the person who paid for it got.

277
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:23,010
Scott: They're just footing the bill for the rest of us, so don't miss your chance to look at this holy shit diorama.

278
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:30,910
Scott: You could've put this thing in any number of anime convention art shows and won all the prizes, and you didn't.

279
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:38,630
Rym: I imagine even at the height of the Otakon Artist Alley, like that giant art auction, this would've been the thing that had an infinite number of bids.

280
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:46,630
Scott: I also think that, yeah, the price the person paid for this, I'm gonna guess, is lower than what it would go for at auction.

281
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,912
Rym: Oh, absolutely.

282
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:49,597
Rym: Some rich nerd would pro-.

283
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:53,870
Rym: If I had to guess, a rich nerd would be willing to pay several thousand dollars for this.

284
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:04,349
Rym: I'm sure the person paid several thousand, but I think, for example, right now- A rich nerd being willing to pay seven or eight thousand dollars for something like this.

285
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,310
Scott: I think they'd pay, you know, at auction, I think that might be what, more like, closer to the price that was paid to commission.

286
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,881
Rym: Well, yeah, to your point, an auction.

287
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:12,890
Rym: Especially a charity auction.

288
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,910
Scott: If you auction this, it's gonna be tens, five digits at least.

289
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,569
Rym: Public auctions, if they're run the right way, will drive the price way higher than a direct sale would be.

290
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:41,990
Scott: Right, well, I mean, for example, right, Desert Bus is happening right now, and they have many, part of Desert Bus, they have many parts of it, but is they auction off items for charity, and they have both people who, A, spend the year planning a big fancy thing to craft to put up for auction as a donation, right?

291
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:46,509
Scott: And B, people who save money all year in order to purchase, right?

292
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,179
Scott: So, I saw somebody, what were they auctioning?

293
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,070
Scott: It was a cross-stitch, but it was a very high resolution cross-stitch, right?

294
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:08,870
Scott: Like a zillion stitches that took, like, months to make of a scene from the Sandman comic, and that thing went for almost, like, not 10k, but, like, maybe seven or eight, somewhere up there, right?

295
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,158
Scott: So, this thing's going for more than that, for sure.

296
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,005
Scott: I'd be really curious.

297
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,470
Scott: But, yeah, this is, you know.

298
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:15,847
Scott: Just look at this.

299
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,596
Rym: Real quick meta-moments, we can get right into it.

300
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:23,030
Rym: The Giganized Book Club book, Tale of Genji, ending by the end of the year, come hell or high water.

301
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:24,430
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,449
Scott: Well, high water might come.

303
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:30,910
Rym: High water might come, but I feel like even if high water comes, we will still finish that book and do the show on it.

304
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,227
Rym: I got a lot of batteries and 5G.

305
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:46,750
Rym: I will be at PAX Unplugged for a couple hours to do one panel, Rare Game Mechanics, on the Friday, December, whatever day that is, at 1pm in the Crab God Theater, I think.

306
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:48,294
Rym: It'll be on YouTube.

307
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:52,369
Rym: Don't go to PAX Unplugged if you're not already going to PAX Unplugged.

308
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,155
Rym: Like, don't go there just to see that panel.

309
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,800
Rym: I'm literally recording it.

310
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,910
Rym: I'm going to put it on YouTube before PAX Unplugged even ends.

311
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:00,836
Rym: Uh, yeah.

312
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,709
Rym: Let's get right into it.

313
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,658
Rym: Rebuild of Evangelion.

314
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,369
Rym: So, if you're new to Giganized...

315
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,130
Scott: Let's start with, you want to just start with the first one, or you got to do some general comment first?

316
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,518
Rym: I want to do a general comment that we are, we've done this pattern in the past.

317
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:20,930
Rym: We do it not that often now because we just don't watch shows to their completion that are worthy of this for a lot of reasons lately.

318
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,329
Scott: Same show to their completion.

319
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,637
Rym: But, we have this concept of a final thought show, as opposed to a review.

320
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:32,930
Rym: And the difference is, when we review a show, we review it without spoiling things, and without assuming you've seen it.

321
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,890
Scott: We're trying to tell you if you should watch it or not.

322
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:35,329
Scott: Exactly.

323
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,307
Scott: Since you haven't watched it.

324
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,130
Rym: So, that's what we already did for the Rebuild of Evangelion.

325
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,170
Scott: This show is for people who have already seen it and just want to enjoy talking about it.

326
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:50,269
Rym: So, we're going to assume you have seen the Rebuild of Evangelion, and...

327
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,429
Scott: Or you don't give a shit.

328
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:52,409
Rym: Or you don't give a shit.

329
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,181
Scott: Which is perfectly valid because I don't believe in spoilers either.

330
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,150
Scott: If I hadn't seen it, I would listen to this show.

331
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,930
Rym: You're not going to know what the fuck we're talking about when we start talking about the Kia Nebuchadnezzar and what that was all about.

332
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:16,050
Rym: But also, we're going to spoil, effectively, the original Evangelion, and the original movies, and pretty much every possible media related to Evangelion.

333
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:24,110
Rym: Except the manga, which we haven't read to completion yet, but is very similar to the show, and thus we're definitely spoiling that as well.

334
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:27,799
Scott: And the Playstation game stuff, where fans like to get a lot of lore from.

335
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,110
Scott: that's not canon anywhere else except the Playstation game and whatnot.

336
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,370
Rym: Yep, Evangelion 2.

337
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:42,410
Rym: If you watch these movies and then you try to go to the Ava Wikis to figure out parts that you didn't understand, you're going to bump into lore from that Apocrypha.

338
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,939
Rym: Which, honestly, doesn't change anything.

339
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,430
Rym: It actually just adds tiny amounts of irrelevant context.

340
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,330
Rym: Like, it gives you a little more about Adam and Lilith and the slight differences between them.

341
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,090
Rym: But, those are things that you could infer from the media as shown without those games.

342
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:10,210
Scott: Anyway, so, overall, I said this when we did a review episode, but the Rebuild movies are not a prequel, they're not a sequel, they're not a remake.

343
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:14,259
Scott: Like, what's a good example of a remake?

344
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,386
Rym: There's so many of them.

345
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:26,170
Rym: So, there was El Hazzard, which had an OAV, and then they remade that OAV as a longer television anime.

346
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,239
Rym: But it wasn't, like, a sequel, it was just a parallel universe.

347
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,990
Rym: Like, same characters, same basic story, but things go differently.

348
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,233
Rym: Tenchi Muyo did the same thing.

349
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:42,830
Rym: There was an OAV, then they made multiple different TV series that aren't in the same continuity, they just use the same characters and the same kind of story.

350
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:49,084
Scott: Okay, so a good example of a remake would be something like The Ring, right?

351
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:51,610
Scott: Where you had the original one, and then they made an English one.

352
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,783
Scott: Or there were several Oceans, were there two Oceans?

353
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,110
Scott: There's at least two Oceans Elevens.

354
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,050
Rym: I think there's three Oceans at this point.

355
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,290
Scott: They redid Planet of the Apes at some point, right?

356
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,763
Rym: Train to Busan is apparently getting a US remake called Last Train to New York.

357
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,930
Rym: Breaking news, I guess.

358
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:13,629
Scott: Yeah, but basically, you know, a remake is like, "Okay, that person made that thing, I'm just gonna make the same fucking thing

359
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:13,890
Scott: again.".

360
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,813
Scott: This is not what that is either, right?

361
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:25,370
Scott: So, I think it's really appropriate that it called it Rebuild, because upon watching it, it is sort of a, you know, it's none of those other things, right?

362
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:37,890
Rym: You could make an argument that, you could argue that it occurs in the same continuity of the show with a giant, complicated asterisk, but you could also just say that...

363
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:43,870
Scott: It's not a strict multiverse time loop thing, even though it's close to one.

364
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,429
Rym: But it's also not a Leiji Matsumoto verse of, "Yeah, it's just these same characters doing something completely

365
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:49,650
Rym: different.".

366
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:59,630
Rym: Imagine taking the original Evangelion, breaking it down into all of its component parts, like a Lego set, and rebuilding something from those same parts.

367
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,068
Scott: With some new parts.

368
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:02,229
Rym: And a bunch of new parts.

369
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,869
Scott: And some parts removed.

370
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,776
Rym: So, you buy the Space Shuttle Lego set.

371
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,240
Rym: You build the Space Shuttle.

372
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,821
Rym: It's cool.

373
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:09,064
Rym: You tear it down.

374
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,450
Rym: You buy the Ice Planet Hoth set.

375
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,070
Scott: Or not even tearing it down, but necessarily, like, just, it's so old that, you know, it's taken damage, right?

376
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:24,970
Rym: Take a few pieces away, take the Ice Planet Hoth set, and rebuild it bigger and different, but also the same.

377
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,289
Scott: Okay, so movie one, we don't need to spend too much time on movie one, except for two items, right?

378
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:36,770
Scott: Because movie one is identical to the television show, pretty much in every way, except for two things.

379
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:43,550
Scott: First thing is there is the scene where Masato takes Shinji down to the terminal dogma in the basement.

380
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,090
Rym: That happens way earlier.

381
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:50,870
Scott: And, right, so that scene was in the original, but in the TV, in the movie, it happens earlier.

382
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:59,990
Scott: And I think that it was just, it's not really any different, but it was necessary because it has to show both the audience and Shinji.

383
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,070
Scott: Like, you know, because up until that point in the story, Shinji doesn't really understand what's at stake.

384
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,708
Scott: Like, "Oh, the angels are trying to get to this physical place to bring about this apocalypse,

385
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:11,050
Scott: basically.".

386
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,050
Rym: Yes, if an angel touches this thing, everyone dies.

387
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,424
Scott: And that's what you're trying to prevent, Shinji, and also telling the audience, like, "Hey, that's what's happening here.

388
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:22,149
Scott: We're trying to keep the angels from reaching the

389
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:22,450
Scott: spot.".

390
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,800
Rym: Now, there are a bunch of other minor, like, plot beats from later episodes of the show.

391
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,090
Rym: that happened earlier and happened in the first movie, but they're not important like this one was.

392
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,749
Scott: But I would argue it is.

393
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,410
Scott: That was a significant difference, and the other significant difference is the very end of the first movie.

394
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:40,830
Rym: The last 30 seconds of this movie.

395
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,932
Rym: The last 30 seconds.

396
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:54,070
Scott: So, in the last 30 seconds, you see Kaoru on the moon coming out of a coffin, and there are many coffins, and some of them have lids on, and some of them are open.

397
00:24:55,351 --> 00:25:01,910
Scott: So, clearly, they're showing you right here that, like, yeah, this has happened before, and it's gonna happen again.

398
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:05,004
Scott: We got a whole bunch of Kaoru's lined up, right?

399
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:06,210
Scott: This is the current one.

400
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:19,210
Scott: He's on the moon somehow, and he's looking at, basically, an Evangelion/Angel being constructed, right, which I think ends up being Eva 5 or 6 that he pilots, right?

401
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,550
Scott: There's so many Evas.

402
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:32,690
Scott: He pilots it at the end of the second movie, but basically, there's this Eva being made on the moon that he's gonna pilot, and he talks to it, and he says very little, but the little he says says a whole lot.

403
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,880
Rym: He basically says the equivalent of, "Alright, Shinji.

404
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:35,724
Rym: Let's do

405
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:35,825
Rym: this.".

406
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,331
Scott: Right.

407
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:39,415
Scott: He's sort of like, "Oh, you're the X-th number this time.

408
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:40,498
Scott: You know, the 12-th, or whatever.

409
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,021
Scott: You'd never change,

410
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:42,141
Scott: right?".

411
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:59,752
Rym: I thought at that point, at that moment, before having not seen the rest of the movies yet, what I thought was, those were all the Sele people, and then he was up there, too, and he was talking about Sele Chairman #3.

412
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:04,637
Scott: Okay, so we learned the deal with that scene in movie #2, right?

413
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:13,007
Scott: While in movie #2, right, Futski Friday and Gendo get in a rocket, and they go into space.

414
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,270
Scott: They're literally in space.

415
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,085
Rym: It's very similar to the scene in the original show where they go to the Antarctic to do the thing, but...

416
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,913
Scott: Exactly.

417
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,122
Scott: It's a replacement for that.

418
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:33,220
Rym: Because remember, and we're assuming you've seen these movies, after, from the beginning of the last 30 seconds of the first movie, the show goes off the rails.

419
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:41,730
Rym: After the second movie, it goes off of the concept of rails to, like, this new reality of space rails.

420
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:48,350
Rym: And then the final movie is, at this point, it's almost like a promare, like, ridiculous spectacle.

421
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,753
Scott: So anyway, so this scene where they're going up to the moon, right?

422
00:26:53,474 --> 00:27:11,670
Scott: The movies keep what the TV show had, which is that relationship between NERV and Sele, where Sele is supposedly the big Illuminati organization that's running everything, and NERV is working for them, but Gendo running NERV has his own ideas.

423
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,471
Rym: Let's break it down.

424
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:22,490
Rym: From the original show, what we knew was NERV was the successor agency to Geherne, and both NERV and Geherne were created for different purposes by Sele.

425
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:32,130
Rym: Sele is pulling the strings of the UN, and all the other organizations involved are just chumps who don't know what's up and all get chumped.

426
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:42,299
Rym: But of course, the new movies, we see further evolutions, where Geherne failed for a bunch of reasons, became NERV, NERV splits into NERV and WIL.

427
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:51,970
Rym: Arguably, I would say WIL and the Wunder and all that, that's free will, like, that is the third path, or the fourth way, or when we get into bed and play.

428
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:55,498
Rym: I say the fourth way because you would get that inside joke.

429
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,770
Rym: The moon literally is trying to eat your soul in this fucking movie.

430
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:11,230
Scott: Right, so they go into space in a rocket, because I guess there's nothing, they know something's happening on the moon, but they can't see it, and there's no other way for them to see it, other than literally getting in a rocket and looking out the window.

431
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:19,150
Scott: And also, that just happens to basically make the plot work to where Gendo and Futsuki aren't on Earth during that angel battle.

432
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,314
Scott: So Misato has to take to run the show there.

433
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:29,127
Scott: But regardless, they look out the window and they see the thing from the end of the first movie.

434
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:30,890
Scott: They see the EVA being constructed.

435
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,443
Scott: And that's basically the EVA that they had no hand in making.

436
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,029
Scott: They had a hand in making all the other ones.

437
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,400
Scott: But that's the one that Seilei made on its own.

438
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:41,987
Scott: that's gonna carry out their opposition.

439
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:51,090
Scott: If we're gonna do our own deal and not necessarily do exactly what Seilei wants, we gotta go spy on their plans.

440
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,535
Rym: And I do appreciate how it kept that continuity of.

441
00:28:54,918 --> 00:29:00,330
Rym: Gendo and Futsuki are trying to use NERV for their own purposes, and they're pretending to go along with Seilei.

442
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,430
Scott: Well, Futsuki is just sort of, I don't know if his purpose is just to help Gendo's purpose.

443
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,495
Rym: Well, I want to get to that.

444
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:09,990
Rym: I got a lot of thoughts on Futsuki because I didn't expect him to have his big moment at the end.

445
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,969
Scott: Is he a Futsuki fanboy?

446
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:15,450
Rym: I really like Futsuki as a character for a lot of reasons.

447
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,365
Scott: Oh, the old man?

448
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:16,570
Scott: Okay.

449
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,085
Rym: Well, partly because the manga actually gets way more into him.

450
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:20,010
Rym: That's one thing you're missing.

451
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,547
Scott: I'm sure it does.

452
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,719
Rym: And he's got an interesting deal.

453
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:24,750
Rym: Pretty sure he really wants it.

454
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,170
Scott: Sadly, the movies as a whole don't basically cut out so much Ritsuko action.

455
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,230
Rym: Oh, they cut out Ritsuko and they cut out the manga stuff.

456
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,470
Scott: She's there, but she's not really doing much.

457
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:46,130
Rym: But you do see her and Maya actually grow as characters and become interesting in ways that could not have happened in the original show because of what we know about Ritsuko's mom.

458
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:53,590
Rym: But I appreciate that Gendo and Futsuki were trying to use NERV for their own purposes.

459
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,349
Rym: They're going along with Seilei and pretending to work with them.

460
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,690
Rym: Seilei knows that Gendo's going to betray them and doesn't give a shit because they think they can prevent him from fucking them over.

461
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:07,184
Rym: And they know that he knows that they know.

462
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:08,570
Rym: This is all explicit.

463
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,850
Rym: But they need him to defeat a certain number of angels or their plan fails anyway.

464
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,569
Rym: So they have to let the person who they know is going to betray them do the work he needs to do.

465
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,709
Rym: And it's literally a prisoner's dilemma of who betrays who first and how.

466
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,910
Rym: And both Seilei and NERV think that they have got it under control.

467
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,550
Rym: And I love how well that translated into the Rebuild movies from the original.

468
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,570
Scott: You know, I think this just comes from playing too many board games.

469
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,790
Scott: I can't help but look at these movies in terms of that, right?

470
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:52,550
Scott: In both what you just pointed out, but also, you know, if you play a game like Dune or any political game, we always have that scenario where it's like so-and-so's going to win on next turn unless you stop them.

471
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:56,109
Scott: So-and-so's going to win on the next turn unless you stop them.

472
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,129
Scott: And basically movie one doesn't really fall into that.

473
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:05,350
Scott: But movies two, three, and four basically all end, all of them.

474
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,721
Scott: The end of movie two is it's about to happen, right?

475
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,290
Scott: It's about to happen unless you stop it and they stop it.

476
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,470
Scott: Movie three at the end is going to happen unless you stop it.

477
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,307
Scott: Someone stops it.

478
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,930
Scott: And movie 3.0 plus 1.0, it's going to happen unless you stop it.

479
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,929
Scott: And then it just sort of happens.

480
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:31,850
Rym: Well, but arguably the end-end movies are the coalition of people who want the thing that will actually end the game.

481
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:33,690
Rym: Gang up and end the game.

482
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,469
Scott: Alright, so the rest of movie two.

483
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,930
Scott: Alright, so movie two- It starts out introducing, you know, Mari, right?

484
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,429
Rym: The new character.

485
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:44,969
Scott: We should talk about her.

486
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:53,910
Rym: And also, you know, showing us- She basically replaces a lot of what Asuka did in the original Eva, but not all of it.

487
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:00,550
Scott: And also, what's the, you know, the kid who dies in the first- Yeah, Koji.

488
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,890
Scott: You know, he's in the movies, but Mari takes a lot of his stuff too.

489
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,490
Rym: Well, what I like is that the first movie was just the recap up until the preview.

490
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:11,989
Rym: Actually, we got to talk about that too.

491
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:20,130
Rym: I love that every one of these movies, after the credits, has a preview of the next movie just like it's the original TV show, even with the same music.

492
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:21,887
Rym: Well, of course the last one doesn't.

493
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:33,290
Rym: But every one of those previews shows you things that are so fucking ridiculous and cannot be parsed based on what you just watched.

494
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:38,184
Rym: I can't imagine having watched 3.0, seeing the preview for 4.0 or 3.0 plus

495
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,233
Rym: 1.0. 3.0

496
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:40,670
Rym: plus 1.0.

497
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,641
Rym: And having to wait from 2016 to 2021 to see how that happens.

498
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:48,490
Scott: Yeah.

499
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,050
Scott: Okay, so Mari comes into the picture.

500
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:53,370
Scott: She's a new Eva pilot.

501
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:57,106
Scott: And where she came from was, I guess, like this other place.

502
00:32:58,336 --> 00:32:58,889
Scott: Oh, I love this.

503
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:06,049
Scott: In the original TV show, they basically do tell you, like, yeah, there are other nerve bases with other Avas in America.

504
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,170
Rym: There's an American nerve in Nevada that disappears.

505
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,789
Rym: It's a plot point in the original Ava.

506
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:11,664
Rym: Right.

507
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:17,190
Scott: And there's also the episode with the lava in the original TV series, right, where the Ava goes in the lava.

508
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:22,729
Scott: And I'm pretty sure in that episode, they're working with some, you know, other...

509
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,970
Rym: Yeah, remember, Asuka was at Asuka on Unit 02, where a transfer from that other organization.

510
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,590
Scott: They came from the European branch or whatever, right?

511
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:34,670
Scott: So, but here, they're actually showing us the other branch, right?

512
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:43,210
Rym: Oh, even better, while the movies kind of gave up on Fuyutsuki's full deal, and they didn't follow Ritsuko and all that stuff.

513
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:52,550
Rym: What they did do is show you, remember in the original show, Kaji was up to something, but they only show you tiny pieces of what he was up to.

514
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,610
Rym: In this movie, they show you what Kaji was up to pretty heavily.

515
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:04,630
Rym: But my favorite moment was at the beginning of that, when Mari and Kaji and all them are doing their European thing to stop that angel from escaping.

516
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:12,228
Rym: And the Ava self-destructs, and Kaji's like, "I hate to use a kid for my plans, but this is real

517
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:12,670
Rym: important.".

518
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:15,770
Rym: And he goes off to do his thing, probably with the Kia Nebuchadnezzar.

519
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:28,329
Rym: But Mari then is floating in the escape pod, and she's like, "Ah, I hate to fuck over an adult for my secret plan, but you gotta do what you gotta

520
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:28,509
Rym: do.".

521
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:43,210
Rym: And then, in the third movie, basically what she was trying to do at the end of the second movie was, as far as I would say, merge with the Ava, using the backup codes to unrestrain it, and trigger the impact herself and become a god.

522
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:49,330
Rym: It feels like that's what she was trying to do, and she got interrupted by Karu and all the other nonsense.

523
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:58,969
Scott: So yeah, at the beginning of the second movie, they're at this Bethany base, which is not the Japanese nerve we're used to.

524
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,063
Scott: And at this Bethany base, the third angel is locked up.

525
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:05,587
Scott: It's not dead, it was sealed.

526
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,189
Scott: And I guess that happened before even the first movie.

527
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:16,570
Rym: You get all this mechanical lore and all this really fun sci-fi nonsense about how they deal with the angels.

528
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:25,370
Scott: You enter both the TV series and, I presume, the manga and these movies, they all start when Shinji is brought into the picture.

529
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,050
Scott: All the stuff that happens before is a mystery to the audience and to Shinji.

530
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:37,350
Scott: So, in the TV show, the only things that really happened before Shinji showed up was all the stuff at the South Pole, pretty much.

531
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:43,190
Scott: But in the movies, there's this other stuff that happened before, including trapping this third angel.

532
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:51,170
Scott: And so what happens there when Mari is fighting the third angel with this makeshift, shitty Eva that's available there.

533
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,110
Rym: It's like a big provisional, like she's not even in the final plug suit design or anything.

534
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:03,730
Scott: Yeah, but basically, it's implied that Kaji sort of let that angel loose to steal the key of Nebuchadnezzar for Gendo.

535
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:08,210
Scott: And the battle is a distraction, so you can get away with it.

536
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:12,890
Scott: So, why does Kaji want to steal the key of Nebuchadnezzar and give it to Gendo?

537
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:19,530
Rym: Yeah, well, remember the original show, Kaji was kind of playing both sides.

538
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,550
Scott: He stole the Adam embryo thing and gave it to Gendo instead of the key of Nebuchadnezzar.

539
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:33,569
Rym: Yep, to give to Gendo, so Gendo could graft it into his own body, so he could then, as Adam, merge with Eva.

540
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:46,410
Rym: Well, merge with Lilith via Eva as a vessel, which was embodied in Rei, which was a clone that had the salvaged soul of Lilith, to then trigger the third impact himself, become a god, reunite with you.

541
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,156
Rym: Like, that was his specific plan.

542
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:52,370
Rym: The original show is very straightforward about what he was trying to do there.

543
00:36:52,991 --> 00:37:08,910
Rym: And he's basically trying to do the same thing, and Kaji is letting this happen in both that and the rebuild, because he has his own goals, and I still think his main goal was that he wanted all of this bullshit to fail and humanity to survive.

544
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,529
Rym: I think that's all he actually cared about.

545
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,590
Scott: Well, yeah, because in both the movie and the TV show, right, he's always planting his watermelons and whatnot, right?

546
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:23,684
Rym: But planting the watermelons was, look, the whole point of this is so that we can have lives.

547
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:25,608
Rym: That's the only reason we're fighting.

548
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,730
Rym: Remember that.

549
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:43,330
Rym: And in the movie, it brings that back, like Shinji comes to, just like in the original show, because he remembers the smell of the ocean that Kaji showed him in movie two, and he remembers the smell of the earth, and he remembers that maybe humanity is worth saving independent of the cosmic space nonsense.

550
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,303
Rym: Maybe humanity is not ready to destroy itself and become something different.

551
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,630
Rym: Maybe we're still very young.

552
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:58,830
Scott: In the original TV show, right, you get sort of those famous scenes that I love so much, where it's a quiet, empty city with cicada noises, all the people have left, right?

553
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,850
Scott: Eventually, it's like NERV is just hollowed out, except for the few people that are left there, which are the main characters of the show.

554
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:14,550
Rym: Humanity has died out, the room of golf was empty and sealed, and in the original show, what were they even fighting for at the end, when there weren't even that many humans left?

555
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:19,270
Scott: Yep, presumably there were, just far away from Japan.

556
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:34,810
Rym: But look at that contrast in the Rebuild movie two, because movie one was kind of rushed because it tried to condense so much, just to set the stage for the differences, but movie two spent so much time showing you humans, the dense, smelly mass of humans.

557
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,190
Scott: Things of people working at NERV, something you didn't see before.

558
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,170
Rym: But even outside of NERV, just living their lives, like, there's kids going to school.

559
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:47,503
Scott: There were a lot of scenes of showing the city's buildings going up and down through the, you know, and, like, all the people who lived in the city.

560
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:51,070
Scott: There was never that sort of evacuation point, really, where the city's empty.

561
00:38:52,310 --> 00:39:07,590
Rym: And even, like, in the later movies, you see Paris and all the other cities that were just like that, like, there's this feeling that humanity itself, as it is, is worth saving and cherishing, independent of the whole Adam and Lilith situation out in space.

562
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:08,891
Scott: Right.

563
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:15,990
Scott: I mean, there's, you know, Shinji basically was like, you know, in the TV show, all he had as, like, you know, motivation to win.

564
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,257
Scott: It's like, it's like, you know, you have that, like, the scene, right?

565
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:24,890
Scott: Where Misato comes down is like, yeah, see, the angels are trying to do this, which will destroy everyone.

566
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,413
Scott: It's like, oh, okay, well, that's bad.

567
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:33,730
Scott: But if there's no humans left, if everyone's, there's almost nobody left, it's like, I'm really just fighting for what, this handful of people?

568
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:41,950
Rym: Yeah, well, I'm fighting for my shitty dad to be shitty forever as a god, or I'm fighting for a bunch of old men running against conspiracy theory to be gods.

569
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:50,370
Scott: In the movies, they keep people around in some, you know, they show you both, you know, apocalypse, lots of people dying, like, the whole bottom of the planet.

570
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:59,650
Rym: But then they always show you, there's still some humans hanging on, like, humans are surprisingly resilient, and that is an overarching theme.

571
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:06,207
Scott: They actually, those humans were there in the original TV show, but the camera never really went to them after a certain point.

572
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:07,470
Scott: You just didn't see them.

573
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:15,950
Scott: In the movies, they keep showing you all the people that are still there, and also the ones that have been obliterated by half-apocalypses.

574
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:25,550
Rym: Like, I really like, in the end, like, where you see the village, where everyone is, like, there's still humans, even after the near-third impact, like, just living their lives.

575
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:35,751
Rym: And you get that whole side story of Rey, like, a clone Rey who didn't know shit, living a life among humans and, like, getting it 100%.

576
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:44,650
Scott: Yeah, and then being, you know, rather, she chose to continue living that life with humans and then disintegrating, rather than to go back to what she was doing before.

577
00:40:44,670 --> 00:41:02,250
Rym: Well, what she was doing before was, it's very clear that the dummy plug systems of the thousands of Ava and Ava-like things that are out there in the second two movies, they're all powered by memoryless clones of either Karu or Rey, and this is just one of those infinite sea of clones.

578
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:16,250
Rym: But, remember, when she died, you get a tiny little cross, just like when any Ava or any angel gets destroyed, but also, 'cause one thing that was added to the movies that was very important was the rainbows.

579
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:29,290
Rym: Those little rainbows that occur, concurrent to the crosses appearing, 'cause sometimes crosses happen without rainbows, and sometimes crosses happen with rainbows, sometimes rainbows happen on their own, and toward the end, rainbows become halos.

580
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:44,090
Rym: Every time a rainbow appears, it's because a soul was involved, and it's very important that when Shinji sees that Rey die, there's the tiny little cross, just like an angel died, and there's a tiny little rainbow around that cross.

581
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:49,804
Rym: That little Rey had at least some soul there, which-- Some left.

582
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:57,770
Scott: Well, a soul at all-- It's really reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell, when you're copying people's cyberbrain system.

583
00:41:58,071 --> 00:41:59,826
Rym: Yep, the degradation of ghost dubbing.

584
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,309
Scott: Yep, exactly.

585
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:09,649
Rym: But I think that's really important, because this show does act-- the original show got into the room of golf, and that's where souls come from.

586
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,889
Scott: We talked about the room of golf in the movies a little bit.

587
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:24,408
Rym: In the rebuild, the rebuilds actually get into the science fiction aspect of, "Nope, those doors can be opened by this set of situations,

588
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:25,529
Rym: specifically.".

589
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:29,110
Rym: Adam and Willis have their own rooms of golf, probably.

590
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:33,430
Scott: Well, yeah, because they're in the big spheres.

591
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:43,870
Scott: The rest of the second movie is mostly just angel battling, but unlike the first movie, it's battling way different angels.

592
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:50,009
Rym: It's battling different angels, and always in the context of, "Remember what you're fighting

593
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,249
Rym: for.".

594
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:54,149
Rym: The human life around it is what you're fighting for.

595
00:42:54,551 --> 00:43:02,028
Rym: It really focuses on that, and it also has all the same beats as that second part of the original show, but they're all remixed.

596
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,350
Rym: An angel takes over an Eva, but it's Asuka piling it instead of Toji.

597
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:15,305
Rym: The same things happen, but different people are involved, so I kept seeing, "Oh, the thing I expect is going to happen,".

598
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,249
Rym: and then, "Wait a minute, it's going a different

599
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:17,429
Rym: way.".

600
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:24,390
Scott: So, at the end of the second movie, what's going to happen is an impact is coming, right?

601
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,332
Rym: I love that so much.

602
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:27,974
Rym: It's like Sele and Nerve.

603
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:37,950
Rym: Imagine if everyone who is planning all their bullshit, and then somebody just suddenly triggers a victory condition way early in the game.

604
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:45,210
Scott: Exactly, so in the original, in the TV show, Unit 1 eats the core of that one angel, right?

605
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,769
Rym: Pretty late in the show.

606
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:53,830
Scott: Right, and that's how it achieves god levels of power, but it doesn't become a god at that moment.

607
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,710
Scott: It doesn't have the keys.

608
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:58,040
Scott: Right, so it takes a little bit longer.

609
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,270
Scott: Here, it all happens at once, right?

610
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:07,850
Scott: The core, the angel, and I think the core of Unit 0 gets absorbed into Unit 1, and the wings come out right away.

611
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:15,826
Scott: It compresses that whole thing all into one, and then it's like, "Well, here comes the impact at the end of only Movie 2,".

612
00:44:15,826 --> 00:44:17,490
Scott: and you know two more of these movies are coming.

613
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,990
Rym: That was the moment, watching the show, watching that movie, because you'd already seen it when we talked about it.

614
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:27,169
Rym: I was just like, when I watched it, I remember thinking, "All right, so this must have been why Scott was freaking

615
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,310
Rym: out.".

616
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,330
Rym: So, the third impact is about to happen, and then, out of nowhere, spare vlog-a-doos from the sky.

617
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:35,916
Scott: So, that's after the credits.

618
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:37,639
Scott: That's the one thing.

619
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:43,910
Scott: If you just end the movie before the credits, you don't see the very, very important scene afterwards.

620
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,168
Scott: You would end Movie 2 thinking, "Third impact, go watch Movie

621
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:49,171
Scott: 3.".

622
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:55,269
Rym: But also thinking, "What could possibly happen in a third, let alone a fourth movie, if this is the third

623
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:55,510
Rym: impact?".

624
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,388
Rym: Because the third impact in the original was the entire end of the show at once.

625
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:14,850
Scott: So, after the credits, there's a very, very brief scene where Kaoru comes down from the moon with the Eva that was being made on the moon, this whole moon thing, and he takes a lance.

626
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:17,010
Scott: You don't know which one yet, right?

627
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,173
Rym: Well, which one?

628
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:22,590
Rym: There was only one in the original show, so already we're in uncharted territory.

629
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:24,433
Scott: Right.

630
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:30,229
Scott: He lances Shinji to basically pause the third impact to stop it right there.

631
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:34,510
Scott: And that's what allows Movie 3 to even exist.

632
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,841
Rym: So, and I can't stress enough, Movie 2 came out in 2009, Movie 3 came out in 2012, and then Movie 3, when it finally came out, alright, it's been 16 years.

633
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:51,029
Rym: Shinji was de-caporialized inside of that Eva that entire time.

634
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:57,350
Rym: There's space shit going on, there's all these other people, Misato betrayed NERV.

635
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:02,969
Rym: There aren't rails anymore, we're on the Galaxy Express, and we're past Metallia and heading off into the...

636
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:10,390
Scott: Going into Movie 3, it starts out, it reminds me a lot of some Gundam movies.

637
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,530
Scott: There's something at a space satellite that someone's trying to steal.

638
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:14,266
Scott: Yeah.

639
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,037
Scott: It's like, what the hell's going on here?

640
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:18,963
Scott: I just saw a third impact that was paused midway.

641
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:24,138
Scott: What is the state of the world now?

642
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:26,590
Scott: You have no fucking clue what the state of the world is now.

643
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:29,564
Scott: How are we even continuing from that point?

644
00:46:29,624 --> 00:46:30,910
Scott: Are we just going to start over again?

645
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,964
Scott: I thought Movie 3 might have just started over from the beginning.

646
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,210
Scott: again, Shinji on a subway.

647
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:42,470
Rym: Yeah, because like you said, all those characters on the Wunder and everything, they feel so much like Gundam seed-type characters.

648
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,370
Scott: Yep.

649
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:54,410
Scott: So, they've created this new, completely new territory here at the beginning, slowly revealed to you over the course of the third movie, where NERV has split into two groups.

650
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:57,077
Scott: Right, the Will group and original NERV.

651
00:46:57,158 --> 00:47:00,126
Scott: Original NERV is basically just Gendo, Futski, Kaoru, and Rei.

652
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:00,487
Scott: That's it.

653
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:01,430
Scott: There's no one left.

654
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,349
Rym: And whatever's left of Lilith's soul and...

655
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,937
Scott: And whatever's left of the equipment that NERV still had.

656
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:11,770
Scott: A large part of the Earth is destroyed in the half-third impact.

657
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,450
Rym: There's little pockets of humanity living on top of giant...

658
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:15,069
Scott: Not everybody.

659
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:23,210
Rym: But they're living on top of like giant, complicated-looking sphere of longaners looking like pyramid things, or they're living in like these handful of zones.

660
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:25,837
Rym: Ava technology is off the charts.

661
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,842
Rym: There's Ava's fucking everywhere.

662
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:30,930
Rym: Everybody's got AT fields, and it's just like space nonsense.

663
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:48,710
Scott: Yeah, so the Will organization, which is, you know, basically everyone else, right, Masato mostly, but everybody else, is basically fighting against NERV somehow, and is also fighting to preserve whatever humanity remains on Earth, right?

664
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,129
Scott: Gendo doesn't seem to care too much about that at all.

665
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:51,748
Scott: No, he didn't.

666
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:56,550
Rym: Gendo gave zero fucks about any human being on Earth except Yui from the beginning.

667
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,476
Scott: Pretty much.

668
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:00,490
Scott: So Will is, you know, fighting for humanity.

669
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:07,250
Scott: So they rescue Shinji from space and, you know, incorporeal-ness.

670
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:07,830
Scott: Yup.

671
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,530
Scott: You know, they have Asuka and they have Mari, right?

672
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,088
Scott: Yup.

673
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,828
Scott: They don't have Rei.

674
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:16,152
Rym: Asuka's back.

675
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:18,114
Rym: She's got an iPad.

676
00:48:19,075 --> 00:48:20,757
Rym: She's an interesting character.

677
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:31,190
Rym: She's like a lot how Asuka from the original would have been if she was more fully realized and not destroyed by the psychological damage of the angel that invaded her brain.

678
00:48:32,032 --> 00:48:39,310
Rym: And this is also the movie that gets a lot more into, the second movie does too, when they talk about plug depth entry and contamination.

679
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:45,630
Rym: In the original show, they don't actually address too specifically from a sci-fi angle what that means.

680
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:50,990
Rym: In movies two and three, that is like a big part of the plot is exactly what that means.

681
00:48:51,831 --> 00:48:53,877
Scott: Okay, so they rescue Shinji, right?

682
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:58,190
Scott: They confirm that it's him, but they put this thing around his neck like Battle Royale.

683
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:58,576
Rym: Yup.

684
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,432
Scott: That'll explode.

685
00:48:59,452 --> 00:49:03,502
Scott: so they can kill him and control him because he's basically super dangerous.

686
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:06,430
Scott: Like if he pilots an Eva, it could cause the apocalypse again.

687
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:06,728
Scott: Yup.

688
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:07,673
Scott: They don't want that to happen.

689
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:12,330
Scott: It's like they want to have Shinji, but they don't want to let him do anything because it's too dangerous.

690
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:12,710
Scott: Yup.

691
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:20,930
Scott: So Shinji sort of, you know, you see, he sees the positives and the negatives of the will side, and then he gets, goes over to the nerve side.

692
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:37,850
Scott: It's a very sort of, you know, cliche thing where, you know, you have a character, you know, you have two sides opposing each other and you have a character who, you know, goes from one side to the other and possibly back and, you know, sees the good and the bad sides of each of the two sides.

693
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,649
Rym: I got to say nerve.

694
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,030
Scott: Sort of a neutral perspective.

695
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,330
Scott: Nerve felt a lot.

696
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,057
Scott: I feel like a lot of stories have done this.

697
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:44,122
Scott: A lot of movies have done this.

698
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:46,050
Scott: I just can't think of any other examples right now.

699
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:52,170
Rym: Nerve on the moon and all the nerve bullshit from like the third movie and the fourth movie.

700
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:58,480
Rym: They reminded me a lot of Zybok, like that empire from Escaflowne compared to the rest of the world in Escaflowne.

701
00:49:59,271 --> 00:50:03,110
Rym: It was like this black pyramid technologically driven like robot society.

702
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:06,289
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if you remember that too much.

703
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:07,628
Scott: Not too much.

704
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:13,266
Rym: But yes, I do enjoy both the cyclical parallelism that happens in movie two.

705
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,199
Rym: Shinji actually grows a lot and is a much better person and much more assertive.

706
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,802
Rym: and everyone's happier.

707
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:26,390
Rym: because at a few points along the way, Gendo says good job.

708
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,368
Rym: Misato explains something.

709
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,190
Rym: Like all along the way, Asuka admits something.

710
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:39,030
Rym: Like there are like five moments where someone explains something to Shinji, where in the original show they didn't say shit.

711
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:42,140
Rym: And as a result, Shinji is just a better person.

712
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:44,850
Rym: And you see everyone is doing better as a result.

713
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,730
Rym: Shinji works hard to just help Rei like live a better life and be happy.

714
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,587
Scott: I wasn't going to talk about any of this stuff until the end, Dan.

715
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,910
Rym: Oh, I wanted to talk about it because in the third movie.

716
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:57,630
Scott: That's the whole point of the whole thing.

717
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:05,330
Rym: But in the third movie, now you see Shinji realizes, it's clear he realizes that this isn't like the same Rei.

718
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,990
Rym: But he tries to do the same thing again.

719
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,310
Rym: But he gets more and more despairing because he's failing because she doesn't have that connection.

720
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,050
Rym: She doesn't actually come around until living with the humans in that refuge later.

721
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:30,810
Rym: And you see her almost come full circle and then the clone of Rei that Shinji tried to rehabilitate based on his experiences with the first Rei ends up being the one who rehabilitates Shinji.

722
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:33,949
Rym: I really like how that played out.

723
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,775
Scott: So Shinji is playing both sides here, right?

724
00:51:36,856 --> 00:51:37,918
Scott: I forget.

725
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:42,950
Scott: Does he get like rescued by Nerve or like Rei comes and he goes with her by choice?

726
00:51:43,412 --> 00:51:48,750
Rym: He leaves, he goes back with Rei by choice.

727
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:49,950
Scott: Right.

728
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:55,990
Scott: But anyway, so at Nerve, you know, he sees Kaoru there, hangs out with Kaoru, right?

729
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,110
Scott: He, you know, he doesn't see his dad too much, right?

730
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,690
Rym: Well, because his dad at that point is already grafting the key of Nebuchadnezzar into his soul.

731
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,453
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

732
00:52:06,055 --> 00:52:09,446
Scott: But basically what happens is they got the Mega Eva there.

733
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:10,750
Scott: What unit number is it?

734
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:13,583
Rym: Well, Unit 13 is like the super one.

735
00:52:13,985 --> 00:52:15,170
Rym: Got to get a full of a wiki at this point.

736
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:21,368
Rym: There's so many Eva's and they're all like specifically distinct and you could literally do a 20 or 30 minute podcast.

737
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,715
Scott: But 13 is the one.

738
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:27,227
Scott: basically in the original TV series, you had the DDR episode, right?

739
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,730
Scott: Shinji and Asuka having to, you know, work in concert here.

740
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:33,375
Scott: They take that idea to the next level.

741
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,160
Scott: Shinji and Kaoru have to.

742
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,550
Scott: literally it's a dual plug, you know, Unit 13.

743
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,710
Scott: They have to go in together.

744
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:45,290
Rym: Well, because you need two souls to trigger the, I guess, now the fourth impact.

745
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:53,950
Scott: Well, yeah, and you need the two spears, right, Cassius and Longinus to do what Gendo wants to have happen.

746
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,130
Scott: Right.

747
00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:04,830
Scott: So this is basically, you know, that this is the, you know, Unit 13 as opposed to the, you know, the one that was made on the moon, which was six.

748
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:06,647
Scott: I think I said I don't remember five.

749
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:07,815
Rym: No, it wasn't five.

750
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:09,342
Rym: I fucking I got to pull up the wiki.

751
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:10,729
Rym: There's so many of these things now.

752
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:19,230
Scott: Yeah, but that one, the one that Kaoru piloted to stop Shinji in the post credit scene of two is still basically down there.

753
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:23,130
Scott: Hold, you know, keeping right at the keeping things at bay.

754
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:23,871
Rym: Right.

755
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:27,770
Rym: Well, even before that, actually total aside, but I did notice this in the end.

756
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:33,330
Rym: It's basically apparent that to trigger the full on like ascension impact nonsense.

757
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,966
Rym: You need four avas or four things to make it happen.

758
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:37,790
Rym: There's four atoms.

759
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:38,913
Rym: They need the two.

760
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:42,190
Rym: They need the four ships at the end and all that stuff from the last movie.

761
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:50,310
Rym: But there's that organization with the Vatican treaty that says any given country can only have three avas.

762
00:53:51,911 --> 00:54:00,570
Rym: It's very clear upon seeing the last movie, three avas was the limit, because if you had four, you could do what nerve is trying to do in the third and fourth movies.

763
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:02,013
Scott: Exactly.

764
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:04,457
Scott: So, yeah.

765
00:54:04,477 --> 00:54:05,959
Scott: So movie three.

766
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:06,901
Scott: Right.

767
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:11,910
Scott: How does this thing fucking end this?

768
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:16,206
Scott: So they're piloting the mega thirteen together.

769
00:54:16,226 --> 00:54:16,306
Scott: Yeah.

770
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:16,788
Rym: Right.

771
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:21,510
Rym: And they're going along with it to save humanity.

772
00:54:22,011 --> 00:54:22,612
Rym: But what?

773
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:25,196
Rym: the only thing that bothers me about this is they go down to do.

774
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:32,870
Rym: they go to do the thing to pull the spears out of the thing that is clearly an ally with body.

775
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:38,649
Rym: Like I don't want to get too much into the cosmology because then we'll have to like look at the wiki to use all the right proper nouns.

776
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:43,330
Rym: But there's a moment where some unexplained things happen right at the last moment.

777
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:45,155
Rym: Jinji's ready to do it.

778
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:47,802
Rym: And cowards like, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up.

779
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,490
Rym: Those spears are not the right spears.

780
00:54:50,730 --> 00:55:01,813
Rym: Something's wrong, which is that is that is the moment that happens in the original show where Kaoru goes all the way down to the bottom of terminal dogma, where that what the what.

781
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:12,910
Rym: the whole time, Masato, the show, everyone has told the viewer, told Shinji, told say everyone believes that what is crucified in terminal dogma is Adam.

782
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,413
Rym: And Kaoru shows up.

783
00:55:14,855 --> 00:55:21,290
Rym: And one of the most like the biggest moments in all of the original Evangelion show is Kaoru looking at it and saying, wait, what?

784
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,424
Rym: Lilith, what the fuck's going on?

785
00:55:24,444 --> 00:55:25,570
Rym: That's not Adam.

786
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:26,452
Scott: Right.

787
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:27,637
Scott: So that's a good point.

788
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:30,367
Scott: Brings back how this is a rebuild where it has that same point.

789
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:31,831
Scott: Right.

790
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:32,995
Scott: But completely different.

791
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:33,216
Scott: Right.

792
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:34,018
Scott: Instead of him.

793
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:34,439
Scott: Right.

794
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:37,970
Scott: Where Kaoru recognizes that there's a sham going on.

795
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:38,291
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:42,588
Scott: And so now that he recognizes that, well, doing this is not what he wants to do.

797
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:43,130
Scott: Right.

798
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:44,131
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:46,662
Scott: Is it going to achieve his angel ends?

800
00:55:46,682 --> 00:55:48,550
Scott: He just kills it.

801
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:54,050
Scott: You know, well, he got Tringy to trust him earlier by taking off the battle royale thing and putting it on himself, the nothing.

802
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:56,278
Scott: And then he just kills himself with it.

803
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,750
Rym: He gets decapitated, just like in the original show.

804
00:55:58,911 --> 00:56:02,830
Rym: That's a that's one of those like inviolable beats of Evangelion.

805
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:03,832
Rym: That character.

806
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:10,470
Scott: So they were starting that, you know, they were restarting the impact again and then they didn't have the impact.

807
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:11,392
Rym: Yep.

808
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:15,110
Scott: And I like how, like I said before, you're about to win the game.

809
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,060
Scott: We stopped you in the post credit scene.

810
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:18,507
Scott: You're about to win the game.

811
00:56:18,527 --> 00:56:19,070
Scott: All right.

812
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:19,854
Scott: We stopped you.

813
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:20,578
Scott: Right.

814
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:22,448
Scott: Because Kaoru noticed and he stopped you.

815
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:22,790
Scott: Right.

816
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,857
Rym: And then the end end, we we almost come full circle of.

817
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:31,070
Rym: the world is even more fucked, like so much more than it was after the near third impact.

818
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:35,423
Rym: And yet humans are still hanging on.

819
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:37,690
Rym: Technology has advanced even further.

820
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:50,430
Rym: Like, so I really like that opening for where they go down to Paris to reactivate something European nerve had been working on to nullify anti-AT fields.

821
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:51,671
Scott: Mm hmm.

822
00:56:52,152 --> 00:56:58,486
Scott: So what's happened is in the in the sort of not complete, you know, whatever number impact.

823
00:56:58,526 --> 00:57:00,510
Scott: it was at the end of the fucking third movie.

824
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,493
Scott: There's a lot of impacts.

825
00:57:02,577 --> 00:57:02,737
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,570
Scott: The world is covered in red shit, just like at the original end of Ava movie.

827
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,635
Scott: But it didn't finish the job.

828
00:57:10,196 --> 00:57:15,889
Scott: So obviously, if you're human and you go out in the red shit, well, that's you're going to become just, you know, LCL or whatever happens.

829
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,011
Scott: Right.

830
00:57:17,493 --> 00:57:23,710
Scott: But if you they've created some sort of protective shields, they can keep it out of certain areas.

831
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:30,150
Rym: I like how that technology was not explained specifically, but was used consistently in many, many parts of the movies.

832
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:36,528
Scott: And it makes perfect sense even given a movie, you know, the original end of the Evangelion movies.

833
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:37,190
Scott: Right.

834
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,735
Scott: It makes sense even given that.

835
00:57:39,157 --> 00:57:39,317
Scott: Right.

836
00:57:39,357 --> 00:57:40,120
Scott: You made it fit.

837
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,742
Scott: Exactly.

838
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:43,010
Scott: So that oh, that red stuff is just.

839
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,097
Scott: Yeah, it literally is just what it is.

840
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:52,330
Scott: So and because the Ava pilots are different, they're not they don't age.

841
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,995
Scott: They're all special children, whatever.

842
00:57:55,456 --> 00:58:02,210
Scott: They can go out into the red stuff with Ava's or not and fight and set up, you know, safe areas.

843
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:07,789
Scott: And that humans can move into those safe areas as long as they maintain the equipment that Will has set up and such.

844
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:16,610
Rym: And it's just that a lot of it is just this humanity using technology and perseverance to continue to just fight to survive.

845
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,632
Rym: Yeah.

846
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:18,695
Scott: So you get this whole.

847
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:24,449
Scott: it's a lot like, you know, there's that angelic days, like spinoff non-canon thing, whatever it is.

848
00:58:24,529 --> 00:58:24,730
Scott: Right.

849
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,197
Scott: But this sort of is kind of like that.

850
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,420
Scott: It's like, hey, we made it.

851
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,670
Scott: You know, here's a town where people are living and, you know, living life for reals.

852
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:34,552
Scott: Right.

853
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:37,727
Scott: You know, you can experience it and get your shit together.

854
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:37,827
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:38,390
Scott: Right.

856
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:57,110
Scott: And it's just really weird to see this kind of thing, because Evangelion, all of it up until this point, takes place in space cities alone in military base type places.

857
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:57,570
Scott: Yeah.

858
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:57,811
Scott: Right.

859
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:06,530
Scott: It never once had a town like location with just people chilling, doing town stuff until this point.

860
00:59:07,897 --> 00:59:08,730
Scott: So that's really something.

861
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:09,170
Rym: Yep.

862
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:16,050
Rym: And you see Asuka and all these characters living kind of what the best life they could live given the circumstances.

863
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:24,130
Rym: And it's really just a story about humanity being worth saving and worth like it's unique in the universe, in the cosmology of Eva.

864
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:29,570
Rym: Because remember the cosmology, like what's happening if you've seen the first show, like it's actually pretty explicit.

865
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:36,964
Rym: Well, in ancient times, something, a seed of life from deep space crashed into Earth.

866
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:40,070
Scott: And that was Adam and Adam at the South Pole.

867
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:40,450
Rym: Yep.

868
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:42,555
Scott: Well, it came in and Adam came in a bit.

869
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:43,697
Scott: It was like a big sphere.

870
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:44,298
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:49,850
Rym: And inside the sphere was Adam and well, Adam and a sphere of Longinus.

872
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:51,221
Scott: Yeah.

873
00:59:51,502 --> 00:59:54,410
Scott: And disease scrolls, basically all this equipment.

874
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:07,670
Rym: And what Adam was going to do is populate the Earth with life driven from the fruit of life, which is the S2 engine power, infinitely powerful godlike beings.

875
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,232
Rym: That's Adam.

876
01:00:08,653 --> 01:00:09,696
Rym: They don't have free will.

877
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:10,819
Rym: Like there's no culture.

878
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,103
Rym: There's a whole thing about them.

879
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,730
Rym: Undecipherable space things.

880
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:18,570
Rym: All the angels are basically life forms derived from Adam.

881
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:30,770
Scott: And presumably in a, in a, you know, 2001 Space Odyssey like fashion, there were many seeds of, you know, that were spread throughout the universe and galaxies that landed on various habitable places.

882
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,437
Scott: Similarly, just like Adam did and populated those planets.

883
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,250
Scott: But alien race that sent these out also sent out seeds of knowledge.

884
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:41,934
Rym: And they had a rule.

885
01:00:42,154 --> 01:00:48,710
Rym: And the rule was you can never have these two kinds of life in the same place at the same time.

886
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,677
Scott: And that's a biblical story, right?

887
01:00:50,697 --> 01:00:53,750
Scott: It's like Adam and Eve couldn't eat from the tree of knowledge.

888
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:54,332
Rym: Yep.

889
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:55,504
Rym: You get one life or knowledge.

890
01:00:55,747 --> 01:00:55,989
Scott: Pick one.

891
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,172
Scott: It's the story of Genesis, right?

892
01:00:57,192 --> 01:01:05,210
Scott: You, God is like, you can live in this paradise and live forever and everything's amazing as long as you don't fucking know anything.

893
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:07,835
Scott: You don't even realize that you're naked.

894
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:08,356
Scott: Right?

895
01:01:08,556 --> 01:01:12,344
Scott: And as soon as Adam eats the apple from the tree, right?

896
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:13,987
Scott: God's like, what the fuck?

897
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:15,730
Scott: Now you know things and you're powerful.

898
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:17,093
Scott: That makes you like me.

899
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:18,215
Scott: I can't have that.

900
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:19,037
Scott: I'm the me.

901
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:19,919
Scott: I'm the God.

902
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:20,580
Scott: Not you.

903
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,221
Scott: Right?

904
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:22,885
Scott: I have power and knowledge.

905
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:24,508
Scott: You only have one or the other.

906
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:25,230
Scott: Fuck you.

907
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:32,810
Rym: So the plot of the original show of Evangelion, and this is extremely specific and straightforward.

908
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,390
Scott: It has the word Genesis in the title.

909
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:34,831
Scott: Yep.

910
01:01:35,352 --> 01:01:46,150
Rym: So what happens is with the first impact, the fruit of knowledge, Lilith, the other kind of life, crashes into Earth by accident.

911
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:47,389
Scott: In Japan.

912
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:53,010
Scott: It happens to land very- Well, it's by accident, but in the movies we learn that actually that happens every time.

913
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,053
Rym: Yeah.

914
01:01:55,017 --> 01:01:57,670
Rym: Well, at least it happens every time to Earth.

915
01:01:58,311 --> 01:01:58,491
Scott: Right?

916
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:03,958
Scott: Earth always is the place where that gets to and it's never supposed to be to.

917
01:02:04,038 --> 01:02:10,446
Scott: So this ritual of the impact ritual is actually just like this safety mechanism.

918
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,250
Scott: like that, you know, God, the alien gods put there.

919
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:18,750
Scott: Like, oh, if two of these accidentally land on the same planet, they'll destroy each other in like a massive apocalypse.

920
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:23,229
Scott: And that way there won't ever be any godlike beings out there.

921
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:24,950
Rym: Only one will survive.

922
01:02:25,232 --> 01:02:27,448
Rym: So what happens is the spear- Or none.

923
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:33,544
Rym: So arguably the spear of Longinus comes along as that safety, like, that's like.

924
01:02:33,564 --> 01:02:35,910
Rym: the spears are almost the enforcers of these rules.

925
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:41,570
Rym: So when Lilith crashes, there's only, in the original Eva, there's only one spear, the spear of Longinus.

926
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,679
Rym: Now we don't know in the show if that was atmosphere or Lilith's spear.

927
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:50,510
Rym: All we know is that when Lilith crashes, the Earth gets covered in Lilith life.

928
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:57,888
Rym: And as a result, the spear basically stabs Adam and says, "Well, there can only be one, so this is Lilith's planet

929
01:02:57,928 --> 01:02:58,088
Rym: now.".

930
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,652
Rym: And that's fine.

931
01:03:00,253 --> 01:03:15,730
Rym: The second impact happens when Sele and Nerv and all these fuck-ups go to the South Pole, find Adam, pull the spear out- Yeah, they fuck around, they pull the spear out, and now there's two, and that's a problem.

932
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,550
Scott: Now angels start coming, right?

933
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:23,110
Rym: So Adam wakes up, they then use the spear to reseal Adam with the spear, they get rid of Adam life.

934
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:26,916
Scott: The angels are the Adam life, right?

935
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:32,070
Scott: So the angels are now coming to attack Lilith to end the Lilith life.

936
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:44,130
Rym: So basically what happens is they wake up Adam, they kill him again, they take an embryo that they took from him, like they take this piece, and that's what Kaji steals and brings back to Nerv for Candidoo's bullshit.

937
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:49,761
Rym: But in that moment, Adam basically said, "Yo, there's a problem

938
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:50,042
Rym: here!".

939
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:54,230
Rym: And all the angels come to fuck up the Lilith life and give the planet back to Adam.

940
01:03:56,171 --> 01:04:00,140
Rym: So what were the angels actually doing in the original Evangelion and in the remake?

941
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:05,430
Rym: They're coming to kill Lilith and everything that spawned from Lilith, including- Which is all humans.

942
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:05,962
Rym: Yep.

943
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,398
Scott: Yeah.

944
01:04:07,661 --> 01:04:08,330
Scott: Kill all humans.

945
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,829
Rym: It's a pretty straightforward sci-fi story.

946
01:04:11,972 --> 01:04:15,524
Scott: Yeah, it's just they never explain it to you in words outright.

947
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,330
Scott: You have to, you know, you watch it and then eventually- No!

948
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:22,150
Rym: If you watch the original show with the extended versions of episodes, what, 23 and 24?

949
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,089
Scott: They explain it a little bit more.

950
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:28,150
Rym: They explain it enough more to figure a lot of this out on your own without reading a wiki.

951
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:33,702
Scott: And I think the point of it is that all that stuff, like what is actually happening?

952
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:34,724
Scott: Why are it, right?

953
01:04:34,744 --> 01:04:36,990
Scott: It's like, you know, that stuff actually doesn't matter.

954
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,420
Scott: No.

955
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:41,194
Rym: Because the moral of Ava is humans talk to each other.

956
01:04:41,655 --> 01:04:42,436
Rym: It's painful.

957
01:04:42,856 --> 01:04:44,799
Rym: The separated existence is painful.

958
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:47,001
Rym: But human life is special.

959
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:54,290
Rym: The fact that we are all individual and can never fully know each other is what makes the diversity of life on Earth so unique in the universe.

960
01:04:56,731 --> 01:05:04,824
Scott: And so, right, the movies and the TV show, right, so basically, did I say this when we did the original episode on the movies?

961
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,390
Scott: But they're both saying the same exact thing, right?

962
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,890
Scott: Is I could make a story, you know, like an Aesop's Fable, right?

963
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:15,570
Rym: It's literally called the Hedgehog's Dilemma.

964
01:05:16,472 --> 01:05:16,652
Scott: Right.

965
01:05:16,752 --> 01:05:25,550
Scott: I can make an Aesop's Fable called Tortoise and the Hare, and the message I want to get across is that slow and steady wins the race, right?

966
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:33,610
Scott: So in the original Aesop's Fable, obviously, the hare, right, doesn't win and the tortoise wins, right?

967
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:42,550
Scott: But you could tell the same story, right, and just flip the script but still have the same moral.

968
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:46,596
Scott: And that is what the movie does in the original TV series, right?

969
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:55,730
Scott: The moral is just talk to each other and they show you what happens when you don't talk to each other.

970
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:56,172
Scott: Yup.

971
01:05:56,212 --> 01:05:56,495
Scott: Right?

972
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:57,790
Scott: It sucks.

973
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:04,043
Rym: But the movie, too, is so, so specifically like, "Hey, what would happen if people actually talked to each other a little bit?

974
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:06,749
Rym: Look, look how much happier literally everyone

975
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:06,889
Rym: is.".

976
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:10,370
Rym: Even Gendo is closer to being happy.

977
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:11,433
Scott: That's right.

978
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:16,510
Scott: So in Tortoise and the Hare, they show you the tortoise being slow and steady and then winning.

979
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:20,964
Scott: You could do the same thing and have the tortoise not be steady.

980
01:06:21,104 --> 01:06:22,830
Scott: The tortoise give up and lose.

981
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:23,269
Scott: Yup.

982
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:27,110
Scott: And that would give you the same message, right, which is slow and steady wins the race.

983
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,331
Rym: Yup.

984
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:28,128
Scott: You could have won, tortoise.

985
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:28,571
Scott: Same message.

986
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:29,696
Scott: Talk to each other.

987
01:06:29,897 --> 01:06:33,050
Scott: You just show the positive and the negative side, right?

988
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,996
Scott: They did it and it was good.

989
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,481
Scott: They didn't do it and it sucked.

990
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:38,367
Scott: Either way, same message.

991
01:06:38,648 --> 01:06:39,270
Scott: Same story.

992
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:48,270
Rym: Zooming all the way out but taking into account, because what I like about Evangelion is the same thing I like specifically about Shoujo Kakame Utena.

993
01:06:50,091 --> 01:07:02,830
Rym: It's relatively rare to have a large work like that where a literal reading of the events as portrayed is equally compelling to a purely allegorical reading of the events as portrayed.

994
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:05,679
Rym: And I appreciate that.

995
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,150
Rym: That's one of the things I like more than almost anything in media.

996
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:28,810
Rym: So taking the literal events as they're portrayed, the sci-fi aspect of this, I would say that the fundamental story that these Rebuild movies tell is that in the cosmic universe there's the Adam life and the Lilith life and humanity is almost an accident that comes about in this weird situation.

997
01:07:29,751 --> 01:07:42,890
Rym: And the moral at the end is the Wunderville, the third spear, is that humans are unique and special enough to where they should break the cycle of these rules of the gods and become their own thing.

998
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:57,430
Rym: They are a free willed, free spirited, new kind of life that arises from this intersection and they should overcome that instead of trying to become Lilith or Adam style gods.

999
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:08,330
Rym: Because Gendo, Sele, all these groups, everyone who's trying to use Evas are using them to try to merge these powers together and become gods playing by the rules of the gods.

1000
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:14,010
Rym: But there's this side story of humans are scarily capable by themselves.

1001
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,875
Scott: Somehow, even though, how did humans make all this shit?

1002
01:08:21,778 --> 01:08:24,582
Scott: This goes back to Evangelion as a whole.

1003
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:30,470
Scott: just being, this guy Anno is a real big fan of Godzilla and Ultraman and all this old robot fighty stuff.

1004
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:34,317
Scott: And most of the show, yeah, it's just robot fighty stuff because he likes that sort of thing.

1005
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:41,149
Scott: You see in all of these movies, lots and lots of scenes of just huge battles that aren't really contributing to the story.

1006
01:08:41,471 --> 01:08:44,529
Scott: It's just Anno's a nerd who likes big robot battles.

1007
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,670
Scott: I'm a nerd, I like big robot battles too.

1008
01:08:49,792 --> 01:09:14,770
Scott: But in all of those stories, Ultraman, Godzilla, et cetera, all of those are stories about some huge catastrophe coming to squash humanity and humanity combines its efforts and organizes and cooperates to develop, usually by technology and science, some amazing effort to not get destroyed.

1009
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:29,149
Scott: And so in the original Evangelion and this one, but in this one even more so, always showing you, look at this amazing shit that all these human organizations were able to make with their science.

1010
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:30,492
Rym: The gods are fighting.

1011
01:09:31,032 --> 01:09:41,670
Rym: And meanwhile, under the gods, this tiny ragtag band of humans have made spaceships powered by AT fields and somehow have survived.

1012
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:49,569
Scott: This angel that's mysterious alien thing with ridiculous powers that's enormous is coming, right?

1013
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:53,950
Scott: And somehow this robot that some humans made is going to fight it and win.

1014
01:09:56,291 --> 01:10:02,289
Scott: That carries on from episode one of the TV show to the last second of the last movie.

1015
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:10,990
Rym: And it comes all the way around to Shinji now having ultimate power and the spear of Ville, like the literally human free will.

1016
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:17,605
Rym: And he decides, unlike all the alternative decisions he has made in various iterations of Eva, you know what?

1017
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:19,430
Rym: The problem is Eva's.

1018
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:26,710
Rym: The problem is humans are still evolving and still have a lot of room to grow.

1019
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:31,383
Rym: It is not time to give them the cosmic space seeds and destroy them.

1020
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:33,449
Rym: Let them continue to evolve and see where they go.

1021
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:34,491
Scott: Yep.

1022
01:10:34,532 --> 01:10:40,727
Scott: So at the end of the last movie, right, they give you, it's like, what could they do in Eva, right?

1023
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:47,388
Scott: That is like the equivalent of like, you know, the terrible secret of space, like the thing, right?

1024
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:51,139
Scott: It's like they have Gendo and Shinji sit around and chat.

1025
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,710
Scott: It's like you couldn't put more, what bigger payoff could you get?

1026
01:10:57,171 --> 01:11:02,890
Rym: The biggest payoff in the whole thing was you get the scene of Shinji talking to himself, you know, same as End of Evangelion.

1027
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:09,069
Rym: But then when it's Gendo and they're just talking and he's like, "Gendo, why are you

1028
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:09,470
Rym: sad?".

1029
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,355
Rym: And then Gendo's like, "Oh, I'm sad because of

1030
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,036
Rym: XYZ.".

1031
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:13,580
Rym: And it's like, hello?

1032
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:17,330
Rym: You could have just said this to each other in the real world.

1033
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:19,129
Scott: Three movies ago and 26 episodes ago.

1034
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:21,789
Rym: And none of this apocalypse shit would have even happened.

1035
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,189
Scott: Well, Sele might have just went out then.

1036
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:26,270
Rym: Yeah, or, well anyway.

1037
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:35,028
Rym: But basically you see that all the mysterious bullshit that all like, "Ooh, Gendo's up to something.

1038
01:11:35,088 --> 01:11:35,549
Rym: Sele's up to

1039
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:35,750
Rym: something.".

1040
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:44,270
Scott: No, Gendo just- Gendo's just a really messed up dude who just only loves this one woman and otherwise didn't love people at all before then.

1041
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,739
Rym: Gendo, same as Shinji.

1042
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,510
Rym: Just a human who's fucked up by the world.

1043
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,413
Rym: Sele?

1044
01:11:50,857 --> 01:11:52,249
Rym: They're just fucked up old people.

1045
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:54,780
Scott: Or are they?

1046
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,066
Scott: Is Sele even people?

1047
01:11:56,106 --> 01:11:57,030
Scott: That's a separate issue.

1048
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:03,510
Scott: It's implied that Sele might be one person or some AIs or they used to be people who were uploaded in the computer.

1049
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:12,849
Rym: Yeah, because notice when they're all being killed in the movies, you see this flash of a nervous system fading out in those coffins each time.

1050
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:14,671
Scott: Yep.

1051
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:15,996
Scott: It's a little HAL 9000-esque.

1052
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:19,387
Scott: I think it wasn't someone pulling something out of a wall or something.

1053
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:20,310
Rym: Anyway, that's not relevant.

1054
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:41,950
Rym: I would say that my best guess as to what Sele is based on all of the Eva stuff is they are humans who figured this stuff out and tried to follow the script, like the instructions from the Dead Sea Scrolls, to make all this happen, knowing that it would happen anyway, but to survive it somehow and/or become gods.

1055
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:43,213
Rym: They didn't give a shit about humanity.

1056
01:12:43,534 --> 01:12:49,010
Rym: They individually wanted to like John Malkovich into an Eva and become gods or at least survive the apocalypse.

1057
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:52,497
Scott: So, Shinji's talking to his dad finally.

1058
01:12:52,517 --> 01:12:54,822
Scott: It's like, what bigger payoff could you have?

1059
01:12:54,842 --> 01:12:58,710
Scott: The thing that was not allowed to happen ever before in an Eva thing.

1060
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,095
Scott: They finally give it to you.

1061
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:00,678
Scott: They chat.

1062
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:03,229
Scott: They say everything that needs to be said between them.

1063
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:05,470
Rym: And then much like his dark materials.

1064
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:12,870
Scott: Well, just like the original End of Evangelion, Pure Heart for You, it goes meta.

1065
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:23,950
Scott: Pure Heart for You, you get this sort of fourth wall destroying shots of the movie theater, Anno giving his middle finger to the fanboys who didn't like the original TV ending.

1066
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,980
Rym: Oh, you didn't like my metaphysical ending?

1067
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,850
Rym: You didn't want to worry about feelings?

1068
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,137
Scott: You didn't like abstract art?

1069
01:13:29,257 --> 01:13:30,021
Scott: Okay, fine.

1070
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:31,328
Scott: I'll go even more abstract.

1071
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:31,750
Rym: Deal with it.

1072
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:37,190
Rym: Oh, you wanted to know what happened to Masato in the real world because you cared about the physical plot of the show and not about the metaphor?

1073
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:37,896
Rym: There you go.

1074
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:38,302
Rym: She's dead.

1075
01:13:38,444 --> 01:13:38,829
Rym: Fuck you.

1076
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:45,510
Scott: Yeah, so much like that fourth wall, we then we again break the fourth wall, right?

1077
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:53,850
Scott: But this time in the fourth wall breakage, you have this sort of, you know, duality of no more Avas, right?

1078
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:59,645
Scott: It's the no more Avas that Rym just explained of Shinji saying, yeah, no more Avas.

1079
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,250
Scott: Let's let's get our human on here.

1080
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:04,747
Scott: Yeah, but also no more Avas in this real world.

1081
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:05,129
Scott: That's it.

1082
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:06,152
Rym: I made it right.

1083
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:07,034
Rym: I made it like four times.

1084
01:14:07,134 --> 01:14:07,976
Scott: I rebuilt it.

1085
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:08,317
Scott: Right.

1086
01:14:08,798 --> 01:14:09,300
Rym: I made it.

1087
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:17,470
Scott: It was a thing, you know, and then I rebuilt it and now it's done.

1088
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,596
Rym: I mean, it literally ends with like the credits.

1089
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:23,163
Rym: It's a drone shot of a real city.

1090
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:26,190
Rym: Like how much more on the nose could you get?

1091
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,611
Rym: Right.

1092
01:14:26,972 --> 01:14:27,595
Scott: Much like.

1093
01:14:27,615 --> 01:14:27,856
Scott: Yeah.

1094
01:14:28,137 --> 01:14:31,390
Scott: Stop watching the, you know, get out of the cartoons and get back into the real world.

1095
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:31,611
Scott: Right.

1096
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:37,629
Scott: You know, much like in the show, there's some sort of a time loop of this thing happening over and over.

1097
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:43,369
Scott: But even if that's true, in the real world that we in the real human world that we live in.

1098
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:44,072
Scott: Right.

1099
01:14:44,152 --> 01:14:49,970
Scott: It's implied that Arno has basically been just Ava has been coming, you know, in his life over and over.

1100
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:55,068
Scott: He's had to do Ava over and over, even after, you know, that it was done in the 90s.

1101
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,477
Scott: But he's had to keep Ava-ing.

1102
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:58,240
Scott: Right.

1103
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:00,449
Scott: Like it was so he was so tied to it.

1104
01:15:02,392 --> 01:15:04,996
Rym: Look at all the the infinite pile of Ava.

1105
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:14,570
Rym: Like you could say if you want to be a nerd about it, you can make a very strong argument that this loop has been happening forever and that the original show was just one of the failed loops.

1106
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:19,342
Rym: And this is the final loop where everything lines up the right way.

1107
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:21,066
Rym: But you don't have to read it that way.

1108
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:22,209
Rym: And it tells the same story.

1109
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:26,279
Scott: But what is definitely final is that in the real world.

1110
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:26,800
Scott: Right.

1111
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:31,030
Scott: The, you know, Hideaki Arno's loop of having to Ava over and over.

1112
01:15:31,491 --> 01:15:35,980
Scott: It's like he rebuilt it and now he has escaped.

1113
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,220
Scott: Right.

1114
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,967
Scott: The human being has escaped the Avas.

1115
01:15:39,987 --> 01:15:41,310
Scott: He doesn't have to Ava anymore.

1116
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,390
Scott: He can now do other things instead with the rest of however long he lives.

1117
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:46,452
Rym: I do.

1118
01:15:46,612 --> 01:15:47,293
Rym: I do actually.

1119
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:56,650
Rym: Some people critique this, but I did enjoy the uneven style of these four movies because I liked how radically different they felt.

1120
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,372
Scott: Like they were all the same.

1121
01:15:58,392 --> 01:15:59,575
Scott: That would be kind of boring.

1122
01:15:59,595 --> 01:16:07,470
Rym: The fight scenes in the last ones almost felt like like a promo kind of like ridiculous overwrought situation.

1123
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:18,250
Scott: But I mean, every just about every movie that says, you know, it's like, what are you going to complain that, like, you know, Star Wars, the original trilogy, all three were different styles.

1124
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:18,891
Scott: Right.

1125
01:16:19,392 --> 01:16:22,419
Scott: Indiana Jones, three different styles.

1126
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,862
Scott: You know, only three.

1127
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:27,390
Scott: All these Lord of the Rings, you know, I guess they were closer.

1128
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,895
Scott: The three Lord of the Rings movies.

1129
01:16:29,336 --> 01:16:31,182
Rym: They all they all felt the same.

1130
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:33,430
Scott: That was that they still had a little bit of difference.

1131
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,179
Rym: I don't think they actually did.

1132
01:16:35,339 --> 01:16:35,862
Rym: They did not it.

1133
01:16:35,962 --> 01:16:37,410
Scott: Not as much as the other examples.

1134
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:42,120
Rym: That's actually one of my main complaints is how Back to the Future.

1135
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:42,902
Scott: Very different.

1136
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:43,965
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1137
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:44,627
Scott: Yeah.

1138
01:16:44,908 --> 01:16:45,570
Scott: The most different.

1139
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:51,487
Rym: Well, especially because Back to the Future was a weird like when it was physically just talked about alien.

1140
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:52,430
Scott: So different.

1141
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:52,751
Scott: Yeah.

1142
01:16:53,112 --> 01:16:58,144
Rym: But Back to the Future, the first movie was made in the pre VFX era.

1143
01:16:58,505 --> 01:17:00,510
Rym: The third movie was made in the VFX era.

1144
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:07,930
Rym: And the middle movie was made in like this Roger Rabbit era of the early VFX mixed with practical effects.

1145
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:10,137
Rym: And it was like this weird time in cinema.

1146
01:17:10,519 --> 01:17:13,970
Scott: And that contributed to actually seeing the second one, the least only maybe one or two times.

1147
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:22,350
Rym: You should watch the Captain Disillusion thing where he breaks down how they did the special effects and Back to the Future to specifically because it is nuts.

1148
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,415
Rym: Absolutely bonkers.

1149
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:25,378
Scott: Yeah.

1150
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:29,090
Scott: So anyway, see, that's the end of the the fourth movie.

1151
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:33,301
Scott: So these movies, I mean, I like that.

1152
01:17:33,341 --> 01:17:36,350
Scott: they exist because in existing right.

1153
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:43,150
Scott: The original I said this before, the original TV series is enhanced just because these are here.

1154
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,399
Rym: Oh, do you know how hard I want to watch the original show again?

1155
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,410
Rym: Just bearing in mind everything I've experienced from these movies.

1156
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,351
Scott: Right.

1157
01:17:51,391 --> 01:17:57,530
Scott: The TV show that already existed, that without editing it whatsoever by simply creating these other movies.

1158
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:05,110
Scott: Those twenty six, twenty eight episodes right of anime are now better than they were before these movies existed.

1159
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:05,651
Rym: Yep.

1160
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:12,710
Rym: Because I can watch the original and I can contrast the beats between the original and the new one in either direction.

1161
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:13,931
Scott: Yep.

1162
01:18:13,991 --> 01:18:16,559
Scott: But are these movies, though, are the movie?

1163
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,690
Scott: I don't think the movies are as good as the TV show.

1164
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:30,270
Rym: No, I like them a lot, partly because they did wrap up a lot of the sci fi and I was interested in because once they got a lot of fan service, they got a lot of fun stuff.

1165
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,216
Scott: But they also have a lot of issues.

1166
01:18:34,396 --> 01:18:35,519
Scott: Just, you know, it's like you can't.

1167
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:40,310
Scott: really can you watch these without having, you know, knowing anything about Ava?

1168
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:42,479
Scott: Yes, but no, it'd be hard.

1169
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,484
Rym: But you know what I would say?

1170
01:18:43,504 --> 01:18:44,670
Rym: There's an easy answer to that.

1171
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:54,350
Rym: Generally, with very few exceptions, the best way to experience media like this, where there's like a complicated situation, watch the thing in the order it was published.

1172
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:55,631
Scott: Of course.

1173
01:18:55,912 --> 01:19:01,863
Rym: So watch the show, all things, watch the Ava movies, watch the rebuild movies in that order.

1174
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,650
Rym: That is the best way to experience all of this, because it's the best of experience.

1175
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:09,881
Scott: I say that for everything, no matter what, because the movie like, oh, no, you got to use a weird order.

1176
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:12,167
Scott: And I'm like, no, do the order published?

1177
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:13,250
Scott: order for everything ever.

1178
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:20,630
Rym: The only one I ever disagree with is I think if someone wants to read the culture books, read player of games first before you.

1179
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,324
Scott: Well, I don't think those matter too much.

1180
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:22,989
Scott: They're not as.

1181
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:27,984
Rym: Well, I would say that Consider Phlebas is very different from the rest of them.

1182
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:29,970
Rym: And it also happens to be the first one published.

1183
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:32,882
Rym: But it's that's that's.

1184
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:33,669
Rym: Did you read that one?

1185
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:35,079
Scott: Most of it.

1186
01:19:35,099 --> 01:19:35,690
Scott: I didn't finish it.

1187
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:38,710
Rym: Yeah, it's the least good one, honestly.

1188
01:19:39,311 --> 01:19:42,730
Scott: They were going to some planet to find a, you know, a computer ship brain.

1189
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:49,390
Rym: Yeah, like I would read that one after you read a bunch of other culture books, but that's the only like situation where I think I could make a case.

1190
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,790
Rym: But I would say that the show is like fantastic on its own.

1191
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:01,890
Rym: The movies are lesser if you haven't seen the show because there are scenes in the movies that are interesting and good.

1192
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:10,910
Rym: But like when Asuka agrees to pilot the test, Ava, that is so much more profound to you as the viewer.

1193
01:20:11,412 --> 01:20:15,830
Rym: If you know how that went down in the original movie or the original show.

1194
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:21,870
Scott: Like there's a lot of things that you can understand just on a base level what's happening.

1195
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,790
Scott: But there's a lot of things in the movies that lose a lot of their meaning.

1196
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:33,330
Scott: And wait, if you have it like, you know, how big a deal is it of Shinji and Gendo talking to each other at the very end?

1197
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:35,009
Scott: The ultimate climax of the whole thing.

1198
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:39,989
Scott: That's how big a deal is a deal if you didn't spend 26 episodes watching them not talk.

1199
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:45,970
Rym: In the second movie, when Gendo agrees to go to the dinner party that Ray is hosting.

1200
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:51,830
Rym: One, if you saw the original Evangelion and I said those words, you would be like, what the fuck happens in those movies?

1201
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:55,288
Rym: But two, the fact that Gendo...

1202
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:57,640
Scott: It's a lot less strange for him to say yes.

1203
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,710
Scott: It's still a little strange for him to say yes to that.

1204
01:21:00,632 --> 01:21:03,430
Scott: But if you haven't seen the TV show, it's less strange.

1205
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:15,330
Rym: But if you've seen the TV show, him agreeing to go to that dinner party or Asuka trying to learn how to cook are as big a deal as another sphere of longaners coming from space and preventing the third impact.

1206
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:20,530
Rym: Like it is weird and crazy to the viewer who knows.

1207
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:26,270
Scott: It's like there's these two magnets and they had the opposite poles pointing at each other and never touching.

1208
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,740
Scott: And it's like, there's no way those can touch.

1209
01:21:28,781 --> 01:21:29,646
Scott: And suddenly they're touching.

1210
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:30,370
Scott: It's like, holy fuck.

1211
01:21:32,532 --> 01:21:33,617
Rym: So I'm glad they were made.

1212
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,283
Rym: I'm glad there'll be no more.

1213
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:36,910
Rym: I like the message.

1214
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,449
Rym: I'm glad that it just compliments the original show.

1215
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:46,310
Rym: But the original show stands alone and does not need these movies to be understood and appreciated.

1216
01:21:47,151 --> 01:21:52,670
Scott: It's better because the movies exist, but it's like, I'd rather watch the original show.

1217
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,784
Scott: The movies are like, do you need to watch these again?

1218
01:21:55,804 --> 01:21:56,850
Scott: I guess you could.

1219
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,520
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1220
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,660

01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:17,000
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

Rym: So yeah, funny story.

1229
01:23:00,644 --> 01:23:01,187
Rym: We did the show.

1230
01:23:01,568 --> 01:23:07,260
Rym: As you know, a water in the ceiling incident occurred right at the end of the last GeekNights.

1231
01:23:07,802 --> 01:23:17,156
Rym: And my mom was listening to the show after we recorded it, not during the livestream, and she DM's me and she's like, "Oh shit, is your apartment okay?

1232
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:17,337
Rym: What

1233
01:23:17,357 --> 01:23:17,698
Rym: happened?".

1234
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,786
Rym: So yeah, that's it.

1235
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,877
Rym: I hope you didn't listen to this episode.

1236
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:32,850
Rym: if you haven't seen Ava, 'cause I'm sure none of that made any sense to you, but for now, I simply leave you with... What's done is done, it feels so bad.

1237
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:35,980
Rym: What once was happy, now is sad.

1238
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:56,899
Rym: I wish that I could turn back time 'cause now the guilt is all mine Can't live without the trust from those you love.

1239
01:23:57,542 --> 01:24:01,157
Rym: I know we can't forget the past.

1240
01:24:02,263 --> 01:24:04,940
Rym: You can't forget love and pride.

1241
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:09,140
Rym: Because of that, it's killing me inside.
