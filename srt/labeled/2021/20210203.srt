1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,299
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 3rd, 2021.

2
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:11,480
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:15,309
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,875
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:21,090
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Lupin the third, the first.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,228
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,358
Scott: So, uh, two days ago-ish, right?

8
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,450
Scott: Sunday night through early yesterday, there was a blizzard in New York.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,766
Scott: It dumped a whole ton of snow, like top 10 snows of New York.

10
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:36,630
Scott: It was big time snow.

11
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:44,090
Rym: It was the kind of snow where if it wasn't COVID times, I literally would have taken days off work and, like, gotten myself upstate to stay at a ski place.

12
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:47,590
Scott: If it wasn't COVID times, I would have stayed in like it was COVID times.

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,249
Scott: Yeah, I also would have gotten a snow day.

14
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,949
Scott: Oh, my office would absolutely would have closed.

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,372
Rym: Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:57,760
Rym: And it wouldn't have been, like, actually work from home, like, all day.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,750
Rym: It would have been the work from home as in, yeah, do what you can, but yes, no.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,104
Scott: Work would have been closed, closed.

19
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:03,650
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:14,529
Scott: So, uh, when it snows like that in New York, right, you don't really want to order food delivery, even if you can, because that is such a jerk move, right?

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:15,565
Rym: Right.

22
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,830
Scott: Food delivery people shouldn't be risking their life to bring you a dinner when in the middle of a blizzard, right?

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:30,270
Rym: My policy has always been that if the weather's bad to a certain point, I'll just give a giant tip, like 20 or 30 bucks, and if it's been, like, on that point, I won't order it.

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,550
Scott: If it's raining or something, like, and I really need the food, maybe I'll do it and pay a lot, you know, but, so anyway.

25
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,130
Rym: But there's a line.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,090
Scott: There is a line, and you can tell that most people agree with this policy because every time I looked out the window, you did not see any delivery people.

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,804
Scott: I think I saw one on, like, the morning after, right?

28
00:01:49,864 --> 00:01:51,750
Scott: I saw one, and that was it, right?

29
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:59,390
Scott: So people, people are, you know, not, but then again, it's like, I wonder from the perspective of delivery person, like, you must be in a tough spot.

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,795
Scott: You're like, damn, I want money, right?

31
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:09,530
Scott: I'm not making, I'm not making anything today, but also, damn, I don't want to go outside, you know, getting an accident, who knows what, right?

32
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:14,430
Scott: So it's a tough, tough spot, I don't know, but I, you just feel guilty doing it, right?

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,650
Scott: So anyway, it comes this morning, and you look outside and the road is clear.

34
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:27,030
Scott: It's perfectly plowed and melted, and it's not precipitating, and the sun's out, and you're like, okay, it's still cold as hell.

35
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,590
Scott: But now I'm in a situation where without guilt, I can order delivery with a big ol' tiff on there.

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,816
Rym: Yeah, but it already got warm enough.

37
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,050
Rym: Snow's already, like, melted significantly.

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,466
Scott: Right, and since we've been inside for a few days and fresh air, I canceled our delivery for good reason, right?

39
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:44,590
Scott: We needed some food.

40
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:49,130
Rym: The day the blizzard happened, I put in a delivery slot for Thursday.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,330
Scott: Yeah, ours is also Thursday, but we had, like, a Monday, and it just got canceled.

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,890
Rym: I luckily happened to have gotten a Saturday, so I was good.

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:07,126
Scott: Anyway, point is, needing food, road's clear, guilt gone, tip big, I'm okay ordering bagels for breakfast, right?

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,150
Scott: That'll carry us for, you know, whenever.

45
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:14,490
Scott: So I order the bagels, you know, and I'm going, getting ready to bike inside, like I've been doing in the morning.

46
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,045
Scott: And the bagel, I realize, is specifically late, right?

47
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,250
Scott: It should've been here already, right?

48
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:25,470
Scott: So I go and I check, you know, I'm looking at the thing, what time it said it was gonna be here.

49
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,839
Scott: It said it would be here, like, you know, 8.37.

50
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,510
Scott: It's already, like, you know, closer to 9 or whatever.

51
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:38,087
Scott: And I'm, like, looking closely, and I go, oh shit, I forgot to click delivery.

52
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,169
Scott: The default is pick up.

53
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:45,557
Scott: The bagels must be sitting at the bagel place.

54
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:51,630
Scott: And the thing is, if I go to get bagels outside, there's close places that are not even at the subway.

55
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:54,204
Scott: But if I get delivery, there's a better bagel place.

56
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:55,210
Scott: that's further away.

57
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,539
Rym: Yeah, like, if I go out to get a breakfast sandwich, there's a place I'll go.

58
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,850
Rym: But if I'm ordering a delivered breakfast sandwich, there's a very specific different place I will go.

59
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,811
Scott: That's right.

60
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:12,370
Scott: So I had to suddenly not bike inside this morning, not do any normal morning stuff, and instead put clothing on, which is why I'm wearing clothing.

61
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,444
Rym: I was about to say, you're wearing, like, a real shirt.

62
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:15,887
Rym: Like, I got...

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,250
Scott: I had to go outside.

64
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,197
Rym: I got all these Hawaiian shirts that I usually would wear, like, just when I'm lounging around.

65
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:25,487
Rym: So I'm doing like that, because they kind of look like a dress-ish shirt, because there's technically a collar.

66
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:27,030
Rym: And I just got pajamas on otherwise.

67
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,652
Scott: Yeah, I know, right?

68
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:34,306
Scott: So I had to go outside this morning and walk all the way down the road to get the bagels.

69
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,550
Scott: They were just sitting there waiting for me.

70
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,884
Rym: You know, it's almost a nice excuse to just be outside, though.

71
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,230
Rym: Like, I look forward to the excuses.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,297
Scott: Well, I gave a huge tip, which I guess should have gone to me.

73
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:50,210
Scott: But instead, I guess the vehicle preparers have that money now, which is fine, but, you know.

74
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,070
Rym: Hopefully, I mean, hopefully it goes to them and not to, like, the owner of the place, if there was no delivery.

75
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,349
Scott: I'm sure they see it.

76
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,885
Rym: Well, because Amazon just got hit with, like, stealing the tips from all their drivers.

77
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:02,850
Rym: Like, that was a big thing.

78
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:14,390
Scott: But the way the systems work usually at these places is, you know, you go into any restaurant in New York City, especially a takeout delivery type restaurant, they have a tablet and maybe even a printer if they're more old school, right?

79
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:26,950
Scott: But usually just a tablet sitting there, like maybe one tablet per service or one tablet with all the services, some kind of setup, and they can see exactly the invoices of everyone putting in orders, right?

80
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,499
Scott: And then they transfer that over to their internal system, right?

81
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:34,770
Scott: Usually printing out a ticket for, like, you know, a receipt for what to make and stuff, right?

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,201
Scott: So it'll say on there, you know, I've seen it because it's right there.

83
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:39,763
Scott: You can see it.

84
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,330
Scott: It says, ah, such and such and a tip, right?

85
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:53,490
Scott: So if the owner was, you know, keeping all those monies, because I guess all that money, you know, digitally goes to the owner's account, the people who are working, they still see how much all those tips are.

86
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,824
Scott: So if at the end of the month, you know, the owner comes back and is like, here, one dollar for everybody.

87
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,950
Scott: They'd be like, I saw what people were tipping.

88
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:08,003
Scott: You know, you know, I didn't add it up on my own, but I know what people are doing on average.

89
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:08,885
Scott: Just don't seem right.

90
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:11,510
Scott: So anyway.

91
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,058
Rym: So you got some, there's some big, there's a bunch of news, actually.

92
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:15,760
Rym: I was surprised.

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,170
Rym: Usually Wednesdays we struggle unless we've watched something to Geek Bite.

94
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:20,372
Scott: Yeah.

95
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:20,573
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:20,793
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:26,530
Rym: So I think the most important one to me personally is about who you're gonna call.

98
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:33,708
Scott: So when we were kids, right, there was Ghostbusters, the movie Ghostbusters to the movie.

99
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:33,969
Scott: Right.

100
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,254
Rym: There was Ghostbusters cartoon.

101
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,601
Rym: that was not the one that we wanted to watch.

102
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:39,724
Scott: Exactly.

103
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,810
Scott: I didn't even know about that one until Internet time.

104
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,853
Scott: I used to watch it.

105
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:44,878
Scott: It didn't, it didn't air where I lived.

106
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:45,980
Rym: It aired where I lived.

107
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,850
Rym: And it was like, there were kids who watched it and knew about that.

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,575
Rym: And even the original live action show, like.

109
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:56,303
Scott: But yeah, there was some other show called Ghostbusters.

110
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:57,405
Scott: that was cartoon.

111
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,990
Scott: that was, had nothing to do with the Ghostbusters movie.

112
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,817
Rym: It's the one with the Jeep and the giant gorilla.

113
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,022
Rym: Like that's how you know it's not the real Ghostbusters.

114
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,127
Scott: It was much, it was basically a Scooby Doo knockoff.

115
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:07,408
Scott: Right.

116
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,330
Scott: As far as I remember.

117
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,953
Rym: I had a bunch of toys for that Ghostbusters.

118
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:23,570
Scott: Anyway, so, but then the real reason that kids were fans of Ghostbusters in, you know, late 80s, early 90s times, right, whenever those times were, I guess, I guess that was the time, right?

119
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,412
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:29,345
Scott: Was not because of that original movie, you know, although we did watch it and enjoy it.

121
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,190
Rym: I love that movie as a little kid.

122
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:32,191
Scott: Right.

123
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:39,942
Scott: But Ghostbusters carried forward with greater fandom instead of just, you know, there were a lot of like single movies that kids were a fan of.

124
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:40,823
Scott: Right.

125
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:45,490
Scott: That didn't carry, you know, for example, like Robocop, right?

126
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,594
Rym: No, Robocop had the cartoon that I watched.

127
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:51,601
Scott: It did, but Robocop cartoon was not a long lasting deal.

128
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:56,690
Rym: Well, when the Robocop cartoon faded away, so too did Robocop fandom among kids.

129
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,076
Rym: There was that, kids knew the predator, but there wasn't a predator cartoon for them to watch.

130
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:02,097
Scott: Right.

131
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:05,662
Scott: So thing, you know, you needed to keep, you know, in those days there was no internet.

132
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:07,805
Scott: You needed to keep some production up, right.

133
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:10,890
Scott: To have kids carry on with your property like Ninja Turtles did.

134
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,090
Scott: Right.

135
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,154
Scott: You were all bombarded with new Ninja Turtles stuff all the time.

136
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:15,095
Scott: It's still going.

137
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,657
Scott: Pokemon still going.

138
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:16,917
Scott: Right.

139
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,861
Scott: So Ghostbusters had a Ghostbusters to keep going.

140
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,486
Scott: There was a cartoon that, you know, called the real Ghostbusters.

141
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,630
Scott: And there was also a toy line to go with the show.

142
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,232
Rym: I had all those god damn toys.

143
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:28,593
Rym: The cartoon.

144
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,414
Rym: Oh my god.

145
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:38,707
Scott: The best toy, the one I had was that like maid old lady witch where you pulled her hat up and there was an eyeball under there and she pulled her whole head up.

146
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,830
Scott: Like her whole body opened up like a mouth.

147
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:46,398
Rym: So the thing about that, like those toys were basically based on the cartoon, not the movie.

148
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:46,578
Rym: Exactly.

149
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:54,950
Rym: And the cartoon, unlike all the other cartoons we were watching in that era, even though I was actually starting to watch anime in that era because my family got me into it.

150
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,735
Rym: The Ghostbusters cartoon was good, dark, and fucked up.

151
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:05,579
Rym: Like way more fucked up than I think a lot of parents realized.

152
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,680
Scott: Oh yeah.

153
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,263
Rym: And that's kind of why it was so popular with kids.

154
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:11,845
Rym: Because kids were watching me like wow, that was fucked up.

155
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:16,470
Rym: And then we watch He-Man like wow, what's this plebeian, boring cartoon compared to the Ghostbusters?

156
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:24,417
Scott: And actually the real Ghostbusters cartoon didn't stray too far from the movie.

157
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:30,463
Scott: Usually a lot of times, even as a kid, you can get angry at poor adaptations.

158
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:34,747
Scott: The sort of thing like hey you took Tom Bombadil out.

159
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:35,527
Scott: That sort of thing.

160
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,490
Scott: Even as a kid you'd get angry at that sort of stuff.

161
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,718
Scott: I remember you read Jurassic Park and then you watch the movie and you'd be like hey!

162
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,202
Scott: You changed all this bullshit.

163
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:51,648
Scott: But the real Ghostbusters cartoon, it wasn't exactly the same.

164
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,290
Scott: Let's not get carried away here.

165
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,570
Rym: But it followed the canon of that movie's universe.

166
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,980
Scott: Slimer was not a friend of the Ghostbusters in the movie.

167
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,130
Scott: He was a one time enemy that they destroyed.

168
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:14,086
Rym: But if you think about the Ghostbusters movie, what it implies that no one in the movie addresses is like this Cthulhu-esque existential terror world that humans inhabit briefly.

169
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,190
Rym: And the cartoon just leaned into that.

170
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,574
Scott: The real Ghostbusters was a great cartoon.

171
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:25,461
Scott: I remember it being a great cartoon and not being crappy like a lot of other ones that don't live up.

172
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:29,246
Scott: But now the news, why is this news?

173
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:32,590
Scott: We can now prove to ourselves whether our memory is correct.

174
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,156
Scott: They are putting the real Ghostbusters cartoon on YouTube.

175
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,280
Scott: Supposedly the whole thing eventually for free?

176
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,221
Scott: Maybe?

177
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,242
Scott: Who knows?

178
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:50,590
Scott: But regardless there's at least some episodes, at least one up there now on the Ghostbusters YouTube channel I think.

179
00:10:51,131 --> 00:11:01,404
Rym: The last time I tried to verify if this was kid memory or if it was legit was in RIT, we pirated like one episode and we all watched it together.

180
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:04,968
Rym: The one where at one point it was raining croutons.

181
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,130
Rym: That's the scene I remember.

182
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:07,251
Scott: Oh okay.

183
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,393
Scott: But yeah.

184
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:22,725
Scott: So now if you were not of our age, or if you've never seen it, even if you are of our age or older, I recommend you actually do go and attempt to watch some of this at least to see what was up.

185
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:27,470
Scott: It's notable, noteworthy, quality, you know.

186
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,053
Rym: It was a solid show.

187
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:35,269
Rym: Well we'll find out if it was truly a solid show because you're all gonna watch it and you might come back in the comments and be like, "Ribbon Scott, you're just

188
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:35,590
Rym: old.".

189
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,351
Scott: Exactly.

190
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:38,513
Rym: That could easily happen.

191
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,180
Rym: So in some other news, a little bit of a geek bite.

192
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,230
Rym: So I'm not super into the MCU, like I don't really enjoy a lot of those movies.

193
00:11:49,610 --> 00:12:01,090
Rym: But WandaVision, which I'm sure you've heard of, I'm not gonna like try to explain it, but WandaVision is a show that you can just watch that is set in- On Disney Plus though, right?

194
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,149
Rym: Yeah, it's on Disney Plus.

195
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:04,450
Scott: You can't just watch it if you don't have Disney Plus.

196
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:14,330
Rym: It's a show that appeared one episode by episode, like three episodes came out, and then a fourth one happened, so I've seen enough to see where it's going.

197
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,696
Rym: And it's higher concept than I expected.

198
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:25,210
Rym: I expected it to be good because of the concept, which I'll get into in a second, when I watched episode one.

199
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,869
Scott: Because Scott, you had this idea- I didn't watch it at all.

200
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:30,353
Rym: You should probably watch it.

201
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:38,610
Rym: The problem is episode one is good at being a very clever and deep homage to an era of television.

202
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,490
Scott: That's what I assumed it was.

203
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,309
Scott: Based on the still image I saw with the logo, that is exactly what I assumed the whole show would be.

204
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:59,090
Rym: The second episode does that from the next decade of television, and at that point- Next episode, Bewitched.

205
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:00,774
Scott: Oh, okay.

206
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,507
Scott: That's even more clever than I had given it credit for.

207
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:03,849
Rym: I like it.

208
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,183
Scott: I'm warming.

209
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:06,850
Scott: I'm sweetening.

210
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,270
Rym: The cleverness is deep, as in every tiny little detail.

211
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:20,850
Rym: If you're a kid who watched Nick at Nite, or you're just old, you'll notice a lot of very subtle bits and very subtle components.

212
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,627
Scott: I definitely could see how that would be amiss on people who weren't familiar with the tropes of 50, 60, 70s television.

213
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,870
Rym: In episode one, there's a moment where something happens, they're laying in their separate beds, and there's a noise out the window.

214
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,407
Rym: But they do some magic and pull the beds together.

215
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:35,850
Rym: Anyway.

216
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:53,050
Rym: The second episode worried me because it was still just homage, and as much as I like homage to those eras of television, the second episode wasn't as funny as an actual episode of Bewitched or I Love Lucy, which were both really funny shows.

217
00:13:53,511 --> 00:14:00,670
Scott: Right, what I'm guessing here already, just as somebody who simply has knowledge of the characters, even though I don't watch Marvel movies or anything.

218
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,730
Rym: Is something going on?

219
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,919
Scott: Is that clearly, right, the best, the only good?

220
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:13,150
Scott: Scarlet Witch, I don't know any comics personally that involve the Vision that are any good.

221
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:20,667
Rym: I know less about comics than you, but I can know enough to say that House of M is the only interesting storyline I've ever even heard of.

222
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,130
Rym: that involves the Scarlet Witch.

223
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,829
Rym: And Vision, I didn't know anything about.

224
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,615
Scott: That's exactly right.

225
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:29,490
Scott: Vision is an Avenger who's a robot and should be awesome because in concept he's awesome.

226
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,184
Rym: I didn't even know he was an Avenger, I just knew he was a robot.

227
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,170
Rym: I assumed he was from space.

228
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,010
Scott: He's like an android or whatever.

229
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,490
Rym: I knew he was a robot from space and I didn't know anything else.

230
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,045
Scott: He's something like that, but the point is...

231
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,810
Rym: Didn't Ultron make him or something?

232
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,370
Scott: I don't know, something like that, but in concept he should be really awesome.

233
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,048
Scott: But in reality, I've never read a comic with the Vision where he was interesting or cool at all.

234
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:48,449
Scott: He was lame.

235
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,670
Scott: And I keep saying lame, I'm trying not to.

236
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:52,565
Rym: I know you're working on it.

237
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,042
Scott: Working on it.

238
00:14:54,911 --> 00:15:01,650
Scott: And the Scarlet Witch, I've never read a comic book other than House of M where the Scarlet Witch was cool.

239
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:08,310
Scott: I never cared about the Scarlet Witch other than in her relation to Magneto, it's Magneto's daughter.

240
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,681
Scott: And that's what made her cool.

241
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,170
Scott: Not any of her powers or anything.

242
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:18,990
Scott: Except for House of M, which is an X-Men storyline in which she creates some alternate universe that all the mutants are trapped in.

243
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,749
Scott: And it's ridiculous, but still good.

244
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:32,150
Scott: So as soon as you tell me that the second episode is a decade later, it's like, "Oh, this whole WandaVision thing, she's created an alternate universe they stole from the comic books again without giving credit to the people...".

245
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,710
Rym: It's obvious that this is a... You watch it right away if you know anything about the Scarlet Witch.

246
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,050
Rym: That's the first thing I thought is, "Okay, clearly the Scarlet Witch has created this universe.

247
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,742
Rym: Now, how close will it be to House of M?

248
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:44,225
Rym: What's it gonna

249
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:44,306
Rym: do?".

250
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:46,890
Rym: That's the only thing I didn't know.

251
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,810
Scott: The thing that seems to keep happening, and I guess I've noticed it more because I've been following this Twitter account.

252
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:58,130
Scott: There's a Twitter account called, I guess, the Claremont Run, right?

253
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,548
Scott: Because this is guy John Claremont who wrote basically all the X-Men comics that are famous.

254
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,190
Scott: You know, the Dark Phoenix ones, all those were all written by this Claremont.

255
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,859
Scott: Oh, Claremont and Burn, but Burn left.

256
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:09,890
Scott: Claremont's the guy, right?

257
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:10,368
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,727
Scott: He's still alive, too.

259
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:17,850
Scott: But they mentioned, basically it posts one thread a morning, and the threads are always great.

260
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,528
Scott: But they talk about, like, "Hey, they made all these X-Men stuff in

261
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:22,890
Scott: Hollywood."

262
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:28,730
Scott: And all of it is based on, basically, mostly John Claremont's work.

263
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,970
Scott: It's not based on the other X-Men storylines, right?

264
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:36,270
Scott: It's mostly based on these original stories that John Claremont wrote.

265
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,324
Scott: And they didn't hire him to write the X-Men movies.

266
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,670
Scott: They don't credit him that much.

267
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,810
Scott: Maybe he, like, you know, does a cameo in one or something.

268
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,990
Scott: I don't know if he's getting money or what, but it's like, everything they make is based on his original work.

269
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,650
Scott: Those are original stories, right?

270
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,062
Scott: He wrote those from, you know, back in the day on his own, right?

271
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,570
Scott: And now people are just rewriting Dark Phoenix five times over.

272
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,150
Scott: It's like, he should be getting paid five times over and credited five times over, and he's not.

273
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:16,810
Scott: So if they're doing House of M here, right, as WandaVision, shouldn't they-- I don't know who wrote House of M. It's probably a name I know, but I don't know the-- I can't pull the name out of my, you know, ass without Googling it.

274
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,241
Scott: But is that person getting the credit?

275
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,150
Scott: Are they writing this show, right?

276
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,170
Scott: If you have-- the person who wrote the original thing you're adapting, right?

277
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,250
Scott: You're making Lord of the Rings the movie, you know, token is not alive.

278
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,510
Scott: So it's understandable, right?

279
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:36,549
Scott: But if he was alive, why would you just not get him to write the movie also?

280
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,209
Scott: It makes no sense.

281
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,770
Rym: The only-- so, like, here's an example of how the show goes.

282
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:49,449
Rym: They're doing this homage, but then, like, one color object appears in the first episode, and Wanda sees it and kind of, like, gets unnerved by it.

283
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:54,110
Rym: And, like, a character kind of glitches out a little bit in a weird way, and, like, no one can deal.

284
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,014
Rym: Like, he's trying to figure out.

285
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:58,210
Rym: The second episode gets weirder.

286
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,670
Rym: Like, there's a few more moments like that.

287
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,889
Rym: And my worry was, the show's just gonna be, it's the homage plus a couple weird things, and just go through all the decades.

288
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:09,229
Rym: But it did not.

289
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,850
Rym: The third episode, everything becomes color.

290
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:14,650
Rym: Now it's the Partridge Family/The Brady Bunch.

291
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:18,570
Rym: And also, the plot escalates rapidly.

292
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,870
Rym: And I'm not gonna, like, spoil much, because the show's worth watching.

293
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,849
Rym: It's not that long so far.

294
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:28,830
Rym: The fourth episode goes to, basically, the outside of people trying to figure out what the fuck's going on.

295
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,750
Rym: And, like, it turns into a proper superhero story.

296
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,290
Rym: And I'm actually really enjoying it.

297
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,730
Rym: The second episode, I got a little worried.

298
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,950
Rym: Third episode, I was unworried.

299
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,400
Rym: And now the fourth episode, it's fun.

300
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,770
Rym: Like, I see what they're doing.

301
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,850
Scott: Wikipedia says that, yeah, they pitched it to, you know, them.

302
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,990
Scott: They pitched it that it would be based on House of M and some other stories, right?

303
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,350
Scott: So, that was already in their thoughts.

304
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,070
Scott: And House of M was written by Brian Michael Bendis and Olivier Coypel.

305
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,109
Scott: I knew those names, I just didn't know they were the ones who wrote it.

306
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:01,450
Scott: And, yeah, they don't seem to be involved.

307
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,649
Scott: Other people are writing it.

308
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,030
Scott: I wish I could do that.

309
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:14,270
Scott: Like, you know, it's like, you know, when you own intellectual property like that, I guess you can, you know, sort of plagiarize people without it being plagiarism, right?

310
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:15,509
Rym: Yeah.

311
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,389
Rym: So, I'm gonna keep watching it.

312
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,409
Rym: I'm not bored with it.

313
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,689
Rym: I'm enjoying it more than I've enjoyed most MCU things.

314
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,729
Scott: I'm gonna continue to not watch MCU things.

315
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:33,570
Rym: Yeah, you could probably stand to at least watch just the first episode, because you at least will appreciate the ridiculous level of detail they put into this.

316
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:35,649
Scott: But I could just watch, like, I Dream of Jeannie.

317
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,044
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,490
Scott: I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere.

319
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:39,390
Rym: I think Big Witch was funnier.

320
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,250
Rym: And honestly, I Love Lucy is funnier than both of those.

321
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,270
Scott: I like I Dream of Jeannie better because the guy was an astronaut, right?

322
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:45,649
Scott: So, there was that whole thing going on.

323
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,269
Rym: Yeah, I can see that.

324
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,288
Rym: But honestly, I Love Lucy is the one that I love the most.

325
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:51,889
Scott: Eh, sometimes.

326
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,310
Rym: Of course, I was weirdly into Andy Griffith as well.

327
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,509
Rym: Like, I earnestly enjoy that show.

328
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,728
Rym: And as a kid, I was really into Dragnet because I didn't know.

329
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:09,629
Rym: So, in some other brief news, the One Piece manga, like, you all, like, everyone's heard of One Piece.

330
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,809
Rym: Even people who don't read comics, like, they hear of, like, "Oh, that's that pirate thing," right?

331
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:19,249
Rym: I don't think people fully appreciate how widely read One Piece is.

332
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,850
Scott: Alright, so I want to just put this into perspective for you, right?

333
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,310
Scott: So, here's some numbers from Wikipedia, right?

334
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:34,108
Scott: So, the numbers from Wikipedia say that if you consider all Batman comics ever, right, the floppy ones, right?

335
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:39,390
Scott: Because the number of trade paperbacks of Batman that have been sold are not significant, right?

336
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,650
Scott: So, the number of Batman floppy comics sold.

337
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:51,610
Scott: There have been about 17,000-ish issues of Batman comics of one type or another since 1939.

338
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,941
Scott: So, how many, so 40, so 70 years, we're gonna say, right?

339
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,994
Scott: From 1940 to 2021, 1939, 21, 70 years, right, of Batman comics.

340
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:05,742
Scott: All of those floppy issues added up, they sold 484 million floppy comics-ish.

341
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,210
Scott: Alright.

342
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,430
Scott: Based on rough numbers, right?

343
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:20,270
Scott: So, you gotta think, 484 million divided by 40 years divided by 12 months, because those are monthly floppies, right?

344
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,763
Scott: It's basically the number of people-ish that read Batman, right?

345
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,447
Scott: It's like a turnstile-related counter.

346
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,370
Rym: Yeah, uniques and turnstiles, I was about to say.

347
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:29,989
Scott: Exactly.

348
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:37,728
Scott: Okay, One Piece sells by the volume, right, and has 98 volumes.

349
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:43,947
Scott: There are 98 volumes of One Piece, and those volumes have sold 480 million.

350
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,670
Scott: So, about the same number as floppies of Batman.

351
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,878
Scott: But you're only dividing, not by 17,000 issues, but by 98 volumes.

352
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,850
Scott: So, that's you're dividing by 100.

353
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,015
Scott: So, what's 480 million divided by

354
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:01,075
Scott: 100? 4.8

355
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:01,718
Scott: million, right?

356
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,439
Scott: What's 480 million divided by 17,000 issues, right?

357
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,690
Scott: And then, you also gotta consider the years, right?

358
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,888
Scott: Batman hit, it took 400, to get 404 million sales of floppies, they had to go for 70 years.

359
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,410
Scott: One Piece came out in 1997.

360
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,401
Scott: It's only 20, not even 25 years old, One Piece, right?

361
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:34,070
Rym: Oh, that just makes me feel old, because I remember, like, when One Piece started, and I was like, ah, that show looks like it's gonna be, like, that comics too.

362
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,770
Scott: I didn't know One Piece existed until about four or five years after, three to five years after it started.

363
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:42,910
Scott: I didn't know about One Piece in 1997.

364
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,402
Rym: I think I didn't know about it until, like, 1998 or '99, when I think back.

365
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:49,230
Scott: I didn't know about One Piece until 2000.

366
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:56,810
Rym: 'Cause I was super into anime and manga in high school, but I knew one guy, only one person, who was way more into it than I was.

367
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,309
Scott: But anyway.

368
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:05,270
Scott: One Piece, this doesn't even include, you know, One Piece anime, but I guess we're not counting BTAS either, right?

369
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,130
Scott: But yeah, and that only, that's the volumes, right?

370
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,528
Scott: If you count the actual shonen jumps that One Piece is in, right?

371
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,990
Scott: We're talking billions, right?

372
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:24,989
Scott: So, people just are not, like, realizing, I think, you know, scope-wise, in America, there's this perception of, like, the big two.

373
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,290
Scott: We talked about this before, right?

374
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,310
Rym: Yeah, there's the marketing machine of, oh yeah, Marvel and DC sell all these comics.

375
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,230
Scott: In other industries, there are big X, right?

376
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,670
Scott: There's, like, big, how many big book publishers does less and less every day be merging, right?

377
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,050
Scott: But it's like, or record companies, there's the big this many, right?

378
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:50,770
Scott: You know, in every industry, there's, like, a big X. You know, some very small number, like, less than five handful of companies that are the big ones, and everyone else is medium or small.

379
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,296
Scott: In U.S.

380
00:23:53,377 --> 00:24:03,650
Scott: comics, there's this perception of the big two, DC and Marvel, and it's true that their intellectual properties of superheroes are big in the culture-wise, right?

381
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:12,753
Scott: But in terms of comics, they are not actually big, right, in terms of all comics sold, not even in the

382
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:13,235
Scott: U.S.,

383
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:16,390
Scott: but indefinitely in the world, they are not big.

384
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:27,230
Scott: It's like, Batman comics are, you know, more popular than other superhero comics, but it's like, in terms of all comics in the world, they are not that popular.

385
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:37,710
Scott: One Piece is the king of comics throughout all history, and you've got to, and even starting at One Piece, you've got to go far down the list before you find Batman.

386
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,190
Scott: It's like, Garfield crushes, you know, Batman easily.

387
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:44,990
Rym: Like, Archie comics are widely read.

388
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,189
Scott: Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if it's the North Star crushes it, right, you know, it's like Asterix and Obelisk, they crush it.

389
00:24:54,213 --> 00:25:00,570
Scott: I assume that, like, probably Donald Duck comics crush it, depending on how many you include in your tally, right?

390
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:04,410
Scott: Tintin probably crushes all superhero comics ever.

391
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:20,750
Scott: So, you know, you need this perspective correction, I think, if you're, you know, thinking about comics and how popular they are, relatively speaking, and it's such a big reality distortion, that's why I feel the need to bring it up repeatedly.

392
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,850
Rym: Maybe the Scarlet Witch is involved.

393
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:29,130
Scott: It takes that much repetition to sort of break the spell, right, of false perception.

394
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:37,468
Rym: Well, like, you know, what we always just talk about with conventions and the turnstile counts and all these conventions saying, "Oh, yeah, 200,000 people showed up at our

395
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:37,930
Rym: convention."

396
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,967
Rym: Like, nah, that's not the number everyone thinks it is.

397
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,556
Rym: Or not?

398
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:43,690
Rym: 200,000 people in that building.

399
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:52,070
Scott: The perception that San Diego Comic-Con was, you know, so, like, ten times bigger than Otakon, when it was really just kind of bigger than it, you know, not that much bigger.

400
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:58,669
Rym: Of course, it'll be infinitely bigger than Otakon if things don't pan out for Otakon this year, which we talked about in the last show.

401
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,046
Rym: But things of the day!

402
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:08,790
Rym: So what do you got?

403
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,570
Scott: So, we both saw the same thing in a tweet today, even though the thing itself is a year old.

404
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,248
Scott: But I snatched his thing of the day first, so deal with it.

405
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,628
Rym: I had it queued up for the show, and then Scott was like, "Oh, yeah, here's my thing of the

406
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:22,829
Rym: day.".

407
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:27,030
Rym: And he sent it to me, and our rule is, if you send the other person your thing of the day, it's theirs.

408
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,627
Rym: That's dibs.

409
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:28,969
Scott: That's right, you get dibs.

410
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,829
Scott: So, there's an animation studio in London that I didn't know about.

411
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:37,890
Scott: But apparently, this animation studio, I did some quick research on them.

412
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:45,770
Scott: They really remind me of the early days of Studio Gonzo, making small commercial animations of high quality.

413
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,730
Scott: Gonzo used to do video game intros and those sorts of things.

414
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,302
Scott: So, for example, the animated Wargroove promo animation, they made that.

415
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:03,266
Scott: So, the thing that they made a year ago is this 90-second.

416
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:05,529
Scott: It's a minute and a half long.

417
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:11,350
Scott: It's a song, and it looks like a trailer or an opener to an animation that doesn't exist.

418
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:15,189
Rym: All I want is to see the show that this was pretending to be.

419
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:16,710
Scott: Well, you might.

420
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,401
Scott: So, this was made a year ago.

421
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,704
Scott: They uploaded it, but there's been a lot of hints.

422
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:23,890
Scott: it might be coming for real.

423
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,490
Scott: It's called The Mighty Grand Piton.

424
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,310
Scott: What it is, basically, you watch this in 90 seconds, you get the whole concept.

425
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:39,230
Scott: There is a black girl from London, and her family goes on vacation to the Caribbean to Saint Lucia.

426
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,277
Scott: I think one of those islands.

427
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,144
Scott: I don't know the names.

428
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:41,850
Scott: There's too many islands.

429
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:45,265
Scott: Sorry, I don't know all the Caribbean islands.

430
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:45,929
Scott: That's my fad.

431
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,528
Scott: And on that island, it's pretty much an Iron Giant situation.

432
00:27:53,752 --> 00:28:01,210
Scott: She finds a giant robot, anime style, and fights what seems to be giant monsters of some kind.

433
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,670
Scott: There's a giant ant in the animation that you can see it fighting.

434
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,789
Scott: And adventures and such and such.

435
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:11,109
Scott: So, this is awesome because A, there's tons of anime like this.

436
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:18,708
Scott: Little kid, giant robot, but it almost always involves a young Japanese boy like 99% of the time.

437
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:24,250
Scott: And a young white boy like 1% of the time Iron Giant.

438
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,410
Scott: It almost never involves a young girl who's got a robot to themselves.

439
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,238
Scott: And definitely not a black girl.

440
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,170
Scott: And definitely not on a Caribbean island.

441
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,020
Scott: So, that's just like A+, not even A+.

442
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:36,542
Scott: It's S+.

443
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:39,478
Scott: This just looks great.

444
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,043
Scott: And the animation is great, and the song is great.

445
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:45,389
Scott: that goes to this.

446
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:50,310
Rym: I was about to say, it gave me that same feel of that 2Mix video, White Reflection, everyone saw.

447
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,862
Rym: Where everyone said, "Oh, I want to see the anime of

448
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:53,103
Rym: that.".

449
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:54,450
Rym: Like, it gave me that same feeling.

450
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:55,758
Scott: It's just a music video.

451
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,266
Scott: It's like, "What do you mean,

452
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:57,528
Scott: anime?".

453
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:05,130
Scott: But here, no, I really hope that, you know, we've seen some good animation coming from Ireland.

454
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:07,129
Scott: Why not from the big island?

455
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:08,910
Rym: Albion.

456
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:15,030
Scott: Yeah, people from the Albion island make animation about, you know, the Caribbean island.

457
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:17,210
Scott: That would be terrific.

458
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:19,589
Scott: You know, the best thing about this?

459
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,010
Scott: The supposed hints about this becoming an actual show/movie are true.

460
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,665
Scott: But yeah, well, this is more than worth 90 seconds of your time.

461
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:29,410
Scott: Watch it two times.

462
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,407
Rym: The top comment on the YouTube video from a year ago is, "The whole world needs to see

463
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:35,648
Rym: this.".

464
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:37,059
Scott: Sure, yes.

465
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:39,089
Scott: Why not?

466
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,030
Rym: You, like, played the clarinet and know some music, so you know about time signatures, right?

467
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,974
Rym: Yeah,

468
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:46,332
Rym: 3/4. 3/4, 4/4,

469
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,697
Rym: like, you know what that means.

470
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:53,738
Rym: Like, 4/4 means there are, we're speaking in quarter notes, and there are four quarter notes in a measure.

471
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:55,405
Rym: Like, one, two, three, four.

472
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:56,490
Rym: One, two, three.

473
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,950
Rym: Like, that's pretty straightforward.

474
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,385
Scott: One thing that wasn't straightforward is, like, you got 4/4, right?

475
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:02,550
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,910
Scott: Which means you got, what, four per measure, right?

477
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,330
Rym: Four quarter notes per measure.

478
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,775
Rym: That's the same as 1/1.

479
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:10,530
Rym: One whole note per measure.

480
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,370
Rym: It is the same.

481
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,150
Scott: Right, so if you made 8/8, it wouldn't be any different.

482
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,756
Rym: It wouldn't actually be any different.

483
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:18,870
Rym: Usually it just means, like, you'll draw all the eighth notes out.

484
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,359
Rym: Like, it's sort of like how you'll draw the music.

485
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,389
Rym: Like, 2/4 and 4/4 can be written, there's a lot of...

486
00:30:24,593 --> 00:30:24,787
Scott: Sure.

487
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,130
Scott: So, uh... But they're equivalent, and that's why people don't bother doing, there's only certain ones people actually use unless they're ridiculous.

488
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:40,490
Rym: And then there's the ones like 6/8, where it's, we're talking about eighth notes, but there'll be groups of them, like, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, like groups of triplets, but that still makes sense.

489
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:41,849
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

490
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,614
Rym: So, uh, what about the weird ones?

491
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:52,688
Rym: Like, every kid knows that there's that weird song in the time signature of 5/4, Mars, Bringer of War.

492
00:30:54,251 --> 00:31:02,150
Rym: The classic song, it's in 5/4, there's five quarter notes per measure, and it makes it unwieldy, and, like, difficult to listen to, and it's a whole thing.

493
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:10,750
Rym: Uh, what if I told you that 15/16 is a commonly used and amazing time signature that you've probably never thought ever heard of?

494
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,270
Scott: I've probably heard songs in it and just not thought about that they were 15/16.

495
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:26,810
Rym: Probably haven't actually heard that many, because usually the way you get the feeling of 15/16 is like a funk groove, which isn't often written in 15/16.

496
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,897
Rym: So, this video is Adam Neely.

497
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,470
Rym: This is a backup thing of the day, 'cause I had to scramble, 'cause Scott got the good thing.

498
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,070
Rym: Uh, I had this cued up as, like, a backup since Christmas.

499
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:46,352
Rym: This is Christmas songs, like, a bunch of Christmas songs you've heard rewritten into the time signature of 15/16.

500
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,162
Scott: Oh, I think I saw this.

501
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:47,709
Scott: You posted it.

502
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,650
Rym: And they're all, I think I posted it, like, in our group or maybe even in the forum, but they're all amazing.

503
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,236
Rym: Like, they're really fun to listen to.

504
00:31:56,276 --> 00:32:02,791
Rym: I particularly like God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen in 15/16.

505
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:07,086
Rym: In the meantime, I'm edging toward reading books, 'cause I can't go anywhere.

506
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,210
Rym: I'm just stuck inside.

507
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:14,250
Rym: And at some point, I gotta just not play Hades and do a non-Hades thing if I'm just sitting around.

508
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,238
Scott: Yeah, I'm reading a game that is very book-like.

509
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,970
Scott: I'm already, like, on my second play, and then I'm reading comics.

510
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,230
Scott: But, yeah, I haven't read the book club book quite yet.

511
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,610
Rym: I'm getting there, though, 'cause the problem is Overwatch has been good again.

512
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,270
Rym: There's been a lot more cash of the flag action in the arcade, which is a problem, 'cause I'll just sit in there forever.

513
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,557
Rym: But, yeah, stay tuned.

514
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,250
Rym: We'll probably be reading the book at some point in the nearing future.

515
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,599
Rym: Otherwise, stay tuned for whatever online cons we do.

516
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,970
Rym: The online convention scene has dried up a little bit.

517
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:53,790
Scott: I think people have realized, yeah, they don't really make money.

518
00:32:54,271 --> 00:33:05,590
Rym: Yep, and especially for cons that are struggling to survive COVID until a post-COVID world, online cons just cost them a lot of money and resources, but don't actually get them anything.

519
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:14,390
Rym: And especially, online cons don't really give that same feeling that people expect, so a lot of cons are struggling to make a useful and good online con experience.

520
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,412
Scott: You've said this over and over.

521
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,357
Scott: A con is not the content provider.

522
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:30,230
Scott: A con is a logistics provider, and if you don't have any need of those logistics, if you're not going to a place, so they have nothing to offer unless their brand is stronger than the brands that they can put on their platform.

523
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:36,810
Rym: And it's hard, because it's not like the old days where cons had content that literally did not exist anywhere else.

524
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:40,881
Rym: Like, anime cons in the early days were, "Yo, kid, you wanna see some anime?

525
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:43,709
Rym: This is the only goddamn place you can see it at

526
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,890
Rym: all.".

527
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,002
Scott: Also, for most cons, even the biggest cons, right?

528
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,009
Scott: San Diego Comic Con, the biggest con, right?

529
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:57,510
Scott: The online platform of San Diego Comic Con is weaker than the online platform of a single artist alley person.

530
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:04,670
Rym: Yup, they're like a glass cannon whose sole purpose is to make people be able to buy badges, see the schedule, show up.

531
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:14,690
Scott: Right, so you just pick a random weave in the anime artist alley table selling, I don't know, crocheted cutie stuff, right?

532
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:20,310
Scott: A typical artist alley table you would see, you go find them at San Diego Comic Con.

533
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:35,210
Scott: They probably don't have as many Twitter followers as San Diego Comic Con does, but I guarantee you, their online community engagement that they have with their customers is probably better than how people have with San Diego Comic Con itself.

534
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,608
Scott: People aren't looking at Comic Con Twitter for stuff, right?

535
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:45,989
Scott: So there's not that much that Comic Con can even offer them other than that's not the actual con.

536
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:56,750
Rym: And most of what I've enjoyed from online cons have just been panels, and that's what we do at online cons, but we could just do those on our own, like we don't actually even need an excuse.

537
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:03,990
Scott: Most YouTube channels with Pete that have a talking head style are just someone doing panels on their own constantly.

538
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:05,634
Scott: That's all they are.

539
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:09,130
Scott: We just do a lot less panels if we only do them live.

540
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:15,610
Rym: Yeah, because it's more fun to do them live, and I think we said this before, you know why we haven't made a whole bunch of videos during COVID?

541
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,350
Rym: Because it's not fun to make videos when Scott's in Astoria and I'm in LIC.

542
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:23,890
Rym: It's way more fun when we do them together in front of one camera.

543
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:25,030
Scott: Anyway.

544
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:27,607
Scott: So let's just get right into it.

545
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:29,052
Rym: Lupin III.

546
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:46,970
Rym: I is not only the latest iteration of Lupin movies, and I'm saying quotes because if you look at the history of Lupin, you've basically got the manga, you've got the TV serieses, and then you've got the specials, some of which were theatrical movies and some of which were basically OAVs.

547
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:49,016
Scott: Some of which were OAVs.

548
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,950
Scott: I think there were some TV, direct-to-TV movies possibly.

549
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:59,930
Scott: Basically, any format of video that exists, any distribution mechanism for video, Lupin has been there.

550
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:07,490
Scott: They just keep making more Lupin stuff at a steady stream for as long as Lupin has existed.

551
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,881
Scott: Make a little short series here, make a movie there.

552
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,030
Scott: It just keeps coming and coming and coming.

553
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:14,937
Scott: It doesn't stop.

554
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,130
Scott: It'll keep going forever.

555
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:38,090
Rym: Well, say that there's a median Lupin, and these specials, let's not talk about the TV series, just these specials, these movie-like things, these one-offs, they vary to a surprising degree, both in tone and quality, because much like James Bond, it's like a different director.

556
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:46,977
Rym: Takes like, "I'm gonna do a Lupin," and they'll take this palette of characters and this palette of tropes, and they'll construct their own Lupin.

557
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:53,110
Rym: So, in the same universe that has Lupin, the Castle of Cagliostro, you've got Legend of Babylon Gold.

558
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,477
Scott: Yeah, and what was the one?

559
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,447
Scott: that was mostly about Zenigata and he was all sad?

560
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,236
Rym: Oh, the Fuma Conspiracy.

561
00:36:59,277 --> 00:36:59,841
Rym: No, no, no, no.

562
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,050
Rym: That's the one about Goemon.

563
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,235
Scott: Fuma Conspiracy's just the normal, really good one.

564
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,885
Scott: What's the one where Zenigata's fired and he's sad in Japan?

565
00:37:09,454 --> 00:37:10,503
Scott: I want to watch that one again.

566
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:11,210
Scott: I just forget which one it was.

567
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,542
Rym: The thing is, I like them all, even the stupid ones.

568
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:15,947
Scott: I just like Lupin.

569
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,569
Rym: Babylon Gold we make fun of because it's got a lot of flaws, but I would watch it again.

570
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,448
Scott: There's worse things to watch.

571
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,450
Rym: The one with Hera Maphrodite is probably the worst one.

572
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:27,790
Scott: That's a real bad one.

573
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,310
Scott: Isn't that like Desert something?

574
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,950
Rym: Yeah, I think we even showed it in the anime club.

575
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:37,890
Scott: For me, the median Lupin is the Assassin Island one.

576
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,536
Scott: That is the default.

577
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:41,098
Scott: It's good.

578
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,422
Scott: It's not amazing.

579
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:43,344
Scott: It's not bad.

580
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:45,190
Scott: It's just like, this is Lupin.

581
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:51,070
Scott: He has to go to this island of assassins and deal with them and such and such.

582
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:54,130
Rym: And this is what I want to get into before we do this review.

583
00:37:54,712 --> 00:38:05,789
Rym: It's a two-dimensional chart because there's median Lupin in terms of quality, and there's median Lupin in terms of how close to the standard tropes is it.

584
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:14,849
Scott: I think the thing is, a lot of Lupin fans always talk about the jacket color, which isn't always a complete perfect guide.

585
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:18,510
Rym: This is closer to a green jacket Lupin, even though he's wearing red.

586
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:19,852
Scott: Exactly.

587
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:29,850
Scott: You can't fully rely on the jacket color, but there is, up to a certain point, a correlation between Lupin's jacket color, whether it's green or red.

588
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:40,810
Rym: Green Lupin, regardless of what he's actually wearing, is like the Cagliostro good guy at heart, always does the right thing, mischievous but not outright evil.

589
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,232
Scott: Right.

590
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:49,010
Scott: If you watch Lupin TV series, like the one we watched most of, He murders so many people in the first fucking episode.

591
00:38:50,130 --> 00:39:03,045
Scott: Or if you read the Lupin manga, the old actual monkey punch one, it's like he is lewd, crude, murderous, actually stealing things, actually a criminal, actually a bad kind of person.

592
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,250
Rym: Like Green Jacket Lupin will knock someone out and get away.

593
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,990
Rym: That manga Lupin will machine gun down an entire room of unrelated and innocent dinner party guests.

594
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,239
Scott: Yup, to steal stuff, right?

595
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:18,669
Scott: He's actually a thief, right?

596
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:29,330
Scott: But the movies, especially the theatrical ones, they tend to really tone it down and make Lupin more of a sympathetic character.

597
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:39,714
Scott: Like yes, he's a thief, but this time he's stealing things, he's using his thief-like skills, but he cares about people.

598
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:43,362
Scott: so he's not going to compromise.

599
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,045
Scott: goodness to do thieving.

600
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:51,550
Scott: And allow the greed to overcome his other desires.

601
00:39:51,771 --> 00:40:01,810
Rym: But there's also this, I don't want to say high concept, low concept, but some of these Lupins are just a by-the-book, here is every Lupin trope, in the correct order, beginning to end.

602
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,369
Rym: Like, go him on and Jigen will show up at this point.

603
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:13,690
Rym: Fujiko Mine will show up at the first part, fuck Lupin over, get away, reappear later to help him, but then fuck him over again.

604
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:19,750
Scott: Zenigata will appear and chase Lupin and not catch him, and then maybe catch him, but then he gets away.

605
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,470
Scott: He'll use his disguise trick.

606
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:30,630
Rym: But then you break away from those tropes and you get the ones where Lupin and Zenigata openly team up for real, or the ones where Zenigata tries to kill Lupin.

607
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:38,150
Scott: Some of them go into more supernatural territories, like the Mama one.

608
00:40:39,012 --> 00:40:42,390
Scott: They get into real weird stuff, like what the heck is going on here?

609
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,750
Rym: Legend of Babylon gold, spoilers, aliens are coming back for their fucking gold.

610
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:48,216
Scott: Right, exactly.

611
00:40:48,256 --> 00:40:55,630
Scott: Some of them go into the supernatural territory, and some of them stick to this more realistic territory.

612
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:02,330
Rym: Realistic in that Tagliostro is very realistic, except for the acrobatics of Lupin and that car chase.

613
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:09,390
Scott: Right, but there isn't actual magic, or actual wizards, or any supernatural ghosts, right?

614
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:16,990
Scott: They'll either be a hint of them, but then a Scooby-Doo revealed that they were actually some science or mechanism, or they won't be there at all.

615
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:29,710
Rym: So the last context, before we dive straight into this movie, is that there was a long period of time where the Lupin specials and shows and everything were just kind of super bad to the point that a lot of them weren't worth watching.

616
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:37,028
Rym: And then starting around the time of the Fujiko Mine anime TV series, the quality suddenly returned.

617
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,093
Scott: What was that?

618
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:39,424
Scott: It was a Jigen's grave?

619
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,008
Scott: What was that like?

620
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:44,270
Rym: So Fujiko Mine was the one that really did something interesting and different.

621
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,721
Rym: I think we reviewed it a while ago.

622
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:46,610
Rym: That show was amazing.

623
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:51,690
Rym: Then after that, in a similar style, is the grave of Jigen Daisuke.

624
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,215
Scott: Oh, that came after that?

625
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:55,285
Scott: Okay, I can't remember what the order was.

626
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,210
Scott: I'll trust you.

627
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:03,253
Rym: I would say that that cluster of Lupin set off a Lupin renaissance, and Lupin III.

628
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:03,755
Rym: I is a top-tier Lupin.

629
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:08,755
Scott: It's pretty up there.

630
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:13,010
Rym: It's down to number one, but it's like top five, top ten at worst.

631
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,396
Scott: This is what they've done.

632
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:18,750
Scott: It's the first 3D CG Lupin.

633
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:26,000
Scott: Every Lupin before now may have used computers to help animate, obviously, but they were all 2D.

634
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,289
Scott: There may be 3D behind the scenes, but they didn't look 3D.

635
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,157
Scott: This is like Toy Story 3D.

636
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,371
Scott: Obviously looking much better than the original Toy Story because it's 2021.

637
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:36,825
Rym: Yeah, we'll get into that, but it looks great.

638
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:45,870
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you might get hesitant whenever anything makes a switch to 3D like that, but this is definitely a Mario 64 situation where it works out.

639
00:42:46,510 --> 00:43:03,410
Scott: They somehow managed, even in 3D, to maintain all of the characteristics of the character's signature movements, and looks, and facial expressions, and everything somehow has completely made the transition.

640
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,810
Scott: Jigen's face is a little weird, I think.

641
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:08,470
Rym: I like it, though, because it made him extra hot.

642
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,990
Rym: It's not bad, but I do think Lupin's face is-- It made him more human and hotter.

643
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:16,565
Scott: But Lupin's face is just Lupin's face.

644
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,289
Scott: There is no--.

645
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:37,490
Rym: The thing that stands out the most about the character designs in the transition to 3D that no still image is going to catch for you, they are emotive to a surprising degree, to the point that I think this was the most acting a Lupin character has ever done on the screen.

646
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:39,999
Scott: Yeah, that could be.

647
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:47,010
Scott: But yeah, they basically-- I don't really see a downside to the switch to the CG thing at all, really, for this movie.

648
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:55,210
Rym: I mean, it's not like, as you might see, the Ghibli 3D airwig does not look great in comparison.

649
00:43:55,972 --> 00:44:02,130
Scott: The only real disappointment is just that, hey, I'm a fan of 2D animation, I'd like to see it carry on and not fade away.

650
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:11,520
Scott: But in this particular instance, I don't think any harm was done, other than the general harm to, "Oh no, there's less 2D animation in the world,".

651
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,248
Scott: but this isn't a bad 3D animation.

652
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,348
Rym: But no matter how hesitant someone is, are there complicated feelings about 3D?

653
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:23,830
Rym: Thirty seconds into this, you don't even remember that it's 3D, you're just gay being in the spectacle.

654
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:25,250
Scott: It did not remember.

655
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,669
Rym: The movie is great and just dives right in.

656
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:38,859
Scott: There are none of those weird moments where the CG is awkward or breaks your fourth wall into remembering, and there's none of those uncanny valley moments where it's too real.

657
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,927
Scott: It's still cartoony, but still, right?

658
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:42,870
Scott: It's great.

659
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:47,339
Rym: In terms of-- The voice acting is top notch.

660
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,190
Rym: I only watch the sub, I can't speak to the sub.

661
00:44:49,712 --> 00:45:03,630
Scott: I know, sadly, that some--for the longest time, Lupin, all the characters had the same voice actors, and it was only relatively recently, like within the past some number of years, that some of those original voice actors sadly passed away.

662
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,710
Scott: Whoever they got, it sounds like Lupin, it sounds like everybody, right?

663
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:12,839
Scott: There was no problem, basically.

664
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,390
Scott: Whoever they got the new voice actors are sound like the old voice actors.

665
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,177
Scott: Sort of like how when there's Muppets, right?

666
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:25,810
Scott: It's like, yeah, Jim Henson doesn't do Kermit anymore, but if you watch a new Muppet thing, it sounds like Kermit the Frog, right?

667
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,610
Scott: It's like whoever they got doing it is doing it fine.

668
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:31,056
Scott: It's the same situation here.

669
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:35,190
Scott: Clearly there are voice actors who can do the voices of these characters just fine.

670
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,133
Scott: They're just perfect.

671
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:43,630
Rym: If you did a blind test and played them talking from this and them talking from older Lupins, I would really struggle to tell the difference.

672
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:50,068
Scott: It's possible that even, you know, it is 2021, I don't know that they did this, I have no evidence-- I don't think they did this.

673
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:57,630
Scott: It's possible that they used computers to help out, or to make it sound even more like the original, but whether they did or didn't, you can't tell, so what does it matter?

674
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,555
Scott: So, along

675
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:36,770
Rym: those lines, the music, 'cause this is set in like the mid to late '60s, like specifically, like it's a Showa era, like the movie is set in that time setting, and the music is the Lupin music from all out of the old Lupins, and it, they got to Yuji Ono, the soundtrack has like, the score has 61 songs in it, and a bunch of the compositions are like that Showa post-war jazz stuff from old Lupins, to the point that they even evoke the themes, like from the songs in Cagliostro specifically, to make sure it feels like a Lupin movie.

676
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:46,710
Rym: Right to the point at the very end, you know that song that creeps in when the movie's starting to end, before the scene that ends every Lupin movie begins, where everyone's escaping?

677
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:51,810
Rym: For a second, I thought it was actually the song from one of those other Lupins.

678
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,469
Rym: I had to go check.

679
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:58,990
Scott: Yeah, they did the same thing that every good soundtrack does, when it's a soundtrack for like something that's a series, right?

680
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,389
Scott: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, James Bond, right?

681
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:05,630
Scott: Is they, they have those core musical motifs, right?

682
00:47:06,932 --> 00:47:21,090
Scott: You know, and then they just remix and rearrange into something new, and you could do a bad job of it, but you can also do a great job of it, and I don't think even bad Lupin movies don't really mess up those, you know, musical motifs ever.

683
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,369
Scott: It's not like you're gonna take the soundtrack and just play it for fun.

684
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:34,926
Rym: Yeah, but like play the ending theme to any Lupin that's ever been made, except the really bad ones that fucked this up, and anyone who's watched a bunch of Lupin just be like, "That's the end to a

685
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:35,549
Rym: Lupin!".

686
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:40,689
Rym: They're all running away now, and Zenigata is trying to chase them, and the credits are about to roll.

687
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:47,643
Scott: It's new, good music, but if you are a Lupin person, you identify it immediately as Lupin music.

688
00:47:47,704 --> 00:47:48,750
Scott: There is no question.

689
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:58,050
Rym: So in terms of the movie plot itself, like it's a by-the-book Lupin, except for a couple of minor pieces.

690
00:47:58,372 --> 00:48:07,527
Rym: Piece number one, this isn't a break from the trope, because Lupin's enemies being Nazis is not uncommon, but in this case, it is like, "Nope, Lupin versus the

691
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:07,969
Rym: Nazis.".

692
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:11,970
Scott: Yes, it's so Indiana Jones, right?

693
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:27,502
Scott: It's like there are a lot of the Lupin movies where he's not outright evil, end up being very Indiana Jonesy or more national treasure-y kind of thing, where it's almost that sort of archaeological historical conspiracy mystery.

694
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,549
Rym: This one is like a full-on Raiders of the Lost Ark.

695
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:43,990
Scott: The only difference between this and Indiana Jones is that Indiana Jones just sort of goes somewhere and doesn't really do anything.

696
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,230
Scott: He's just sort of there getting beat up until the bad guys lose.

697
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:52,430
Rym: Like, who beat the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark?

698
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:53,589
Rym: It wasn't Indiana Jones.

699
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:55,081
Scott: It was the Nazis.

700
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:55,910
Scott: God.

701
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:12,670
Scott: Lupin actually uses him and his allies, use their skills and abilities and such to directly conquer and overcome many conflicts and challenges.

702
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:19,577
Rym: So the only break from the tropes of Lupin, because this movie is literally like, Fujiko shows up.

703
00:49:19,738 --> 00:49:23,847
Rym: at the moment you're thinking, "I bet Fujiko's about to show up to do her

704
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:24,108
Rym: thing.".

705
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:34,669
Rym: It's just by the book, except it brings the lore of Lupin himself, like Lupin III, the ancestor of Arsène Lupin.

706
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,820
Scott: Lupin I is the ancestor of Lupin III.

707
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:41,910
Scott: This is Grandpa, I guess, right?

708
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:48,590
Rym: So it brings that in directly in a way that I have never really seen in a Lupin before.

709
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,131
Scott: Right.

710
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:57,630
Scott: In every other Lupin thing I've ever seen, they basically make no mention of Lupin II or Lupin I or Lupin's mom or anything, right?

711
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:05,469
Scott: It's like, here's Lupin III, yeah, you know he's the grandson of Arsène Lupin because that's where his name comes from.

712
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:07,290
Scott: But we're not going to mention that at all.

713
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,401
Scott: We got nothing to do with it.

714
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:08,825
Scott: Nothing.

715
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:26,230
Rym: This one is like you get this flashback to a bunch of Nazi shit and like families and people separated and like a treasure that Arsène never got and how Lupin like was almost destined to meet the person he meets and do the thing in this movie.

716
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:32,050
Rym: That's a trope or a beat, not a trope, it's a beat that I don't think we've ever seen in a Lupin work.

717
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:39,530
Scott: Yeah, a Lupin movie has never been, that I know of, has never been about Lupin's history in any way, shape or form.

718
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:45,367
Scott: And not to spoil anything, but the moment where you see- It's not spoiler, it's in the title, the title of the movie is Lupin III I.

719
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:50,350
Rym: The moment when you see that hat sitting at the end of that tunnel.

720
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:52,289
Scott: That was a plus moment right there.

721
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,830
Rym: Well, the two's the first when they come into that whole area and the Nazi guy walks forward.

722
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,569
Rym: All I could think was about a pious man kneeling down.

723
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,315
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

724
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:03,789
Scott: It's very, very in and of jones.

725
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:04,508
Rym: Yup.

726
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,410
Scott: It's like, you know, anyway.

727
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:23,550
Scott: So the only downside I can see, right, plot wise, was that while all the characters were on point, right, I think that the three typical allies, right, I think Zenigata got the right amount of screen time that Zenigata usually gets.

728
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:30,365
Rym: Yup, because he got the extra beat of, all right, there's like- Because he was there in the beginning scenes too, to add to.

729
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:35,230
Scott: But Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko.

730
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,689
Scott: Fujiko could have had maybe like one or two more things going on.

731
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:43,970
Scott: But Jigen and Goemon especially, I think, barely appear in this movie.

732
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,230
Rym: But that's kind of by the book, a lot of the Lupins.

733
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,090
Scott: They do, it's true.

734
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:52,430
Rym: Those two show up in that fucking car and like save Lupin once or twice and otherwise don't matter.

735
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:56,190
Scott: It's true that they don't appear much, but I think they're appearing in this.

736
00:51:56,271 --> 00:52:02,070
Scott: I don't know, I have to time it to figure out exactly, but it feels like they even have less than the usual amount of screen time.

737
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:09,070
Scott: I think you're right, but I think that's partly because- I think you need to give them like one or two more scenes to bring them up to their average level.

738
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:14,383
Rym: I would say that the movie backed off on them a little bit, because it actually took Lupin and the new character.

739
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,230
Rym: There's always the new character in a Lupin.

740
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:22,170
Scott: There's always the new plot character who's in this movie only, and you never hear from them again every single time.

741
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:28,470
Rym: It gives both of them more development than they would either get in any other Lupin.

742
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,530
Rym: Like that's the trade-off.

743
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,629
Scott: Yep, I think that is true.

744
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:36,115
Rym: I did particularly enjoy the villains, because there's two villains, like even on the movie poster.

745
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:38,567
Rym: you can look at it and be like, "Okay, those are the two

746
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:38,969
Rym: villains.".

747
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:51,890
Scott: The one villain was more of like just a Nazi, but the other one, the more main villain that gets more focused, is actually somewhat interesting and complicated even though he's-

748
00:52:52,010 --> 00:53:02,390
Rym: Also a Nazi, but like one's the Nazi fanatic, like Hitler's still alive in Brazil type of Nazi, and the second one is like complicated relationship with granddaughter and the world.

749
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,670
Scott: Right, he actually cares about a person.

750
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:13,790
Rym: Yeah, and as a villain duo, they work better than the villains tend to in a lot of Lupin's.

751
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:20,710
Scott: Yeah, especially since it's not always clear, in a lot of Lupin's it's clear that there's a boss and there's a square boss.

752
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:21,669
Scott: That's the real boss.

753
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,568
Rym: Oh my god, the one where the boss keeps murdering with the flyswatter, with the poison one by one like that.

754
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,870
Scott: Right, but in this Lupin it's not always clear which of them is like the bigger boss.

755
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,490
Scott: There's almost like this sort of up and down between them.

756
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,650
Rym: There's a power struggle between the two of them that was never resolved until the end of the movie.

757
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:46,527
Scott: Yes, in some points in the movie like one of them is like sort of like threatening the other, like, "Oh, I'm in charge

758
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:46,790
Scott: here.".

759
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,287
Scott: And then at other points it's like, "No, I'm in charge

760
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:49,649
Scott: here.".

761
00:53:51,254 --> 00:53:59,690
Scott: And it's not the usual Megatron/Starscream thing where like one of them is just a jerk, and Megatron is actually in charge.

762
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:05,369
Scott: It's more of a, you know, I guess I can't use Transformers again, it doesn't really fit.

763
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:11,770
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like, yeah, it'd be like if there were two Megatrons and they were there at the same time.

764
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:18,249
Rym: There's an active power struggle between two people who are equally powerful and equally weak, just in different ways.

765
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:20,950
Scott: And it's kind of interesting.

766
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,407
Rym: Like that's more nuanced than I think any Lupin villain has ever been.

767
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:24,507
Rym: Ever.

768
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,569
Scott: That's true, that's true I think.

769
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:37,470
Scott: And considering that the rest of the plot of the movie is so, I guess, cookie cutter, you sort of need that to like spice things up and keep some interest.

770
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:43,989
Rym: Now I will say, I'm good with how cookie cutter the rest of it was, mostly because it was such- It was an excellent cookie.

771
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:53,490
Rym: It was a visual treat, like the acting was perfect, everything was so good, that it was like the best possible completely plain sugar cookie.

772
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,130
Scott: Yeah, it's like, hey, let's make a chocolate chip cookie.

773
00:54:56,632 --> 00:54:57,750
Scott: It's just a chocolate chip cookie.

774
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:04,430
Scott: We didn't spice it up with like, you know, some Sriracha chocolate chip cookie, or peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, or fancy expensive chocolate, right?

775
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,510
Scott: It's just a fucking damn good chocolate chip cookie.

776
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,390
Scott: Look at that, it's a perfect circle, exactly the right consistency and texture, perfectly baked.

777
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:17,208
Scott: It's like, dang, don't come here expecting, you know, your Sriracha peanut butter cookie, right?

778
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:23,870
Scott: But guess what, the absolute perfect chocolate chip cookie, you would tell me you wouldn't eat that?

779
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,288
Scott: You'd be like, no, I'm not going to eat that.

780
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:37,990
Rym: But along those lines, the other thing I would say is, I would add this to my list of, if someone had never seen or heard of Lupin at all, this would not be a bad one for them to see first.

781
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:43,230
Scott: If they, yeah, I mean, you might see this first, I think it would be great.

782
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,630
Scott: Yeah, seeing this first is perfect.

783
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,630
Scott: Because every Lupin, whenever anyone sees Lupin first.

784
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:56,110
Scott: If they become such a big Lupin fan that they're going deep and watching the ones with Lupin is evil, this starting one might cause a surprise later.

785
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,370
Rym: I don't think that's a problem, because most people get started on Cagliostro.

786
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,169
Scott: If you're going that deep, you know, yeah.

787
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:07,330
Rym: People already start on Cagliostro, and then they watch like, I don't know, Mama, and they're like, what the fuck is wrong with Lupin?

788
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:08,693
Scott: Exactly.

789
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:11,630
Scott: Yeah, this is a perfectly fine first Lupin movie.

790
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:22,730
Rym: Yeah, you know, partly just because every Lupin movie, anyone, the first Lupin movie you see, you got, like, you're going to learn the deal with these characters just by jumping right in.

791
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,890
Rym: Like, there's no, like, the origin story movie to watch.

792
00:56:26,211 --> 00:56:34,062
Rym: Even the first cartoon, the first episode of the first show just assumes you know who the fuck these people are and dives right in, because it kind of doesn't matter.

793
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:35,670
Rym: You'll figure it out along the way.

794
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:49,789
Scott: And also, maybe, you know, the fact that some of the side characters barely appear might intrigue someone who maybe, you know, thinks, you know, if you think Goemon is cool or something, or you think Jigen is cool, and you're like, oh, I want to see more Jigen, well, guess what?

795
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:54,969
Scott: There's a whole, there's plenty of other things you can watch that have a lot more Jigen action in them.

796
00:56:55,430 --> 00:57:05,129
Rym: Well, like, case in point, the show, the Fujikomiine anime series, that one almost does, like, an origin story of all the characters, but, like, a twisted one.

797
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:12,510
Scott: But that one is the one I would not show to someone first, because-- Oh, no, no, if you don't know anything about Lupin, that's no good for you.

798
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:27,341
Rym: That nonsense is completely uninteresting to you, unless you already care about and are interested in these characters, and then you see, like, those versions of those characters and that evolution of, like, the characters together, and you're intrigued by it, and, like, you want to go deep.

799
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:35,988
Rym: Someone could watch this, and, like, oh, I wonder what the deal is with Jigen, and then watch Fujikomiine and Grave of Jigen Daisuke and be like, ooh.

800
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:42,130
Scott: Yep, so try to think of anything negative to say, because it wasn't, like, a perfect movie in all ways, right?

801
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,859
Rym: I kind of would have liked it to be a little longer and have, like, one more-- You said longer.

802
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,650
Scott: I was going to say shorter.

803
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:48,157
Rym: I think they already cut a lot out.

804
00:57:48,198 --> 00:58:03,610
Rym: I think the movie was actually edited pretty much perfectly, because, much like Indiana Jones and the arc of the covenant, like, that whole story, it skips over a bunch of stuff, like, when he just rides the submarine to the destination.

805
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:08,370
Rym: This movie, like, Lupin and the girl are about to go break into a thing.

806
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:11,504
Rym: It just cuts to them having already broken into the thing.

807
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:12,830
Rym: It cuts to the good part.

808
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:24,565
Scott: It does do that, but at the same time, when it starts getting towards the end, and you think, like, ah, this is the climactic thing, it felt like I was starting to feel a little bit like, ah, this is the final eh, and it's like, that wasn't the final eh?

809
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:25,390
Scott: There's another eh?

810
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:26,619
Scott: And then another eh?

811
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,690
Scott: And then it was over.

812
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:33,190
Rym: I don't know, the Hitler no Fukkatsu eh was a beat that I both didn't expect and appreciated greatly.

813
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:38,930
Scott: I mean, it wasn't bad, but it felt like, you know, I looked at my watch at least one time, right?

814
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:40,690
Scott: Not ten times, but, like, one time.

815
00:58:40,750 --> 00:59:04,730
Rym: I think part of the reason I didn't was that if I had to describe the animation, like, the end result of watching everything, like, kind of like we talked about in the very beginning about the animation style, it's so rich and, like, thick and detailed and textured and stylized, like, all the little details on the screen were just such a pleasure to the eye that I kind of just wanted to keep seeing more of it longer.

816
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:14,490
Rym: But, to your point, the movie was edited well enough to, like, not make it drag on, and if they added more scenes, I might have started to feel that drag.

817
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:23,110
Scott: The other thing is that some of the action scenes, right, were excellent, especially, like, the laser, you know, a typical laser tunnel, right?

818
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,566
Rym: Oh, the laser tunnel was so good.

819
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,320
Scott: Laser tunnel, laser tunnel's such a cliché, right?

820
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,429
Scott: It's like, oh, you gotta, even a coupon is a cliché.

821
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,910
Rym: But the twist with the cane and the hat?

822
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:35,490
Scott: Right, but not just the cane and the hat, but, like, the way it was animated and, right?

823
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,610
Rym: When it slows down for the one moment.

824
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:38,193
Scott: Right, exactly.

825
00:59:38,213 --> 00:59:40,710
Scott: It's like, that may be the best laser tunnel I ever seen.

826
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,830
Scott: Fuck you, Mission Impossible laser tunnel, right?

827
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,629
Scott: It's like, you suck compared to this one.

828
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:53,249
Scott: But on other parts, right, the action scenes were kind of, okay, good, you know, nothing to write home about, right?

829
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:59,590
Scott: But if you think of, like, other coupons, like Castle of Cagliostro, you've got, like, the iconic clock scene, right?

830
01:00:00,432 --> 01:00:03,569
Rym: Or the swimming through the canal scene.

831
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:13,090
Scott: Right, it's like, this didn't have, maybe laser tunnel scene is the one, but other than that, it didn't really have the X scene, right?

832
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,689
Scott: Or more than one of them, at least.

833
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:24,449
Rym: Like, the two action scenes, well, the three action scenes that actually stood out the most, that were just, actually, no, none of them were iconic, but they were all, like, above average, because I was trying to list them.

834
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,410
Rym: Like, there's the fist fight he has, which was just, like, cowboy bebop levels.

835
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:32,125
Rym: There was the plane fight.

836
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:33,310
Rym: when Fujiko comes in.

837
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,049
Rym: Like, that was actually really fun.

838
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:41,209
Rym: The bit where he grabs onto the front of the wing, and then the girl grabs on, and kind of knocks him off, and they, like, go back and forth a little bit.

839
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,990
Scott: Well, that started with the scene where they're falling out of the sky.

840
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:45,850
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

841
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:54,590
Scott: But then you've got the car chase in the very beginning, which was-- You've got to have a car chase at the start of a Lupin movie, otherwise it's a Lupin movie.

842
01:00:55,171 --> 01:00:55,362
Scott: Come on.

843
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:57,014
Rym: But yeah, you're right.

844
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:02,510
Rym: There were many great action scenes, but there was no, like, THE action scene.

845
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,870
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing, like, you know, some iconic thing to--.

846
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,538
Rym: Well, like, Babylon Gold.

847
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:10,290
Rym: All right, they're on motorcycles on that clown face.

848
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,301
Scott: Motorcycle on the clown face.

849
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:11,970
Scott: That's iconic.

850
01:01:13,615 --> 01:01:14,869
Scott: It's a very memorable scene.

851
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:23,630
Rym: But yeah, I would, like, without reservation recommend watching this movie to anyone who would listen to GeekNights.

852
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:28,770
Scott: If you're an anime person, if you like animation, do you like animated movies at all?

853
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:28,919
Scott: At all.

854
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:38,530
Scott: If you like Indiana Jones, if you like a Lupin, if you, you know, any-- Most people would be well-served watching this movie, I'd say.

855
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,610
Rym: Like, I would recommend this to, like, my dad, or my mom.

856
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,183
Scott: How long is it?

857
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:43,649
Scott: Two hours?

858
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:44,917
Rym: Not even.

859
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:45,966
Rym: It's, uh, 93 minutes.

860
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:51,024
Scott: All right, you want 93 minutes of fun, that's got a better.

861
01:01:51,024 --> 01:01:52,028
Scott: 93 minutes of fun?
