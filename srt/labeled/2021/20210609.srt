1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,790
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,071
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:12,956
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,505
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:18,540
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about comic and cartoon merch.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,877
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:36,300
Rym: So, uh, last night, at almost exactly 3.10 AM, someone very near our apartment put on what I have to assume was a full professional fireworks show.

8
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,580
Scott: You were loud enough to be one.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,045
Rym: It was loud enough to where I was woken up.

10
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:42,589
Rym: Like, first, I had a dream.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,039
Rym: And in the dream, all hell broke loose, and it turned into a war.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,665
Rym: And I was, like, in a war and trying to escape.

13
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:55,480
Rym: And then I kind of woke up, and it was so loud that I sat up, and it took me a minute.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,273
Rym: I actually had to think, is that a war?

15
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:01,300
Rym: The fuck is going on outside?

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:09,140
Rym: And it took me about 30 seconds to wake up enough to recognize that this was not the sound of gunfire, which, if you're not familiar, is very distinctive.

17
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,566
Rym: It was the sound of a shit ton of fireworks.

18
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,351
Rym: Like, holy crap.

19
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,794
Rym: This was a lot of fireworks.

20
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,780
Rym: And this went on for, like, a half hour.

21
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,223
Rym: So I laid there for a half hour.

22
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:35,218
Rym: I didn't call the cops, one, because fuck the cops, but two, because this has been such a problem in Queens lately that probably thousands of people had already called them.

23
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:36,680
Rym: There was no point in me calling them.

24
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,614
Scott: It's basically the same problem we discussed with the fart cars, right?

25
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,020
Scott: You know, is there a certain people?

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,840
Rym: Both of these things started last year during COVID.

27
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,371
Scott: No, they've always been around.

28
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,400
Scott: The fart cars started before we were alive.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,120
Rym: So I guess the difference is, the fart cars started becoming a lot more common during the quarantine.

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:03,735
Scott: Yes, there has been an upscaling, an escalation, right, in these things in recent times, past couple years.

31
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,398
Scott: But they've always been a thing.

32
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,380
Scott: They're not new.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,064
Rym: But the fireworks, there was some thing that happened, because it wasn't just in New York.

34
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:11,445
Rym: It was all over America.

35
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,710
Rym: All summer last year, people were freaking out about illegal fireworks everywhere.

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:24,740
Rym: Best I can tell, something happened where a lot of really cheap illegal fireworks made their way to the US, and people could just get them.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,200
Rym: And it turns out, if it's easy to get illegal fireworks, people use them, which honestly, when I was a kid, we went through a lot of hassle to get illegal fireworks and enjoyed them mightily.

38
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:40,580
Rym: If they were as easy to get when I was a kid as they are now, I would have been a problem for my local community.

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean, people in our neighborhood growing up had them, but they were, you know, they didn't have that many, right?

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,400
Scott: They would just, they'd be like, you know, on their way home from whatever state they would stop at the fireworks store.

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:59,180
Scott: They bought, you know, like maybe one or two of those boxes full of random stuff like the little cardboard tank or, you know, a little spiral tower.

42
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,480
Rym: No, we would go down to Tennessee and get mortars and bottle rockets.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,339
Scott: The disc that spins in the street, you know.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,100
Rym: Yeah, we'd go down and get like the dangerous good stuff from the south and bring it up every year.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,288
Scott: Yeah, but they would get like one box of stuff.

46
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,359
Scott: They wouldn't fill the entire back of their, you know, a truck with like an arsenal.

47
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:27,560
Rym: Yeah, our big like illegal fireworks shows when I was a kid were like two mortars and about a half hour's worth of bottle rockets.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,852
Rym: And then we'd shoot Roman candles at each other and go home.

49
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:30,859
Rym: Like it wasn't like this.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,659
Scott: For example, like, you know, someone would come and they'd have a bunch of like the tiniest fireworks, you know, the ones on a string, right?

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,120
Scott: They'd have like a shit ton of those and then it'd be like, yeah, I went and I was able to get fireworks from out of state.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,802
Scott: Look at all these.

53
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,918
Scott: I bought a million of the cheapest firecrackers and one M80.

54
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,359
Scott: And you would fire all the little guys and then you would make a small hole in the back in the backyard with the M80.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
Rym: And that was the highlight.

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,904
Rym: See, most M80s were fake.

57
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:04,420
Rym: I found like a lot of things that were called M80s were not because if it was a real M80, it's it's like an eighth to a quarter stick of dynamite, depending on how you look at it.

58
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:05,460
Rym: Like old M80s.

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,160
Scott: I mean, regardless of how of whether it was, you know, an eighth, you know, how big of an explosion it was, it was big enough, right?

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,420
Scott: Yeah.

61
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,320
Rym: I mean, what we do is we take an M80 and we put it in a garbage can that was upside down and launched it into the air in the woods.

62
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,759
Rym: Like that was our our toy.

63
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:33,200
Rym: Anyway, so that happened and I'm a little tired this morning because I woke it up for a half hour at 3.10 a.m They've never been loud enough to actually wake me up or bother me because I don't mind them that much.

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,938
Rym: But they must have been like on our street or like right next door.

65
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,399
Rym: So, yeah, that was fun.

66
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:43,520
Rym: And other Rym only opening bit news.

67
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,540
Rym: I just want to briefly tell the story of Glamdring the Foe Hammer.

68
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,360
Scott: OK, you and your you and your Foe Hammer.

69
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:57,040
Rym: I fully admit I'm the only person on earth, I think, who makes this who finds this amusing, except for the person who made the original.

70
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,780
Rym: In 2012, I can't believe was that long ago, The Hobbit movie came out.

71
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,439
Rym: It was pretty good because it had the songs.

72
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:03,576
Rym: I really enjoyed it.

73
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:09,760
Rym: The second Hobbit movie was terrible and I didn't even bother watching the third Hobbit movie.

74
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:14,960
Scott: I only saw the first one, which had good and bad points, and then I didn't watch the other two.

75
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:15,420
Rym: Yep.

76
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:18,540
Rym: I found it funny that you didn't realize there were three of them.

77
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,479
Scott: And also, I thought that I thought there were only two.

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,099
Rym: There should have only been one because the first movie may be two at most because the first one ended when they all get picked up by the eagles in the trees with the fire.

79
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:37,460
Scott: The way I see it is the books, there were three Lord of the Rings books, depending, you know, we could talk about token stuff, right?

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:47,360
Scott: How they were like, you can, it could be, I don't know, it could be seven books or whatever, but the point is there were three Lord of the Rings books.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,700
Scott: There was one Hobbit book, so there should be one Hobbit movie.

82
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:57,580
Rym: But the first Hobbit movie got like four fifths of the way through the book, and then they made two more movies somehow.

83
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,919
Scott: I mean, you know, it could have been one long movie.

84
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:06,100
Scott: The Hobbit book isn't any longer than a Lord of the Rings book.

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Rym: But the real sin was there wasn't any singing in the second two movies, which was just like, why even make a Hobbit movie if you're not going to put all the songs in there?

86
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,737
Rym: Like, come on.

87
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:25,500
Scott: You sort of, that was the one, you know, that singing, the beginning of the first movie was like the only part that actually captured the feeling of the Hobbit book.

88
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,320
Scott: And then it's like, okay, they're trying, I can see what they're trying to do, and then they abandoned it.

89
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,260
Rym: When they sang, they cracked the pots, cracked the plates and banged the pots or whatever, that song, I got legit fucking excited.

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,020
Rym: And when they sang that Misty Mountain song, I got chills.

91
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,020
Scott: They should have kept that feeling going for the whole fucking movie, and then that's the whole movie.

92
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Rym: Yeah, you didn't give me any tra-la-la-la-lolly here down in the valley, like what, what the hell?

93
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:59,160
Rym: But almost immediately after the Hobbit came out, someone who is now gone, as far as I can tell, made a YouTube video that they just called Fauxhammer.

94
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,540
Rym: And it was basically the video that I'm going to link to because I found it really funny.

95
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,660
Rym: No one else did.

96
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,496
Rym: I think I even linked to it on the GeekNights.

97
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:08,860
Rym: In fact, I did.

98
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,199
Rym: I found, I linked to it on the old GeekNights forum long ago.

99
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,166
Rym: It disappeared.

100
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:16,179
Rym: It got taken down for copyright at some point.

101
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:21,500
Rym: And the YouTube account that uploaded it also got taken down, and it was just gone.

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,300
Rym: It is, as far as I can tell, I would love if someone could find this for me or find the person who made the original.

103
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,461
Rym: It disappeared within a couple years of it being made back in like 2012.

104
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:37,259
Rym: And every now and then I'd remember it, I'd want to reference it or bother someone with it, and I couldn't find it.

105
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Rym: So yesterday, I was like literally playing a Blades in the Dark game, and I remembered it again because I wanted to reference it.

106
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,363
Rym: I searched for it.

107
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:45,985
Rym: I couldn't find it.

108
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:47,010
Rym: And I was like, "Fuck it.

109
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,738
Rym: I'm going to remake this thing from

110
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:49,140
Rym: memory.".

111
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:54,180
Rym: And I remade this video as shot for shot as I could from my memory.

112
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,840
Rym: It's 36 seconds long, and I uploaded it to YouTube.

113
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,840
Rym: So I have recreated a piece of the internet that was gone.

114
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,840
Scott: Probably inaccurately because your memory.

115
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,840
Rym: Yeah, but I think I got it as close as I possibly could.

116
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,874
Rym: I hope against hope I can find the original and see how good my 2021 memory of this 2012 video.

117
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:17,500
Rym: that was also stupid shitposting that was made for me and me alone.

118
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,134
Rym: How accurate that was.

119
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,868
Scott: That is a common fun activity I see people doing.

120
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:24,658
Scott: I see people doing stuff like, "Draw Pokémon from

121
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:25,120
Scott: memory.".

122
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,494
Scott: It's like, "How good is your memory?

123
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:27,776
Scott: Draw

124
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:28,219
Scott: Pokémon.".

125
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,937
Scott: And then when you're done, you look and you're like,

126
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:31,017
Scott: "Ahh.".

127
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:40,559
Rym: But it's also hard because, as we know with the Mandela Effect, it is very easy to have a very clear memory of something that is just not true.

128
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,597
Rym: You can remember things that didn't happen.

129
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:51,140
Rym: So yeah, you can watch Glamdring the Foehammer, and if you don't find it funny, well, yeah, I made this for me.

130
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,849
Rym: Alright, so you got any news?

131
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,140
Rym: It is anime, manga, and comic day.

132
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,080
Scott: Yeah, so there's this auction company, Heritage Auctions, right?

133
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,660
Scott: They got a janky old kind of website, but they run legitimate auctions.

134
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,246
Scott: You know, they're trying to make money.

135
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:11,291
Scott: They're an auction place.

136
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,500
Scott: They're, you know, exactly what you think they are, right?

137
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,840
Scott: It's the kind of place that would, you know, you imagine this place being run by like a 90-year-old guy selling coins and stamps.

138
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,458
Scott: It's the kind of, that's the kind of deal it is.

139
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,227
Scott: But they got this auction that just started.

140
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:29,860
Scott: It's got maybe 17 days left, like a couple weeks left.

141
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:34,268
Scott: And it's full of all sorts of anime and animation stuff.

142
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:40,940
Scott: Mostly sells, but not just sells, other stuff as well, including like some action figures and some, all kinds of stuff.

143
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:53,740
Scott: And it has material from things as old as like, you know, Testagen 28, Astro Boy, I saw even one like, you know, ancient manga from 18-something, right?

144
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:54,592
Rym: Alright, alright.

145
00:09:55,942 --> 00:10:03,254
Scott: And also it's got like Simpson's cells, peanuts, you know, great pumpkin cells.

146
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:06,840
Scott: It's like Evangelion cell going for a bunch of money already.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:18,380
Scott: Like there's all the variety of stuff in there and the quality level is like, you know, usually when you look at the cells on sale, like a convention, it's like, you know, it's the back of someone's head.

148
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,048
Scott: It's like, you know, it's that kind of stuff, right?

149
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,017
Scott: Almost all of these are like, whoa, really?

150
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:25,020
Scott: Where the hell did you get that from?

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,900
Scott: You know, it's like, I don't know where this collection came from, but it's on sale and you can bid on it.

152
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:40,620
Scott: And my strategy is going to be, I'm not paying like $100 for a piece of plastic with some paint on it, no matter who painted it or what that art is.

153
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,668
Rym: Because I have one irresponsible Captain Tyler cell.

154
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:47,660
Rym: that's really good, but I recall paying what felt like a lot of money for it at the time.

155
00:10:48,441 --> 00:11:00,179
Scott: But hopefully some of these will, there's so many items in this auction, I'm wondering if it's possible that like some of them will go unnoticed and I can be like $1 and just snatch something that no one cares about, right?

156
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:13,540
Scott: Some of the items, yeah, at the end of the auction, I think the way it works is that some of the items go for live auction, which happens I think in person and on the phone and on the internet.

157
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,327
Scott: But some of them don't.

158
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,615
Scott: Some of them are just like, you know, no one cares about these.

159
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,800
Scott: So it's sort of like internet only.

160
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,391
Scott: And those are the ones that you might be able to sneak out of there for $1.

161
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,781
Scott: Because every single item started at $0.

162
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:29,080
Scott: Even the ones that are now at like many hundreds started at $0.

163
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,757
Rym: Some of them are still at $0 and are pretty great.

164
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,281
Scott: A lot of them are still at $0.

165
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:37,080
Rym: Oh shit, this is a really good Sailor Stars sell.

166
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,127
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in there that's like, whoa, but there's so many items.

167
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:46,840
Scott: Like I went through every single item and you can pick, you can basically watch the ones you care about.

168
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:51,841
Rym: Alright, the Ava01 losing its shit is already $400.

169
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,502
Scott: Yeah, that's the one.

170
00:11:52,763 --> 00:12:00,560
Scott: I followed that one yesterday and then today I got the, they send you an email that's like, you know, every day you can have a thing that's like a report on all the things you're watching.

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,611
Scott: Yesterday it was $0, today it was $500.

172
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:03,780
Scott: I'm like, unwatch.

173
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,058
Scott: The end.

174
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,118
Scott: There's a perfect blue cell in there.

175
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:15,700
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting because cells from anime are such a, like, they really only existed for this brief span of time.

176
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,606
Rym: And that's it.

177
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:18,692
Rym: Like, there won't be more.

178
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:20,100
Rym: No one's ever going to do this again.

179
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:24,414
Scott: I mean, there might be like one thing here or there, but, you know.

180
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:25,620
Scott: Anyway.

181
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,560
Scott: Yeah, I got a few.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,800
Scott: I wish they would auction off like, you know, hey, you know, the actual files on our computers at the animation studio, right?

183
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:40,540
Scott: You know, but, uh, and then it's like, yeah, if you want to share the, you know, if you want to share them on the internet after you buy them, that's on you.

184
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Scott: But we know they're all, they're not accessible on the internet.

185
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,808
Scott: Clearly they're on our hard drives at our studio.

186
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,920
Scott: We'll sell you the, a copy of our like Photoshop file, right?

187
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,327
Scott: You'll be, we're only selling it once.

188
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,720
Scott: You don't need NFTs and crypto bullshit, right?

189
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,291
Scott: Just be like, hey, we have these files on our hard drive.

190
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,798
Scott: We'll sell you the PSD.

191
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,966
Scott: We're only going to ever sell it.

192
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,032
Scott: one time, we promise.

193
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,439
Scott: We'll sign a contract with you.

194
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,290
Scott: We'll send you the Photoshop file and we'll never sell it again.

195
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,097
Scott: And now it's yours to do with what you wish, right?

196
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:09,720
Scott: That kind of thing.

197
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:09,980
Scott: Yep.

198
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:16,560
Rym: Thing is, actually, now that we've rearranged the room, the few cells that we own, I'm getting them nicely framed and we're going to put them up and do a thing with them.

199
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,480
Rym: Because the only reason to own one of these cells is if you're going to display it and show it to people.

200
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,021
Rym: Yeah.

201
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,147
Scott: I mean, I have this, I have this space back here behind me to the right.

202
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:31,380
Scott: that is strangely a conveniently like movie, regular movie poster size, but I gotta, I gotta choose one.

203
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,146
Scott: I got, I have some, but also I could buy a new one.

204
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,050
Scott: Obviously I wouldn't buy an original one.

205
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,700
Scott: I would buy like a reproduction of one, you know, but there's so many choices.

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,639
Scott: It's hard to, it's hard to pick just one to go in there.

207
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,240
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,899
Rym: So in some other news, I'll do a brief Geek Bite on this.

209
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:54,597
Rym: While it is a live action show, it is an adaptation of a comic that I actually didn't finish reading, even though I was really excited about it.

210
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:55,900
Rym: We even talked about it on GeekNights.

211
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,739
Rym: Jeff Lemire made fame, I was about to say famous for Essex County, but I suspect that is the thing he's actually least well known for.

212
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,544
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,374
Rym: Jeff Lemire is just a creative powerhouse and Sweet Tooth, a comic about a hybrid deer boy in a post-apocalyptic world.

214
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,460
Rym: I read the very beginning of it and it was really good.

215
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,527
Scott: And I read the first couple of volumes.

216
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,460
Scott: I have all the volumes except for apparently a newer volume.

217
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,428
Rym: There's one more volume.

218
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,460
Rym: It'll finish in August.

219
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:22,920
Scott: Yeah.

220
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,294
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's called Sweet Tooth Returns or something that I didn't realize was coming out is just coming out now, right?

221
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,500
Scott: How many years after the original comic ended?

222
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,507
Scott: I have all the six original volumes.

223
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,611
Scott: I just haven't read them all.

224
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,820
Scott: So I'm going to do that and then I'm going to watch the show.

225
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,524
Rym: So I watched a couple episodes of the TV series on Netflix.

226
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,668
Rym: So far, it's real good.

227
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:51,638
Rym: And what I appreciate about it the most is I just learned today, one, they make the kid really cute instead of sort of gangly and weird looking like in the comic.

228
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:53,120
Rym: Like the hybrid kids are just really cute.

229
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.

230
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,169
Rym: But two, the ears are prosthetics.

231
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,734
Rym: They're not composited.

232
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,679
Rym: It's all practical effects, which is kind of cool.

233
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,119
Scott: Well, I mean, at least for that part of it.

234
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,122
Rym: Yeah.

235
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,928
Rym: And three, it's a kind of heavy adaptation.

236
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:13,660
Rym: Like from what I remember of the beginning of the comic, this leaves a lot out and focuses on different things.

237
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:27,520
Rym: And that actually gives me a lot of hope, because usually if a TV show like an anime adaptation of a manga, for example, is just exactly one to one, the manga or the comic, those tend to not be that great.

238
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:37,360
Rym: And I usually would prefer to just go to the source rather than read the adaptation like the Death Note anime compared to just reading the Death Note manga.

239
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:37,841
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:42,550
Scott: I mean, that's the dilemma when you're adapting something.

241
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,037
Scott: Which is why I'm usually like, stop making adaptations, just make everything original.

242
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:46,919
Scott: Then you don't have this problem.

243
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,380
Scott: But anyway.

244
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,940
Rym: But if the adaptation is loose.

245
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:59,956
Scott: When you make an adaptation, if you just adapt something 100% perfectly true to the original or whatever came before, it's like, why even bother?

246
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,420
Scott: I just pick one of the choices.

247
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,123
Scott: Like Urasawa's Monster.

248
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,931
Rym: That manga is like one of the best comics I've ever read.

249
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,420
Rym: And the anime is just that, but not in the original format.

250
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:13,661
Rym: Yeah.

251
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:17,530
Scott: And you could also go the route where you change everything up.

252
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,160
Scott: But the problem is a lot of times people change everything up and it's like, ah, you ruined it.

253
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:23,763
Scott: Right.

254
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:33,160
Scott: You have to, when you're adapting, somehow change things up and not ruin it at the same time, which is, you know, difficult.

255
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:45,120
Rym: Now, in my experience, like as a reader of things and also working with creative people, I feel like a general rule is the best adaptations are where the original thing wasn't that great.

256
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:53,380
Rym: But there was good stuff going on and someone takes that and then adapts it and polishes the parts that were good and leaves out the parts that were meh.

257
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:02,860
Rym: And it ends up diverging further from the source material than a lot of adaptations, but often can end up being better than the original or at least complimentary to the original.

258
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:14,960
Scott: I always say the best, I think I probably said this before, I say it often, I must have said it on the show at some point, the best adaptations are usually when you adapt Broadway or theater to movies.

259
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,146
Scott: Because you don't have to change much, right, at all.

260
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:26,180
Scott: And really what you're doing is you're just replacing the single stage with, you know, the limitations of having sets.

261
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,876
Rym: No, Les Mis, that movie, yeesh.

262
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,980
Scott: I don't think I saw Les Mis, the movie, I just saw it in an actual Broadway theater.

263
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,636
Rym: Phantom of the Opera, the movie, yeesh.

264
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:40,480
Scott: I didn't see that either, I just watched Phantom of the Opera in the theater.

265
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,540
Rym: Alright, well what's a Broadway thing was turned into a movie that was good that you have seen?

266
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:56,300
Scott: Cabaret is a legendary movie, West Side Story is a legendary movie, I mean there's just so many, Chicago.

267
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,920
Rym: Yeah, but I guess I can think of an equal number of counter examples.

268
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,900
Scott: I'm not saying it's 100% guaranteed, right, I'm just saying.

269
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,460
Rym: Yeah, but so far we get like a 50/50 hit rate with our anecdotal not comprehensive.

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,540
Scott: If I bring up my powers of Google, I could probably vastly increase the hits.

271
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,640
Rym: Yeah, but I suspect I could vastly increase the misses.

272
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,920
Rym: The thing is I couldn't use Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark because that was a Broadway thing made from Spider-Man, so that doesn't count.

273
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:41,360
Rym: Anyway, what I will say, because I don't want to try to trick you again into turning a whole show into a news roundup, but Sweet Tooth seems like it's adapting enough and leaving behind details enough to focus on interesting things to make a pretty good show.

274
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:45,240
Rym: And so far, the first season is only 8 episodes long and what I've seen I've liked.

275
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:48,839
Scott: I saw the trailer, it looked good.

276
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,902
Rym: It just looks great.

277
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:58,660
Rym: In some other news, if you didn't notice, Netflix is for real making a Cowboy Bebop live action series.

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,380
Rym: That is actually happening.

279
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,280
Scott: This isn't one of those where it keeps getting brought up but never actually finished and you don't believe it's going to really happen.

280
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,280
Scott: Like, Ava live action, never going to happen, Akira live action.

281
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,960
Scott: These things that people have been trying to do for a long time and never happen and it's just like, whatever.

282
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,340
Scott: Why are you even bothering with that nonsense?

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,976
Scott: Or it's not one of those things where they do it and everyone just wipes it out of their mind?

284
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:27,580
Scott: because it was so terrible, which is obviously going to be from the beginning, like Ghost in the Shell live action, which I didn't even see.

285
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,620
Scott: I forgot it existed until very recently.

286
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:38,680
Rym: It sucks because I feel like the best case scenario for a live action remake, because this is a special situation.

287
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,200
Rym: Like, Cowboy Bebop is a phenomenal standalone work.

288
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,560
Rym: This is like, if you're a gamer nerd, Chrono Trigger.

289
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,380
Rym: No one made anything like it before.

290
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,860
Rym: No one successfully made anything like it or better than it after.

291
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,079
Rym: It kind of stands alone.

292
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,020
Rym: Cowboy Bebop very much stands alone for a lot of reasons.

293
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,842
Rym: We probably reviewed it back in like 2006.

294
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,393
Scott: Regardless, I feel like what's the reason to do this?

295
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,940
Rym: I don't feel like there is a reason to do this.

296
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,620
Rym: There is a very, very good reason to do it because someone believes they will make money.

297
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:17,500
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so this doesn't need to be made, but the news about it is actually a very enticing news.

298
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:24,480
Rym: Yup, Yoko Kanno, one of the greatest composers of modern music.

299
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:29,340
Rym: Like, Yoko Kanno is a very important person if you somehow don't know who this is.

300
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,440
Scott: The person who made the music for the original, which is a very important part of the original.

301
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,539
Scott: It probably would have been like a B show at best without that music.

302
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:41,160
Scott: Has been hired to make the music for the live action remake.

303
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,720
Scott: They could have just reused the music.

304
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,159
Rym: I feel like you could have reused it straight up.

305
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,394
Scott: Yeah, just reuse it directly.

306
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:49,120
Scott: Why even bother?

307
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:54,540
Scott: You know, Anno made Shin Godzilla and he just reused the music from Ava.

308
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,937
Scott: He didn't make the music, right?

309
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,579
Scott: You know, the same timpani, whatever track that is.

310
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,420
Scott: But they're at least getting the original composer to just make more music.

311
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,339
Scott: And it's like, all right, all right.

312
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,559
Scott: I guess that's something positive maybe, you know.

313
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,299
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting.

314
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:15,339
Scott: It makes me want to hear the soundtrack to it.

315
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:18,579
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty much down for anything Yoko Kanno does.

316
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:22,819
Rym: It's just interesting to think, too, that Cowboy Bebop was such a phenomenal score.

317
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,240
Rym: Irrespective of being a phenomenal show.

318
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,640
Rym: It was like this intersection of music and writing and acting and like everything came together.

319
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Rym: But like Escaflowne, that was Yoko Kanno music.

320
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,620
Rym: Ghost in the Shell, like Stand Alone Complex.

321
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:37,659
Rym: Yeah, all that biz.

322
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,298
Rym: Lot of Yoko Kanno in there.

323
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,340
Rym: So I'm still not confident that this will be good.

324
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:53,400
Rym: I feel like the best case scenario is that it is not so bad that it taints the legacy of Cowboy Bebop somehow.

325
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,520
Scott: Like that somehow is moderately well received.

326
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,080
Scott: I think that tainting the legacy is like not a concern for pretty much anything, right?

327
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,360
Scott: That's something that you see fanboys saying, right?

328
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,275
Scott: Like, "Oh, you ruined Star

329
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:09,517
Scott: Wars.".

330
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,480
Scott: It's like the originals are unchanged, right?

331
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,460
Scott: And name one thing whose legacy has been ruined, right?

332
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,280
Scott: There's plenty of things that have had shitty adaptations and have had shitty sequels or prequels tacked on, right?

333
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,260
Scott: And the legacy of exactly zero of the good ones have been tainted.

334
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:32,140
Rym: The things that get tainted are usually because the creator did something shitty in the real world.

335
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,319
Scott: Yes, that can happen.

336
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Scott: But I'm saying there has never been a single quality artwork in any medium that I'm aware of that was tainted because of a shitty adaptation, remake, prequel, or sequel, right?

337
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:51,538
Scott: If there's a good thing, the goodness of that good thing carries on, right?

338
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,360
Scott: And I can't think of a single example of something that was actually tainted.

339
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,978
Rym: What'll be interesting is...

340
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,400
Scott: Other than by what Rym said, which is the shitty creator, or something else coming out, right?

341
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:06,360
Rym: The only thing I'm curious about is will people, because there's two things I've noticed as we've gotten older.

342
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:10,240
Rym: One, a lot of the younger anime fans performatively hate Cowboy Bebop.

343
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,300
Rym: Like, they think it's old person anime, it's edgelord.

344
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,420
Rym: I see young people, a lot of people have seen it.

345
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,538
Scott: Do you have evidence of this?

346
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,740
Rym: Look at the comments on some of our older YouTube videos.

347
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Rym: But more importantly, I did encounter a lot of people in my life who wouldn't watch Cowboy Bebop.

348
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,500
Rym: Mostly people who we would not be friends with, but I encountered in other circles.

349
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:32,020
Rym: Because they won't watch animation.

350
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:42,760
Rym: I'm curious if this will get an audience of people who have never seen the original because they don't watch animation, but will watch this because it's hyped and it's on Netflix.

351
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:45,299
Scott: I mean, I don't think so.

352
00:23:45,480 --> 00:24:01,360
Scott: I think, you know, if you, historically, other things that have been adapted to live action have not gotten... People who are like, you know, the people who have that ingrained attitude that animation is for kids, or, you know, they only want to watch live action things.

353
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,440
Rym: They tend to not like good things in general.

354
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,920
Scott: They tend not like good things in general, yes.

355
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:23,120
Scott: But also, you know, there have been plenty of live action adaptations of things, and those live action adaptations have either A, not drawn in an audience of newcomers, and have only drawn in an audience of the people who are a fan of the original thing, right?

356
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:34,560
Scott: And B, have definitely not brought people, you know, I'm not going to say nobody, but have not caused a massive surge of, you know, popularity for the original thing.

357
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:48,460
Rym: Well, the one difference here, though, is that here it looks like Netflix is actually trying to market this pretty heavily, and I'm curious to see if they do broad-based marketing, like the generic, like, put posters up at subways.

358
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,620
Scott: I mean, Netflix would have to... Netflix, do they even have animated Cowboy Bebop on Netflix?

359
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:56,560
Rym: I don't know where you'd watch Cowboy Bebop, currently.

360
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,960
Scott: Yeah, because, I mean, that's the minimum that you would have to do, is you would have to have both of them there, and you would have to have Netflix recommend to anyone who watched one watch the other one.

361
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,100
Scott: That would be like the start to even have a chance, right?

362
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:16,320
Scott: I mean, how many people, you know, watch Lord of the Rings and, you know, or read a game, watch a Game of Thrones, and it's like, sure, that did increase people reading the original book, right?

363
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,820
Scott: But A, it's percentage-wise pretty small, right?

364
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:26,560
Scott: Even though it does cause a surge, it's not, you know, most people who watch the movie did not go read the book, right?

365
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:26,781
Scott: Yeah.

366
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:31,180
Rym: Well, look at Marvel movies, so many people will think, "Oh, I should go read the comics,".

367
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,340
Rym: and then they find out why they don't like comics, at least those comics.

368
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:49,505
Scott: Yeah, or, right, and that's the thing, is the... and books don't have that sort of, you know, barrier where some adults have a closed-minded attitude about, you know, they don't have some closed-minded attitude that books are for kids, right?

369
00:25:49,565 --> 00:26:05,920
Scott: It's like, so, you could, you know, you see a limited surge for books, you're gonna see, like, no surge for animation or comics from, you know, people with that mindset, but people who don't already have that mindset, right, they might, you know, they might be good.

370
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,930
Rym: But, like, I wonder how Netflix is gonna market this.

371
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,519
Rym: Is that something we don't know, partly 'cause we don't see ads, like, we avoid ads?

372
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,139
Scott: The same way they market all their other stuff.

373
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,860
Rym: Yeah, but who will they target, what kind, where are they gonna run the ads, 'cause sometimes they'll run very focused campaigns, or...

374
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,679
Scott: In the Netflix app, where they do normally.

375
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Rym: Yeah, they also buy, like, subway posters and things, like, that happens kinda often.

376
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,979
Scott: Yeah, we'll see if it becomes subway poster popular.

377
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:34,460
Rym: I'm curious to see when and how they market it and how well it does and everything, but not actually really curious to watch it.

378
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,840
Scott: Hmm, I mean, now I'm curious to watch it so I can hear the soundtrack.

379
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,400
Rym: Yeah, maybe I can just buy the soundtrack.

380
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,059
Scott: Maybe it's on Spotify, or will be.

381
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,900
Scott: So, tiny little thing.

382
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,678
Scott: The regular one is.

383
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:48,584
Rym: I forgot about this.

384
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:52,199
Rym: This was announced in May, about a little under a month ago.

385
00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:00,560
Rym: But, uh, El Hazzard, The Magnificent World, the OAVs, are getting a Blu-ray remastered, like, re-release.

386
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,107
Rym: That is a forgotten show.

387
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,800
Rym: Like, people do not remember that show by and large.

388
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,980
Rym: And, uh, while the TV series of it is garbage, it is not part of this, thankfully.

389
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:19,220
Rym: Unfortunately, this includes both the first OAV, which is an underrated anime, and the second OAV, which is, just don't watch it, it's terrible.

390
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:27,299
Scott: Right, it's one of, look, the, what do you know, the TV series and the second OAV, and, I guess, are there movies maybe?

391
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:27,720
Scott: I don't know.

392
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,515
Scott: They have not tarnished the quality of the original OAV.

393
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:32,178
Scott: How about that?

394
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:32,620
Scott: Okay.

395
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,560
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to remember, like, just how bad that TV show was for El Hazzard.

396
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:44,200
Rym: But, uh, I rarely encounter people younger than us who have ever seen, heard of, ever thought about El Hazzard.

397
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:44,881
Scott: Why would they?

398
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:50,280
Scott: It was a less than, it was an unpopular, you know, minor show from a long time ago.

399
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,780
Rym: Yep.

400
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:52,083
Rym: It was moderately popular.

401
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:52,885
Rym: It was part of a boom.

402
00:27:53,325 --> 00:28:00,420
Scott: And, uh, I found this only, I think the only reason it was popular at all is because someone bothered to license it at, like, the right time.

403
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:08,380
Rym: But, uh, one thing I have found is over my life, whenever I've recommended someone to watch it or shown it to someone, they've always enjoyed it, because it, I'm not saying it's great.

404
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,062
Scott: It's fun.

405
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:12,289
Rym: It's just, it's, it is underrated and underwatched.

406
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:14,575
Scott: We did a show on it probably in 2000-something.

407
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:15,176
Rym: It is.

408
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,520
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure we reviewed it at some point.

409
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,706
Scott: 1078-something like that.

410
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,999
Rym: Something like that.

411
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,626
Rym: But, anyway, things of the day!

412
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,632
Rym: So, uh, you know that Super Mario Brothers movie?

413
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,277
Rym: Like, the one, the live action one?

414
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:33,900
Rym: The, the, the, the disaster?

415
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:35,459
Scott: Yes, we know.

416
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:50,220
Rym: So, there is an extended cut of this movie available, because if you've ever read much about, I'm gonna link to this article that goes into a lot of depth, but it also links to the entire movie with the extended cut.

417
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,365
Rym: Basically, they didn't know what they were doing with this movie.

418
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,970
Rym: Like, the hit, like, the production was just, like, this nightmare.

419
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:01,160
Rym: And, uh, they filmed a ton of stuff that ended up not getting included.

420
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:07,670
Rym: They filmed a ton of stuff kinda angling for this to be an R-rated, adult, serious, cyberpunk movie.

421
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:10,735
Rym: And, uh, most of that got cut out.

422
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:14,140
Rym: Like, a lot of really dire, weird stuff got cut out.

423
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,459
Scott: I mean, the aesthetic of the movie is weird.

424
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,125
Rym: The thing is, the aesthetic is actually something I love.

425
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:20,967
Rym: Like, the movie is bad.

426
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:29,960
Rym: Even though I like some aspects of what it could have been, and, like, the style of it, and the radical adaptation, you know, to follow a theme.

427
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,684
Rym: The reality is, the movie is also boring, bad, unwa- like, it's not worth watching.

428
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:55,440
Rym: But, uh, what we've got here is, for free, on archive.org, you can watch the entire two hour and five minute long, completely uncut, full filming, where they have spliced in everything that was edited out of the movie into the narrative of the movie.

429
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:02,679
Scott: The last thing you want to do to any movie, even a good one, is just, it's like, a director's cut is one thing, right?

430
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,380
Rym: This is the Morton Jankle cut.

431
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,948
Scott: Yeah, just undo all the edits.

432
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,796
Scott: It's like, put all the film back together.

433
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:10,640
Scott: It's like, no.

434
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,297
Rym: Ah, well, because this is not, this is not a, you want a seven hour Lord of the Rings movie, and there's a reason why they cut all that stuff out.

435
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:18,180
Rym: Like, this is not that.

436
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:21,508
Rym: Don't watch this to enjoy this as a movie.

437
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,333
Rym: It's not better than the original movie.

438
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:25,940
Rym: It's in fact worse, because it's longer, that movie's bad.

439
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:36,000
Rym: But, because it includes all that stuff that was cut, it's almost like a historical lens into the production hell.

440
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,874
Scott: Someone else can watch it.

441
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,863
Rym: There's a bunch of clips of it, and the stuff they cut out.

442
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:48,960
Rym: There's a lot of weirdly, like, violent, gross, and sexual stuff that they filmed, that they apparently wanted to have in this movie, and were told no.

443
00:30:50,660 --> 00:31:00,200
Scott: Anyway, so, uh, someone named Mel Olivera, right, MelkyCurdy on Twitter, I don't know if that's a famous person I should know or something.

444
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:12,940
Scott: But they tweeted two tweets, and these two tweets contain a subtitled video that's a few minutes long, showing, basically, it's like a mini-documentary behind the scenes.

445
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:26,300
Scott: They go to Tatsunoko Productions, where they are, you know, back in the 80s, where they are still, you know, drawing the movie, Matt Cross Do You Remember Love, and they're talking to the animators.

446
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,838
Scott: Like, the first thing they do is they go to Itano, and he's, like, drawing some robot, and they're like, "Hey, what's going on over here,

447
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:31,300
Scott: Itano?".

448
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,117
Scott: He's like, "Oh, you know, drawing robots,

449
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:33,460
Scott: right?".

450
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:39,340
Scott: They go show people painting cells, they show them photographing everything, right?

451
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,484
Scott: It's like, "Whoa, what's going

452
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:40,625
Scott: on?".

453
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,720
Scott: You know, it's like, this is some kind of thing to see here in color, right?

454
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,646
Scott: So, yeah, you don't see stuff like this too often.

455
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:54,394
Scott: I wonder how much more material like this is out there.

456
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:57,700
Scott: that has just been, you know, lost to time and space.

457
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:11,900
Scott: But this hasn't been, so while these two tweets are still available, I don't know if it's on YouTube or anything, or saved anywhere else, maybe you can, maybe you know how to save Twitter videos, you should get on that.

458
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:17,237
Rym: I mean, the janky way to save a Twitter video is just to watch it while recording in OBS.

459
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,280
Rym: Like, that totally works.

460
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:19,680
Scott: I thought about doing that, yeah.

461
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,650
Rym: I have done that two things before.

462
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,720
Rym: Mostly when I need clips from an anime.

463
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,940
Scott: But not to the Fauxhammer?

464
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,860
Rym: Not to, well, for the Fauxhammer, I just pirated The Hobbit movie, and then I pulled out the clips I needed.

465
00:32:31,924 --> 00:32:32,220
Scott: Anyway.

466
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:43,340
Rym: Anyway, in the meta moment, we will be live with a, well, it's an old topic we've done before, it is basically a brand new panel with totally different content.

467
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,711
Rym: We'll be live at PAX Online, PAX East Online, I should clarify, 2021, on Saturday, July 17th at 1.45pm on the PAX2 channel, not PAX3.

468
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:58,580
Scott: We already know the channel, how about that?

469
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,328
Rym: Yeah, we're upgraded to PAX2 with Atari Game Design.

470
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:07,860
Rym: We're gonna play a bunch of Atari games and talk like real talk game design about those games.

471
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,200
Rym: Some of them are good, some of them are bad, some of them are interesting.

472
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:17,960
Rym: And a big difference, if you've seen our old panel on this, is we're gonna talk about a lot more single player games.

473
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,280
Rym: In that original panel we did, we focused exclusively on multiplayer games for a reason.

474
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,956
Rym: So we're gonna talk about a lot of different kinds of Atari games in this one.

475
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:27,760
Rym: Should be fun.

476
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,018
Rym: Otherwise, mostly still stuck at home, but we're going outside a lot.

477
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,520
Scott: Book Club Book is still the first book ever, first novel ever.

478
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,819
Rym: Not the first book, but the first novel.

479
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:52,580
Scott: Yeah, Tale of Genji, so if you wanna read that, you can get yourself the fully unabridged, you know, properly translated penguin classic Ultimate Edition or whatever.

480
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,660
Scott: And, you know, get reading, 'cause it's long.

481
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,179
Rym: Yep, I feel like my real time to plow through this book is coming soon, because the beach we would go to...

482
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,759
Scott: You said the same thing for how many shows in a row now.

483
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,248
Rym: Yeah, but I've been moving slowly.

484
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,837
Rym: It hasn't accelerated, but it's going.

485
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:20,737
Rym: But the water temperature at the beach we might go to to just lay and read all day has reached the minimum threshold of "I can touch that water without

486
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:21,119
Rym: dying.".

487
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:25,620
Rym: It's 63.1 degrees Fahrenheit as of today.

488
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:27,719
Scott: How many degrees?

489
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,719
Scott: So are you saying if I get some 62 degree water and splash it on you, you will die?

490
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:35,657
Rym: If I jump into...

491
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,938
Scott: Like the Wicked Witch of the West.

492
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Rym: So, I think the way I would describe it, if you want me to actually be specific about it, is below that temperature, that is water that I will get up to my ankles in and no further.

493
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:55,380
Rym: But above that temperature, I will go into that water completely and stay in for at minimum five minutes.

494
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:05,559
Scott: Okay, so when you're asleep, or when you're not paying attention, I'll get a bucket of water that's more than ankle high, that's 61 degrees, and put both your feet in it.

495
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,514
Scott: Or tie you up and put both your feet in water.

496
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:10,540
Scott: Anyway.

497
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:15,188
Rym: So yeah, otherwise just keep an eye on us, our YouTube channels.

498
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,436
Rym: If you look at my YouTube channel, I just uploaded the Fauxhammer.

499
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:19,800
Rym: Sometimes we stream games.

500
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,020
Rym: If you hang out in the Discord, Scott does it more than me, and a lot of the listeners will do it sometimes.

501
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,637
Rym: People just hanging out, being chill, streaming a game, couple of people are watching, really just chill.

502
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:30,200
Rym: fun times.

503
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,920
Rym: Check out the forum, all our other stuff, and yeah, the next time...

504
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,780
Scott: Whichever way you like to internet, we internet that way with you.

505
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:48,020
Rym: You probably won't see us in person at a con, the earliest con where there is the highest chance that we might be at in person is going to be PAX Unplugged in November.

506
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,020
Rym: Don't expect us, I'm not saying we'll be there, or that it'll happen, but that's the first one that we're even considering right now.

507
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,607
Rym: The way things are.

508
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:01,839
Rym: But if it happens, and things are safer by then, I'm looking forward to it.

509
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,965
Rym: Otherwise, let's get right into it.

510
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:10,840
Rym: We're talking about merch today, mostly around cartoons and comics.

511
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:23,360
Scott: Well, there's obviously the often mentioned phenomenon of cartoons and comics that were created as a vehicle for merch, your Voltrons and whatever.

512
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:45,540
Scott: So there's just always been this sort of extreme synergy between buying stuff and comic and cartoon art as a tie-in, if not straight, reason for existence tied to those merchandise of various sorts.

513
00:36:45,620 --> 00:37:00,600
Scott: And even today, various anime and comics, even though they are not created the way, say, Transformers was created solely to sell things, but they make most of their money from selling merch.

514
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:07,314
Scott: They're not making their money from the actual comic or anime itself.

515
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:10,240
Scott: The money still comes from other things, endorsements.

516
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:29,060
Scott: And I think it just stems from the fact that if you're doing anything, it doesn't matter your genre or your medium even, but if you design a character that can be drawn as opposed to a real person, that character can now be placed on things.

517
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,646
Scott: They have a logo that can be placed on things.

518
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,611
Scott: They can suit any role for anything.

519
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:38,215
Scott: They're just always available for any job.

520
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,960
Scott: You don't need to hire them, you just need to license them.

521
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:50,673
Scott: There's various aesthetics and symbols and a visual language associated with any sort of character.

522
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,500
Scott: Even if you're not going for it, you get it for free.

523
00:37:55,021 --> 00:38:00,615
Scott: And it goes even back, probably even further, but the oldest one you think of is Mickey Mouse.

524
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,400
Scott: You just slap ears on fucking anything.

525
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,685
Rym: I mean, that was the hat, the Mickey Mouse hat.

526
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:09,172
Rym: It's just two black orbs and a half orb.

527
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:09,994
Rym: That's it.

528
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:12,960
Rym: It's the Yamago with two orbs on it that you wear forward.

529
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:26,420
Scott: And then, we could probably do a whole show, so we shouldn't talk much about it here, but then you have the fan merch thing, which is, I guess it does go way back, but it didn't explode until maybe a few decades ago.

530
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:40,093
Rym: It's interesting, you can track the kinds of merch that I cared about very clearly by what era of my life I was in, so specifically, and it's so radically different, culminating now in.

531
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:47,780
Rym: I don't want anything about anything, unless it's a very subtle, small, usually pin or article of clothing at most.

532
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:52,960
Scott: Yeah, so when I was a kid, I didn't have any fucking money.

533
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,387
Rym: But I wanted this stuff so bad.

534
00:38:55,527 --> 00:39:00,000
Rym: X-Men cards, like X-Men t-shirt, P-Man, everything.

535
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:09,340
Scott: Right, there were things that I liked, and the amount of merch available was not high, at least not as high as it is today.

536
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,723
Rym: Well, there's a 50/50.

537
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:17,980
Rym: Some things I liked, the amount of merch I had access to was a cornucopia that overfloweth, because it was a popular intellectual property.

538
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,280
Rym: The only reason I didn't have it all is because my parents, rightly, didn't buy it all for me, and I didn't have any money.

539
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,507
Rym: But then the other half of the things I liked, there was zero merchandise.

540
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:31,452
Rym: Like, when I was really young, I was really into H.P.

541
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:32,694
Rym: Lovecraft and Monty Python.

542
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:36,100
Rym: Wasn't a lot of merch for that stuff, not that that's animation.

543
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:42,500
Scott: Even if you were a kid who loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, right, it's like you can go to any store, the clothing store, you can get Ninja Turtles clothes.

544
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,311
Scott: You can go to the toy store, you can get everything Ninja Turtles, right?

545
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:47,480
Scott: Video games, Ninja Turtles, you can get anything, right?

546
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,660
Scott: But, you couldn't get everything because there wasn't an internet shopping, right?

547
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,449
Scott: So like, you could go on TV, and you could see, okay, they got the turtle van, and then you look at the, you would buy.

548
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:05,240
Scott: like, you know, Leonardo, and you look at the back of the Leonardo action figure, the back of the piece of cardboard, and you would see all the turtle action figures.

549
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,440
Rym: Yep, and you see one that you don't have that you want, but then you go to Toys R Us, it's not there.

550
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:18,638
Scott: Yeah, you go to Toys R Us, and you'd be like, okay, there's like a hundred, there's like two, you know, five rows of Baxter Stockman's that no one wants, right?

551
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,433
Scott: And you can always get the four turtles, and it's like, you know, there'd be like one shredder left, maybe.

552
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,360
Scott: It's like, you're looking at the back of this package, you're like, I want one of each of these.

553
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,540
Rym: The thing I always wanted was more foot soldiers, because I wanted a bunch of enemies.

554
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,388
Scott: You just wanted to have like 20, you're watching the show, and what are they doing?

555
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:38,252
Scott: They're fighting like an army of foot soldiers.

556
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:41,038
Scott: Like, well, listen, if I'm playing, I need like 20 foot soldiers.

557
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:41,960
Scott: We had one foot soldier.

558
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,721
Scott: Yep.

559
00:40:43,883 --> 00:40:54,080
Rym: Well, I was a big fan of the Robocop cartoon, and we had all the goddamn Robocop toys, like those cap shooter things, and there weren't generic bad guys in the Robocop cartoon.

560
00:40:54,501 --> 00:41:04,100
Rym: So we ended up finding, I think when Children's Palace went bankrupt and did a 90% off sale, which, by the way, was a terrifying mob.

561
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:08,928
Rym: That was, imagine a horde of children literally destroying a building.

562
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:15,860
Rym: But we found a pile of one random specific villain who had a name from that cartoon.

563
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:24,580
Rym: There were like 10 of that action figure, so we just bought them all for like 10 cents each, and I used those as my Robocop villains, and that was so exciting.

564
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:37,060
Scott: Okay, yeah, but, so yes, when we were kids, it's like, pretty much if you slapped, you know, the image of any intellectual property that I enjoyed on a thing, right?

565
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,809
Rym: Nintendo cereal.

566
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:38,680
Rym: I ate that shit.

567
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,519
Scott: Yeah, I didn't, but, you know.

568
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,206
Rym: The Mario cartoon, I watched it, and I wanted merch from it.

569
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:53,220
Rym: Irrespective of merch I wanted from Nintendo, I wanted merch from that cartoon because I was a kid, and I was stupid because I was a kid.

570
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,590
Scott: Exactly, I just wanted anything, you know, I went to the store and there were choices of things.

571
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:02,137
Scott: The thing that had the character on it that I liked was clearly superior.

572
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:03,340
Scott: I wanted that one, right?

573
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:06,200
Scott: It's like the thing, and I'm sure that works on kids today.

574
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,123
Rym: Didn't matter what it was.

575
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:10,936
Rym: I wanted, like, all the cartoons I watch, yeah, He-Man toothbrushes, give it to me.

576
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:12,160
Rym: Give me two of them.

577
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,194
Scott: Yep, I mean, I see kids today, it's like they're wearing like Minecraft, you know, sneakers.

578
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,860
Scott: It's like, it still works, right?

579
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,630
Rym: As a kid, the thing that bothered me, I wanted clothes, but like, those were the hardest things to find.

580
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,596
Rym: Like, usually Toys R Us and the toy stores wouldn't sell that stuff.

581
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:29,876
Rym: Like, it was hard to get, like, Kids R Us.

582
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:34,833
Rym: Yeah, but they didn't have a lot of branded stuff, and usually they'd have a tiny limited selection.

583
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,940
Rym: It was never the thing I was into at the time.

584
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:47,214
Scott: Anyway, you know, so after that, right, there came a period, you know, mostly towards college times, high school college times, where I had fucking money.

585
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:51,160
Scott: I was spending most of it on computers and stuff, right?

586
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:56,520
Scott: And a lot of the places, like the comic book store was out of business by the time I was in high school.

587
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,940
Rym: Yep, by then I knew, like, as much as I wanted X-Men cards, by then I did not want X-Men cards anymore, even though they were plentiful.

588
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,686
Scott: Yeah, I was spending my money on, like, you know, video games, right?

589
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:16,340
Scott: Things of that nature, computers, you know, and then even when I got to college, I go to comic book stores, I can go to that again, but I was getting comics I was going to read.

590
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,449
Scott: I wasn't, you know, there wasn't a lot of buying stuff that didn't do anything, right?

591
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:29,240
Scott: It's like, yeah, I would, you know, there were certain intellectual properties, you know, of comics and animation that I liked.

592
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,851
Scott: You know, I remember I bought, there was a Voltron comic that came out in the early 2000s, I have every issue of, right?

593
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:36,595
Scott: It was okay, but I bought it.

594
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:38,720
Scott: If it wasn't a Voltron comic, I wouldn't have bought it, right?

595
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,180
Rym: But yeah, I wasn't buying, like, tchotchkes or toys, I was buying, like...

596
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,947
Scott: There was a period, I was in the early anime cons, like, '02, '03, right?

597
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:58,500
Scott: It's like we had suddenly opened this world of, like, oh my god, this, the merch for these things is actually available here and nowhere else, in this country at least.

598
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,518
Scott: I finally have access to it and money, so I did go on, like, a mini spree of, like, buying just all kinds of, yeah.

599
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:18,620
Rym: That's actually where, you know, we didn't want to talk about the fan stuff, but that was where, the first time where I encountered a unique phenomenon that I never encountered in my life around my fan, the toys and merch I wanted for cartoons and comics.

600
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:28,260
Rym: I wanted whatever shows I was into, because I was watching anime a lot at that point in my life, and I wanted, like, high school onward.

601
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:41,900
Rym: I wanted merch from the anime I was watching specifically, but when I went to anime cons, they tended to only have merch from shows from three to four years prior that no one cared about anymore.

602
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,631
Scott: Or, and then it sort of switched up and it became shows that were the brand new hot shows, right?

603
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:53,440
Scott: And I didn't, I wasn't watching those, or I didn't like them as much, I didn't like them enough to buy merch from them.

604
00:44:54,662 --> 00:45:02,840
Rym: But I also had this changing relationship of what I wanted out of merch, because as a kid, merch was, like, kid brain, like, I just wanted it for no particular reason.

605
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:06,914
Scott: Even if something was free, I'd be like, "Okay, I'll take it.

606
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,139
Scott: I don't even care what the hell it

607
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,260
Scott: is.".

608
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,060
Rym: I had so many free posters that I threw away before I went to college.

609
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,750
Scott: Yeah, and it wasn't even just, you know, anime comics merch.

610
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,980
Scott: Like, I would go to, like, a kid's bar mitzvah or some shit, right?

611
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,440
Scott: And they would give away, like, inflatable saxophone and, like, you know, plastic top hat and all sorts of stuff.

612
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:26,210
Scott: And I was just like, "Yeah, give me all that

613
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:26,552
Scott: stuff.".

614
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:27,598
Scott: And I was like, "Woo, free

615
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:27,819
Scott: stuff!".

616
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Scott: And then when I got home, that stuff lasted, like, a couple days, and then it was in the garbage, right?

617
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:38,078
Rym: But then I hit this era where I didn't want toys, because I wasn't playing with toys anymore, and I didn't want crap.

618
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:48,820
Rym: But what I wanted was social currency and ways to display my fandom of these cartoons and comics to other people.

619
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,526
Rym: I wanted things like wall scrolls.

620
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:56,919
Rym: I kind of wanted some of those busts and things for a while, but thankfully I couldn't afford them.

621
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:00,871
Rym: Little plastic figures to line up above my computer.

622
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,014
Rym: Like, that kind of crap.

623
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:04,160
Rym: T-shirts, pins, buttons.

624
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:17,400
Rym: But that was the era where the thing, for whatever reason, all the cartoons and anime and comics I was reading were never the things where official merch that I wanted was available in the US.

625
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:33,260
Rym: And it was too expensive to import, so I tended to buy mostly bootleg illegal stuff made by nerd fans in the artist alleys because they tended to be making unlicensed merch for the things where there was no easily accessible official merch.

626
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,520
Rym: There was, like, a weird golden era of that specific phenomenon.

627
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:48,820
Scott: I think also what happened is, you know, a lot of the things I bought is I have, like, a good couple sacks full of various plastic figures of different kinds, right?

628
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:54,320
Scott: And some of them are pretty cool, but it's like, you know, I guess in the college days I was putting them all up on the shelf.

629
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,146
Scott: Like, "Oh yeah, that's so cool," right?

630
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:58,675
Scott: And in the Beacon days, I still had them on the shelf.

631
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:00,220
Scott: I was like, "Alright, they're cool," right?

632
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:08,760
Scott: And then it was sort of like, I didn't feel like, you know, that display was a cool display anymore, even though I still thought some of the figures were cool.

633
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:15,680
Rym: But it was always sort of cluttered, and more importantly, that shit would get dusty, and I was unwilling to dust it.

634
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,164
Scott: You gotta dust it.

635
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:19,759
Scott: You gotta put them in that glass case that everyone has.

636
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,226
Rym: I was about to bring up the glass case, because that was the moment.

637
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:27,600
Rym: My specific moment was, I have all these plastic figures, and they look awesome, but they get dusty.

638
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,884
Rym: "Oh, I should put them in a plastic case,".

639
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:36,440
Rym: but then I imagined having a plastic case full of that stuff in, like, my future fancy apartment.

640
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:43,119
Rym: And I realized that I don't want things, and I started trying to get rid of all my things, and all the only merch I want now.

641
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,787
Scott: I don't need any more of this shit, right?

642
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:50,060
Scott: And I already had learned my collecting lesson long ago with Imagine the Gathering, right?

643
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:57,518
Scott: So I was doing it for collecting, and the purpose of a lot of this stuff was displaying, and I'm like, "Well, not displaying

644
00:47:57,578 --> 00:47:57,979
Scott: anymore.".

645
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:07,320
Scott: And so now, it's at the point where even if there is some sort of character or something that I really like, even my fucking favorite, right?

646
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,980
Scott: It's like, if it's not on a quality thing that I'm going to use, then I'm not interested, right?

647
00:48:15,202 --> 00:48:24,320
Scott: I could see two t-shirts, and one of them has, I don't know, Spiderman 2099 on it, and another one is just an amazing plain t-shirt.

648
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,393
Scott: It's like, "Give me the amazing plain t-shirt, please.

649
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:28,216
Scott: It's a better

650
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:28,658
Scott: t-shirt.".

651
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:35,020
Scott: If you're gonna give me a t-shirt that says something on it, it's gotta be a good t-shirt first.

652
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,581
Rym: That was it.

653
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:43,342
Rym: for so long, I'd wear any goddamn t-shirt, like a lot of people who are in their early 20s do, in late teams, and then I learned better.

654
00:48:43,422 --> 00:49:00,360
Rym: The nicer t-shirts fit better and work better, but for the longest time, any t-shirt that had cartoon or comic, especially cartoon intellectual property on it, tended to be the big ugly square prints on the garbage tier, like Hanes cotton black shirt.

655
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,263
Scott: That's the thing.

656
00:49:03,946 --> 00:49:09,980
Scott: Uniqlo, for example, they make tons and tons of t-shirts and other clothing, especially t-shirts.

657
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,058
Scott: Lots of nerdy things printed on them, and when they make those, I go and I check them out on their website or even at the store before times.

658
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:24,999
Scott: They would make ones for properties that were like, "My favorite fucking property," and I'd look and all the designs would be meh.

659
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,168
Scott: They had a whole Mario series.

660
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,660
Scott: I didn't even buy one thing, I don't think.

661
00:49:29,941 --> 00:49:30,826
Rym: Every now and then I do.

662
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:32,133
Rym: I got that Bowser Jr.

663
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:32,374
Rym: shirt.

664
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:41,499
Scott: Yeah, every now and then they'll have one where the quality and the design is actually tasteful and good, and I'll be like, "I'll buy

665
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:41,699
Scott: that.".

666
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,066
Scott: But otherwise, it's like, no.

667
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:49,640
Scott: But if I was a kid, and Uniqlo existed when I was a kid and they had those Mario clothes, I would have won everything.

668
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,420
Rym: Yep, they would have had to drag me kicking and screaming out of that store, possibly.

669
00:49:55,223 --> 00:50:00,099
Scott: I would have been like, "Oh, I'll just replace an eye from my entire wardrobe with every single one of

670
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:00,380
Scott: these.".

671
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:09,320
Rym: And I guess the shift is it went from, and this is something that gets into nerds, because it's Wednesday, we'll focus on anime nerds, like the weebs and anime cons.

672
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:28,838
Rym: There is a big difference between wanting merch, especially clothing like that, as a shibboleth to tell other people, "I like this property," to find other people who also like that property, versus, "I like the specific aesthetic of that design and choose to wear it for that

673
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:29,399
Rym: aesthetic.".

674
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:34,213
Rym: And I'm not going to say that is a sign of maturation or anything, like.

675
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:36,140
Rym: that's not where I'm going with that.

676
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:48,740
Rym: I'm just saying that I personally radically and suddenly shifted from one mode to the other mode, to the point that I don't use fashion or merch or anything as a shibboleth ever.

677
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:58,680
Rym: The only shibboleth of the things I'm into I will ever use are talking, and that's it, just talking to people, conversations, human interaction, being in an event together.

678
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,846
Rym: It's not like, "Oh, you're in a Batman shirt.

679
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:02,472
Rym: I bet you're into Batman.

680
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,837
Rym: We're going to be best friends and talk about

681
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:04,258
Rym: Batman.".

682
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:10,216
Scott: You know how many people have Batman shirts and aren't huge Batman fans?

683
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:11,099
Scott: It doesn't tell you anything.

684
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:23,679
Rym: The listener's talking about their changeover from, "I would buy the lunchbox or the thing that just has the lazy Batman logo right in the center in a big square with no thought to the aesthetics

685
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:24,200
Rym: whatsoever.".

686
00:51:25,943 --> 00:51:27,599
Rym: Very much like the Red Dragon t-shirt.

687
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:32,585
Rym: I had a mask lunchbox that was just the mask logo.

688
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:41,240
Rym: It was basically just a shitty sticker stuck on the front of a completely generic, super cheap, Folly a Party red lunchbox.

689
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,260
Rym: I used that thing until it fell apart and loved it as a kid.

690
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:56,660
Scott: I think another thing that contributes to the problem is that the fan merch is usually good, but there's also the bootleg not fan, just bootleg bootleg merch out there.

691
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:06,980
Scott: Especially for anime stuff, but it just really clogs up the marketplace in general.

692
00:52:08,582 --> 00:52:14,129
Rym: Right now, I'll pick some cartoon on Amazon which has full of bootleg crap.

693
00:52:14,649 --> 00:52:16,932
Rym: My Little Pony t-shirt.

694
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:18,394
Rym: I'm confident.

695
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:20,457
Rym: most of what I find is unlicensed crap.

696
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:23,100
Rym: Oh wow, that's a lot of unlicensed crap.

697
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:28,366
Scott: The aesthetic of most of it is even the official stuff.

698
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:32,330
Scott: I remember what was the place, We Love Fine or whatever.

699
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:41,100
Scott: They had all these licenses to properties that I enjoyed and we were making stuff, even some useful stuff that I might have bought.

700
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,225
Scott: But their designs were just so tacky.

701
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,326
Scott: I was just like,

702
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:46,047
Scott: "No.".

703
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:49,372
Scott: Even though you're the only people making a Rainbow Dash, it's like, "No, that's ugly as hell.

704
00:52:49,392 --> 00:52:49,833
Scott: What's wrong with

705
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:49,953
Scott: you?".

706
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,560
Rym: Even worse, I feel like a lot of these are probably just stealing someone's fan art.

707
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:00,303
Scott: A lot of them, yeah.

708
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,830
Scott: And then, you do have the good ones out there.

709
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:06,100
Scott: Like Fangamer, which puts a lot of effort into making a good design.

710
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,604
Rym: Even these official ones are bad.

711
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:10,673
Rym: You put the zipper right through Twilight Sparkle's face.

712
00:53:10,693 --> 00:53:12,679
Rym: That's an aesthetic.

713
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,031
Scott: You look at something like Fangamer, and it's like, "Yo, I can see that they put a lot of stuff into the...".

714
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:21,735
Scott: The designs are less tacky.

715
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:23,278
Scott: They're actually pretty quality.

716
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:24,480
Scott: Some of them are subtle.

717
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:34,640
Scott: But even though they are good, a lot of them, when they stand alone, a lot of these properties are ones I don't care about.

718
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:42,640
Scott: Or even though it's good, it's still not something I'm going to buy or use from myself a lot of the time.

719
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:53,060
Scott: There's such a narrow window you have to hit to make something that I will actually buy that and use that, and now you'll get my money.

720
00:53:54,460 --> 00:54:03,319
Scott: Whereas if Fangamer existed even 15 years ago, it's like, "Oh no, I would have been in big

721
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:03,599
Scott: trouble.".

722
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,603
Rym: Here's an example.

723
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:07,128
Rym: The Great Pretender.

724
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:08,813
Rym: Pretty good anime we just watched.

725
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:10,819
Rym: Let's say we were younger and super into it.

726
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:19,320
Rym: One, I don't think anyone sells a t-shirt for The Great Pretender, but say I was desperate to get a t-shirt for that cartoon because I really liked it.

727
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:25,380
Rym: I imagine that t-shirt would just be like the character's face is lazily stuck in the center of the t-shirt and that's it.

728
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:33,420
Rym: There's no way the t-shirt would be an asymmetric background from the show without the logo and without the name of the thing.

729
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:49,200
Rym: I feel like most merch for cartoons, especially in America, focuses on making sure anyone who sees you wearing it clearly identifies which intellectual property it is to the expense of any aesthetics.

730
00:54:50,840 --> 00:55:08,599
Scott: Another problem I see that happens to me a lot is, "Okay, I like a thing, but my favorite thing, character usually, but not always character, but my favorite aspect of a particular property will not be the main character or the main villain or

731
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:09,040
Scott: something.".

732
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:15,231
Scott: And so even though that property as a whole might have a shit ton of merch, it's like your actual merch.

733
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:20,040
Scott: options for the thing you personally care about are very, very limited.

734
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:24,566
Rym: Oh my god, there are Great Pretender shirts.

735
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:31,558
Rym: One, there's a bunch that are just the Freddie Mercury album cover, but just a big square in the middle of a t-shirt.

736
00:55:31,698 --> 00:55:32,780
Rym: It's just terrible.

737
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:33,700
Scott: Okay, sure.

738
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:37,488
Rym: But there's a bunch that are literally just what I said.

739
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:42,419
Rym: It's just like, "There's Lawrence, front and center, with the words 'The Great Pretender' on

740
00:55:42,479 --> 00:55:42,760
Rym: top.".

741
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,592
Scott: Well, a lot of these things you're probably finding on the internet are probably just, you know, someone has a print-on-demand factory and they've got a database of JPEGs.

742
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:57,140
Scott: and when you search, you land on the JPEGs and then they slap the JPEGs onto various items.

743
00:55:57,401 --> 00:56:02,194
Rym: Yup, which people wouldn't be doing if there wasn't some money to be made there.

744
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:04,120
Rym: Someone's buying these enough.

745
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:06,965
Scott: But that didn't exist when we were younger.

746
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:08,849
Scott: That wasn't a possibility, right?

747
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:14,060
Scott: Print-on-demand was not something a normal person could access even if they did mail order.

748
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:19,968
Scott: And you definitely didn't have JPEGs, right?

749
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:23,720
Scott: It's like even if you tried to do it, where would you get the artwork to do the printing?

750
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:33,718
Rym: When I was in high school, a big thing I did on the internet was look for JPEGs or just images like GIFs or bitmaps from anime I liked.

751
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:34,900
Rym: That was not easy to come by.

752
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,092
Scott: How could you get it?

753
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:38,079
Scott: What was someone going to do?

754
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:43,180
Rym: Take a photograph of their TV from the VCR.

755
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,982
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

756
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:54,132
Scott: So we're sort of in a wondrous time in that you can get merch of anything of any form, right?

757
00:56:54,212 --> 00:57:00,960
Scott: A mug, any sort of apparel, keychains, like literally any item of any property.

758
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:12,419
Scott: It's like you can probably find a merch of it somewhere, but it's sort of a dark time and that so little of the merch is well designed, high quality, good, useful, right?

759
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:21,320
Scott: The thing that you're specifically interested in, like finding that perfect storm where you're actually going to spend money on a thing is like even rarer, right?

760
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:33,380
Scott: It's like, yeah, there wasn't much merch for a thing in the 90s, but if I was a kid and I went to the store, it's like there would still be a section of the store that had something and I could buy all those.

761
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:48,860
Rym: But I guess I do feel like a lot of people who buy branded merch for cartoons are specifically doing that whole shibboleth, like show off the thing I'm into, make sure that people know I'm a fan of this intellectual property thing.

762
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:59,480
Scott: I think there's also, you know, the extreme nerds, right, is like they really identify strongly, like personally with maybe a particular thing, right?

763
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,375
Scott: Like, you know, you meet some nerd and that nerd is like, they're all about the Flash.

764
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:06,060
Scott: The Flash is their thing, right?

765
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,955
Rym: I remember that guy from that con who was into Silver Age Spider-Man.

766
00:58:10,015 --> 00:58:11,160
Rym: I think that was his entire life.

767
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,919
Rym: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

768
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,793
Scott: Yeah, the Flash isn't unpopular, but he's not, you know, Superman level or he's not Spider-Man level.

769
00:58:18,813 --> 00:58:21,820
Scott: He's like on the next tier of famous superhero, right?

770
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:27,120
Scott: He probably even got pushed down by the fact that other heroes are rising in popularity.

771
00:58:27,621 --> 00:58:30,153
Rym: DC Comics sells a pretty good The Flash shirt.

772
00:58:30,656 --> 00:58:31,400
Rym: Looks like it's official.

773
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:42,440
Scott: If you buy, you can probably like literally have a Flash, you know, it's not as probably as not to the Hello Kitty extent, but you could probably have a Flash everything in your house, right?

774
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,880
Scott: Flash cups, Flash silverware, Flash clothing.

775
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,138
Rym: Some of these t-shirts are moderately classy too.

776
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,580
Scott: Flash bed sheets.

777
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:55,139
Rym: Like just a red t-shirt with the Flash logo in the middle, like that's actually a good aesthetic for what The Flash is.

778
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,437
Scott: They've been printing that t-shirt probably for 30 years.

779
00:58:58,181 --> 00:58:59,575
Rym: Yeah, it's the same t-shirt someone had in the 70s.

780
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,652
Scott: It's the same, yeah, it's the same t-shirt.

781
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:02,640
Scott: They've been printing that forever.

782
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:10,620
Scott: But you know, that's where we're at now, so I don't know, you gotta decide how you're gonna be, right?

783
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,354
Scott: Are you gonna, like maybe you're a person who doesn't find that aesthetic tacky.

784
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:17,039
Scott: Maybe you're still young, right?

785
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:19,389
Rym: Ah, you're making a value judgment there.

786
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,280
Rym: I heard that still you slipped in there.

787
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,340
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I am making a judgment.

788
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:30,140
Rym: For all that Scott complains about people talking about fashion stuff, Scott is very particular about fashion.

789
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,717
Scott: You know what, I look like some...

790
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,582
Rym: Like some what?

791
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:37,053
Rym: Why is it wrong to wear sandals with socks?

792
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:39,200
Scott: What's wrong with that?

793
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,220
Rym: What's wrong with wearing Crocs?

794
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,959
Scott: Because what's wrong with it is that people like me will look down on you.

795
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:45,514
Rym: But why?

796
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:47,579
Scott: Because I will.

797
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:48,462
Rym: But why?

798
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:57,440
Rym: Why do you look down on someone wearing the t-shirt that is just like Wolverine in a big square taking up the entire center of their chest with the word Wolverine on the bottom?

799
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:09,320
Scott: Well, because you're telling me that you're signaling, right, that your aesthetics, or you don't care about the aesthetics, or your aesthetic taste is so far out of line with mine.

800
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,639
Scott: I do not have much in common with you, so I don't want to associate with you.

801
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:23,640
Rym: But I'm trying to think, other than a few Nintendo shirts that I got from Uniqlo recently, actually I bought them right before quarantine so I haven't worn them in public much.

802
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,259
Rym: I'm trying to think of the last piece of merch I bought from any cartoon of any kind.

803
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:34,090
Scott: I mean, does a gun block count?

804
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,680
Scott: I bought some buildable Evangelion models.

805
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:37,906
Rym: I guess that counts.

806
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,095
Rym: You're doing that.

807
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:39,740
Rym: I don't do that.

808
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:41,680
Scott: I'm just thinking back.

809
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:44,412
Scott: It's like, I'll buy those, I won't buy an action figure.

810
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,620
Scott: An action figure doesn't do anything.

811
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:50,079
Scott: I don't really actually like displaying them or looking at them that much.

812
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,426
Scott: But building them is fun, right?

813
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:56,300
Scott: I wish I could build them and then someone who would want them would take them.

814
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,571
Scott: But usually people want to build them.

815
01:00:58,793 --> 01:00:59,719
Scott: After I built them, I'm like,

816
01:00:59,799 --> 01:00:59,880
Scott: "Fuck.".

817
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:03,316
Scott: When I was a kid, I had like- I'm like, "That was fun building this, but now what do I

818
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:03,437
Scott: do?".

819
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:08,218
Rym: I was reminded, one of the listeners was talking about the old iron-on bootlegs.

820
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:11,473
Rym: I had a lot of Bart Simpson shirts when I was a kid.

821
01:01:11,694 --> 01:01:13,040
Rym: Like, a lot.

822
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:20,320
Rym: And one time, Cedar Point made me turn it one inside out because Bart said the word "hell," I think, on it.

823
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,288
Rym: Or "damn" or something.

824
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:22,600
Rym: I forget exactly what was on the shirt.

825
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,880
Scott: The only thing I had- I think I had a South Park shirt that was like a Kenny Dyeing shirt of some kind.

826
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,380
Rym: I had a lot of bootleg Simpson shirts, too, that were just iron-ons.

827
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:47,900
Rym: Yeah, I cannot- the last intellectual property from a show that I got was probably like a pin from an anime con at least like four-plus years ago, maybe?

828
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:49,558
Scott: Yeah, who knows?

829
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:50,699
Rym: Who even knows?

830
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:57,800
Scott: But yeah, it's, you know, for all we've said about it, right, that merch industry sustai- that's what's sustaining everything, right?

831
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,853
Scott: That is the thing that's holding everything up, right?

832
01:02:00,893 --> 01:02:06,473
Scott: It's not your, you know- Well, it's that and advertising cross-promotion type stuff.

833
01:02:06,553 --> 01:02:08,700
Rym: Like, there's the whole ecosystem there as well.

834
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:16,100
Scott: But it's like, yeah, it's like, you know, people buying comic books aren't holding up comic books, right, you know, directly.

835
01:02:16,921 --> 01:02:19,485
Scott: People watching anime isn't holding up anime.

836
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:29,696
Rym: People watching cartoon- you know, you're watching Adventure Time on Cartoon Network- Openly, nakedly, that's what they were.

837
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,342
Scott: You know what I'm saying?

838
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:35,780
Scott: Like, kids watching, you know, I guess it's over, but if you're watching Adventure Time, right, there were ads during it.

839
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,720
Scott: That helped a lot, but, you know, it was people buying all that Adventure Time stuff at the store that was holding the show up for how many years.

840
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:45,799
Scott: Not the- not anything else, so.

841
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,253
Rym: I do like some of the- a lot of backpacks came around for a while.

842
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:54,240
Rym: Like, the branded backpack from a show.

843
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,660
Rym: Like, a lot of people had Finn's backpack.

844
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,607
Scott: It's been around forever.

845
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:58,240
Scott: We had Ninja Turtle backpack and stuff.

846
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:04,960
Rym: But the ones more recently, like in the last couple decades, were a lot higher quality than what we had as kids, but I guess that's just not the way it goes with everything.

847
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,102
Scott: Qualities.

848
01:03:06,222 --> 01:03:11,020
Scott: In some ways, that's actually weird, the way quality has changed over time, right?

849
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,660
Scott: Is that, you know, obviously we already discussed how there's all the bootleg, print-on-demand, low-quality stuff, right?

850
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:22,500
Scott: But if you only count the officially licensed stuff, in some ways, quality has skyrocketed.

851
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,249
Scott: There are, you know, today, the highest, like, the cap on quality.

852
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:33,360
Scott: Like, if you buy official merch for, like, Ghibli stuff, like, that stuff is, like, so well made.

853
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:37,254
Scott: It's, like, unbelievable that, you know, some- and it costs a lot, too.

854
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:38,740
Scott: It's not cheap, right?

855
01:03:39,363 --> 01:03:40,999
Scott: And that was just- didn't exist.

856
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:49,220
Scott: But on the other hand, people are putting out some low-quality biz, and the quality of certain things has decreased over time.

857
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,240
Scott: When I was a kid, if you wanted to buy, like, a lunchbox with a thermos, you got, like, a fucking metal lunchbox.

858
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,942
Rym: Eh, not always.

859
01:03:55,962 --> 01:04:05,340
Rym: I had the plastic one where, literally, every- there's this one specific type of plastic lunchbox that came with a shitty plastic thermos and a couple other things.

860
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:09,780
Rym: They were all identical, but they all had a different sticker of an intellectual property on the front.

861
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,348
Scott: I know the one you're talking about, yeah.

862
01:04:11,509 --> 01:04:13,720
Scott: I'm saying before- that was, like, the turnaround, right?

863
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,746
Scott: Is, like, before that, I had a metal one, right?

864
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:18,093
Scott: And then those came out afterwards.

865
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:20,460
Scott: The quality of the official stuff went down.

866
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,241
Scott: Well, look at backpacks.

867
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:23,707
Rym: I remember I had a branded, like, mask backpack.

868
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:29,900
Rym: Every backpack was the exact same backpack where the shoulder straps came in toward the middle and were always too tight on your neck.

869
01:04:30,281 --> 01:04:34,900
Rym: Every kid had identical backpacks, but they all had different cartoon intellectual property on them.

870
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:40,300
Rym: Now, like, you get a BMO backpack, it's just physically shaped like BMO, and it's really high quality.

871
01:04:41,061 --> 01:04:51,959
Scott: Yeah, but it's, like, you know, it has to do with, you know, what was cheap to produce, what would sell, and who are the companies who own the intellectual property choosing to license to in various territories.

872
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:52,720
Scott: It's always different.

873
01:04:54,141 --> 01:05:02,580
Scott: And that's gonna affect, you know, if you license- if you give a license out to, like, you know, awesome statue maker, they're gonna make, like, these unbelievable expensive statues.

874
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:07,440
Scott: If you give a license out to just anybody, who knows what the hell they're gonna make, right?

875
01:05:07,963 --> 01:05:09,940
Rym: You get the Subway franchise of merch.

876
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:11,440
Scott: Exactly.

877
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,066
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

878
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:21,120

Rym: You sold a key- hold the key to my heart and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their name.

888
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:15,300
Rym: I'm trying something just to make it clear that all the money we spend on equipment probably matters.

889
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:24,578
Rym: I recorded this with my like fancy gaming headset that I use when I'm playing like Overwatch instead of the nice audio interface and the fancy Beta 87A.

890
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,210
Rym: Yeah, the nicer microphones are just superior in every way.

891
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:33,920
Rym: But anyway, for now I leave you with something that you really should have seen coming.

892
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:34,999
Scott: Fauxhammer.
