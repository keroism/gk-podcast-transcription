1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,758
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 7th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:10,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,216
Scott: -I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,390
Rym: -And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,950
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing Metroid Dread on the Nintendo Switch.

6
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:21,647
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,498
Scott: Uh, not working.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,370
Scott: Just every day, waking up, do whatever I want.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,276
Rym: -Uh, working.

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,036
Rym: -If only... -Uh, working.

11
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:31,882
Scott: I was at work today.

12
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:37,190
Scott: -If only there was some way that I could do this and live this life of wake up and do whatever I want.

13
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:51,910
Scott: But, also, A, not have it be cold, B, not have a pandemic outside so I can do things, uh, and C, have enough money so that someone else could do all these chores for me.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,930
Rym: -'Cause that's... -Oh, so you want to be landed gentry with, like, butlers.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,389
Scott: Yeah, well, it doesn't... I think everyone deserves that, you know.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:07,630
Scott: And even the people who end up doing the chores, it's like, okay, you know, they shouldn't have to do that more than, like, you know, once a week or something.

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,710
Rym: Well, the way I've always thought about it, like, the ideal democratic communism I want, the idea is that you give everyone bare minimum, like, they'd live, everyone's got everything they need to live, be relatively happy.

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:29,559
Scott: And also, if we had, say, for example, like, you know, even more socialisms, right, like, we had a shared kitchen, you know, it's like, oh, well, then I could just clean that kitchen once a week and then I got six other days to do...

19
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,399
Rym: -To do things...

20
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:44,549
Scott: -Instead of having seven kitchens for seven people who have to clean the seven kitchens once a day, every day, you could have one kitchen, everyone cleans it once a week.

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:53,570
Rym: Ah, but what if some of the people in your building with that shared kitchen are just, to use a word, a phrase that I've liked lately to describe certain kinds of people, shit-asses.

22
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,807
Scott: Then you don't... You get kicked out.

23
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:58,134
Rym: By who?

24
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,389
Rym: What if the majority of the people are using that kitchen?

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,350
Scott: That's part... That's... Doing the work of living there is part of the rent, effectively.

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,698
Scott: -So you would get, you know...

27
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,809
Rym: -You've reinvented the co-op.

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,699
Scott: -Yes, exactly.

29
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,848
Rym: -Like the Soviet-style co-op.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,807
Scott: -Yeah, not the co-op city co-op.

31
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:12,929
Scott: -No.

32
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,189
Scott: -The way I look at it... -Yeah, I'm doing all... I'm getting all kinds of stuff done over here.

33
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,121
Scott: You know, having all sorts of good times.

34
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,029
Scott: Some of it's metamoment material, what's not metamoment material.

35
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:27,909
Rym: Sitting around, looking around?

36
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:30,268
Scott: Yeah, you know, stuff.

37
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:39,770
Rym: Yeah, I got my booster, and the reason we missed Wednesday GeekNights last week is that the booster... I was basically out of commission for 48 hours after that thing.

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,670
Scott: Well, I didn't have any really problems with the first two, you know, six to eight months ago, other than pain in the arm, so we'll see what happens.

39
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,415
Rym: -That was my first shot.

40
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:55,030
Scott: -I thought I was getting my booster the day after Thanksgiving, but I was just an idiot, and I didn't read the calendar correctly.

41
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:57,276
Rym: You were the only one.

42
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,170
Rym: Emily was trying to get an appointment quickly and got one at CVS.

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,040
Rym: Their website is so shitty, 3

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,382
Rym: a.m.,

45
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:03,610
Rym: 'cause I guess that was an option.

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,132
Scott: Oh, no.

47
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:06,370
Scott: What happened was I opened my doctor app.

48
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:15,369
Scott: I opened my doctor app, and it said "Friday," and it was a few days before Thanksgiving, so I just said, "It said 'Friday,'" and I didn't look beyond the word "Friday,".

49
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:19,464
Scott: so I just said, "Yes, appointment for Friday at 1230,".

50
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:24,646
Scott: and I went in Friday at 1230, and they were like, "No, you made your appointment for Friday, December 19th,".

51
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,790
Scott: so I guess I'm going there 12 days from now, 'cause, eh, you know, I'm staying inside for all these days.

52
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,695
Scott: -It doesn't really matter.

53
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:31,976
Scott: -I'm telling

54
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:46,181
Rym: you, the most anxiety-inducing thing that ever happens in my life, I mean, I have a pretty good life, is I'm always vaguely afraid that I'm gonna have an appointment to do a thing, like meet someone, get on a plane in particular, and I'll just show up on the wrong day.

55
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:53,677
Rym: Like, I'll just have fucked up my calendar, show up on the wrong day, like, "Your flight was yesterday, you're not going to PAX," or, "Flight to PAX?

56
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,708
Rym: That flight is next week, what's wrong with

57
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:55,828
Rym: you?".

58
00:03:56,793 --> 00:04:00,149
Scott: I may have discussed this when it happened many, many years ago.

59
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,625
Scott: Not that many years ago, but, you know, I was living in New York City at least, maybe early 2010s.

60
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:20,164
Scott: There was some College Humor thing in the city when College Humor was still a thing, and I had bought tickets to it, and then I was in the shower one day, and I thought about it, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, that thing.

61
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,269
Scott: When was that

62
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:21,490
Scott: thing?".

63
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:29,275
Scott: And I get out of the shower, and I go and I search in my email for the tickets to it, and I'm like, "Yeah, what day was that

64
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:29,536
Scott: thing?".

65
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:35,036
Scott: It turned out it was that day, and it was too late to go.

66
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:40,234
Scott: It had already begun, and I was like, I bought tickets to a thing and just didn't go.

67
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:46,690
Scott: I wasn't doing anything that day, I just didn't go because I forgot about it, and then I started using Google Calendar, and it never happened again.

68
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,281
Scott: All right, so that actually happened.

69
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,617
Scott: It wasn't like some dream of like, got tickets, didn't use them.

70
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:56,790
Scott: I actually had tickets and didn't use them.

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:19,882
Rym: I finally, after like two years of this pandemic, stopped having the recurring dream of, my brain just knows that there's paxes on the certain cadence, plus magfest, that we go to and perform at, so I have like a whole, like my brain is just like, you know that feeling when you're laying in bed, and you feel comfortable, and your alarm hasn't gone off yet, but you almost feel like you've been laying in bed too long, and you have the fear of,

72
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:20,485
Scott: "Did my

73
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,390
Rym: alarm not go off?

74
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,855
Rym: Did I not set it?

75
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,483
Rym: Did I just sleep through it?

76
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:25,689
Rym: It feels too

77
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,830
Rym: late.".

78
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,009
Scott: Why would I set my alarm?

79
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,142
Rym: Because you're an old man, I don't know what's up with you.

80
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,890
Rym: If I don't set an alarm, I'll just sleep forever.

81
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,426
Scott: I mean, I basically am just sleeping until my body decides to get up.

82
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:37,909
Scott: That seems good.

83
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,830
Rym: I mean, my body would like to get up around 10, which is not really an option.

84
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:42,926
Scott: I don't have anywhere to go.

85
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:43,827
Rym: True.

86
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,410
Scott: I don't have any appointment.

87
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:56,397
Rym: But my brain just has this cadence of, "Paxes happen on this like fairly reliable schedule," and then suddenly I'm just not going to them, and my brain's like, "Yo dog, didn't you write the panels?

88
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,184
Rym: When are your panels?

89
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,610
Rym: What panels are you doing?

90
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,879
Rym: When's the next pax?

91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,787
Rym: Shouldn't you be there

92
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:02,150
Rym: already?".

93
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:04,190
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

94
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,280
Rym: Anyway, there's a bunch of gaming news.

95
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,970
Rym: I guess we can start with a little thing.

96
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:18,250
Rym: A bunch of games are having problems right now, because a bunch of things are having problems right now, because Amazon is like super fucking down.

97
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,580
Scott: Yeah, we've talked about this before.

98
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:48,536
Scott: We'll talk about it again, I'm sure, is that too many internet services are hosted on Amazon Web Services cloud platform and the services that they provide, and most people who set up things on Amazon Web Services, they do offer ways to, for example, create a database that's like multi-region, so that if one region explodes or gets cut off, your database is still up in other regions, and you're very resilient if you do that sort of setup.

99
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:52,010
Scott: But that kind of setup isn't just like a push button thing.

100
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:59,282
Scott: It requires, even though they do a lot of the hard work for you, it still requires engineering effort and money.

101
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,970
Scott: They charge more money for that, right?

102
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:12,497
Scott: So the vast majority of people who set up things on Oz set things up just very simply, the way you would with any other hosting, the way that like the GeekNights website is set up, even though that's not on Oz.

103
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,270
Scott: It's partially, I guess, but mostly not.

104
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,097
Scott: You know, just an easy-to-instance, whatever.

105
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:27,823
Scott: And most people, because the way the world works, have things set up in the US East 1 region zone, right?

106
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Scott: Because US East is where people are, where we live also, where people, it's where the most people are.

107
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,074
Scott: And it's closer to Europe than US West.

108
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:43,658
Scott: So even though even California companies, all the Silicon Valley people will still- I've never set something up in US West, ever.

109
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:49,917
Scott: I have multi-region stuff in US West, just for, that's what I use.

110
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:54,817
Scott: Any region that's not US East, it's like US East is always the primary region where you do everything.

111
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,093
Scott: And then the other regions are just like the backup fail over us.

112
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:04,724
Scott: So yeah, US East is having problems today, big problems.

113
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:18,098
Scott: And that means that, you know, a lot of things, a lot of internet services of all kinds are down or broken because we've built all on this one thing.

114
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:21,610
Scott: And if that one thing breaks, a lot of other things break.

115
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:38,621
Rym: Now it's interesting, because on one hand, from an individual perspective, especially because it's Tuesday, like a small gaming company, it's way cheaper and cost effective to just spin up cloud services, to do stuff like having physical data centers is very much a huge expense and a huge pain in the ass.

116
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:39,482
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:44,240
Scott: I mean, it pays off for you in terms of some things like your hardware costs, right?

118
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,904
Scott: So it's like you buy computers and then you don't have to buy computers again, whereas you have to pay OZ monthly.

119
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:55,709
Scott: So eventually those computers pay for themselves and you don't need new ones, you know, and hard drives won't break that much.

120
00:08:57,072 --> 00:09:00,485
Scott: And then you say you end up saving money over this like long term.

121
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:01,690
Rym: You can even go further.

122
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,416
Rym: A lot of people to manage them.

123
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:06,687
Rym: A lot of people don't even make servers.

124
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:09,839
Rym: They're not putting like a virtual server on EC2 and Amazon.

125
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:23,090
Rym: A lot of people, newer things especially, are just leveraging cloud services to directly provide services via those capabilities of the cloud without actually having like a so-called server running an operating system up there.

126
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:35,393
Scott: Well, it is still a server running an operating system, but they call it serverless because the cloud provider gives you an abstract interface via which to launch your application, usually some kind of container.

127
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:37,522
Scott: You'll make a Docker container.

128
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:43,627
Scott: And normally if you wanted to host that yourself, you would have to make a Kubernetes cluster and all this stuff right on servers.

129
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:51,414
Scott: Instead, Amazon made a cluster and they have this Fargate thing and they have this, you know, ECS thing.

130
00:09:51,755 --> 00:10:00,929
Scott: And it's like you just give your container to that and they built up all this software that hides the servers from you, even though they are very much there.

131
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,861
Rym: Now what's interesting is this affects a lot of things like.

132
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,878
Rym: VRChat has a bunch of random parts of VRChat that are down right now because of this.

133
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:24,696
Rym: But one thing, something I've always internalized in the kinds of jobs I've had when we're doing a risk assessment is that for many companies that are not mission critical, where lives depend on them, Amazon and things like it don't go down that often, but also

134
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:25,879
Scott: it's pretty rare

135
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,303
Rym: if they do go down.

136
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:33,804
Rym: The answer you can give is basically, well, yes, we're down and so is everybody else.

137
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,191
Rym: Nobody has an advantage over us right now.

138
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,296
Rym: So who gives a shit?

139
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,461
Scott: That's one thing.

140
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:51,210
Scott: It's a situation in which from an individual perspective, right, using this platform is the most cost effective, best way of doing things.

141
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:59,717
Scott: But from a societal perspective, everyone putting all their services, all their eggs into one basket is like, it's like, I got one egg.

142
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,062
Scott: What basket do I put it in?

143
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,148
Scott: The biggest, strongest basket.

144
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:10,800
Scott: So now you have everyone puts their one egg into this basket and now, yeah, it's a big, strong basket, but all the eggs are in that one basket.

145
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,716
Rym: Well, like with Google, you and I both, you have a lot of our data in Google services.

146
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:25,252
Rym: If Google got hacked, like for real, like somehow compromised fully, worst case scenario, on one hand, yes, all a lot of very personal information is now compromised for me.

147
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:35,275
Rym: On the other hand, society has deep problems because of that hack, like so big that my problems are almost lost in the shuffle.

148
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:45,181
Rym: So yeah, the ramifications of this on an infrastructure level are more of a Monday episode.

149
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:50,722
Rym: But yeah, if you're trying to play some game and something's not working today, good chances due to this Amazon outage.

150
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:51,765
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:11:51,986 --> 00:12:04,766
Scott: I wonder if we'll see, you know, the companies that do really care about never being down, perhaps not just go multi-region but also maybe like have a failover to Azure failover.

152
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:05,549
Rym: Oh, that already exists.

153
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,632
Rym: All big companies do that.

154
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:07,656
Rym: I know, I know.

155
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:15,946
Rym: Of course, you know, but there's services that will auto deploy your shit to all the different cloud services and like work between them.

156
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:20,543
Rym: Like there are people who say, will those, will those get some more customers?

157
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:33,552
Rym: The problem is I feel like a lot of those things have their own single points of failure such that it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of everyone's moving to these services run by giant mega-corps that don't have our best interests at heart.

158
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,076
Scott: Yep.

159
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:49,946
Scott: I just still, I would like to see a return or, you know, a resurgence in not the bullshit crypto distribution model, but the real distribution distributed model of the internet, which is just that everyone runs servers all over the place.

160
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,675
Scott: We've got a web, you know, the way email works, the way the web works.

161
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:53,959
Rym: Well, the way email worked.

162
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:55,463
Scott: Right.

163
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:56,065
Scott: Exactly.

164
00:12:56,145 --> 00:13:05,335
Rym: But, you nerds who don't listen to Monday GeekNights, web browsers and the worldwide web was just one of many things we could use the internet for.

165
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:12,460
Rym: And the big idea of a web site or web stuff was that every web browser is also a web server.

166
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:16,053
Rym: Everyone makes content and everyone interlinks with everyone else's content.

167
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,820
Rym: And there is no central server for really anything.

168
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:20,103
Scott: Yep.

169
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:33,588
Scott: Anyway, so other news going down, a really common thing these days is you find someone that you're a fan of and you join their Patreon and Patreon has a Discord integration.

170
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,336
Scott: That's pretty, very well polished.

171
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:36,200
Rym: Oh, right.

172
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,270
Rym: I keep forgetting I should enable that for our Patreon.

173
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,371
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:56,826
Scott: So you join a Patreon and then if the person who runs the Patreon associates that Patreon with a Discord server, then, and you have Discord, your Discord account linked to your Patreon account, then when you Patreon someone, you automatically get joined to their Discord server.

175
00:13:57,508 --> 00:14:07,583
Scott: And on top of that, the person who runs that Patreon can now give you access to like special Patreon only channels or features or roles or benefits and whatnot.

176
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,350
Scott: And it's just a really common model.

177
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:10,696
Scott: And it makes sense, right?

178
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:26,962
Scott: It's like you're producing some sort of entertainment, you know, maybe you're a Twitch streamer, probably, you know, you get money from subs, you get money from, you know, whatnot, you know, donations, advertisements, if you run those, and then, you know, people want to join your community.

179
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:36,299
Scott: So, you know, they want to join your Discord, not just your Twitch channel and make friends with the other people who are fans of you and you can charge them money to do that.

180
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,282
Scott: Well, Discord is now realizing like, hey, why are we letting Patreon take all the money on this model?

181
00:14:43,784 --> 00:15:03,063
Scott: And they are now testing something that I imagine will eventually become a widespread feature, which is, yeah, you could just make a Discord server and directly, without integrating any other services, gate all or some of the features and channels in the Discord server behind money.

182
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:15,952
Scott: So somebody using only Discord and nothing else, no Twitch, no Patreon, no nothing, could set up a server and say, "Hey, you want to pay $5 a

183
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:16,233
Scott: month?".

184
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:28,041
Rym: It's a great way to even do things like people who make a clan or a rating group, like small time things for like playing games online, having their little membership dues to pay for like whatever stuff they do as a group.

185
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:30,010
Rym: There's a lot of ways to use this kind of thing.

186
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,513
Scott: Yeah.

187
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:37,437
Scott: So it has a lot of things going on, but the fact is, you know, Discord, you know, sort of bumping out Patreon, right?

188
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:42,895
Scott: But also I could see it as even bumping out, you know, how could they bump out Twitch?

189
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,787
Scott: Well, it's like you can just stream on Discord.

190
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:56,624
Scott: If you get enough people into your Discord server and people can find your Discord server somehow, either via maybe a Twitter or something, you might not even need the Twitch.

191
00:15:56,684 --> 00:16:00,138
Scott: You can just completely stream only on Discord to your own people.

192
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,387
Rym: You can avoid copyright stuff to a big degree.

193
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:10,096
Rym: And you can also have a more intimate, closed experience with, you know, we always talk about that very few people can be a megastar in any domain.

194
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,002
Rym: That's just rare, often toxic.

195
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:18,886
Rym: But a lot of small content creators have a small but dedicated group of fans who like exactly what they're doing.

196
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:25,934
Rym: And this is a great way to concentrate them together and they will pay that person to keep making the thing that they specifically care about.

197
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,625
Scott: Yeah, I think a lot of people do this already.

198
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:32,523
Scott: But the problem is the money that they're getting doesn't come in through Discord.

199
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:34,292
Scott: It has to come in through some other channel.

200
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:34,593
Scott: Right.

201
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:37,765
Scott: But yeah, I think this is pretty much you can see.

202
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:45,975
Scott: this is clearly now the established model is create some content, not for people like us who aren't trying to make money, but the people who are trying to make money.

203
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:55,187
Scott: This the model is create art, put the art out there on some channel for free of some kinds that people can find you and become a fan of you.

204
00:16:55,728 --> 00:17:04,374
Scott: And then charge money for either, you know, some exclusive arts, even though that's not perfect, because those can leak very easily.

205
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:11,895
Scott: And then charge money to either join the community or join the VIP part of the community or both.

206
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,785
Scott: You know, because you can absolutely.

207
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:16,953
Scott: there's no way somebody can like steal that.

208
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:17,494
Scott: Yeah.

209
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:17,857
Scott: Right.

210
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,885
Rym: It's also interesting because this get.

211
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,752
Rym: I think there's a few things going on here.

212
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,482
Rym: One is the economy is kind of messed up.

213
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:31,653
Rym: And this is a way for small creators to make a revenue stream and avoid a lot of the middlemen that provide nothing and just collect rent along the way.

214
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:35,930
Rym: It's also a way to sustain the people who have the one thousand true followers.

215
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:44,763
Rym: But the cynical side of me says that what we're going to see is every goddamn service on earth is going to try to come up with some half-assed way.

216
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:57,792
Rym: Discord, I think, is doing a good job with this, but I can imagine a lot of other online services trying to come up with an equivalent thing and try to get people to self monetize via their platforms with whatever it is their platform provides.

217
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:02,431
Rym: I think we're gonna see a lot of these spin up and a lot of them go away over the next few years.

218
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,619
Rym: But I bet Discord will stick around.

219
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:10,070
Rym: I think Discord, Patreon, maybe OnlyFans, I don't know.

220
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,956
Rym: There's some trouble with them still.

221
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:15,570
Rym: We'll see who survives this current round, I guess.

222
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:16,712
Scott: Yep.

223
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:23,054
Rym: I can see using this a lot of people have like a family and friends Discord or like a private Discord where.

224
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,558
Scott: And why would you collect money then?

225
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:32,163
Rym: Well, say in your group of friends, you do an annual beach house retreat or an annual party somewhere.

226
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:38,044
Rym: And this is the way everyone pays the dues to a central place to cover the cost of that party every year.

227
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,851
Scott: I don't think this works that way.

228
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:40,473
Scott: I think this is.

229
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:41,778
Scott: Oh, you mean every.

230
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,850
Scott: it's like everyone pay five bucks a month to join the Discord.

231
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:45,771
Rym: Yeah.

232
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:51,913
Scott: Or the people who are in the channel just be like, hey, if you want to I'll tell you the address of the party.

233
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,718
Scott: if you Venmo me 10 bucks.

234
00:18:55,664 --> 00:19:00,423
Rym: I know some friends, not our friend group even, but some friends of ours have talked about Chase in particular.

235
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:08,755
Rym: Groups of friends that set up like more complex, larger structures like these are friend groups that are a little more organized and they're almost like mini conventions.

236
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,304
Scott: Yeah, you can do that sort of thing.

237
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:22,018
Scott: I don't think that charging everyone a monthly fee that Discord takes a cut of is going to be the model for you need your friends to collect money together.

238
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:27,440
Scott: I feel like it only could definitely is only going to work for collecting money from the public and your fans.

239
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:32,500
Rym: I think that could work if you had sufficient scale of friends and sufficient scale of activities.

240
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:35,050
Scott: that if you have that many friends, those aren't friends.

241
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,074
Scott: Those are now fans.

242
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,339
Scott: There's that many people.

243
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:42,878
Rym: You could argue that line gets blurry at a certain weird size between really big and very small.

244
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:46,029
Scott: You're going to charge people a monthly fee.

245
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:49,385
Scott: I don't know if they're not just fans or audience of some kind.

246
00:19:49,425 --> 00:20:01,363
Scott: I don't think that really, I can see what you, what I think, what it also could work well for is, um, you know, Patreon and these sorts of things aren't often used by big companies.

247
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:07,061
Scott: Uh, if you're a big company, say a video game developer publisher, right?

248
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:13,543
Scott: You set up a Discord for your fans because you don't have a forum anymore because you know who, who would do that, right?

249
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:21,254
Scott: Um, you know, you have your actual paid community managers in there and whatnot, but then you have your gated channels that cost money.

250
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:31,935
Scott: And in those channels, you're giving out, you know, beta keys and you're, you know, you're actually getting feedback from, you know, this does sidestep, but it causes another externality.

251
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:37,455
Rym: The same problem that Twitter has that Twitch has is that any rando can make an account and start fucking around.

252
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:54,991
Rym: As soon as you have to pay for the thing you want, like pay to be able to chat in the Discord or the Twitch, 99% of trolls and harassers disappear because very few people are motivated enough in their hate of some creator to pay a monthly fee to harass them.

253
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:56,457
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:20:56,497 --> 00:21:03,603
Scott: If you retreat to your own Discord, it's like, yeah, you're going to still need moderation in there, obviously, but a lot less than just some public Twitch.

255
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:04,385
Rym: Yeah.

256
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:12,448
Scott: I think this would be pretty cool if there was some way to, you know, on Twitch, right?

257
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:20,051
Scott: Sort of erase the Twitch chat, just like block it all and then have, you know, a Discord chat be funneled in.

258
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:29,470
Scott: It's like, you can't chat there unless you go to the Discord, which could be gated, but everyone can never let you do that because that would undercut a lot of how they make.

259
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,299
Scott: of course it would, of course it would.

260
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,901
Scott: But if you did that in your own Twitch video, you see chats from the Discord.

261
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:42,943
Scott: So everyone in Discord has to know that they're chatting publicly, but that no public people can chat.

262
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:43,846
Scott: They can only read.

263
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,312
Rym: We're waiting for a few new features.

264
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:55,822
Rym: I've done a little bit of testing, but we do plan to, don't worry, we're not gonna start charging money, but I do plan to start streaming the GeekNights live, even if we keep doing it on YouTube, also streaming it inside of the Discord.

265
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,167
Rym: There's just some reasons.

266
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,933
Scott: I wish they would add video to the stages.

267
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:00,436
Scott: Then we'd be using that so much.

268
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:07,875
Scott: There's a Discord like feature suggestion website, an official one.

269
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:12,153
Scott: And there is a post there that's like, "Hey, add video and screen sharing to

270
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:12,675
Scott: stages.".

271
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:19,442
Scott: And it's got a lot of upvotes, but if everyone listening goes and upvotes it, that might encourage them to work harder on that.

272
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:26,506
Scott: You know, they gotta be working on such an obvious feature, but that feature will be like an explosion of easy content.

273
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:34,375
Rym: Can you imagine if we could just do our panels like in a Discord with slides up on the screen, video of us, people queuing up questions.

274
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,881
Rym: There's so much cool shit we can do.

275
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,736
Scott: Taking Q&As that we don't like to do, bringing in guests.

276
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:45,038
Scott: A guest on the show would just have to join the Discord and like join the stage and we'd say, "Let them join

277
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:45,219
Scott: stage.".

278
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:45,520
Scott: That's it.

279
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:46,404
Scott: We'd be good to go.

280
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:54,068
Rym: We're here with a listener from Omaha who has some comments on our... So yeah, we're keeping an eye on this.

281
00:22:54,088 --> 00:23:03,604
Rym: We've got a lot of other stuff in the hopper obviously, but once Discord stage is added a little bit more, we'll be using it heavily and we'll see where this community building goes.

282
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:08,340
Rym: I think this is a material threat to Twitch today because Twitch is.

283
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:15,424
Rym: the cracks in the Twitch universe and ecosystem are definitely becoming more and more apparent, especially for non-white creators.

284
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:20,801
Scott: I think people need still some public thing.

285
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:26,400
Scott: You can have your closed community, that's where your real action is, but you need some public things so people can find you.

286
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Scott: Discovery isn't a problem for consumers because there's so much stuff.

287
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,750
Scott: We don't need help discovering things.

288
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:42,900
Rym: If I never looked at the internet again, just from the games I know came out in the last few years, I could entertain myself for like five or six years.

289
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:44,224
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

290
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,552
Scott: So discovery is no longer a problem.

291
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,621
Scott: That's the problem we're trying to solve.

292
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:50,549
Scott: It's long been since over solved.

293
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:54,362
Scott: It's too easy to discover new awesome things that you don't have time for.

294
00:23:55,185 --> 00:24:00,303
Scott: The problem is on the other side, someone who creates something wants to be discovered.

295
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:06,140
Scott: They need to shout louder than everyone else in that sea of things that are easy to discover.

296
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:15,113
Rym: So I think there's a lot of ways to address that, but that would turn this into a show about this, but we'll be talking about this topic again, mind you.

297
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:24,274
Rym: In some other news, we rotate through which AAA video game studio is the worst one at any given time.

298
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:27,023
Rym: It's usually Ubisoft.

299
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,149
Rym: Ubisoft is the news I'm about to talk about.

300
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,808
Scott: Ubisoft is always the most micro transaction-y, scammy, one with awful games.

301
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:37,073
Rym: Like Blizzard, usually that's the worst one.

302
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:53,882
Scott: Blizzard is really bad right now, partly because they laid off a way off the deep end Blizzard Activision, and then EA is never good with their FIFA gambling, but even so, Ubisoft is regularly the worst one.

303
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:57,594
Rym: Like Riot, don't forget, they have very similar problems to Blizzard.

304
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:03,744
Rym: In fact, they had very similar problems recently to Blizzard, but now Blizzard is in the news because Blizzard's problems came back again.

305
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:04,790
Rym: All of those are bad.

306
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,109
Scott: They're all bad, but it's like I would rank probably Ubisoft last place, EA second to last.

307
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:18,694
Rym: Ubisoft is bad enough to where I actively, like I would actively avoid Ubisoft games even if the game itself was good.

308
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:23,994
Scott: Thankfully, I've been avoiding Ubisoft games for, uh, I don't even remember one I've bought.

309
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:35,454
Rym: Yep, thankfully I very rarely am even interested in any Ubisoft games because the kinds of games, they're all garbage, but Ubisoft is really fighting for the crowd of shittiest AAA studio.

310
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:41,918
Rym: They are actively and aggressively pursuing NFTs now, so what they're gonna do- I mean, that's not a surprise.

311
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,022
Rym: No, not a-.

312
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:55,320
Rym: what surprises me is that they didn't already have this live, uh, that this is somehow new, but I was surprised that Ubisoft was not like the first adopter of this blockchain chain NFT bullshit.

313
00:25:55,962 --> 00:26:20,276
Rym: Ubisoft is trying to use blockchain, uh, and they're launching this on December 9th in two days to have gear in Ghost Recon, like cosmetic hats basically, but when you get the hat in game, you get a fucking NFT, that means you own that hat, and that NFT will let you use that hat in, in the future, other Ubisoft games.

314
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:33,578
Scott: Uh, I want to- now before we go any further, I want to point out- Hold on a second, so this is actually, um, you know, approaching, right, forgetting the environmental and other bullshit, right?

315
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:52,091
Scott: This is actually approaching something where, you know, "Hey, now suddenly owning-" in quotes, right, having that token on the blockchain associated with your wallet cryptographically, right, would actually confer something resembling ownership, like

316
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:52,613
Rym: no

317
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:59,019
Scott: one else in any Ubisoft game is going to ever be able to wear that specific hat because there's only one of them, they didn't make more.

318
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:11,205
Rym: Yep, some other game company, not Ubisoft, could be like, "Hey, if you have a particular NFT from the Ubisoft whatever ecosystem, then you get this same equivalent item or something similar-".

319
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:37,515
Scott: Oh, you could, you could do that, but also the question is now, alright, so let's say I give Ubisoft money, they mint a blockchain coin, they, in their server, right, they look at that coin, and they recognize that that goes with my account somehow, maybe by looking at the wallet, and then associate my wallet with my Ubisoft account, and then their server just, you know, allows me to choose that hat to wear in various games.

320
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,639
Scott: There is a beg to question.

321
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:50,701
Scott: The question is, if I go, right, because Ubisoft doesn't control the blockchain itself, right, so if I go and, say, sell that coin, so I go to a coin exchange, and I sell that coin to someone- Yes, they are

322
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:57,466
Rym: directly saying they expect people to speculate on trade, sell for real money, these things, outside in the real world.

323
00:27:58,168 --> 00:28:11,082
Scott: Right, so if I sell that coin, is it, you know, they could, but are they actually going to correctly and properly set up their servers to recognize that the hat has been sold?

324
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,087
Scott: Who owns the hat now?

325
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:15,192
Scott: Which Ubisoft account?

326
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:17,300
Scott: is the person who now owns the hat?

327
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:21,677
Rym: So, the short answer is yes, that is, they're building their own servers to do this.

328
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,344
Scott: But are they doing it right?

329
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:27,278
Scott: I just don't have a lot of confidence that they will make it work technologically.

330
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:28,582
Rym: Oh, I think they'll make it work technologically.

331
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:30,950
Rym: I think it's going to be buggy and broken as all fuck.

332
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,423
Rym: I think there's a way deeper and more fundamental begged question.

333
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:39,074
Rym: What part of this entire fucking thing requires blockchain?

334
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:40,198
Scott: None of it.

335
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,591
Rym: This could be done with their own database that they already have.

336
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:51,833
Rym: The limiting factor on multiple games respecting the same token is implementing that in the games.

337
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:55,565
Rym: Not who has the ownership, but actually implementing the assets.

338
00:28:56,147 --> 00:29:01,986
Scott: Yeah, they don't need to implement the, you know, use blockchain to do this.

339
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,057
Scott: They could do it with the database, as is true for all blockchain things.

340
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:08,210
Rym: Oh, but what if you want to sell them for real money?

341
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,657
Rym: You can't do that with Counter-Strike hat.

342
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:10,441
Rym: Well, guess what?

343
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:15,081
Rym: In Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike, people sell those things for real money all the time.

344
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,510
Rym: Yeah, they just use Valve's database.

345
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,653
Scott: Valve has a database.

346
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:23,010
Rym: Yeah, or remember the Diablo real money auction house?

347
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:32,634
Scott: Yeah, but what it does is it saves Ubisoft from having to implement these trading house, right?

348
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:41,060
Rym: No, because they're gonna implement something far more complex to facilitate the recognition of these trades.

349
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:43,028
Rym: They're also running this as their own service.

350
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,152
Rym: They have a name for it.

351
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:56,370
Rym: I think the more fundamental problem is no part of this ecosystem is in any way enhanced by using blockchain, NFTs, cryptocurrency bullshit than by just doing it a normal way.

352
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,151
Scott: That's not new.

353
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:08,781
Scott: There's nothing that a cryptocurrency can do that can't be done with a database better, other than crime, right?

354
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,086
Scott: Someone said that recently.

355
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:12,234
Scott: It pretty much sums it up, right?

356
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,243
Scott: So there's nothing new about that.

357
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:22,228
Scott: Yeah, they could do it better with the database, but they could save themselves the effort of having to create a trading house.

358
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:27,990
Scott: Steam had these people at Valve created a trading house where you could buy and sell things, right?

359
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,334
Scott: They don't have to make that.

360
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:38,184
Scott: All they have to do is put mint a coin when they give you a hat and then look at the blockchain to see who owns the hat.

361
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:41,398
Rym: They're gonna provide a trading house and use the technology as well.

362
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,509
Scott: Well, then they didn't save themselves anything.

363
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,152
Rym: Well, because they're not.

364
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:55,569
Rym: The only reason a company like Ubisoft would ever do anything like this is solely that they want the buzz of the crypto bro bullshit to drive money their way.

365
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:02,113
Rym: They're trying to get people to say, "Oh, Ubisoft supports NFTs and I'm a dipshit, so I'm gonna go use Ubisoft stuff

366
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:02,334
Rym: now.".

367
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:03,518
Rym: That's my goal.

368
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,450
Scott: It's just that somebody might- It's a popular buzzword.

369
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:14,158
Scott: Yeah, but also if you're doing crime, it's like, "Well, if I could launder my money with some random picture of a monkey," right?

370
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:24,993
Scott: Or I could launder my money using an Ubisoft hat and there's a chance that some kid might actually want that hat and there might be some value to it instead of just a picture of a monkey.

371
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:32,719
Scott: So that's probably a better place to launder my money and it's backed up by some legitimate evil company.

372
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:42,016
Rym: But if you're not trying to launder and commit a crime and you just want to actually own the stupid monkey, none of this technology is needed for that and it just destroys the earth for no reason.

373
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:46,595
Scott: Yes, that's not new so there's no point in discussing the parts we've already discussed in the past.

374
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,572
Rym: So here's a thread, a link to all the evil crap that Ubisoft is doing.

375
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:52,841
Scott: and remember Ubisoft has always been the worst.

376
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:55,974
Rym: As bad as Activision Blizzard is right now they're real bad.

377
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:59,430
Rym: Ubisoft is the king of being a shitty AAA game company.

378
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,578
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

379
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,905
Rym: So this is a long video.

380
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,830
Rym: This is an hour and eight minutes long.

381
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,552
Rym: It's from Wired.

382
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:32,386
Rym: Thankfully it is annotated in that YouTube way so every single chapter of this video has its own tiny section in the timeline and this is an explanation of every single style of beer on earth in a good order of discussion from beginning to end.

383
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:39,534
Scott: Couldn't you just, this sounds to me like, I mean that's good information even for someone who doesn't like or you know even drink any alcohol.

384
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:43,550
Scott: but it feels like you could have just made that a webpage instead of a video.

385
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,216
Rym: Oh there's a million web pages like that.

386
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:50,057
Rym: What I enjoy about the video is that it's not about, no one should come to this video.

387
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,956
Rym: if you're trying to figure out the difference between a porter and a stout like just go google that.

388
00:32:55,297 --> 00:33:02,700
Rym: But if you just want to internalize the scope of beer and spend about an hour doing it, it's entertaining.

389
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,466
Rym: It has a lot of context.

390
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:05,450
Rym: It's really well done.

391
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,059
Rym: It explains interesting and relevant details.

392
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:12,054
Rym: I guess it's much more curated than any website I've seen like this.

393
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:18,738
Rym: It's one of the rare examples of a video that I think is sufficiently information dense to be useful and interesting.

394
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:22,853
Rym: It's also legitimately entertaining if you don't give a shit about beer.

395
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,021
Scott: I learned a lot from this video.

396
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:28,836
Scott: I feel like what you could do I think if this was a webpage.

397
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:30,965
Scott: right, if I was someone who cared about beer.

398
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,010
Rym: There are web pages like that.

399
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,073
Rym: I could link to like 10 of them.

400
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,606
Rym: There's like two different competing big beer wikis.

401
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:44,631
Scott: What I would do is I would just make a fucking checklist and I would drink one of everything over a period of time.

402
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:51,534
Rym: This provides a lot of history and interesting context too that I did not know about some of these varieties of beers.

403
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:55,050
Rym: Some beers I thought were very similar have very different histories.

404
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,360
Rym: It reminded me that the czech pilsners are delicious for a reason.

405
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,406
Rym: Is sugar the reason?

406
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,217
Rym: No, better quality.

407
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:05,659
Scott: I don't know.

408
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,351
Rym: Better quality and specific varieties of hops is the main reason.

409
00:34:10,355 --> 00:34:11,958
Scott: Anyway, all right.

410
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:16,630
Scott: So there's an old game, an Atari game called Pole Position.

411
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:27,871
Scott: Pole Position I think is actually a fantastic game because even with a crappy old computer from the 80s that doesn't have a lot of bits, a racing game was actually one of the earliest types of games.

412
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:35,918
Scott: You could make a really smooth, high quality racing game without much because the only controls you have are sort of analog left and right.

413
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:41,056
Rym: It's not really 3D like the way they actually render these graphics.

414
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,502
Scott: Right, exactly.

415
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:43,726
Scott: There's not much to it.

416
00:34:43,806 --> 00:34:46,255
Scott: It's just sort of like, "Stay in line.

417
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:46,797
Scott: Don't go on the

418
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,159
Scott: grass.".

419
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,045
Scott: It's not that complex.

420
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:53,761
Rym: I don't remember if it was a launch title, but there was an Atari 2600, Pole Position, whatever.

421
00:34:53,781 --> 00:35:05,315
Rym: When the Atari 7800 came out, which was similarly powerful pre-MMC chip to the Nintendo Entertainment System, it had some flaws that made it not succeed in the end of course.

422
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:09,028
Scott: You and your 7800 talking to, you know, everyone.

423
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:11,734
Scott: But they released a 7800 only version of Pole Position that was shockingly advanced for its time.

424
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,878
Scott: I mean, you know, there were plenty of games.

425
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:26,151
Scott: There was Outrun, Rad Racer, all kinds of these games.

426
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:31,350
Scott: Pole Position was the first one and the other ones didn't make too much improvement on it.

427
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,517
Scott: I guess Outrun had better music and art and whatnot.

428
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:40,842
Scott: But anyway, for a very long period of time, there was a high score at Pole Position, right?

429
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:46,199
Scott: We're talking arcade Pole Position with the actual sit-down cabinet with the steering wheel and everything.

430
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:54,328
Scott: And no one had really broken it, but this person in September, I had this thing of the day sitting around a while.

431
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,632
Scott: I just didn't use it until now.

432
00:35:56,474 --> 00:36:13,058
Scott: In September, Daniel Yamnitz on their own YouTube channel recorded a video of presumably the cabinet that they own playing the legit old original Pole Position on the, you know, tournament competition settings.

433
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,610
Scott: At the end of the video, they're like, "Oh, I got the high score.

434
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,118
Scott: I better go take a look at the jumpers to prove I didn't cheat,".

435
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:18,399
Scott: right?

436
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,212
Scott: It doesn't look like they cheated at all.

437
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:26,546
Scott: And yeah, they beat the world record for Pole Position.

438
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:27,870
Scott: It's quite amazing.

439
00:36:28,331 --> 00:36:34,913
Scott: I've always wondered what was the fastest way to race in Pole Position, because it's a pretty short game, right?

440
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,627
Scott: You do a qualifier, you do a race, and that's sort of it.

441
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,313
Scott: You don't keep racing or anything.

442
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:56,983
Scott: So apparently the fastest way to do it is obviously you got to start in low gear and then go to high gear as soon as you can and stay in high gear and drive like a lunatic and only go down to low gear and hit the brakes.

443
00:36:57,004 --> 00:37:12,616
Scott: I can't even tell if he's hitting the brakes, but for very short periods of time when you're taking like the really hard turns or otherwise in danger and stay out of the grass as much as possible, obviously only go into it very briefly for these ridiculous turns.

444
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:18,615
Scott: Obviously don't crash into any other cars and do that the whole time and you'll get a score of 67,260.

445
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:19,917
Scott: So congrats, Daniel.

446
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,899
Scott: That was awesome.

447
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:21,600
Scott: I like Pole Position.

448
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,072
Scott: It's a good game.

449
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:27,875
Rym: It is a good game.

450
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:39,400
Rym: God, now I just have flashbacks to hanging out in the not RIT's cafeteria, but U of R's cafeteria because there was that DDR machine and there was a Ridge Racer around the corner from it.

451
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,584
Scott: The Ridge Racer is 3D.

452
00:37:40,604 --> 00:37:47,472
Scott: Cruisin' World, Cruisin' USA, I think were the last significant racing games to have like the sort of 2D model.

453
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:49,979
Rym: Yeah, you want to go old.

454
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,703
Rym: Look at Night Driver on the Atari 2600.

455
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:55,973
Rym: The road is just dots on two sides.

456
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,261
Scott: Virtua Racing was the first major one to be 3D.

457
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:03,964
Rym: Oh my God, that Virtua Racer arcade machine with the four views you could pick between.

458
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:08,083
Scott: Virtua Racer is basically, I consider that to be Pole Position too, right?

459
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:12,699
Scott: It's like, do I need any other racing games besides Pole Position and Virtua Racing?

460
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,564
Scott: I feel like I don't, anyway.

461
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:20,783
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the Geek Design Book Club book is still the tale of Genji.

462
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:24,720
Scott: Since I'm not working, I read so many chapters like yesterday and the day before.

463
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:35,101
Rym: It's easy to steamroll through if you just sit down and read and like I've said before, if you don't sweat too much, like who exactly is having a particular conversation unless it's really important?

464
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:38,438
Rym: You can read a summary or like figure that out after you finish the chapter.

465
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:44,883
Scott: I think what happens a lot is like, for example, in the chapter I just read, what actually happened in the chapter?

466
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,312
Scott: You know, some people talked about a thing, right?

467
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:55,883
Scott: So that conversation was sort of what happened, but half the chapter was like describing the scenery of where they were in great detail.

468
00:38:56,023 --> 00:39:12,066
Scott: Like, ah, yes, there were these torches and these flowers and they were standing in this garden and the garden looked like this and there was an event happening in the garden that was like this and then eventually they came, you know, they were sitting between this curtain and now they have the conversation.

469
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:26,860
Rym: It's like, it's interesting how the like the mini climaxes and like the big moments in Genji are these extremely short like couple sentences and then the entire, it's like you could totally miss them because there's no, you know, narrative flow.

470
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,114
Rym: More than once I've been reading anyway and then I back up like, oh shit, did she just die?

471
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,979
Rym: And I back up like, oh shit.

472
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:40,620
Rym: But like I'll get several paragraphs past a death before I realize someone actually died right there.

473
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:41,723
Scott: Yep.

474
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:43,670
Rym: So yeah, people die.

475
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,403
Scott: In other meta news, since I'm not working, I got a lot of stuff going on.

476
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:54,419
Scott: It's December, which means advent of code, even though I don't celebrate Christmas.

477
00:39:55,402 --> 00:40:03,023
Scott: I'm doing 25 two-part computing programming puzzles between December 1st and December 25th.

478
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:08,584
Scott: So I'm uploading that to YouTube, my YouTube channel every day until I give up on it.

479
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:09,106
Scott: Who knows?

480
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:12,094
Scott: Last year I did all of them, except two stars.

481
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:13,918
Scott: So not too bad.

482
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,888
Scott: Also a new website is coming along.

483
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,955
Scott: Those are basically my two priorities, right?

484
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:29,943
Scott: I'm doing a lot of things, but my two highest priorities are the new website, which is making a ton of progress now and the reading the book.

485
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:35,938
Rym: Don't forget to invoice me for when we got to pay our contractor.

486
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:45,586
Scott: But yeah, things are moving along and I'm also going to be making other things once those two other main priorities, right?

487
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,071
Scott: I still got some time after that.

488
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,775
Scott: So yep, stuff's happening.

489
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:54,872
Rym: And on Friday this week, I will be at PAX Unplugged for a few hours.

490
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:00,409
Rym: I'm going to roll in at 1pm, do a panel in the Crab God Theater, Rare Game Mechanics.

491
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:01,835
Rym: I've rewritten half this panel.

492
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:03,905
Rym: I watched the panel we did before again.

493
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:16,614
Rym: I did some more research, but if you are not already going to PAX Unplugged, you do not need to worry about missing this because like I've said repeatedly, I am going to upload this to YouTube before the end of PAX Unplugged.

494
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:23,244
Rym: unless something happens like, I don't know, someone steals my camcorder out of the back of the room and runs away with it and somehow escapes.

495
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:30,848
Rym: Unless something terrible happens, video of this will be online before PAX Unplugged even ends on YouTube.

496
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:39,558
Rym: And otherwise, we'll see how many shows we do toward the end of the holiday period when holiday stuff happens, but we're both generally around.

497
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:42,591
Rym: So generally, Geek Dies episodes are going to just keep coming out.

498
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:46,679
Rym: Alright, let's get right into it.

499
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:57,710
Rym: So, full disclosure, I like Metroid games, but I have not played many recent Metroid games, and this Metroid Dread was literally my foray back into Metroid.

500
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,927
Scott: I have played just about every Metroid game ever, some of them several times.

501
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:03,209
Rym: Yep.

502
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:08,347
Rym: Also, you're pretty good and fast, especially some of the older Metroids.

503
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,290
Scott: No, that is not true.

504
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,308
Scott: If you are good and fast, I am garbage next to people who are good and fast.

505
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:18,197
Rym: You're good and fast relative to the average rando.

506
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,653
Scott: That's true, if it's a game that I've played before, then I know where stuff is.

507
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:28,923
Rym: So, I hadn't played a bunch of Metroids in a while.

508
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:30,247
Rym: Did you actually beat it?

509
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,357
Rym: Did you do the last little bit today?

510
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:36,135
Rym: I haven't beaten it yet because I only started playing it a week ago.

511
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:47,700
Scott: Yeah, when this game came out, Metroid Dread came out, I immediately played it a whole bunch, and I got all the way to the final boss, and then I didn't feel like beating it because I was like, "Well, then it's going to be over.

512
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,364
Scott: There won't be any more

513
00:42:48,384 --> 00:42:48,707
Scott: Metroid.".

514
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:49,631
Rym: I know that feeling.

515
00:42:50,173 --> 00:42:54,167
Rym: I fucked around not killing Ganon for a long time in Breath of the Wild.

516
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:56,316
Scott: So, then Rym was like, "Well, let's do a show on it

517
00:42:56,336 --> 00:42:56,537
Scott: today.".

518
00:42:56,557 --> 00:43:04,753
Scott: So, I'm like, "Well, so earlier today, since, again, I'm not working the entire month, I went ahead and I just loaded it up and I beat the final boss, and that was the

519
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:04,874
Scott: end.".

520
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:08,469
Rym: Yep, I got to Bird Uncle and I just beat that big, like, tentacle boss.

521
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:14,676
Rym: However far that is through the game, but it's moving along and I've played it enough to have a lot of thoughts on the game mechanics.

522
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:16,704
Rym: Hot top level, though, Metroid Dread.

523
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:20,837
Rym: Remember, it is a 2D Metroid, which is a big deal.

524
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:26,919
Rym: 2D games, especially Metroidvanias and Metroids, are somewhat like, they're my jam and they're Scott's jam.

525
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,330
Rym: Just keep making them and making them good.

526
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,112
Rym: I'll just keep playing them.

527
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:33,502
Rym: But, two, I really liked it so far.

528
00:43:34,183 --> 00:43:37,392
Rym: I plan to beat it soon and I highly recommend it.

529
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,638
Rym: if you like 2D Metroid games.

530
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:40,961
Scott: Yep.

531
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,113
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much all there is to it.

532
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:51,819
Scott: I think I talked about it a bit when it came out on the show, but just, you know, yeah, let's, you know, just reiterate, right?

533
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:59,069
Scott: It's like, some people say that, like, this is the best Metroid there is, which, you know, I could understand why you might say that, right?

534
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,458
Scott: It's clearly the most polished, right?

535
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:06,175
Scott: It has all the benefits of being made in the current year and not in 1990-whatever.

536
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:06,738
Rym: Yep.

537
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:15,210
Rym: Similar to how many people say Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game ever made and that is a plausible argument, but there are also very plausible counter arguments to that.

538
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:26,539
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like when you're comparing, like, you know, baseball players now to Babe Ruth and it's like, okay, it's like, you know, Babe Ruth, if he had to play baseball now, would be, like, you know, he was a schlub, right?

539
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:26,940
Scott: Yeah.

540
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:27,904
Scott: Or like hockey.

541
00:44:27,944 --> 00:44:32,218
Scott: He would not be good if he had to play baseball now against current baseball player, right?

542
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:48,637
Scott: But then again, if he was born in 1980 or 90-something, right, with the same DNA and the same, you know, whatever, he would have had the advantages of all the modern advancements in nutrition and fitness and maybe he would be even better, right?

543
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:49,682
Rym: Or here's an example.

544
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,092
Rym: There's a famous hockey player, uh, Sawchuck.

545
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,427
Rym: If you're not a hockey person, go Google a picture of this person.

546
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:56,495
Rym: You'll understand exactly what his deal is.

547
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:06,275
Rym: Was he great because he was great or was part of his greatness because he was one of the few people willing to take pucks to the face in an arrow and there was not a lot of protection?

548
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:12,666
Scott: Also, you know, Wayne Gretzky's got all those, you know, so many goals and assists, but he played in a time where it was easier to score.

549
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:15,279
Scott: If you had to play now, he wouldn't be able to score as much, right?

550
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:19,215
Scott: So, you know, people are like, well, you know, is Ovechkin better than Gretzky?

551
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:21,543
Scott: No, but he is a better scorer.

552
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:21,644
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:34,769
Scott: He's, you know, Wayne Gretzky would probably, if he had to play hockey today, if he started his career, when Ovechkin started his career, he probably wouldn't have, you know, as many goals as Ovechkin has.

554
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:36,880
Rym: Of course, Wayne Gretzky would score from all over the place.

555
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,513
Rym: He didn't have an office where everyone could be like, he's there.

556
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:40,799
Rym: He's right fucking there.

557
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:42,606
Rym: Do something or he's going to score.

558
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:51,037
Scott: He also mostly got assists at, you know, most of his, his unbeatable records are mostly points-based and not goal-based team player.

559
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,648
Rym: But yeah, that's why it's hard to say if this is the best game.

560
00:45:54,668 --> 00:46:04,763
Scott: So it's like, if you just compare the games to get all the Metroid games against each other and don't take any other, don't, you know, sort of do any sort of grading, uh, right.

561
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:17,988
Scott: Um, then, yeah, it's probably the best Metroid game, but if you say, well, look at what the games were when Super Metroid came out, it's like Super Metroid was punching way above its time, right?

562
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:20,778
Rym: Super Metroid was like a decade ahead of its time.

563
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,481
Scott: Right.

564
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:23,850
Scott: You know, Metroid Dread, is it ahead of its time?

565
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,573
Scott: Not really.

566
00:46:24,693 --> 00:46:26,280
Scott: It's just sort of, it's at its time.

567
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,870
Rym: It's exactly what I wanted to play right now.

568
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,211
Scott: Right.

569
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:33,003
Scott: It's, it's just, it's the Metroid experience, right?

570
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:36,092
Scott: Polished extremely heavily, right?

571
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:38,640
Scott: Uh, and that's it, right?

572
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:46,204
Rym: Like very similar to, uh, not to harp on this, uh, Castlevania games, like the other half of the Metroidvania type of world.

573
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:49,517
Rym: We had Symphony of the Night, which was phenomenal.

574
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:53,653
Rym: There's a bunch of other 2D Metroid, or Metroids, Castlevanias that came after that.

575
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:54,918
Rym: They're really good.

576
00:46:55,018 --> 00:47:03,088
Rym: Some of them might even be equal to, or in some ways, some narrow ways, I'm being very specific here, better than Symphony of the Night.

577
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:14,987
Rym: However, if you look at what existed in that genre or that space before Symphony of the Night, Symphony of the Night was like an alien from space coming down and handing onto us a new artifact.

578
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:16,693
Scott: Except for Super Metroid.

579
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:27,225
Rym: Yeah, but, but it was, it was a super, there's a reason why the power of Super Metroid and Castlevania became a genre that to this day we call Metroidvania.

580
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:27,606
Rym: Right.

581
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:28,590
Scott: Yeah.

582
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:43,042
Scott: So, I mean, you know, if you like a Metroid game, Metroid Dread is going to give you, you know, terms of controls in terms of graphics, in terms of, you know, design, music, you know, everything is pretty much, you know, as good as it's going to be.

583
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:43,625
Scott: Right.

584
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:47,839
Scott: You know, there is, you will find no flaw on this heavily polished stone.

585
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:53,863
Scott: At least no like, you know, flaw that you can say is sort of like a universal objective flaw.

586
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,692
Scott: Like, ah, this, you know, there's something wrong with it.

587
00:47:55,732 --> 00:47:55,893
Scott: Right.

588
00:47:56,334 --> 00:48:02,114
Scott: However, for at least me personally, you know, this is what I mentioned last time I talked about it.

589
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:07,574
Scott: There are a few things that for me make it only second best to Super Metroid probably.

590
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:07,815
Scott: Right.

591
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:11,991
Scott: So the first is that, you know, there's a plot and it's not a bad plot.

592
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:15,626
Scott: Um, it's a better plot than some of the like Metroid Fusion, for example.

593
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:21,394
Rym: I like in the beginning how the plot is given to you in drips and drabs and typical video gamey way, like, oh, here's the computer.

594
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:29,144
Rym: It tells you some stuff, but then there's a point where bird uncle shows up and just spends like four minutes just telling you what's happening.

595
00:48:29,626 --> 00:48:29,907
Scott: Yeah.

596
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:41,723
Scott: It's like, but the like Rym said, given to you in basically cut scenes, talking, voice acting, these sorts of things, Super Metroid, part of the magic of Super Metroid.

597
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:46,419
Scott: And I am going to compare this game to Super Metroid a lot, which is fair, right?

598
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:53,268
Scott: Uh, Super Metroid, the only plot that they give you in like, and part of it was the technological limitations of the Super Nintendo.

599
00:48:53,288 --> 00:49:07,899
Scott: You couldn't really have a video cut scene with voice acting so easily, um, and not use up all the memory on the cartridge, but the only really plot it gives you in text form is just, you know, uh, that one voice acting at the beginning, right?

600
00:49:07,919 --> 00:49:09,687
Scott: Where it's like the last Metroid is in captivity.

601
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:10,751
Scott: The galaxy is at peace.

602
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:18,315
Scott: And then some text, a little bit of text and every, all the rest of the story is told to you in game.

603
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:19,880
Scott: It's like, they don't cut away.

604
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,150
Scott: It's like, you know, spoilers are Super Metroid, right?

605
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,850
Scott: When the baby Metroid that was at the end of Metroid two comes back and it's enormous, right?

606
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,298
Scott: It's like, you just see it there.

607
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:31,570
Scott: You can, you're still Sam is you're still looking at the game.

608
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,494
Scott: You're still walking around.

609
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:34,143
Scott: You can try to shoot it and everything, right?

610
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:35,971
Scott: It's like, it's right there.

611
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:43,072
Scott: You know, it's in the plot of Super Metroid is integrated into the gameplay the same way that half-life.

612
00:49:43,353 --> 00:49:44,477
Scott: one and two do it.

613
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:50,737
Scott: Half-life does it a little bit less good, you know, cause they do, they trap you in a room and make guys talk to you sometimes.

614
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:58,120
Scott: Um, but even so, in my opinion, that is the right way to have a plot in a video game.

615
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:01,772
Scott: A cut scene just makes it less of a game and more of a movie.

616
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:09,240
Scott: Um, Metroid Dread doesn't have, isn't like some ridiculous, you know, Metal Gear cut scene thing where this cut scene is all over the place.

617
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:15,869
Rym: Um, you know, it's mostly not cut scenes, but like when you beat a boss, you're playing the game, fighting the boss the whole time.

618
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:24,102
Rym: But when you finally beat the boss, most of the time it cuts to like a really mini cut scene that shows how bad ass Samus is doing the things that you can't do with the controller.

619
00:50:24,904 --> 00:50:25,145
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:33,408
Scott: Um, but yeah, a lot of the plot is told to you with cut scenes as opposed to environmental storytelling.

621
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:35,737
Scott: And that to me is a negative, right?

622
00:50:35,978 --> 00:50:39,614
Scott: I like the environmental storytelling better where you're just playing the game the whole time.

623
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:40,439
Scott: The second thing is...

624
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:43,855
Rym: Even the original Metroid, like why are there these weird bird statues everywhere?

625
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:45,782
Scott: Right, exactly.

626
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:46,343
Scott: Right.

627
00:50:46,524 --> 00:50:49,856
Scott: Whereas here it's like the bird statues are these beings called Chozo.

628
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:50,720
Scott: Here's one of them.

629
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:51,885
Scott: It's talking to you now.

630
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:55,983
Rym: Of course the original Metroid, you couldn't even know what they were at all.

631
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:57,208
Rym: It wasn't even really that good.

632
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:58,976
Scott: You could, because it was in the instruction manual.

633
00:50:58,996 --> 00:50:59,398
Rym: Ah, yes.

634
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:03,537
Rym: A bunch of text exposition that was given to you in a physical cut scene.

635
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:07,194
Scott: But the instruction, all the instruction manual told you is like, it's Chozo.

636
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:08,643
Scott: And you're like, what the fuck is Chozo?

637
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:09,650
Scott: It didn't tell you anything else.

638
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:28,666
Scott: Regardless, the second thing is that other Metroid games, even Super Metroid to a large extent, um, there's bad guys that are just, you know, the non-boss bad guys, uh, are, you know, all over the place, but they're largely not a threat to you ever.

639
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:29,910
Rym: Unless you're not cautious.

640
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:34,552
Rym: Like if you're just like not that good or not paying attention or getting lazy, it's easy to bump into them.

641
00:51:35,294 --> 00:51:35,615
Scott: Yeah.

642
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:41,676
Scott: But for the most part, like the bad guys in Metroid games are just sort of decorations on the level, right?

643
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:46,916
Scott: They give you something to do, a reason to shoot your gun when it's not a boss, right?

644
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,286
Scott: Just like, Oh, there's a bad guys in this room.

645
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:53,303
Scott: I guess I have to push the shoot button a few times to get to the other side of the room.

646
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:54,427
Scott: I can't just run across.

647
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:57,101
Rym: It gives you a natural sense of progression.

648
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:05,021
Rym: And then as you just get better at the game, you can move through areas you've been through where there's enemies, you know how to handle faster or competently with less thought.

649
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:10,669
Rym: Like you just sort of memorize a pattern or no, you can run past a certain guy or you have a better upgraded weapon at that point.

650
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:17,756
Rym: And they go down easier, but it does give you a sense of progression that you wouldn't get if you were just exploring and fighting bosses.

651
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:18,639
Scott: Yep.

652
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:24,679
Scott: But for the most part, the bad guys aren't part of the challenge of a Metroid game, the normal bad guys.

653
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:29,635
Scott: They're just, you know, decoration, environment stuff, right?

654
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:34,126
Scott: Whereas in Metroid Dread, the regular old bad guys.

655
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:42,968
Scott: for, you know, as you progress through the game, if you backtrack to an area where there's weaker bad guys than your current equipment, yeah, they're just going to be decoration.

656
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:58,763
Scott: But as you're progressing through the game, the regular old bad guys are like in your way, you have to get past them and you have to actually do a little bit of like action game button timing stuff to get to defeat them, right?

657
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:02,096
Scott: They're not necessarily difficult, though there is a hard mode.

658
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:05,012
Scott: you can unlock after you beat the game, which probably does make them more difficult.

659
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:10,422
Rym: But they also, when they hit you, especially in an area you haven't fully explored yet that you're currently supposed to be in, they'll mess you up.

660
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:13,435
Rym: They do a shit ton of damage, way more than I expected.

661
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:14,821
Scott: Even on not hard mode, right?

662
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:16,910
Scott: If you mess up, then you pay the price.

663
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,294
Scott: Yeah.

664
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:26,928
Scott: And also, right, the bosses are very much, you know, the classic action game.

665
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:31,401
Scott: Simon says, you see this animation, that means you have to do this.

666
00:53:31,843 --> 00:53:39,966
Scott: That means slide, that means jump, that means dash to evade that enemy's attack, that means shoot him now, right?

667
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:44,259
Scott: And that's how you defeat enemies because that's how action games work, right?

668
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:48,713
Scott: And then you also have some timing things, right?

669
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:51,343
Scott: It's like when you see a flash, push X to counter attack.

670
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:59,494
Scott: You also have a little bit of quick time event things at certain parts in little cut scenes here and there, not too much, very small amount.

671
00:53:59,595 --> 00:54:04,136
Rym: Yeah, we'll describe the enemy thing because I think there's some interesting game mechanics stuff to talk about there.

672
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:06,870
Rym: There's good and bad parts of that aspect of this game.

673
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:13,194
Scott: Right, but the point I'm making is that this Metroid is much more of an action game than other Metroids.

674
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:20,562
Scott: where the action parts are, you can just sort of gloss over them and just, it's more, the exploring is what matters.

675
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:33,778
Rym: Because one specific thing I noticed in this Metroid compared to other Metroids I have played is that in this one, you know, the typical fashion, you get items that lets you interact with or get past obstacles you couldn't get past before, kind of like in a Zelda 3.

676
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:36,790
Rym: Now you can go back and go to an area you couldn't go to before, like.

677
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,075
Rym: that's a big part of the game loop.

678
00:54:38,637 --> 00:54:48,617
Rym: But in older Metroids, you could explore a lot more broadly and when you got a new item, the game didn't do a ton of work to point you in the right direction of where you could use it.

679
00:54:48,658 --> 00:54:53,536
Rym: It kind of assumed you'd explore and figure stuff out, backtrack on your own, etc.

680
00:54:53,958 --> 00:55:11,355
Rym: This game often, when you solve a puzzle in a certain area, it'll, you get to a certain point in these areas, it'll block paths in that area to really push you into backtracking toward where the interesting stuff is that you can interact with the things you recently acquired.

681
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:22,279
Rym: So, it'll like, you find a teleporter pad early in the game, the first one, and as soon as you use it, a bunch of shit falls down and blocks the path back, so you're forced to go forward in the area you just got to.

682
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:23,644
Rym: That happens a lot.

683
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:35,189
Rym: You can often get around those blocks if you really want to backtrack and get the one thing the game's guiding you away from, but it's often tedious, so I tend to just go where the game wants me to go.

684
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:41,310
Rym: But it did remove a small aspect of exploration that I did enjoy more in other Metroid games.

685
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:50,007
Scott: At a certain point, the game does sort of unlock and you can go anywhere freely, but yeah, at least they did a better job of that than Metroid Fusion does.

686
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:55,164
Scott: Metroid Fusion literally, you're locked in this zone, now go to the next zone.

687
00:55:55,184 --> 00:56:03,770
Scott: Whereas this did the same concept, but made it feel more natural and integrated, but it still was, I still prefer Super Metroid.

688
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,920
Scott: It's like, you can just go anywhere that you can go.

689
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,270
Scott: It's up to you to remember where, or figure out where the, you know, remember there was a green door you couldn't open.

690
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,755
Scott: You just got super missile.

691
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:14,362
Scott: Where was that green door again?

692
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:15,165
Scott: Oh, right.

693
00:56:15,286 --> 00:56:16,330
Scott: It was over in that place.

694
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,016
Scott: Let me go to that place and use my green.

695
00:56:18,056 --> 00:56:24,320
Rym: It is hard to express how fucking jazzed I was to be able to open green doors, right?

696
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:26,789
Rym: That's that's so those green doors, the whole game.

697
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:27,632
Rym: And I'm just like, damn it.

698
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:28,776
Rym: How do I get in there?

699
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:31,605
Scott: But anyway, so it's more of an action game.

700
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:38,707
Scott: And the, the action game that it is, is an extremely polished, high quality action game.

701
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:39,971
Scott: Like there aren't much better.

702
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:43,765
Scott: I just personally, I'm not playing Metroid for the action.

703
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:48,827
Scott: So I'm a, it's like, yeah, they put in like one of the best possible action games.

704
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:49,510
Scott: That's amazing.

705
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,310
Scott: But I would rather have that personally, I'd rather have there be no action game.

706
00:56:53,571 --> 00:56:56,264
Scott: It's like, I want the enemies that don't really challenge me.

707
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:58,594
Scott: I want to just, I want, I'm there for the explorer.

708
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:00,159
Rym: You want just like an Odyssey?

709
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:01,183
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:08,329
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm not there for, you know, shooting the regular old bad guys or for a really complicated boss.

711
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:10,377
Scott: I'm just, I just want to fill the boss full of missiles.

712
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:10,658
Scott: Right.

713
00:57:10,698 --> 00:57:13,530
Scott: It's like, you know, there's a bad guy.

714
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:13,852
Scott: Yeah.

715
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:14,134
Scott: Okay.

716
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:15,080
Scott: I'll shoot the bad guy.

717
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:18,158
Scott: But it's like, I don't want to have to have like the dual with this regular old bad guy.

718
00:57:18,178 --> 00:57:27,372
Rym: And you know, it's like, but I also don't, I don't want to go back to original Metroid one on the NES of you better have 90 missiles and you don't miss with any of them.

719
00:57:27,392 --> 00:57:27,472
Rym: Yeah.

720
00:57:28,997 --> 00:57:31,765
Rym: That's also the wrong Ridley in that game sucks.

721
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:37,903
Scott: There's a reason I'm comparing to super Metroid, not regular one is you don't need to read this.

722
00:57:37,984 --> 00:57:40,592
Rym: Not like most Metro games are playing.

723
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:44,327
Rym: You don't really need to go back and beat the original Metroid.

724
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:50,655
Scott: You, what you, what you should do is you should play the original Metroid a little bit so you can understand what it was like.

725
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:53,405
Rym: That'll tell you everything you needed to know about that game.

726
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:55,512
Scott: Then play Metroid zero mission.

727
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:57,600
Rym: I guess also internalize only better.

728
00:57:57,701 --> 00:58:01,677
Rym: The coolest thing Metroid one did was the game was called Metroid.

729
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,149
Rym: The instruction book was like, watch out for fucking Metro.

730
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,072
Rym: They will fuck you up.

731
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:06,235
Rym: You come into the game.

732
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:11,650
Rym: There are no Metro until the very, very, very end of the game.

733
00:58:12,591 --> 00:58:14,702
Scott: Well, I think that Nintendo had a pattern of that, right?

734
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:16,169
Scott: Zelda was legend of Zelda.

735
00:58:16,189 --> 00:58:18,359
Scott: It was, it was not named after the name character.

736
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:18,921
Scott: It's like.

737
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:20,147
Scott: Metroid is not named.

738
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,735
Scott: The main character is Sam is not right.

739
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:23,161
Scott: It's like, you know, Mario.

740
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:25,995
Scott: It's like, okay, the name of the game is the name of the main character.

741
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:28,747
Scott: You know, Sonic, the name of the game is the main character.

742
00:58:28,848 --> 00:58:29,692
Scott: Zelda and Metroid.

743
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:30,315
Scott: No, it's not.

744
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,526
Scott: The name of the game is not the name of the character.

745
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,576
Scott: It's the name of something else, right?

746
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:37,991
Rym: But then you finally encounter Metroids and they're just all up in your grill.

747
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:40,359
Rym: There's a million of them constantly coming at you and it's crazy.

748
00:58:41,503 --> 00:58:41,664
Scott: Yep.

749
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:52,380
Rym: So the thing they get the mechanic, cause every Metroid game, well, most measure games have like either a new mechanic or the thing that's interesting about this Metroid.

750
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:58,500
Rym: This one is it has the stealth component around a particular kind of.

751
00:58:59,142 --> 00:59:00,285
Rym: there's sort of a boss.

752
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:01,830
Rym: I'd say that they count as bosses.

753
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:03,092
Scott: Maybe.

754
00:59:03,393 --> 00:59:03,674
Rym: Yeah.

755
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:10,095
Rym: There's there's bosses and then there's Emmys or EMMIs, which sort of function like bosses, but they're a little bit different.

756
00:59:10,496 --> 00:59:17,420
Rym: They add a stealth element that I have not encountered in Metroid games I've played before.

757
00:59:17,942 --> 00:59:20,512
Rym: Metroid Fusion has the, I never played Metroid Fusion.

758
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:21,215
Rym: full disclosure.

759
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:22,381
Scott: A little bit.

760
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:22,742
Scott: Yeah.

761
00:59:22,823 --> 00:59:24,872
Scott: Well then how do you understand what's going on in Metroid Dread?

762
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:28,710
Rym: Uh, cause the plot is really simplistic and it's really straightforward.

763
00:59:29,912 --> 00:59:37,337
Scott: Well, you know, anyway, so yeah, the Emmy thing is basically there are certain zones in each, in each of the areas of the planet.

764
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:43,681
Scott: Cause it's a Metroid game, named areas of the planet, but each major named area has a zone.

765
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:45,327
Scott: That's like the Emmy zone.

766
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:54,241
Scott: So when you go there, there's like these doors and you can just tell it cause it signals to you visually that once you go in that door, you'll be in the Emmy zone.

767
00:59:54,282 --> 00:59:56,010
Scott: And the Emmy zone is all weird and scary.

768
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,803
Scott: And there's an Emmy in there and you basically can't kill it.

769
01:00:00,023 --> 01:00:00,746
Scott: It's invincible.

770
01:00:01,087 --> 01:00:05,043
Scott: If it grabs you, you can escape with some really well-timed button presses.

771
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:06,470
Scott: Maybe if you're really good.

772
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:11,406
Rym: The game is even like, look, listen, kids, don't think this is a mechanic.

773
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:14,035
Rym: We expect you to use, do not rely on this.

774
01:00:14,075 --> 01:00:15,622
Rym: Do not like try to get good at it.

775
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,128
Rym: It is not the way to play.

776
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:18,853
Scott: I'm sure there are people who can do it every time.

777
01:00:18,893 --> 01:00:19,454
Scott: No problem.

778
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,800
Scott: I had about like a 30% success rate.

779
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,492
Scott: I'm getting fascinating.

780
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:31,107
Rym: Uh, it as echoes of something that five nights at Freddy's did very well too.

781
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:38,857
Rym: Uh, if the game was, cause the way this works is when you get into an Emmy zone, they will like, listen for you, hunt you down.

782
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:42,731
Rym: And if they touch you barring this quick time event, it's instant death.

783
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:43,315
Rym: You just die.

784
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:44,300
Rym: There's nothing you can do.

785
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,125
Rym: You cannot fight them.

786
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:46,552
Rym: You cannot even like shooting them.

787
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:47,636
Rym: Doesn't really do anything.

788
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:49,363
Scott: You just, they're just invincible.

789
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:55,546
Rym: So if they, if them touching you was just instant death, that's still really scary.

790
01:00:56,027 --> 01:01:11,122
Rym: But the fact that there's this tiny chance you might be able to escape by hitting X at the right time during that animation gives you this false sense of hope and makes you like engage more with this instant death mechanic and it increases.

791
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:17,112
Scott: Otherwise, if you didn't have a chance, you would just like, you know, you know, as soon as you knew you were caught, you'd be like, fuck it.

792
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:17,293
Scott: Right.

793
01:01:17,313 --> 01:01:22,397
Scott: You wouldn't even, but it's like you hold on and you actually experience the horror of being caught.

794
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,184
Scott: You submit yourself to that.

795
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:32,314
Rym: Similar to how five nights at Freddy's to escape gives you all these, it does all these things to convince you as a player, instead of just closing your eyes.

796
01:01:32,374 --> 01:01:42,353
Rym: Cause you know, the jump stairs coming, leaning in and paying attention to, so you end up getting more gotten by the jump scare than you as an intelligence adult would have been.

797
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:49,194
Rym: This mechanic in Metroid Dread literally increases the dread you as a player feel around these Emmys.

798
01:01:49,936 --> 01:01:56,835
Rym: And I think that is the most interesting mechanical innovation used in this game, like full stop.

799
01:01:56,956 --> 01:02:02,438
Scott: Now, the problem is, is that, you know, when I started playing the game, the first couple Emmy zones, right.

800
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,944
Scott: It totally worked, right.

801
01:02:04,004 --> 01:02:06,133
Scott: It was very scary to go in the Emmy zones.

802
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:08,081
Scott: The Emmy was catching me all the time.

803
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:08,362
Scott: Right.

804
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:14,348
Scott: But then by the third or fourth Emmy zone, I realized like, wait a minute, this game is structured in such a way.

805
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:15,974
Scott: Like, I don't need to go.

806
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:20,755
Scott: Cause I was trying to explore the Emmy zone while avoiding the Emmy to figure out what the hell to do in there.

807
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:31,372
Scott: But then I realized, wait a minute, every time you encounter a new Emmy door, the game is designed for you to just run through to the next Emmy door and escape the zone.

808
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:44,601
Scott: And if you just keep going forward in that fashion, as quickly as you can, you'll eventually arrive at the method to get rid of the Emmy permanently, then unlock that zone, removing the Emmy so that you can explore it freely.

809
01:02:44,842 --> 01:02:46,490
Scott: There's no reason to hang around in there.

810
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:52,491
Scott: So once I realized that after the, like the third Emmy zone, I never got caught by an Emmy again, ever.

811
01:02:52,552 --> 01:03:00,827
Scott: I fucked up some platforming, like that happens sometimes, but yeah, but it's like, I just, I saw an Emmy zone and I didn't even give a shit about what was in that zone.

812
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:02,857
Scott: I just ran from, I looked at the map.

813
01:03:02,957 --> 01:03:04,545
Scott: I said, okay, well, this is the entrance.

814
01:03:04,566 --> 01:03:05,430
Scott: Where's the next exit.

815
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:06,996
Scott: It's probably around there.

816
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:09,748
Scott: And I just went in, I ran through as quickly as I could.

817
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:11,915
Scott: I didn't do stealth metal gear style.

818
01:03:12,337 --> 01:03:13,942
Scott: I didn't try to do any shenanigans.

819
01:03:14,344 --> 01:03:15,287
Scott: I just ran through.

820
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:22,029
Scott: no exploring, no nothing, you know, got out the other side and that the Emmy was now not scary at all.

821
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:29,015
Rym: Once I realized, you know what the deal was, I think they should not have given you, they should not have let you destroy the Emmys.

822
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,161
Rym: They should have done that differently.

823
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,287
Rym: I'd rather know.

824
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:33,256
Scott: I think letting you destroy them is fine.

825
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:41,826
Scott: I think what they should have done is given you some incentive or reason to explore and hang out in the Emmy zone while the Emmy was still there.

826
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:42,288
Rym: Yeah.

827
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:43,130
Scott: Right.

828
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,749
Scott: Don't just construct it in such a way that like, yeah, just run through and explore it later.

829
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:49,395
Scott: It's like, it's a Metroid game.

830
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:51,523
Scott: I should basically always want to explore.

831
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:54,956
Scott: And you know, this thing should basically be like, yeah.

832
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:58,510
Rym: Imagine if it was more like the Emmy was exploring under pressure.

833
01:03:58,831 --> 01:03:59,133
Scott: Imagine

834
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:18,067
Rym: a bigger Emmy zone that was like really vertical, let's say, and there's a bunch of shit to explore and you couldn't destroy that Emmy, but it was further away from you and you had like more room to maneuver and you couldn't, you just literally had to, with that sense of dread play Metroid in a place where there's only one monster and it's really, really dangerous.

835
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:21,359
Scott: But yeah, and also despite being stealth, right?

836
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,371
Scott: You know, the old, the old palace guard stealth game, right?

837
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,084
Scott: You're hiding in the hedge maze, Zelda 64 style.

838
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:28,370
Scott: There's a lot of other games that do that.

839
01:04:29,572 --> 01:04:30,758
Scott: it's like, they could have done that.

840
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:43,873
Scott: You could have brought in more than one Emmy and been like, okay, you're in a ball in some vents and it's like, go through the vents with the correct timing, looking at where the Emmys are so that their flashlights don't touch you while you're in ball shape.

841
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:47,248
Rym: They made all the Emmys the same, which was also kind of boring.

842
01:04:47,288 --> 01:04:49,357
Rym: Like I wish the Emmys, they're not all exactly the same.

843
01:04:49,397 --> 01:04:55,761
Scott: They do get more dangerous, but dealing with them is effectively the same because you just don't run away from them.

844
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:56,885
Scott: It's a problem.

845
01:04:56,925 --> 01:05:02,564
Rym: I call it the portal problem back when we played portal two all the way to the end.

846
01:05:02,886 --> 01:05:06,704
Rym: When I realized that portal one and portal two, the puzzles are really good.

847
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:07,529
Rym: I really love those games.

848
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,464
Rym: In fact, I'm actually finally playing the multiplayer with our friend right now.

849
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:12,212
Rym: We're going to finish that like tomorrow.

850
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:15,261
Scott: It's really early 20 years too late, but it's fun.

851
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:36,112
Rym: But I realized like portal two got really easy when in the course of my playthrough pretty early on, I realized that there's so few avenues of solving puzzles just with the limited tools you have in the game that you can kind of just fall forward into solutions without thinking about the problem at all.

852
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,862
Rym: Like, oh, there's two angled places.

853
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:40,810
Rym: Definitely going to make something momentum.

854
01:05:40,951 --> 01:05:42,417
Rym: shoot out of those angles.

855
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:53,375
Rym: One of the two of them will get me to the next area or we'll get the cube to the next area and approaching from the every puzzle in portal two with like one or two eventually rare exceptions.

856
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:57,955
Rym: You can just fall forward into victory without even understanding what the puzzle was.

857
01:05:58,377 --> 01:05:59,985
Rym: And I've noticed the Emmys were the same way.

858
01:06:00,226 --> 01:06:05,185
Rym: Just fucking run and you'll beat the Emmy eventually without having to think about it at all.

859
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:13,818
Scott: And I just think that puzzles though, there is one mini puzzle and that is, you know, you, you have in each Emmy area, you eventually beat.

860
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:21,590
Scott: this brain thing is reminiscent of the original mother brain and you get your weapon temporarily powered up in such a way that it can defeat the Emmy.

861
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:28,375
Rym: I like how you have to do the really like scary thing of shoot at it while it's approaching you until you melt the cover.

862
01:06:28,876 --> 01:06:34,556
Scott: But it's that sequence is actually sort of a puzzle because you need to shoot the gun at the Emmy.

863
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:40,743
Scott: You need to charge it up, shoot it at the Emmy for a long enough period of time for it to break through the Emmy, right?

864
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:42,350
Scott: It's not just like shoot it and you beat it.

865
01:06:42,832 --> 01:07:01,325
Scott: So it's a mini puzzle of you have to get Samus into a position where the Emmy is far enough away and coming at you slowly face first so that you can now get the weapon ready and fire it and have enough time to kill the Emmy with it before the Emmy reaches Samus.

866
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:08,409
Scott: And it's like a mini puzzle to examine, you know, the limited arena in which the Emmy is and where you can go.

867
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:11,484
Rym: Is there a really long one time it got me, there's a really long place.

868
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:12,489
Rym: I think it was the third Emmy.

869
01:07:12,509 --> 01:07:13,996
Rym: And I was like, okay, I'll do the obvious thing.

870
01:07:14,036 --> 01:07:16,527
Rym: I'll stand at the end of this long, long area.

871
01:07:16,547 --> 01:07:18,174
Rym: And then I have a long time to shoot it.

872
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:21,507
Rym: And it didn't follow down where I expected right away.

873
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:25,662
Rym: And for just a second, I think, oh, did it go in and it fell on top of me.

874
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:26,766
Scott: Yep.

875
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:32,591
Scott: It's, there's a little mini puzzle of how do you get, you got to get the Emmy into the right spot and Samus into the right spot.

876
01:07:32,853 --> 01:07:45,539
Scott: And then, you know, there's an action game element of not only to do that, you have to skillfully get the weapon out and start shooting it with good aim and keep that good aim right on Emmy's head until it's destroyed without fucking up.

877
01:07:46,502 --> 01:07:50,456
Scott: So it's, that's a fun little game, like a sub game within a game there.

878
01:07:50,496 --> 01:08:06,639
Rym: But aesthetically, the other thing, the Emmys are not that interesting of a puzzle for all the reasons we discussed, but the other cool thing about them is at least in terms of their design, they are so creepy that like burbling chirping noise that they make when they're hunting you is fantastically creepy.

879
01:08:08,103 --> 01:08:08,264
Scott: Yeah.

880
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:13,922
Scott: Everything aesthetic about this game is 100% on point, like nothing wrong with it whatsoever.

881
01:08:13,942 --> 01:08:16,711
Rym: The environments are all radically different and interesting.

882
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:17,593
Scott: It's very Metroidy.

883
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,738
Scott: All the Metroid tropes are intact.

884
01:08:20,038 --> 01:08:22,505
Rym: Yeah.

885
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:24,009
Rym: I'm really enjoying it.

886
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,902
Scott: If you have a Switch, you should play this game, obviously.

887
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,926
Rym: It's a must buy game.

888
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:31,662
Rym: If you've never played a Metroid game, you could just start with this one.

889
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:32,950
Rym: You don't need to know anything else.

890
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:39,835
Scott: You could just start with any of them, but I recommend playing, you know, actually the remade ones are going to be much better to play.

891
01:08:39,935 --> 01:08:42,443
Scott: So I would play Metroid Zero Mission.

892
01:08:43,045 --> 01:08:47,300
Scott: Samus Returns, which is for the 3DS is a remake of Metroid 2.

893
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,276
Scott: Super Metroid is Metroid 3, and it's never been remade because it doesn't need to be remade.

894
01:08:51,316 --> 01:08:52,442
Scott: You can just play it on your Switch.

895
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:56,337
Scott: also though, in that Super Nintendo app, if you have Switch online.

896
01:08:56,778 --> 01:09:00,048
Scott: And then you've got Metroid Fusion, which is kind of meh.

897
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:03,037
Scott: Maybe you can like read about it or play it if you really want to.

898
01:09:03,157 --> 01:09:04,821
Rym: Don't play Metroid Hunters.

899
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:10,479
Scott: That's the Metroid games that aren't in the Metroid main series.

900
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:15,278
Rym: That one is actually listed in the official Metroid story chronology for some reason.

901
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:20,676
Scott: I mean, they're all in the story chronology somewhere, but it's like Metroid 1, 2, 3, 4.

902
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:23,545
Scott: This Metroid Dread is actually Metroid 5, right?

903
01:09:24,787 --> 01:09:29,018
Scott: Metroid Prime is like a side prequel deal, right?

904
01:09:29,459 --> 01:09:32,567
Scott: And Metroid Hunters is another offshoot side deal.

905
01:09:32,587 --> 01:09:39,225
Scott: The only main Metroid games that are 2D, normal Metroid games are Metroids 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

906
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:39,447
Scott: That's it.

907
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,734
Scott: And this is Metroid 5.

908
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,801
Scott: So Metroid Fusion is Metroid 4.

909
01:09:43,801 --> 01:09:48,720
Scott: So, you know, it's not as good as the other ones, but it won't take you that long to beat it.

910
01:09:49,082 --> 01:09:51,535
Scott: You know, it won't be a complete waste of time, but you don't have to.

911
01:09:51,575 --> 01:09:52,179
Scott: It's not as good.

912
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:55,095
Scott: You can read about it just to get the plot, synopsis, whatever.

913
01:09:56,101 --> 01:09:57,689
Scott: And then play this one for reals.

914
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:05,041
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

915
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:10,244
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

916

Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

918
01:10:18,556 --> 01:10:23,178

929
01:11:05,256 --> 01:11:12,889
Rym: And I don't know how many shows we'll do in the coming few weeks, because as I said, you know, it's the holiday season, we got stuff going on, but we'll do several.

930
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:15,041
Rym: Don't know if I'll be able to hang out with anyone at Unplugged.

931
01:11:15,081 --> 01:11:17,092
Rym: I'm really literally just going to be in and out.

932
01:11:17,514 --> 01:11:23,251
Rym: But for now, I leave you with something that will likely be a thing of the day next week.

933
01:11:27,193 --> 01:11:29,615
Scott: I don't want a lot of Christmas.

934
01:11:32,757 --> 01:11:34,978
Scott: There is just one thing that I need.

935
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:41,726
Scott: What about the presents underneath the Christmas tree?

936
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:49,200
Scott: I just want to boldly go more than you could ever know.

937
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,811
Scott: Make my wish come true.

938
01:11:58,052 --> 01:12:17,199
Rym: All I want for Christmas is Captain Long.

939
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:21,905
Scott: It's almost Christmas, and there is just one thing I need.

940
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:28,120
Rym: I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree.

941
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:34,611
Scott: I don't want to hang my stocking there above the fireplace.

942
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:41,004
Scott: Number one won't make me happy with the toy on the Christmas day.

943
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:47,317
Rym: I just want to make it so more than you could ever know.

944
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,104
Scott: Make my wish come true.

945
01:12:51,509 --> 01:12:53,497
Scott: All I want for Christmas is.
