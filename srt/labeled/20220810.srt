1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,571
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:10,912
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:14,219
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:15,910
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,880
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing E2O, directed by Masaaki Yuasa.

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:22,978
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:32,650
Rym: So, uh, I was in the GeekNights forum, community.frontrowcrew.com, a little bit before this, 'cause I hadn't read it in a couple days.

8
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:47,113
Rym: Like, I'd actually been really busy, and I'd, like, I didn't read the entirety of the internet that I normally read, and I was catching up on it, and I noticed a comment from the listener, which, you know, when I see comments like this, I do react to them, because every now and then, I will fuck up an episode.

9
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:51,632
Rym: Like, I have left a main bit, like a thing-of-the-day sound in the wrong place.

10
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:53,198
Rym: I'd like it to happen.

11
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,347
Rym: It's rare, but it happens.

12
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,652
Scott: But, uh... I added, for the new website, I added a feature.

13
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:03,600
Scott: Not, it won't be one of those features that keeps me from releasing the new website, but it's one of those future features.

14
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:11,240
Rym: Oh, if you're gonna say what you're, I think you're about to say, that's gonna be great, because the process I have to follow now involves manually logging the Libsyn and fuckery.

15
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:16,320
Scott: Yeah, create some way for Rym to, you know, re-upload the MP3 if he fucks it up.

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,560
Rym: So I did look through some old stats, because, you know, I have my own production logs.

17
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:26,360
Rym: I have fucked up fewer than ten episodes in the history of GeekNights, which is actually pretty good.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,400
Scott: That's why this is a distant feature and not a high-priority feature.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:37,300
Rym: 'Cause I, when I fuck it up, so I thought, because the listener said, and I'm gonna quote here, "The audio tracks in the main bit of this episode are misaligned.

20
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,951
Rym: You are artificially talking over each other.

21
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,212
Rym: I don't care to listen about vacuum cleaners enough to listen this

22
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:41,414
Rym: way.".

23
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:41,860
Rym: Which, fair.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,491
Scott: I don't care about, I don't, that's fair.

25
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:44,780
Scott: I don't want to listen about vacuum cleaners.

26
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:47,019
Scott: I didn't have much to say about them.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,519
Rym: You already had to listen to it once.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,820
Scott: I didn't have much knowledge about them either, so I'm not the one you should be listening to about vacuum cleaners.

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,160
Scott: Go find, there's probably some vacuum expert home appliance podcast you could listen to.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:57,821
Rym: Yeah.

31
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:00,560
Rym: So, uh, but anyway, I, you know, I reacted to that.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,100
Rym: So just before the show, I, uh, I went in and checked.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,460
Rym: So, uh, first, I keep the raw session of every GeekNights episode for a year.

34
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,378
Rym: That's like my process, just in case.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,120
Rym: And I keep the raw audio, but not the whole project forever, just in case.

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:26,380
Rym: Obviously reconstructing an episode from the raw audio would be more of a pain in the ass, but I have never needed to go more than a year in the past and fix an episode, except when I did all that commentary on the Patreon on the Beta GeekNights.

37
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:27,079
Rym: But I digress.

38
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:32,020
Rym: So I go, I open the sequence first, because if you fuck that up, it's really obvious.

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,919
Rym: And it looked fine.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:42,840
Rym: So I actually went deeper and did some analysis because I have to synchronize your audio recorded at home with a slightly different clock with my audio recorded here and the discord.

41
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,068
Rym: We have that whole process.

42
00:02:44,128 --> 00:03:08,960
Rym: I talked about before, but no, that episode was within 50 milliseconds, uh, accuracy at any point as in 48 milliseconds, like difference between when you actually said the thing over the discord and when you said it in the audio that I lined up, because they're not exactly synchronized, uh, less than 50 milliseconds at the worst possible point in the entire episode, which a human could not even notice.

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,060
Rym: So then I, like, what if I exported and did something weird in the pipeline?

44
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:16,300
Rym: So I listened to the real episode on the actual Ibsen, it's also fine.

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,159
Rym: The only conclusion I can reach is that we did just talk over each other a bunch, but that's actually what we did.

46
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,378
Rym: That was what it sounded like when we did the show.

47
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:26,840
Scott: Such a high quality podcast.

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,879
Scott: I don't know why you listen to it.

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,100
Rym: Yeah, I think at this point it's just momentum.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,179
Rym: We are literally one of the longest running podcasts on earth.

51
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,815
Scott: Uh, I looked up recently to see who else is still out there.

52
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,800
Scott: that's been running long.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,270
Scott: We, uh, there's like the one I could find that was going.

54
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,220
Scott: the longest was in the girl one that I've heard of, but I don't know anything about other than that.

55
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:53,580
Scott: Presumed the hosts are a person named Keith and someone who's a girl who's named the girl.

56
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:54,176
Scott: I don't know.

57
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,560
Scott: I don't know anything about their show, but it's, it's long.

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,380
Scott: I think it's longer and has older, longer, still going and has more episodes.

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,144
Rym: I didn't say where.

60
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:05,660
Rym: the number one, but we're, we're definitely in like, I don't know, the 50 or a hundred old.

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:18,579
Scott: But the other thing is if you go and Google, right, and you look for old podcasts, you'll find like these lists, but the lists mostly have really popular ones that are like, you know, big and well known that have run long or had a lot of episodes.

62
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:20,540
Scott: But for example, right.

63
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:25,278
Scott: I know that they're comic geek speak who we haven't talked about cause I haven't listened to them in years.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,660
Scott: Right.

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,620
Scott: I listen to them back in the iPod days.

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,499
Rym: Memories just flooded back into my head.

67
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:30,140
Rym: Yeah.

68
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,299
Scott: They've been going longer than us.

69
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:39,240
Scott: They're still going, uh, and I don't know which of us has more episodes or more record time.

70
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:41,279
Scott: Uh, but that doesn't, who really cares?

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,484
Scott: Yeah.

72
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:50,980
Scott: But the point is none of the pot, like podcast lists have them on there because they're, you know, not, they're an obscure, you know, little thing, right?

73
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,758
Scott: A little, just like us.

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,971
Scott: Right.

75
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,180
Scott: You know, and there must be out there.

76
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,279
Scott: How many others are there out there like us?

77
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:02,800
Scott: Like, you know, comic geek speak and my world order, right?

78
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,640
Scott: About some other topic that we're not thinking about.

79
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,020
Scott: There could be some horse podcast or some, I don't know, butterfly.

80
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,820
Scott: I think of the animals, but like this is a flower podcast.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
Scott: What a flora, fauna, mineral.

82
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,840
Scott: So a geology podcast.

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,579
Scott: I don't fucking know.

84
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:17,820
Scott: Right.

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,960
Scott: Where it's been going on for a long ass time since iPod nanos or iPod minis.

86
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,220
Scott: And it's got a lot of episodes.

87
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,478
Scott: They never gave up on it.

88
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:31,440
Scott: And just know if you, no one, only people who listen to it know about it.

89
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:40,520
Scott: And if you say, what's the longest podcast, the only way you'll know is if one of those a hundred listeners happens to be in the chat at this point, the only data, cause like you said, there's no way to find this out.

90
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,938
Rym: The only thing I can really go on there is that we started pretty early and we are still around.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:56,840
Scott: I mean, if you go, if you go to a general podcast place and say, what's the longest running podcast or what are the top longest running podcasts?

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,199
Scott: You know, no one will say GeekNights cause no one knows about us.

93
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,819
Scott: Right.

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Scott: So there must be others like us who also, no one knows about.

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Rym: We got to go around and find like the oldest podcasts and then do an old podcasters convention.

96
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:24,080
Scott: The only way to do it would be, cause even if you were to scan, like if you, if you had access to like the iTunes podcast library, like backend, you could find all the podcasts that have like an episode that's old and an episode that's new.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,238
Scott: You could narrow it down.

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,613
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:33,040
Rym: But the RSS feeds have a limit on how many episodes we're, and we are the weird ones and that we keep like everything up forever.

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:43,518
Rym: Almost every long running podcast tries to make money and they sell access to their archives like PNE or I seen a bunch do that, but not all of them, but they just take old stuff down.

101
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,700
Rym: Like we're kind of weird.

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,599
Scott: Or someone stops maintaining or the podcast ends and people stop paying for it to be hosted and it just disappears.

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,158
Rym: Yup.

104
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:59,780
Rym: We're also in a weird boat because of, because of our old Libsyn deal, I don't know that we could afford to keep that archive up if we were not using this service.

105
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:05,540
Scott: We could migrate to another service, but the redirect thing would be a problem.

106
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:06,020
Rym: Yup.

107
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,700
Rym: Also the long tail of bandwidth.

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,060
Scott: Like it would be fine for anyone getting, you know, who wanted to like just go download episodes because the RSS would be updated.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:26,860
Scott: The website would be updated to new URLs, but you know, it probably wouldn't matter that much for the listener, but if there was any like old URL hanging out there, linking directly to the old Libsyn, that it would fail, right?

110
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:27,197
Scott: Yeah.

111
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,100
Scott: As soon as Libsyn closed our account.

112
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,980
Rym: So, but anyway, uh, I guess we'll just get right into it.

113
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,799
Rym: There is a bunch of news.

114
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:39,959
Rym: We, uh, I don't think we, I think we skipped a Wednesday show recently, uh, but we did do Sonic, but anyway, let's get right into it.

115
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,620
Rym: So in the news, there is a little bit of a tragedy.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,386
Rym: Uh, so the voice actor of, uh, Jigen Daisuke, Kiyoshi Kobayashi has passed away at 89, which 89, good job.

117
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,581
Rym: I hope that I make it to 89.

118
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:08,979
Scott: You know, some years ago, you know, the Lupin, cause Lupin was one of these interesting things where no matter how many TV shows, movies, et cetera, that they made, they just kept using the same voice actors right over and over.

119
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,799
Scott: And it wasn't until just a few years ago, right?

120
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,014
Scott: I remember, I think we did it as a news that they all sort of retired and stopped doing it cause they were all way old, right?

121
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,013
Scott: They've been doing that shit for like 30, 40 years.

122
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,821
Rym: Kiyoshi Kobayashi has been playing Jigen Daisuke since 1969.

123
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,791
Rym: He played that character for 52 years.

124
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:31,658
Scott: Yup.

125
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,291
Scott: Yeah.

126
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,672
Rym: And I feel like if he had not gotten pneumonia and become an old human, uh, our meat sacks only last, you know, 80 to 120 years at most.

127
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,900
Rym: I feel like he would have kept doing it forever.

128
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,220
Scott: Yeah, probably.

129
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
Scott: But yeah, much like, you know, at the Looney Tunes situation, right?

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,620
Scott: Or the Mickey Mouse situation.

131
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:56,040
Scott: It's like, yeah, they want to keep making cartoons with the same characters, but you know, the, the original goofy voice, like ain't around anymore.

132
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,560
Rym: Mel Blanc can't live forever.

133
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,493
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:58,920
Scott: Right.

135
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:11,000
Scott: So, but because it's such a huge, popular character, there are so many talented voice actors who can just do the character that it's, you know, they find they'll find the best person on earth who can get close enough.

136
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:11,279
Scott: Right.

137
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:22,240
Scott: And at the same time, it's, it's actually nice, you know, at least in my opinion, for the person to not just be a perfect imitation, um, bring their own thing, like a little bit of an update to the character.

138
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:22,940
Scott: Right.

139
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:29,039
Scott: If they use, if they get their own style in there a bit, they'll do a, they'll be actually more expressive, at least I think.

140
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,400
Rym: Well, kind of like how every bond, every bond is a little bit different.

141
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
Rym: They didn't just all try to be exactly like Sean Connery.

142
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:36,713
Scott: Yeah.

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,159
Scott: And then, you know, you can get different stuff and you know what, there might be someone who does it even better.

144
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,740
Scott: Right.

145
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,548
Rym: Yup.

146
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,423
Rym: And, but the cool, the other nuts thing is he was the last remaining original cast member in Lupin.

147
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:53,558
Rym: at this point, just prior to his retirement, he held out as long, longer than anyone.

148
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:53,906
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,959
Scott: Like I said, everyone else kind of retired.

150
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,319
Scott: But while they were all really old and they're like, all right, that's enough.

151
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:00,340
Scott: He's like, okay.

152
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,798
Rym: So in some huge and somewhat unnerving news, uh, we've talked about this.

153
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:13,300
Rym: half the news we've done for the last two weeks has been giant companies all merging together, like the consolidation of every industry.

154
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:19,240
Rym: And here we are again, Crunchyroll has closed a deal to acquire Right Stuff.

155
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,180
Scott: Right.

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,100
Scott: So, so if you don't know, there's a company called Right Stuff in the US, right?

157
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,600
Scott: And they're basically sort of like an anime retailer slash distributor slash licenser.

158
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:33,320
Scott: And they also had a side hidden brand for hentai stuff.

159
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
Rym: I mean, they've been around since what?

160
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,489
Rym: Like '87, '88, like they were around.

161
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,400
Scott: They've been around as long as anime has been around.

162
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:50,900
Scott: And like, if you were in the United States and you wanted to get anime, especially before the anime boom of the early two thousands, it's like, they had like mail order catalog.

163
00:10:51,081 --> 00:11:00,019
Rym: They were still like, was that the one that had the separate hentai section that was like, you could remove it from the catalog.

164
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:01,539
Scott: Yeah.

165
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,840
Scott: Uh, but like they also had a licensing arm.

166
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,740
Scott: They were licensing and subbing dubbing animes, right?

167
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,240
Scott: Releasing them on disc, you know, for themselves, I guess.

168
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:10,579
Scott: Right.

169
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:20,220
Scott: It's like they were a big important deal in, you know, United States anime industry and, you know, Funimation and Crunchyroll, the two streaming services.

170
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,440
Scott: Funimation is also a licenser, right?

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,240
Scott: It's Crunchyroll kind of also, and, you know, they came together and now you're bringing right stuff into all of the same company.

172
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:29,938
Scott: It's like, that's it.

173
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,856
Scott: That's US anime monopoly, right?

174
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:32,896
Scott: Game over.

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,651
Rym: And I'm waiting for Amazon to just buy the whole thing.

176
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,499
Scott: Yep.

177
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:45,940
Scott: It's like, all I can think about is like those mid two thousands Otakons where there were like so many US anime companies, right?

178
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:58,579
Rym: You know, there was that brief period where the, the expo hall at an anime con looked a little bit like what a PAX expo hall looks like today with like the cars and the Pika girls and all the nonsense.

179
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,238
Scott: But it's like there were just so many different anime companies all going at it, you know, and, and now there's just a lot less.

180
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,640
Scott: It's that as one, basically does disco tech off to the side being awesome, right?

181
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,278
Scott: With their getting the old stuff.

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,620
Rym: Yeah.

183
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:20,600
Scott: Meanwhile, G kid and his G kids coming through with the movies and then this funimation with like everything else.

184
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:20,780
Scott: I

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:38,899
Rym: wonder what this will mean now for my streaming, because when I look back at what anime I've watched recently, pretty much every anime I've watched that has not been in the theater has been on Netflix or has been from the high seas because it was from like a streaming service I wasn't paying for.

186
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,298
Rym: I actually haven't, I actually canceled my crunchy roll because I haven't watched anything on it in a while.

187
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:44,558
Scott: Mm hmm.

188
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,577
Rym: Despite being deep into anime still like, I don't know.

189
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,899
Scott: I might, you know, there might be some stuff I'm going to watch on there soon.

190
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,928
Rym: Crunchy roll is the kind of service I think.

191
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:59,220
Rym: finally, let's just make sure if whatever either one of us is going to sign up for it.

192
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:07,120
Rym: We agree to do it at the same time and watch as many like four episodes of the show so we can do a gig nights episode on them as we can before we shut that off again.

193
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,051
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,160
Scott: Well, we'll have to see what the pricing is like too.

195
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,600
Scott: Cause pricing on streaming services is going up everywhere.

196
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,917
Rym: Yup.

197
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,099
Rym: So, uh, we'll see.

198
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:23,179
Rym: This is not bode well for the anime industry in the longterm, but it'll probably be easier for fans of anime in the short term.

199
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,720
Scott: Well, it's, it's, you know, like we talked about it when funimation and crunchy roll merged, right?

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,460
Scott: It's like, it's good for fans because now you can just go to one streaming service, one stop shop.

201
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,020
Scott: There's everything is all there.

202
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,330
Scott: It's bad for fans cause.

203
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,440
Scott: well, it's like now you don't have a choice.

204
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,580
Scott: There's no competition.

205
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,279
Scott: They can drive prices up.

206
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,419
Scott: They can just control everything and you're not going to always like what they decide and then you're going to be stuck.

207
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,013
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:13:48,402 --> 00:14:00,340
Rym: So in some other news, you may remember a cute little show that Natasha Allegri put out long time ago, being puppy cat that had like a pilot and then like a short series.

209
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:05,520
Rym: So the for real being puppy cat, like the remake, the full deal.

210
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,620
Rym: We just got our trailer drop.

211
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,499
Rym: It's coming on Netflix.

212
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Rym: Cartoon Crave has got the trailer.

213
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,020
Scott: It's like we, we kickstarted this thing like a hundred years ago.

214
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,740
Rym: I went to the launch party.

215
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:16,959
Rym: Like I met Fred there.

216
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:17,871
Scott: Yeah.

217
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:23,869
Scott: And then they friggin, uh, you know, they released it and then they released it sort of again.

218
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:24,460
Scott: ish, right?

219
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,375
Scott: It was like a pilot and then it was a series, but it never really finished.

220
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:29,700
Scott: all the way kinda.

221
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:33,117
Scott: And it's like now they're giving it a third go or a fourth go.

222
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,569
Scott: I don't even know how many goes.

223
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,540
Scott: it's been at this point.

224
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:42,360
Rym: I'd say this would really just be the third go, but what's fascinating is if you watch the trailer comics, there's I'm pretty sure there's comics.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,499
Scott: There's all kinds of merchandise.

226
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,930
Scott: It's like, it's like there's just so.

227
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,519
Scott: it's like this thing is already a thing.

228
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:56,079
Scott: It's like, they're just like, okay, with an even bigger budget, we're going to just make the show again for real, for real, for real this time.

229
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,219
Rym: It's almost like I've never seen anything do it that way.

230
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,180
Rym: It's an interesting process.

231
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,840
Rym: Cause you sort of like with Steven Universe, there was that pilot that we all saw.

232
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,820
Rym: And then there was the real show, which looked very different.

233
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,580
Rym: That's the normal process, but it's interesting to get a pilot.

234
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:16,500
Rym: Then like a pilot series, like a second pilot that's longer.

235
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:21,920
Rym: And then the main thing, though, I don't think, I think that, I don't know what, you know, what had a pilot series.

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,159
Scott: It was, that was the series.

237
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:27,880
Rym: Well, but it didn't like fully flesh out or like explore everything.

238
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,438
Rym: Like it almost like touched on everything that was going to happen, but then just kind of stopped.

239
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,179
Rym: Like it didn't follow the plot that it had clearly set up.

240
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,200
Rym: But the original Star Trek had a little bit of a process like that.

241
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,479
Rym: If you look at how they actually made, they got that show going originally.

242
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:48,240
Rym: Many shows do have multiple rounds of pilots, but rarely do we get to see those pilots.

243
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:53,818
Rym: This is fun because we almost see like the evolution of this idea into ever increasingly polished forms.

244
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:59,520
Rym: But the trailer both shows that there is a real like show here with a lot of content.

245
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:00,659
Rym: Like there's a lot of new stuff.

246
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:10,660
Rym: Clearly it's going to be like, there's going to be something going on, but it specifically shows you the scenes from the original, uh, to remind you that it is still the same.

247
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,459
Rym: V and Puppycat she is still going to in the first episode hit Deckard in the nuts with her umbrella.

248
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:16,337
Scott: Yep.

249
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:26,379
Scott: Uh, I mean, yeah, there are, there, I think there have been series where they would start off with a pilot and then go to like a mini series that was so popular that they had to keep going.

250
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:27,220
Scott: Right.

251
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,979
Scott: That's happened quite a few times.

252
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:38,979
Rym: I'm actually pretty excited about this, especially considering, I don't know, it's one of those shows that raised a lot of interesting ideas and allegories, but then didn't finish them.

253
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,040
Scott: And I just like the aesthetic of the show.

254
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,960
Rym: I like the aesthetic and I like the, uh, the, the deep, probably this is going somewhere, Blade Runner, uh, analogies and references that are everywhere.

255
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,951
Scott: I'll wait until it is 100% done and then watch it at this point, you know, you know how it goes.

256
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:56,497
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,219
Rym: Uh, that all our news.

258
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,579
Rym: So, but anyway, things of the day.

259
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,839
Rym: So, uh, you know, I told my tale of how I bought a cheap roller blade break and it was basically just counterfeit.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,459
Rym: It was basically like a marker.

261
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,260
Rym: So I got real breaks now and skating again.

262
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,900
Rym: And I, uh, I stumbled upon just randomly while I was looking at like different kinds of breaks.

263
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,200
Rym: I was debating whether or not I wanted to get like a different kind of break for my or upgrade or mess with them since I had them out and taken apart anyway.

264
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:35,140
Rym: And I found a good video that is basically, uh, it's 15 things to make you a better skater.

265
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:35,918
Rym: And it's just this guy.

266
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:48,880
Rym: And he walks you through, like basically the exercises you would do if you already know how to roller blade, like you're already a decent rollerblader, but you want to get better at rollerblading specifically.

267
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,080
Rym: And, uh, these are the kinds of videos that I watch a lot for skiing.

268
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,460
Rym: And I used to watch a lot for mountain biking.

269
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,780
Rym: And despite the fact that I've rollerbladed my whole life, I never got lessons.

270
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
Rym: I never learned any formal tech.

271
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
Rym: I just rollerbladed, like never thought about it.

272
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,820
Scott: Where, where were there rollerblading lessons?

273
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,100
Rym: Uh, there were rollerblading lessons.

274
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,619
Rym: In fact, there was a rollerblading class in my high school you could take.

275
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:10,879
Scott: Wow.

276
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:11,299
Scott: Okay.

277
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:11,939
Scott: We didn't have that.

278
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,359
Scott: I mean, Michigan nineties, like it was, you could do at the roller rink, you could take roller skating class.

279
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,193
Scott: So that was it.

280
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,460
Scott: There are a lot of rollerblades at the roller rink.

281
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:20,837
Scott: Really?

282
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,760
Rym: Our roller rink banned regular roller skates.

283
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,200
Rym: Only rollerblades were allowed.

284
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,360
Scott: The roller rink was like, it's a place for dancing.

285
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,320
Scott: It's not a place for racing.

286
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,513
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Rym: That roller rink was people just skated in a circle.

288
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,059
Rym: Like no one wanted to dance.

289
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Scott: And yeah, people would, I mean, yeah, you could, most people skated in a circle cause they couldn't dance, but it was not a place for ice.

290
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,320
Scott: It was not a place for hockey and not a place for racing.

291
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,879
Rym: No, the roller rink, the roller rink I used to go to as a kid.

292
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:48,240
Rym: So regular skaters kept getting hit by people.

293
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,160
Rym: And like so often that they banned them from the place and it was rollerbladers only.

294
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:53,620
Scott: Okay.

295
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,260
Rym: But, um, I never thought about it.

296
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Rym: I just thought by rollerblade.

297
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,960
Rym: So this video, it's not like a video.

298
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,898
Rym: The reason I'm making this my thing of the day is that one of the best ways to learn something is to do it.

299
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:13,160
Rym: Uh, and a lot of tutorials online, like here is how to bike better or here's how to ski better.

300
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:17,360
Rym: They almost just show you like the technique of how to do a thing.

301
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:25,559
Rym: This video does the more enlightened way of it shows you here are weird things to try that will force you to get better.

302
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:34,675
Rym: Like it's an exercise that if you do, it will teach you something by doing the exercise as opposed to emulate what you see in this video to learn how to do the thing you see in the video.

303
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,440
Rym: That's how actually ski instruction usually goes.

304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,700
Rym: I just never seen this for rollerblading before.

305
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,440
Rym: And this video is actually pretty good.

306
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,240
Rym: And I'm going to try to do a bunch of these exercises because I'm an okay plater.

307
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:47,898
Rym: I'm not great.

308
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:57,880
Scott: So you got, uh, so one of these, uh, nerdy, you know, there's a nerdy thing that I don't do because I don't have a lot of space.

309
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,400
Scott: Uh, and that nerdy thing is jigsaw puzzles, right?

310
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,539
Scott: Have we done an episode on those?

311
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,079
Scott: We can make it.

312
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,600
Rym: If we haven't, that's going to be, I'm going to look that up right now.

313
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:06,658
Rym: That's a great episode.

314
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:08,800
Scott: We've done puzzles of other kinds.

315
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,720
Scott: I don't think we did jigsaw.

316
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,720
Rym: I think we can do a whole episode on jigsaw puzzles.

317
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,698
Scott: We might have.

318
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:13,500
Scott: It's possible.

319
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,820
Rym: We might have the backend while you explain your thing of the day.

320
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:18,119
Scott: But yeah.

321
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,740
Scott: Uh, you know, the ones I did as a kid, you know, we did, we have never done any episode that includes the word to jig in any capacity puzzle though.

322
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,679
Rym: So if I look for pus, we have done the solitaire puzzles and versus puzzle games.

323
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:34,678
Scott: Yeah.

324
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:39,755
Scott: But you know, I've always, you know, it's like, it's a nice relaxing thing to just like have around, right?

325
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:41,494
Scott: It's like when you got nothing to do, right.

326
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,418
Scott: Instead of poking the internet, it would be much better to do, just go sit by your jigsaw puzzle.

327
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:50,239
Scott: That's a much better use of your time than reading Twitter again.

328
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,280
Scott: If you got nothing else to do, but sit around your apartment, have it a puzzle out.

329
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:55,437
Scott: Pretty good.

330
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,000
Scott: You know, it's not the best, but it's, it's good.

331
00:20:58,927 --> 00:20:59,298
Scott: It's fun.

332
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,860
Scott: So, you know, but there are some puzzles.

333
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,939
Scott: It's like, I just don't have room to do them.

334
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,475
Scott: Oh yeah.

335
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,340
Rym: Like I have to, I live in an apartment in New York city.

336
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:12,720
Rym: If we want a table, I unfold a big table and guess what?

337
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,440
Rym: That table has got to be folded back the fuck up before long.

338
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Rym: Cause it is in the way.

339
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:17,420
Scott: Right.

340
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:39,639
Scott: And you know, you got to imagine in the year 2022 that there is some like, you know, really unique puzzles out there that didn't exist, you know, when my back in the day and sure enough, here's the YouTube video and a YouTube channel called Karen puzzles as a jigsaw puzzle specialist, YouTube channel and Karen puzzles gets the, uh, what is this?

341
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:44,821
Scott: 24,000 piece puzzle, 24,000.

342
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:47,140
Rym: I remember doing puzzles that were like, watch out.

343
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,849
Rym: This motherfucker's got 3000 pieces.

344
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,440
Scott: The short side is like five something feet long.

345
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,880
Scott: And the long side is like 14 feet long.

346
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:57,999
Scott: It's it's it's large.

347
00:21:58,248 --> 00:21:58,480
Scott: Right.

348
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,239
Scott: Um, what's disappoint.

349
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,500
Scott: What's obviously this is, you know, no small feet that, uh, this puzzle is completed in six parts and comes in six bags.

350
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:13,200
Scott: But I am disappointed in the fact that the six bags it's really.

351
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:15,127
Scott: Uh, 24,000 divided by six, four.

352
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:30,257
Scott: It's basically like, you know, six, 4,000 piece puzzles really that you then combine because each bag is well, but I would argue, I would point out that that is interesting and that it is.

353
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:35,913
Rym: It is an affordance to allow people who do not have a puzzle room to do this puzzle at all.

354
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:37,200
Scott: I agree.

355
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:44,700
Scott: But really it would be so epic to just, I mean, I guess there's nothing stopping you from buying this and just mixing all the bags together.

356
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,175
Scott: Oh, yeah.

357
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:47,737
Scott: It's not forcing you to do the puzzle.

358
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,239
Rym: I mean, I knew a guy in high school who was he would do puzzles, but he'd do them upside down and not try not to see what the image was till the end.

359
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,999
Rym: Like you get someone else to buy them for him.

360
00:22:57,862 --> 00:23:01,480
Scott: I mean, let's I'll save my story about that for when we do an episode on this topic.

361
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,739
Scott: But I just want to point out my epic six part YouTube video completing this thing.

362
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,480
Rym: I dug around and there seems to be some consensus.

363
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:20,360
Rym: So a five hundred piece jigsaw puzzle is expected to take an average person who is not like a jigsaw puzzle expert between two and seven hours.

364
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,459
Rym: A one thousand one, a one thousand piece puzzle will generally take someone five to twelve hours.

365
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,540
Rym: So one thousand five to twelve hours.

366
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,578
Rym: So twenty four times that times the complexity of it's probably not a linear progression as these get bigger.

367
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:45,220
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know, I could see knowing those times now I could see myself like do without one good.

368
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,120
Scott: I guess I'll just save all these things or we do an episode on it.

369
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,130
Rym: But this video is great, especially the.

370
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:58,060
Rym: the top comment says everything you need to know about these videos, quote, find someone that hypes you as much as Karen hypes this puzzle.

371
00:23:58,683 --> 00:23:59,178
Scott: That's right.

372
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Rym: The sheer joy of this puzzle building.

373
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:13,720
Rym: I even if there is a hobby that I don't particularly enjoy myself, there is something infectious about watching someone who loves the shit out of their hobby no matter what it is, unless it's something evil like being a Nazi.

374
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,240
Scott: I mean, I like I you know, I hate cars.

375
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,819
Rym: I want to remove all cars from Earth, but I watch a channel that is just a mechanic being awesome about fucking with old cars.

376
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,920
Scott: Like I did a thing of the day on Transmission Guy.

377
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,389
Scott: Yeah.

378
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,740
Scott: Yeah.

379
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:30,539
Rym: In the moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is Binti.

380
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:34,380
Rym: I expect we will do the show on Thursday unless Scott somehow has not read this book.

381
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,719
Rym: Scott, there is no way this will take you more than 45 minutes to read.

382
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,560
Scott: It's not about finishing.

383
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,480
Scott: It's about starting.

384
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,060
Rym: Well, we'll see what we do this weekend.

385
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,920
Rym: But I suspect you can finish this book.

386
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,679
Rym: We'll do it in the next.

387
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,780
Rym: If we don't do it Thursday, we got to absolutely do it the following Thursday.

388
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,840
Rym: Mostly, I just want you to pick your next book so then we can begin the gambit choice that we're going to do going forward.

389
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:00,540
Scott: I told no, I have no ideas right now, so I got to come up with a gambit.

390
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,620
Rym: I revealed somewhere.

391
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:04,319
Rym: I will not say where.

392
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,119
Rym: What the two choices I'm going to put forth for you are.

393
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,620
Rym: And the feedback I got was quotes.

394
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:12,700
Rym: That will be delightful.

395
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Rym: I'll bet he picks X. Obviously, the book is not called X, though.

396
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,880
Rym: That would be funny.

397
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:19,840
Rym: I cannot reveal.

398
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,539
Rym: It'll be funny.

399
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:23,700
Rym: I do want to read both of these books, so I'm fine either way.

400
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,796
Rym: I'll be alive at PAX West Sunday, September 4th, 12 30 p.m.

401
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,260
Rym: Pacific Time in the Sasquatch Theater, which is on the second floor of the Sheraton.

402
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:35,251
Rym: Losing, there is a decent chance.

403
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:43,859
Rym: Scott and I will be at PAX Unplugged at least doing a panel or two, because that is that con is like an hour drive from here, even if we don't stay to do anything else.

404
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,879
Scott: We'll see what the state of the world is then.

405
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:51,274
Rym: I mean, I will pretty much definitely be there doing a panel unless I'm physically prevented from doing it.

406
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:55,179
Rym: But we'll see what the odds are at us with the world will be like that.

407
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:56,537
Rym: That's not that far away.

408
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,880
Rym: Well, and I'll see websites coming along.

409
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,218
Rym: I think we don't have any planned disruptions coming up for the foreseeable future and get right into the main bit.

410
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,440
Scott: The main bit is, you know, which all right.

411
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:16,200
Scott: So yeah, years ago, right, it was announced.

412
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,800
Rym: I got to find the episode where we like we found out there was a rumor he was making a new movie and we were like, oh, right.

413
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,724
Scott: It's like there was.

414
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:29,400
Scott: there was like, you know, Masaaki Yuasa, Saenzaru was making a new movie, or at least we knew they were going to make another movie.

415
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,570
Scott: Right.

416
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,480
Scott: But the next movie was called Inuo, and we didn't know much about it at all, other than that's what it was called.

417
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,120
Scott: And there was like an image like, you know, a like a prototype of the movie poster.

418
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,259
Scott: And we knew absolutely nothing about it.

419
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,420
Scott: More recently.

420
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:44,240
Scott: Right.

421
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,820
Scott: An actual movie trailer came out very recently.

422
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:57,160
Rym: And I actually have that movie trailer up because I wanted to quote it right now because the trailer actually describes what genre this movie is in perfectly.

423
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,220
Rym: I'm just going to read this from William Bibbiani at the wrap.

424
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,577
Rym: The best feudal Japanese hair metal demonic curse serial killer political tragedy rock opera of the year.

425
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:12,000
Rym: Yeah, pretty much it is that that is what this movie is.

426
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,980
Scott: So yeah, that's when we saw the real trailer.

427
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,660
Scott: That's when he figured out what the movie was like, which is not at all what I expected.

428
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:39,059
Scott: But yeah, we got to see it because the Japan Center in New York City, a fine institution, got to have the East Coast premiere of the movie ahead of the more general G Kids release in the United States.

429
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,719
Scott: So everyone else is going to be able to see this movie, at least in the United States.

430
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:51,959
Scott: on G Kids website says August 12th, two days from now.

431
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,120
Scott: And I guess maybe one day if you're listening to this tomorrow.

432
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,159
Scott: Whereas we saw it like last week.

433
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,470
Rym: Yep.

434
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,400
Rym: Now what I will say before we go any further, we will avoid spoiling anything until the end of the episode, of course.

435
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,360
Scott: But I know we say I think there's not much I can say without spoil.

436
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,816
Rym: We'll argue when we're going to start like spoiling stuff because there are some things I want to discuss.

437
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:13,638
Rym: Yeah, but I'll say this.

438
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,780
Rym: We know we always say if there's an anime movie and we talk about it on GeekNights and it's not just a sequel to an existing long running anime franchise.

439
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,499
Rym: If you're even like partially an anime fan, just watch it.

440
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:26,759
Rym: There aren't that many.

441
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,746
Rym: They're usually.

442
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:28,999
Rym: they're usually very good.

443
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,859
Scott: I have even if it's not the best.

444
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,500
Scott: Right.

445
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,723
Scott: Even if it's kind of so.

446
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:41,519
Scott: so if there is an anime movie with an original story, it's not just Pokemon, the movie, one piece, the movie.

447
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:42,239
Scott: Right.

448
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,200
Scott: It's nothing like that that you just go see it because there aren't that many of them.

449
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,440
Scott: You can see them all.

450
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,019
Scott: There's only a handful a year.

451
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:51,719
Scott: Right.

452
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:56,079
Scott: And even if they're and they usually have some merit that makes it worth your 90 minutes.

453
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,220
Scott: It's not like investing in a whole TV series.

454
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:01,860
Scott: And so you know, just on that alone.

455
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:07,699
Scott: Yes, you should see it because of those same reasons, because it is also an original story anime movie.

456
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:12,260
Rym: So with this one, I'm going to go further and say, just go see it.

457
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,080
Rym: Don't even read anything else about it.

458
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,100
Rym: Just go see it, because it is a ride.

459
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,596
Rym: I haven't seen a movie like it.

460
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,399
Scott: I'm going to go even further than that.

461
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:21,717
Scott: Right.

462
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,879
Scott: I don't want to I don't want to go too far.

463
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:24,518
Scott: Right.

464
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:36,609
Scott: But I will say of I went through and I looked at all the original, you know, full length feature anime movies that have come out over the years because I've seen almost most of them.

465
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:37,259
Scott: Right.

466
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:37,618
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,118
Scott: The vast majority of them.

468
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:54,440
Scott: And I think in order to find one that I like more than Inoue based on only a one viewing judgment, I think you have to go back to Paprika and like two thousand whatever.

469
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,990
Rym: I mean, I'm going back to like Bell was in spittin.

470
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,357
Scott: distance is the night is short.

471
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,860
Rym: Walk on Girl is definitely close up there.

472
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:04,640
Scott: Yeah.

473
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:05,620
Scott: Those are way up there.

474
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,031
Scott: But I think, you know, I Lou over the wall, you know, actually, you know, to the how many?

475
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,039
Rym: How many Masaki Yuasa's did I just list there?

476
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,132
Scott: One.

477
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,519
Scott: Well, Inoue was one and Walk on Girl is the other one.

478
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:17,917
Rym: Yeah.

479
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:19,539
Rym: Ride your wave.

480
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:20,820
Scott: Bell is hosted.

481
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,340
Scott: So is there any hosted a movie that you like more than Inoue?

482
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,660
Scott: Do you like Summer Wars more than Inoue?

483
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:27,638
Rym: I don't think I do.

484
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,408
Rym: Bell.

485
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:29,244
Rym: I liked.

486
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:32,099
Rym: I liked a lot, though, where I was really good.

487
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:34,172
Scott: But but it's like I don't like.

488
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:34,555
Scott: I like.

489
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:35,300
Scott: those are great.

490
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:36,840
Scott: I don't like any of them more than that.

491
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:37,218
Scott: Like Inoue.

492
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,057
Scott: Is there any Makoto Shinkai thing you like more than Inoue?

493
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:41,560
Rym: You see, it's been a while.

494
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,519
Rym: I guess I'd have to watch the one that made me cry the hardest with you.

495
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,720
Rym: Place from his early days of all his works made me cry the hardest.

496
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,139
Rym: But that was a long time ago.

497
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:54,220
Rym: I got to see if Old Man Rym will still cry to that amount.

498
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,357
Scott: Right.

499
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:06,899
Scott: But I'm saying is like, you know, of the of the newer anime directors that are active right now that are putting out the movies, the ones that get a G Kids release and a guaranteed night's episode, those right Miyazaki.

500
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:07,821
Scott: It's like.

501
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,700
Scott: what Miyazaki movie do you like better than Inoue?

502
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:23,140
Rym: Oh, I mean, I as a weirdo almost want to say The Wind Rises, but I very specifically like what that movie was doing.

503
00:31:23,523 --> 00:31:25,720
Rym: But then I have to start differentiating movie.

504
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,420
Rym: I like on this intellectual allegorical level versus movie.

505
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,620
Scott: I enjoy watching and there are Miyazaki movies I like more than Inoue.

506
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,999
Scott: I like Lapita more than Inoue.

507
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,125
Rym: I like my favorite still.

508
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:41,377
Scott: I like Spirited Away more than I like Inoue.

509
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:43,310
Scott: It's easy, easy.

510
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,399
Scott: Totoro's better than Inoue.

511
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:44,797
Scott: Right.

512
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:45,780
Scott: It was an easy call.

513
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:49,480
Scott: I guess what I'll say is this delivery service I like more than Inoue.

514
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,347
Rym: Those are all old.

515
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,560
Scott: Those are all older than Paprika.

516
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:59,039
Rym: But you know, that movies like it takes a really good movie to do this.

517
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:03,437
Rym: This movie just sucked me in and that I forgot.

518
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,000
Rym: I was in the theater.

519
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,100
Rym: I was completely immersed.

520
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,900
Rym: And when the movie ended, it was a moment of, oh, shit, I'm in the real world.

521
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,535
Rym: Right.

522
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,794
Scott: But also, right.

523
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:20,462
Scott: The point summary, I think this is my favorite anime movie since 2006 and maybe the best since 2006.

524
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:23,959
Scott: I can't say that for sure right now, but I'm leaning that way.

525
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,260
Rym: Go see this movie.

526
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:36,260
Rym: And if you can safely go see it in a theater because that bit in the trailer about it being a rock opera, it is a rock opera.

527
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:44,280
Rym: I want to go back and see how many minutes of screen time are a song versus not a song because I feel like that number is really high.

528
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,360
Rym: The movie didn't just suck me in like a good movie does in the movie.

529
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:56,620
Rym: It is you basically get characters telling an ancient tale to you via music in the context of the movie.

530
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,740
Rym: That is itself a tale.

531
00:32:58,123 --> 00:32:59,980
Rym: And I wasn't just sucked into the movie.

532
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:07,300
Rym: I was sucked into the tale they were telling in the movie to the point that when we got home, I read the entire fucking Wikipedia article.

533
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,940
Rym: Unlike the Heike clan and what the hell happened in this battle.

534
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:10,520
Scott: Yep.

535
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,500
Scott: Well, so, yeah, exactly.

536
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,009
Scott: I think that's really I was going to.

537
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:23,599
Scott: when we start talking about spoilers, I was going to talk about how this movie tells, like, several stories like that are all layered on top of each other.

538
00:33:24,061 --> 00:33:30,380
Scott: But that element, I think, is the core element in that the plot is about.

539
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:31,180
Scott: Right.

540
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:40,720
Scott: These characters are trying to tell these ancient forgotten stories so that they are remembered within the movie.

541
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:47,280
Scott: But what's really happening is that exact same thing is happening in the meta.

542
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,480
Scott: Masaki Yuasa is the characters telling us the real audience, the stories.

543
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:03,080
Scott: So that they're remembered right via a story about someone trying to do what he is successfully doing.

544
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:04,240
Scott: Right.

545
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:09,978
Scott: So that meta element, which we've seen a lot of lately, or at least, you know, is in a lot of things.

546
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,333
Scott: Period is working in sort of a new way.

547
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:31,639
Scott: I haven't seen that exact layering element before where you depict somebody doing something to achieve a goal, while the artwork, the movie itself is somebody else achieving the goal that is depicted.

548
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,219
Scott: Right.

549
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:46,078
Scott: Like if I'm it would be like if I was trying to stop climate change and somehow I succeeded by making a movie in which there is a person trying to stop climate change and the movie successfully stops climate change.

550
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,179
Rym: And it's like and especially with the end, like what happens in the very beginning and the very end of the movie.

551
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,840
Rym: And without spoilers, this movie does that thing.

552
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:01,660
Rym: And you picked up on it, too, where it shows you a scene and then the movie kind of starts and everyone watching the movie forgets about that scene.

553
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:22,100
Rym: And then the very end, just when you think, wait a minute, what it comes back to that scene and the movie, one of the big themes it has is the contiguous connection of humans telling their stories over the course of history and how that thread is still alive for things that are terrifyingly ancient and forgotten.

554
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,280
Rym: Like there's always this thread.

555
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:26,300
Rym: There's always this echo of memory that survives.

556
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:32,259
Rym: Even when memories and ideas are repressed, it's very hard to destroy human knowledge.

557
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:37,280
Rym: And even though we'll lose big swatches of it, like these pieces still remain.

558
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Rym: So what is it like to watch this movie?

559
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:43,487
Rym: A little bit into it, and I would.

560
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:47,959
Rym: this is not really a spoiler, but the movie starts starts telling a pretty good story.

561
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,980
Rym: And then a song starts in the movie.

562
00:35:52,561 --> 00:36:04,778
Rym: The character starts playing a song and then the movie almost turns into a sort of montage of songs being performed by those characters that span years and years and years and years and years.

563
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,819
Rym: And that song doesn't stop for a long time.

564
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:10,900
Rym: Very much like a rock opera.

565
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,820
Rym: Trying to think of what else I can say without, let's see, the music's great.

566
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:23,219
Rym: The music is varied to the point that every stage of the music in the show is a completely different style.

567
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,040
Rym: The animation is phenomenal.

568
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:30,440
Rym: The animation of the characters dancing is off the wall.

569
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:36,781
Rym: And I don't know what else I could really say other than go watch this movie unless we.

570
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:40,740
Scott: only other non-spoiler thing, right, is that you have the music.

571
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:42,295
Scott: Who are the two?

572
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,659
Scott: The two rock singers they got?

573
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,322
Rym: No, we got.

574
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:46,984
Rym: we got.

575
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:51,220
Rym: we got you know himself and we got the blind kid Tomona.

576
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,320
Scott: Well, no, but the actual the actual human being.

577
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:55,459
Rym: Oh, the band.

578
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:55,938
Rym: Oh, God.

579
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,858
Rym: I don't have any of that open.

580
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,708
Scott: Here we go.

581
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,455
Scott: Avu Chan and Mariah Moriyama.

582
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:03,918
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,300
Scott: So Avu Chan was the lead vocalist and songwriter of the band Queen B in 2009.

584
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,899
Scott: I'm reading this on Wikipedia, if you didn't know.

585
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:16,213
Scott: And the band Goku Monto Ika in 2015.

586
00:37:16,213 --> 00:37:16,400
Scott: Right.

587
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,659
Scott: And that's the person who is the the voice of Inuo.

588
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:25,055
Scott: And then Mariah Moriyama is.

589
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,380
Scott: it just says Japanese act.

590
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,020
Scott: Oh, they were like a musical person.

591
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,699
Scott: They were in the Japanese version of Rent and such.

592
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,859
Rym: So kind of like how in Carol and Tuesday you have a musical act that is also the actors like doing the show or doing them.

593
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:40,400
Rym: This is a very similar thing.

594
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:49,620
Rym: You've got these two musicians playing these like doing this music in the context of this story about two musicians making music.

595
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:50,496
Scott: Mm hmm.

596
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,739
Rym: So we're going to spoil stuff.

597
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:55,680
Rym: I feel like we have to to talk about this movie.

598
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,839
Rym: I honestly just go see it as soon as you can.

599
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,439
Rym: But Warren, we're going to start spoiling things as we go on.

600
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:04,900
Rym: There's a few shocking moments that happen that are worth addressing.

601
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,639
Rym: But I think this movie will be equally compelling, even if you know exactly what's going to happen.

602
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:15,060
Scott: So the thing like I was saying before, this movie is several stories.

603
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:15,840
Scott: Right.

604
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,859
Scott: All told, like on top of each other.

605
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,050
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,476
Scott: Right.

607
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,660
Rym: On one story, there's a little bit of a of an Amadeus story, like a little bit.

608
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:29,200
Rym: There's there's a Mozart, Salieri, even though that is a very facile comparison.

609
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:32,740
Rym: It's more funny to say it that way than to actually line it up one to one.

610
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:34,787
Rym: But there's definitely the story of.

611
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:45,339
Rym: there is the senior respected musician, but then the world gravitates toward this upstart who he doesn't like because it's stealing his thunder and he wants revenge.

612
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:46,659
Scott: Yep.

613
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:55,960
Scott: Well, and then the band, the upstart band, right, has its own story of, you know, the typical rock band story of, you know, people get together, form a rock band.

614
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,080
Scott: They're fucking legends.

615
00:38:57,361 --> 00:39:05,000
Scott: They take the world by storm and one of them sells out and one of them is in it for the music and, you know, the true artist.

616
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:06,799
Scott: And it doesn't go well for them.

617
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,640
Scott: It's like that's a classic tale.

618
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,820
Rym: You've also got the tale of the music they make is new.

619
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:26,259
Rym: They have made a new scene and that scene threatens the existing political order to the point that the government represses it, which is also a tale that has happened in the real world time and time again.

620
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,209
Scott: Yep.

621
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:32,960
Scott: You have the tale, the sort of folk tale of a someone who is cursed.

622
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,560
Scott: Right.

623
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,960
Scott: And is, you know, disabled, disfigured in some way.

624
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:41,840
Scott: It's it's somewhat similar to a Tezuka's Dororo.

625
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:43,618
Rym: Ah, I was going to bring that up.

626
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:50,719
Scott: Where the guy's born with like nothing because because of a deal with like what was like a whole bunch of demons.

627
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,064
Scott: Right.

628
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,879
Scott: Same kind of deal.

629
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:01,700
Scott: There was a, you know, many, you know, there was a deal with demons that results in a person being born with not the greatest body.

630
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:10,560
Scott: And then by doing certain things, they are able to, you know, get their body to be, you know, quote, you know, normal.

631
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,895
Scott: But there's also it's a tale of, you know, disability and, you know.

632
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:26,420
Rym: Well, for both of them, because you have you have a disfigured social outcast and you have someone who is blinded in an incident when they were a child and they come together.

633
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,640
Rym: And these two disabled people form the greatest rock band in Japanese history.

634
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:36,560
Rym: But you've also got the story of two societal outcasts.

635
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:42,320
Scott: Also the common trope of, you know, the sort of disfigured person and the blind person.

636
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:42,620
Scott: Right.

637
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,471
Scott: They don't judge them because they can't see them.

638
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,880
Scott: kind of deal that happens a lot.

639
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:59,159
Rym: You have got a demon story where the current court musician made a deal with a demon to get the secret tales so he could have unique music and he could bring something to an existing music scene that no one else had.

640
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:08,719
Rym: But the deal he made was he gave up one of his sons and the demon took his son and made this son into the musical genius that would destroy him.

641
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:15,384
Rym: And there's a whole serial killer murder plot there that turns into an allegorical story of.

642
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,800
Rym: there was no demon.

643
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:25,560
Rym: He was just a fucking serial killer who was also trying to cover up anyone who could compete with his music for the court for his court job, basically.

644
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:26,599
Rym: Yep.

645
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,860
Rym: Then you've got the political story of the Heike clan was destroyed.

646
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,680
Scott: And so we got to talk about the Heike clan here.

647
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:34,912
Scott: Right.

648
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,911
Scott: You know, I think the movie does.

649
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:47,379
Scott: perhaps one of the only negative things I can say about it is that if you know absolutely nothing about the tale of the Heike, then you might be a little confused at the movie.

650
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,700
Scott: You have to at least know a tiny amount.

651
00:41:51,060 --> 00:42:03,620
Scott: I know a tiny amount, even though a woodblock depicting a famous part of the tale of the Heike has been above my bed for like, you know, basically.

652
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:13,460
Scott: I think as also the Japan Society, ironically enough, just, I guess, coincidentally, I don't know, like 2010, we went to the Japan Society and there's a woodblock print exhibition.

653
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:17,279
Rym: That is where I learned everything that I know off the top of my head about this.

654
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:18,220
Scott: Right.

655
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:23,459
Scott: And so I'm looking at all the wood blocks and the one that I was drawn to the most was this one.

656
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:26,940
Scott: And in it is a depiction of a scene from the tale of the Heike.

657
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:31,480
Scott: And I ordered like, you know, an MFA fancy high quality print of it.

658
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:32,799
Scott: And I framed it and I put it up.

659
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:42,540
Scott: So the basic story is that in the thing about the tale, the Heike is that it's not completely fake and it's not completely real.

660
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,459
Scott: It's a thing that actually happened.

661
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,708
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,480
Scott: There is archaeological evidence.

663
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:47,279
Scott: This is real.

664
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:47,636
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Rym: Well, there was that there we know there was a court drama.

666
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:50,399
Rym: There was a coup.

667
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,579
Rym: This was like late Hayen.

668
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,400
Scott: Like, so like this is like eleven hundreds, the 12th century.

669
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:55,900
Scott: This happened.

670
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,076
Rym: Yeah.

671
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,300
Rym: So towards the end of the era depicted in the tale of Genji, the tale is a real thing that happened.

672
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:06,478
Scott: But the stories surrounding it because of, you know, it's like how much real info do we have?

673
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Scott: It's not like they had cameras then have become like a fantastic tale over time.

674
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:13,160
Scott: Right.

675
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,359
Scott: Thanks to fictional retellings, you know, oral tradition, literary tradition, etc.

676
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,419
Scott: But what you need to know about the story is that at the time, Japan was split in two.

677
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:25,954
Scott: Right.

678
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,140
Scott: There was basically a Shogun in the north and a Shogun in the south.

679
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,286
Scott: Right.

680
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:33,759
Scott: And one of them, the north one, I think, was the Heike.

681
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,500
Scott: Right.

682
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,120
Scott: And Emily told me the reason that they have two names is because the Kanji, the character for Heike can also be read as Tyra.

683
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,354
Scott: So a lot of times you'll see the Tyra clan instead of the Heike, but they're the same thing.

684
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:51,959
Scott: And in the south was the Matsumoto, I think.

685
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:52,552
Scott: Right.

686
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:58,420
Scott: Which also known as Genji, interestingly enough, was the other clan.

687
00:43:59,151 --> 00:43:59,400
Scott: Right.

688
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,319
Scott: And so these two clans were at war.

689
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:03,000
Scott: Right.

690
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,559
Scott: You know, they weren't friendly with each other.

691
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,497
Scott: Little Hatfield McCoy situation.

692
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:07,620
Scott: Right.

693
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,660
Scott: Because who was going to actually rule all of Japan?

694
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:10,020
Scott: Right.

695
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,886
Scott: It was split into.

696
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,140
Scott: there should be one emperor, one Shogun, whatever.

697
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:13,700
Scott: Right.

698
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,698
Scott: You know, that kind of deal.

699
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:21,040
Scott: And I came to a head at this battle, the Battle of Dan-no-ura.

700
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,617
Scott: Right.

701
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,820
Scott: Which was Dan-no-ura is basically, you know, the south island in Japan.

702
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:26,799
Scott: What's the name of that island?

703
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,300
Scott: But basically in between that island.

704
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:29,673
Scott: Right.

705
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,940
Scott: And the big Japan island.

706
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,059
Scott: The long one is like a little straight.

707
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:38,219
Scott: And that's where they had a naval battle there.

708
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,194
Scott: And that naval battle was basically the decisive battle between the Heike and the other ones.

709
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:48,899
Scott: And the Heike did not win.

710
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,320
Scott: They were exterminated and they took their treasures down to the bottom of the sea.

711
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:56,040
Scott: Like the, you know, the right.

712
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,811
Scott: They were like, that's it.

713
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:04,280
Scott: And so it's not one of those stories where it's like, you know, one was evil and one was good.

714
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,539
Scott: It was like there were just two of them.

715
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:07,300
Scott: Right.

716
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:09,260
Scott: And this one won and that one lost.

717
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,640
Scott: It's not like, ah, the evil Heike or the right.

718
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:16,260
Scott: And so that's right in over time.

719
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: Right.

720
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:26,860
Scott: You had the sort of legendary status thing going on with the Heike crabs where in that area, because it was a naval battle, there are crabs because crabs live everywhere.

721
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,400
Scott: They're the ultimate evolutionary existence.

722
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,660
Rym: I think we both watched that video.

723
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,550
Scott: Yeah.

724
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:42,460
Scott: And some of the crabs looked like, uh, you know, the shape of the crab was somewhat similar to a, you know, a samurai face, you know, something.

725
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:42,738
Scott: Right.

726
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:47,500
Scott: And so the fishermen in that area believed that this is true.

727
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:52,940
Scott: They believed that those are like the dead Heike were, you know, coming back as crabs.

728
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,479
Scott: Right.

729
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:58,920
Scott: So when the crabs looked like samurai too much, they would throw them over.

730
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:00,999
Scott: They wouldn't take those ones.

731
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,720
Rym: And so due to the evolution, I read up on that that night as well.

732
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,320
Rym: There is no possibility that there was any selection pressure.

733
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:11,818
Rym: They have always just looked like that.

734
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,819
Scott: Oh, they've always just looked like that.

735
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:14,900
Rym: Yeah, I read.

736
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,940
Rym: I read a lot at the night after we watched that movie, but it's, I guess it's interesting that the legend was still there.

737
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,186
Rym: Oh, yeah.

738
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Rym: A bunch of samurai died here in a battle and their clan was dispersed.

739
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,320
Rym: And there are rumors of like Heike holdouts that we never found.

740
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:30,680
Scott: They literally call them Heike crabs.

741
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,180
Scott: That's the name of the crab.

742
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,700
Rym: You're some fishermen and you know, like this epic samurai battle happened here and they all died and there's probably ghosts.

743
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,280
Rym: And then you go fishing and a bunch of crab that looked like samurai come up.

744
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,768
Rym: You would definitely believe that there was a connection and it would be hard to follow you.

745
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,840
Scott: I zoomed in on Google maps and I can even see on Google maps here.

746
00:46:49,962 --> 00:46:51,160
Scott: Dan Noura Battlefield.

747
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:53,120
Scott: So there's clearly his pictures, right?

748
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,360
Scott: It's like there's definitely some touristy shit you can see down there if you go.

749
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:05,900
Rym: But I guess the important thing you need to know in the movie, which is just simply that the Heike lost the battle and lost the war effectively.

750
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,460
Scott: So and now the other the other group, you know, now rules Japan.

751
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:17,500
Rym: So history was written by the winners and knowledge of what the Heike were about, what they're up to was generally suppressed.

752
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:26,500
Rym: So you basically in the movie, you have the situation where there's the one dude, the Salieri, who is the one who's allowed to tell tales about the Heike.

753
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:27,478
Rym: Nobody else is.

754
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:53,440
Rym: And depending on how you read the movie, either a demon told him those stories to tell or he's telling false tales or tales that he made up or collected in some way on his own, probably unethically, especially if you read into that thing with the regalia and the sword and why the kid was blinded in the beginning, which clearly was him sending people out to like find these artifacts and consolidate his victory and destroy knowledge of the Heike.

755
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,120
Rym: There's a lot going on there.

756
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,959
Rym: We'll get into in a minute.

757
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:04,259
Rym: So then suddenly, you know, and this up like this upstart band just start singing new stories about the Heike.

758
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,530
Scott: And yeah, there's these stories, right?

759
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:13,540
Scott: So there's Biwa monks, right?

760
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:16,800
Scott: And basically, you know, they're a real thing also, right?

761
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,900
Scott: They're monks who play the Biwa, an instrument that was also in the tale of Genji, right?

762
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:25,139
Scott: Once you see a Biwa or hear one, you'll know what it is.

763
00:48:25,561 --> 00:48:26,660
Scott: Yeah, it's a musical instrument.

764
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:33,499
Scott: And so these monks who are blind would travel around playing the Biwa, telling stories to get money and survive, right?

765
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:35,640
Scott: Often together in groups for safety.

766
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:36,914
Scott: But like they were a thing.

767
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,918
Scott: And so in the movie, they're depicted going around, right?

768
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,740
Scott: To try to talk to people who were around in the Heike times or have been passed down.

769
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:54,399
Scott: You know, it's like they'll visit small villages and be like, Hey, has anyone here have any Heike stories that have been orally passed down?

770
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:55,480
Scott: Teach me them.

771
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,840
Scott: And then I'll take them around and teach them to other people so that they're not forgotten.

772
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:20,019
Rym: So it's interesting if I have this one reading, I think on the beginning is, you know, we see that they basically the imperial people come to the town and they hire local divers to go try to find artifacts from the battle because they're looking for the regalia and they find the cursed sword and the sword blinds the kid and kills the dead.

773
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:26,780
Rym: It is easy to read that literally if you take the demon that we see later as literal.

774
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,920
Rym: It's also easy to read that as an allegory.

775
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,740
Rym: And like, that's what the kid remembers.

776
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:31,999
Rym: Like, that's the last thing he saw.

777
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:41,058
Rym: But really, maybe the emperor saw, I guess, the Shogun in this case, because it was a as far as I can tell, I'm not super up on late.

778
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,720
Rym: Hey, there is a Shogun.

779
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:58,500
Rym: Yeah, but might have been sending imperial emissaries down to find that regalia because it is important to solidifying the rule and also maybe killing anyone who knows too much about exactly what happened in the Heike and suppressing the knowledge of the rival faction.

780
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:06,860
Rym: So maybe imperial troops came and just blinded the kid and murdered the dad and the kid remembered it as the cursed sword related to the Heike themselves.

781
00:50:07,368 --> 00:50:07,978
Scott: Yeah, could be.

782
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:15,912
Scott: I mean, you know, if you think like, again, the wood block that I have, right, what it depicts is the sort of after the battle, right?

783
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,600
Scott: You know, Yoshitsune, who is in charge of the other clan, the one that's not the Minamoto.

784
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:24,820
Scott: That's what it is, right?

785
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:26,420
Scott: Did I say Matsumoto?

786
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:27,438
Rym: You did, I think.

787
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,480
Rym: I can go back and listen.

788
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,849
Scott: Minamoto clan is the one that's not.

789
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,360
Scott: the was the one that won, right?

790
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:33,899
Scott: And the leader was Yoshitsune, right?

791
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,199
Scott: And that the Shogun and then also Benkei, the warrior monk, was on that team as well.

792
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:40,959
Scott: Another legendary figure.

793
00:50:42,362 --> 00:50:45,140
Scott: But it depicts after the battle, right?

794
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:51,796
Scott: They're sailing somewhere and it's like the ghosts of the Heike are coming to haunt their asses, right?

795
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,517
Scott: Like, you know, make it, fuck it up the water Poseidon style, being like, ooh.

796
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,480
Rym: I mean, part of what the Biwa priests were all about is placate all those angry ghosts.

797
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:01,920
Scott: Exactly.

798
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:11,380
Scott: So it's like every time I see a Heike story of some kind, it's like that theme is there somehow where it's like, it's not about the Heike.

799
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,960
Scott: You know, I mean, there is an anime tale of the Heike that's on crunchy roll right now.

800
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:15,975
Scott: that I presume tells.

801
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:20,280
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to watch it at some point, but I presume it tells the actual story.

802
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:31,040
Scott: But almost every time I've seen the Heike story come up in some other work, it's always about somehow relating to the Heike coming back to haunt, right?

803
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:34,060
Scott: Or, you know, revenge beyond the grave.

804
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,840
Scott: And Inoue is another example of that, right?

805
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,853
Rym: And think about everything we said earlier about what this movie is about, like all the different ways to read it, all the different stories it tells that all overlap with each other.

806
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,418
Rym: They all together are tied.

807
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,938
Rym: They're tied together specifically just by this root story of these people were real people who lived and died.

808
00:51:54,241 --> 00:52:00,219
Rym: That not memory of them was suppressed like their clan, just like the kid with his dad, like his dad's ghost is telling him, man, tell my story.

809
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:01,097
Rym: Get revenge.

810
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,397
Rym: Don't let our line die.

811
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,239
Rym: Even though he's like, fuck you, Dad, I'll change my name as much as I want.

812
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:10,200
Rym: But all these ghosts want is for someone to know they existed.

813
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,179
Rym: Just hear their story.

814
00:52:11,386 --> 00:52:11,696
Rym: That's it.

815
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:12,108
Scott: Yep.

816
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:13,279
Scott: That's what they want.

817
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:19,120
Rym: And the way that is depicted in this movie to drive all those different readings and allegories is fantastic.

818
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:26,339
Rym: Those songs that get played, I was deeply invested in those tales of what happened to those soldiers on those ships.

819
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:27,220
Scott: Exactly.

820
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:31,000
Scott: That's the meta thing that we talked about before the spoiler line, right?

821
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,660
Scott: It's like they're trying to sing music to get these people within the story.

822
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:41,475
Scott: They're trying to tell people the story of the Heike and make them care about it and remember it.

823
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,560
Scott: But actually me, the real person, right, is being told that story.

824
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:47,260
Scott: And now I care about it, right?

825
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,510
Rym: But the best part, they never show the battle that they're talking about.

826
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,340
Rym: They don't animate that directly.

827
00:52:56,363 --> 00:53:03,899
Rym: You just see the band singing about it with the band's primitive late Han era, not historical special effects.

828
00:53:04,803 --> 00:53:05,500
Scott: And that's the funny.

829
00:53:05,742 --> 00:53:07,220
Scott: That was a really great thing.

830
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,194
Scott: It's like they're imagining how could somebody put on a rock concert in whatever year this is.

831
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:14,080
Rym: And it grows.

832
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:14,904
Rym: Like it starts with.

833
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:19,000
Rym: just they got the big guys just breathing fire, like constantly behind them while they're rocking out.

834
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,757
Rym: Like that was great.

835
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,520
Scott: It's like they make up like, well, how could it be done with the level of technology they had?

836
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:25,800
Scott: How could someone do a light show?

837
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,898
Scott: Well, they could do it like this.

838
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,760
Scott: So then not only do they draw this light show.

839
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,080
Scott: Right.

840
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,080
Scott: It's all an animation, right?

841
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,120
Scott: They could draw whatever they want.

842
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:42,480
Scott: They draw a light show and then they draw pictures of somebody with a contrived theoretical means of doing a light show with ancient technology.

843
00:53:42,624 --> 00:53:42,897
Rym: Yeah.

844
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:43,440
Scott: Right.

845
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,699
Scott: It's like you didn't have to draw that, but you did.

846
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:51,639
Scott: And it's like, you know, when you think about the fact that that is something like someone drew that picture.

847
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,498
Rym: Storytelling as storytelling.

848
00:53:54,380 --> 00:54:01,860
Rym: I think my favorite level, my favorite, especially as they're so different, my favorite of those effects like that bit, the song about the whale and the tie.

849
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,800
Scott: The whale is, I think, the best song in the whole.

850
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,700
Rym: Absolutely the best song, but also the best.

851
00:54:06,162 --> 00:54:08,420
Rym: Well, there were the visuals.

852
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:18,880
Rym: I like the most like that set piece, but the the most luscious visuals are definitely the final set of songs that they do with a giant crane and the glam rock set.

853
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:19,780
Scott: Right.

854
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:26,000
Scott: Well, I mean, there's a lot of, you know, I'd say, you know, a lot of it is really just like a queen parody.

855
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,362
Rym: Well, there's.

856
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:42,200
Rym: it seems like it covers a lot of parody, but homage styles and types of music like you can like each of the set pieces of music is like a mishmash of references to a bunch of different bands and a bunch of different musical styles.

857
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:47,819
Rym: But it definitely gets extremely clean, especially toward the end.

858
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:48,476
Scott: Right.

859
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:53,460
Scott: The whale, you know, felt to me like it was directly referencing like Live Aid.

860
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:01,131
Scott: Because the whole focus, even if you listen to the soundtrack, right, it's on it's on all the streaming services is it's the whale?

861
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,179
Scott: song is all about the fact that like now the crowd is like at its peak.

862
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:05,519
Scott: Right.

863
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:07,220
Scott: The crowd is enormous.

864
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,697
Rym: The crowd is rising, just like the tide rose with the whole.

865
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:11,880
Scott: Right.

866
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:19,780
Scott: And the whale song is just focused almost entirely on this huge call and response element where the crowd is like in unison.

867
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,580
Scott: And it's like you don't see that at concerts.

868
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,892
Scott: Right.

869
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:25,217
Scott: Other than right.

870
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,360
Scott: There was Live Aid and what other concert has that?

871
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,100
Scott: It's not that that goes down like that.

872
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,269
Scott: Right.

873
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:37,520
Scott: And then the final song is so like not even not subtle at all.

874
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,999
Scott: Bohemian Rhapsody.

875
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:39,919
Scott: Oh, my gosh.

876
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,091
Scott: Yeah.

877
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:46,859
Scott: I got chills when that song starts off ballady and then it gets bouncy and then it gets right.

878
00:55:47,323 --> 00:55:50,000
Scott: It's it's like they're not even trying to hide the fact.

879
00:55:50,020 --> 00:56:00,580
Rym: I love how at the end of all that, that ridiculous visual in some of the final scenes, you do see in the background a giant crane that was clearly to let him swing across everything.

880
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,600
Scott: Yeah.

881
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:06,269
Scott: What else can we say about this thing?

882
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,290
Rym: So I do it.

883
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:17,530
Rym: I liked how they portrayed the jealous like the person who was taking the head details before, because like I said, you can read him as he's just a serial killer.

884
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:19,490
Rym: Like he's just going around killing the monk.

885
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,143
Scott: It wasn't serial.

886
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,237
Scott: He had an emotive.

887
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:22,529
Scott: serial killers have no motive.

888
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:24,150
Rym: Depends.

889
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:32,850
Rym: I mean, arguably serial killer just came out of the old terminology sequence killer, which just meant someone who kills many people over a span of time with the same methodology.

890
00:56:33,312 --> 00:56:34,750
Scott: OK, the point is right.

891
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,729
Scott: He was clearly the murderer.

892
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:47,570
Rym: Yeah, but he was either the murderer directly because he was evil and crazy or he hired or he was working with that demon and the demon was responsible.

893
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,389
Rym: But really, he asked the demon for help.

894
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:50,450
Rym: It doesn't really matter.

895
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,370
Rym: I like, you know, my jam.

896
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:53,988
Rym: Same reason I like shows like your tenor.

897
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:58,950
Rym: Whenever the allegorical reading and the literal reading work equally well.

898
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:01,469
Rym: That is like the chef kiss of media for me.

899
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,650
Rym: The only thing that could get me harder is precursor technology mixed in.

900
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:09,810
Scott: Yeah, it honestly doesn't matter which way it goes.

901
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:19,829
Rym: But the moment where he like I thought he was going to go try to kill them and like ruin their performance, I did not expect him to just pop.

902
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:30,469
Rym: What's extra funny is the crowd did not react that strongly to like the eyeball bouncing like after he just popped when the demon killed him.

903
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:38,689
Rym: But when then you see the finger just like stuck to the wall, like slowly sliding at that moment, that's when the whole crowd went all at once.

904
00:57:39,073 --> 00:57:40,689
Rym: There's like a shutter that went through the theater.

905
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:49,469
Scott: I mean, like for for for a movie that's actually pretty light on the, you know, anything that would be a content warning.

906
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:56,330
Scott: It's like that is like one brief scene was like, whoa, I read that as him committing suicide.

907
00:57:57,171 --> 00:58:04,230
Rym: Yeah, probably, especially because you had the angry, you know, his sword is getting angrier and angrier every time they're succeeding.

908
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:06,750
Rym: And especially with the cultural sensibilities of the era.

909
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:10,810
Rym: He could not commit murder on that scale and get away with it.

910
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:13,268
Rym: He was consumed to the point they just had to destroy himself.

911
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:20,768
Rym: But if you read it with the demon, the demon is great because the demon is just like, you made a deal with me.

912
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,289
Rym: You said I could have your son.

913
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,129
Rym: I can do whatever I want with your son.

914
00:58:24,597 --> 00:58:25,249
Rym: I did that.

915
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:30,070
Rym: So if you tell me to kill your son, you are taking away the thing that I like.

916
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,269
Scott: You're giving up telling me to destroy what's already mine.

917
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:34,068
Scott: Fuck you.

918
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,470
Rym: Like quit while you're ahead.

919
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,430
Rym: You're the court musician.

920
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:39,987
Rym: You're safe.

921
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:41,039
Rym: Like, don't?

922
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,708
Rym: what's wrong with you?

923
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,369
Scott: Well, he wasn't the court.

924
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:44,290
Scott: That was the whole thing.

925
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:49,009
Scott: So the the he should have been the court musician in his eyes.

926
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,439
Scott: Shogun slash emperor is the most popular.

927
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,869
Scott: no theater in town was by this dude.

928
00:58:56,301 --> 00:58:56,410
Scott: Right.

929
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,026
Scott: What was his name?

930
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,349
Scott: The evil dude.

931
00:58:58,795 --> 00:58:59,609
Rym: I forget his name.

932
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:00,528
Scott: Yeah.

933
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:03,810
Scott: But he had the most popular no theater in town.

934
00:59:04,652 --> 00:59:07,950
Scott: It was popular with all the people and it was supposedly the best one.

935
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:13,070
Scott: And so he makes the deal with the demon, though, to sort of keep that position going.

936
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:13,368
Scott: Right.

937
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,710
Scott: And so the demon gives him the, you know, you know, son.

938
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:17,410
Scott: Right.

939
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,627
Scott: So, you know, is his son.

940
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:19,326
Scott: Right.

941
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,929
Rym: But he also gives them all like new tales of the heck.

942
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:23,150
Scott: Right.

943
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:28,570
Scott: And so the, uh, what was I saying?

944
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:30,770
Rym: We were talking about Salieri.

945
00:59:31,812 --> 00:59:32,030
Scott: Right.

946
00:59:34,732 --> 00:59:41,690
Scott: Um, oh, so he's most popular in town, but the emperor does not have him perform for him.

947
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:48,428
Scott: Emperor has this other second no theater perform because like the emperor's daughter is a fan of this other one.

948
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:53,770
Scott: So even though everyone knows that sort of the Salieri guys, one is the best.

949
00:59:54,282 --> 00:59:54,490
Scott: Right.

950
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:58,290
Scott: He doesn't get to perform for the emperor because the emperor's daughter likes a different one.

951
00:59:58,473 --> 00:59:59,047
Rym: His daughter's fun.

952
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:04,227
Rym: I love, I love the crowd scenes of her and all the people in the crowd reacting to the performance too.

953
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:05,310
Scott: Right.

954
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:12,710
Scott: And so then, right, you know, when, when Inoue comes along, you know, with the, with the rock band and the new stories, right.

955
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,004
Scott: From all the spirits that he talks to, right.

956
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,910
Scott: He takes down sort of both, right.

957
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:29,768
Scott: It's like with their new rock and roll style, not only do they take down, you know, the no theater that was popular with the people, they also take down the no theater that was popular with the emperor and his daughter, right.

958
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:30,849
Scott: And they replace.

959
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,369
Scott: So it's like first they take out one.

960
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:36,870
Scott: Then when they take out both, that's what pushes the guy over the edge.

961
01:00:36,954 --> 01:00:37,190
Scott: Right.

962
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,806
Scott: Because it's like, you know.

963
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:45,508
Rym: You also had half the deal and now he's got nothing, which reminds me of yet another story had told.

964
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:54,510
Rym: There is the upper class performance arts that they portray, like what is acceptable, socially acceptable and popular.

965
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:59,790
Rym: And then great balls of fire style, some loud upstarts, making nonsense music outside.

966
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:09,850
Rym: And bit by bit, there's that great scene where the court, like the famous dancers performing the really, really slow upper high class, very special dance.

967
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:11,410
Rym: And then some dipshit just runs in.

968
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,190
Rym: He's like, Hey, the crazy guys by the water are doing something cool.

969
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:15,469
Rym: Everybody runs out to see that.

970
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:20,163
Rym: And there's only like six nobles sitting there watching this and everyone else goes to see the cool band.

971
01:01:21,003 --> 01:01:21,126
Scott: Yeah.

972
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:23,695
Scott: But yeah, this is just.

973
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:28,890
Rym: you got that great bit where even the viewer like, what's up with him anyway?

974
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:32,230
Rym: Yeah, they got like long hair and makeup and WTF.

975
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,490
Rym: I thought they were monks.

976
01:01:34,972 --> 01:01:35,475
Scott: I think it's just.

977
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:38,030
Scott: it's really like a genius, a genius work.

978
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:40,070
Scott: It spoke to me.

979
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,410
Rym: So I hope it speaks to you, too.

980
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:43,409
Rym: There is zero.

981
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:44,650
Rym: Just watch this movie.

982
01:01:45,012 --> 01:01:47,750
Rym: I think people who have never seen an anime will enjoy this movie.

983
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,730
Rym: Just make just get in front of people and it's a ride.

984
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,888
Rym: And before you know it, it'll suddenly end.

985
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:57,520
Scott: I mean, I think I don't know if it's like.

986
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:59,970
Scott: it's like there are better anime movies, right?

987
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,548
Scott: It's like Akira is better than this.

988
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,310
Scott: Ghost in the Shell is better than this, right?

989
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:05,310
Scott: It's like that's it.

990
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:11,390
Scott: But that doesn't mean I'm going to still say it's S tier, even though it's not the essence of the S tier.

991
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:13,510
Scott: It's still in that same realm.

992
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:14,110
Rym: Absolutely.

993
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:19,530
Rym: If I could watch it right now and not regret those ninety eight minutes.

994
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:20,570
Rym: Just watch it again.

995
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,050
Scott: Yeah, I was so surprised it was only ninety eight minutes.

996
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:26,829
Scott: I was like, whoa, there's a lot worse ways to spend ninety eight minutes.

997
01:02:27,732 --> 01:02:32,363
Scott: Most things you could do are a worse way to spend ninety eight minutes than watching this movie.

998
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:40,830
Scott: So I hope you are able to see it in the theater in a day or two when it is in theaters in the United States or who knows wherever you live.

999
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:43,670
Scott: It is getting some sort of distribution worldwide.

1000
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:47,150
Scott: If you're in Japan, I'm sure you've had a chance to see it already plenty of times.

1001
01:02:47,391 --> 01:02:47,668
Scott: Who knows?

1002
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:55,407
Scott: You know, it'll eventually, I'm sure, be streaming in and Blu rays and all that business at some point.

1003
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,070
Scott: So don't you know, you'll have your chance.

1004
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,930
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1015
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:15,570
Rym: I look forward to finding out if Scott is going to choose to read a book about the character Garak from Star Trek written by the actor or Foucault's Pendulum.

1016
01:04:16,073 --> 01:04:19,010
Rym: That will be the terrifying choice that sits before Scott.

1017
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,268
Rym: This is the second time I've revealed it.

1018
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:31,090
Rym: I don't think he will find out what the choice is going to be unless one of you tell him until the book club after the book club after Binti.

1019
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:39,590
Rym: But anyway, tonight I'm really hungry so I'm just going to sign off and leave you with... I mean, I just heard the phone over and said take the stuff off.

1020
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,629
Rym: Can I have you look in the very bottom below the very bottom left corner?

1021
01:04:45,003 --> 01:04:45,550
Scott: Is that the phone number?

1022
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,041
Scott: Yeah.

1023
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:53,348
Scott: So you did get my text messages and said you didn't.

1024
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,265
Scott: Nice trick.

1025
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:56,377
Rym: Yes, Mr.

1026
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,023
Rym: Jones.

1027
01:04:58,275 --> 01:04:58,484
Rym: Indeed.

1028
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,649
Rym: You didn't give this text message to me.

1029
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,990
Rym: You don't know where this came from.

1030
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:03,949
Rym: Do you know where I got this?

1031
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:04,494
Rym: No.

1032
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,711
Rym: Mr.

1033
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:24,180
Rym: Jones, did you know that 12 days ago, 12 days ago, your attorneys met up and sent an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone with every text message you've sent for the past two years and when informed,

1034
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:26,126
Scott: did not take any steps to

1035
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:28,849
Rym: identify it as privileged or protected in any way.

1036
01:05:29,671 --> 01:05:32,470
Rym: And as of two days ago, it fell free and clear into my possession.

1037
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,056
Rym: And that is how I know.

1038
01:05:34,116 --> 01:05:37,507
Rym: you lied to me when you said you didn't have a text message about saying it.
