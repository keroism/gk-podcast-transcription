1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,560
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 10th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,861
Rym: I'm Rip.

3
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:13,386
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,976
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:17,469
Rym: Tonight, the J-drama, Blue Blazes.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,199
Rym: [laughter] Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Rym: In other news, I think Scott is dying of the tubercules.

8
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,818
Rym: I just had- There's some tuberculin going on here.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:45,060
Scott: At the PAX, it wasn't PAX Pox, but I had a scratchy throat, which I think was from a combination of talking too much, yelling in loud places, and also eating too much pie.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
Rym: How could the pie cause the scratchy throat, Scott?

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,279
Scott: Because then there was too much stomach acid, and while I was sleeping, the acid scratched my throat.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,099
Rym: Oh, so you're saying you had a for-real gastric reflux?

13
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,450
Scott: Well, I didn't feel it anywhere in my esophagus, so I don't know.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,980
Scott: I'm just guessing.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,600
Rym: I do recall when we went to bed that night, you were laying there making noises that sounded like you were dying.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,239
Scott: You were just laying there like- I ate too much pie, and bad things came out the other end.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,567
Rym: But pie, man.

18
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,140
Rym: How can you have so much trouble with pie?

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,280
Scott: The problem wasn't the fact that it was pie.

20
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,620
Scott: It's that I ate when I was full, because the pie was so delicious.

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Scott: Anyway, so that scratchy throat turned into mucus, which went to my nose, and then my throat, and then my nose, and then my throat.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,324
Scott: And right now, it's just mucus in the throat that my body is- Oh, Captain Mucus.

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:34,709
Rym: What?

24
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,599
Rym: You're full of mucus.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Scott: I haven't felt actually sick at all during this whole period.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,907
Scott: I felt perfectly fine.

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,239
Scott: I'm just full of fucking mucus, and I keep coughing and/or sneezing it out.

28
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,600
Scott: At least you were- It keeps coming.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,940
Rym: At least it's telling that you're- And it's not green.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,479
Scott: It's not some nasty infection shit.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,479
Rym: Your character- I mean, your coughs sound kind of wet, so it almost sounds like an upper respiratory thing.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,675
Scott: But- But yeah, it's just mucus.

33
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,280
Scott: Won't stop coming.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,859
Rym: I guess it's fitting that your character in a Bernie Wheel game failed his health test against the cold, because we're basically hiking through the Arctic.

35
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:02,785
Scott: Yep.

36
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,400
Scott: I was able to roleplay with reality.

37
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:06,767
Rym: Ah.

38
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:16,960
Rym: So, some funny meta news, 'cause we were last night playing Bernie Wheel, and not to let me tell you about my character, but we're- Let him tell you about his character.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,094
Rym: We're a group of cultist assholes nominally researching stuff, and we're going off into the Arctic.

40
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:21,440
Scott: It's the society.

41
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:22,691
Rym: Yes, cultists.

42
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:23,320
Rym: Society.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,871
Rym: The society of cultists.

44
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:25,960
Scott: Secret society.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,809
Rym: So, we're going off into the Arctic, HMS Terror and Erebus- It's Greenland.

46
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,539
Scott: It's not the Arctic.

47
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:37,240
Rym: We're going off into an icebound wilderness to find a buried city and awaken some god that'll probably kill us.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,898
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,978
Scott: That is awesome and true.

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,581
Rym: Yeah.

51
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:43,960
Rym: And, uh, the fact that your character, you know, failed his health test was funny.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,639
Rym: But, uh, so we're playing that game, and we're constantly referencing the disappearance of the Franklin Expedition, because- I mentioned it once.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,999
Rym: I mentioned it or referenced it a couple times.

54
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,139
Scott: I didn't get those references.

55
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,800
Rym: Oh, you never read that book, The Terror.

56
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,698
Scott: I'm not going to.

57
00:02:58,981 --> 00:02:59,246
Rym: You should.

58
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,020
Rym: I'll make it a booklet book.

59
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,587
Rym: I'll read it again.

60
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,560
Rym: That book is fucking awesome.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,199
Rym: Go fuck yourself.

62
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:18,340
Rym: The only problem with that book, and I will admit this is a problem, is that it has gruesome, 100% accurate, really up close and personal depictions of lead poisoning and scurvy.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
Rym: And let me tell you, scurvy is a horrifying thing.

64
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,080
Scott: I don't want to read about those things.

65
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,239
Scott: I might just vomit on the book.

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Rym: The worst part is that if you read the book, uh, I didn't know it was based on a true story.

67
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:35,340
Rym: So I'm reading it, and I'm enjoying it, and at one point, like, I read this letter that, like, someone left behind.

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:46,419
Rym: Then I found out later that that letter was actually found in the real world and that the novel was based on, like, what they found of the missing expedition, and all those people were real, and yeah.

69
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:54,340
Rym: So, funnily enough, turns out there was an announcement pretty much, like, yesterday that they actually just found one of the ships.

70
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,780
Scott: Okay.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,378
Rym: Like, for real.

72
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,159
Scott: Under the ice?

73
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:57,594
Rym: Yes.

74
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:58,267
Rym: In the water.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:09,998
Rym: They found it because Global Warming has basically opened up the Northwest Passage, and Canada sent a ship up there to basically claim the Arctic and do all their bullshit, and they just found it straight up.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,180
Scott: Dude, Global Warming is awesome.

77
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:17,279
Scott: We should get a ship and go find pirate ships that are basically bubbling up from the melted ice.

78
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,779
Rym: I don't think many pirates tried to find the Northwest Passage.

79
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,940
Scott: Vikings are pirates, kind of.

80
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,280
Rym: I don't think Vikings went that way on purpose.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Scott: Woolly mammoth fossils.

82
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,940
Scott: All of those things are valuable.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,720
Rym: Also, fun fact, this expedition went up into the Arctic to die, and everybody died of madness and lead poisoning and scurvy.

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,316
Scott: You don't say.

85
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,380
Rym: The ships were the Erebus and the Terror.

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,600
Rym: Erebus basically means darkness.

87
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:56,160
Rym: So, remember that all these men, it was like 200 men, died alone and mad, starving to death and eating each other in the Arctic after being iced in for multiple years.

88
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:57,333
Scott: So Cthulhu got them.

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:08,708
Rym: And before this expedition, someone came to them and said, "Hey, young men, would you like to go off into the Arctic in the Terror and the

90
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:08,949
Rym: Darkness?".

91
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,359
Scott: How much does it pay?

92
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,476
Rym: Not much.

93
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:14,679
Scott: Is there a Cthulhu on the way?

94
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,900
Scott: Because I'm totally in the society.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,380
Rym: So, anyway, it's Wednesday.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,580
Rym: I got sort of a geek bite because I'm completely, like, I watch Teen Titans.

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,499
Rym: I've already talked about it.

98
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,780
Rym: That show is amazing.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,359
Rym: Teen Titans Go!

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,169
Scott: The cartoon.

101
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,719
Scott: that's mad old?

102
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,939
Rym: No, Teen Titans Go!

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,639
Rym: Not Teen Titans.

104
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,659
Scott: What year is it from?

105
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,717
Rym: The new, like, right now.

106
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:34,920
Scott: Okay.

107
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,779
Rym: I've talked about this on the show, like, four times.

108
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:38,820
Scott: Okay.

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,938
Rym: Teen Titans Go!

110
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:40,659
Rym: It's new.

111
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,520
Rym: It's ongoing.

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,899
Rym: There's a new episode, like, right now.

113
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,199
Scott: I don't like any Titans or teens.

114
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,269
Rym: Teen Titans is amazing.

115
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,220
Rym: if you watch Teen Titans Go!

116
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,280
Rym: If you read the comics, they're terrible.

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,339
Rym: If you watch the old animation or the older animation, they're the worst.

118
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,760
Rym: But, anyway, I've talked about that.

119
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,900
Scott: If you want to claim that Teen Titans is good, you must explain Wonder Girl and her history.

120
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,260
Rym: Wonder Girl's not in Teen Titans Go!

121
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,580
Rym: So, they explained.

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,431
Scott: Okay.

123
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,240
Scott: I explained it.

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
Scott: That makes it already better than regular old Teen Titans.

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,250
Rym: Scott, Teen Titans Go!

126
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:17,720
Rym: is basically just Raven, Beast Boy, Cyborg, Robin, and Starfire, and they're all fucked up people.

127
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:18,820
Scott: Only Cyborg is good.

128
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,520
Scott: Everyone else sucks.

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
Rym: Beast Boy is pretty great, actually.

130
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,600
Scott: Fuck Beast Boy.

131
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,880
Rym: I think Raven and Beast Boy are tied for my favorites.

132
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,273
Rym: Anyway.

133
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,040
Scott: And Cyborg's only cool because he's a cyborg.

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,960
Rym: Cyborg's actually really, really goddamn annoying.

135
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,619
Scott: Well, you know what?

136
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,299
Scott: He's a cyborg.

137
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:33,940
Scott: Yeah, he is.

138
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,180
Scott: That makes up pretty much anything.

139
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,679
Rym: So, I'm caught up on that.

140
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,200
Rym: Venture Brothers hasn't come out yet.

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
Rym: I'm caught up on Adventure Time.

142
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,320
Rym: We've talked about that a bunch.

143
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,239
Rym: So, I need a new animation to watch.

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Rym: Just a new show to watch, other than Sailor Moon.

145
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,039
Scott: I just asked me.

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,039
Scott: I could have told you what to watch.

147
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:54,357
Rym: And it's got to be in English so I can watch it without having to watch subtitles because I'd watch it while I'm mopping and stuff and doing the things that adults do.

148
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,980
Rym: So, I've started watching The Amazing Adventures of Gumball.

149
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:00,473
Scott: Oh, isn't that the...

150
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,220
Rym: That's like the cat and the fish guy and the rabbit.

151
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Scott: Oh, I thought you were talking about the piratey one.

152
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:08,635
Scott: What?

153
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:09,991
Scott: What's the show?

154
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:10,619
Scott: that's piratey?

155
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,153
Rym: Piratey?

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
Scott: Blabjack something.

157
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:12,600
Rym: Blabjack?

158
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:13,780
Rym: No, I'm not watching that.

159
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,660
Rym: I don't even know what that is.

160
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,259
Scott: I heard that one's actually good and it's piratey.

161
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:16,954
Rym: Might be.

162
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,080
Rym: I'm watching this show.

163
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,659
Rym: I'll show a screenshot of it.

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,137
Rym: These guys.

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,480
Scott: What the fuck is that?

166
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,659
Scott: I've never seen that in my life.

167
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,992
Scott: Really?

168
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,159
Scott: Why are you watching this?

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,099
Scott: You really haven't seen that?

170
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,200
Scott: I've never seen that ever.

171
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,680
Rym: It's like one of Cartoon Network's semi-flagship shows these days.

172
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,299
Scott: I would just rewatch Textures Lab instead of watching whatever that is.

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,980
Rym: This is actually pretty good.

174
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:36,819
Scott: Okay, sure.

175
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,300
Rym: I am actually really enjoying it.

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,980
Scott: The only thing good about that picture is that the house has googly eyes.

177
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,253
Scott: And there's a fish.

178
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:45,719
Scott: A fish can't be bad either.

179
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,660
Rym: The fish actually is a pretty good character.

180
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,060
Scott: I don't mind the Mario bushes on the front lawn either.

181
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:50,718
Scott: Those are nice.

182
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,920
Rym: The cool thing about the show is that it's basically a combination of 2D animation, 3D animation, stop motion animation, paper cutout animation.

183
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,879
Scott: So basically all the animations at once.

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,377
Rym: Yes.

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,619
Scott: That's interesting.

186
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,420
Rym: And it's kind of like a modern Simpsons in the sense that it is the story of a family that is incredibly dysfunctional.

187
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,420
Rym: The mother is kind of a bad person.

188
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,959
Rym: The dad is a failure at life.

189
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,300
Rym: And the kids, it kind of focuses on one of the boys.

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,440
Rym: So kind of a Bart Simpson.

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,900
Rym: But cross it with SpongeBob because it's got that sort of humor going on.

192
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,540
Scott: I'm not into that humor.

193
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,120
Rym: You know, it has its place.

194
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,240
Rym: I enjoy it legitimately and I think it's funny.

195
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,179
Rym: And I'm going to watch it some more and then I'm going to straight up review it.

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Rym: So guys, if you need something to watch, it's actually worth checking out at least like a clip on YouTube.

197
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,458
Scott: If you're a Rym type person.

198
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:43,980
Rym: Yeah.

199
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,359
Rym: A lot of people are Rym type people.

200
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,277
Rym: Bad people.

201
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,120
Rym: Rym type is strong against everything.

202
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:48,915
Scott: No, it's not.

203
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,259
Scott: And also nothing is strong in spirit too.

204
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,600
Rym: Rym used annoying noises against Scott.

205
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,760
Rym: It's super effective.

206
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,218
Scott: That's your only attack.

207
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,740
Scott: Annoying noise, annoying noise, annoying noise and set clock.

208
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:03,940
Rym: So you got a news?

209
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,440
Scott: I do have a news.

210
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,699
Scott: It's a tiny, simple, basic news.

211
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,480
Scott: We've waited all summer and patience has been rewarded.

212
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,160
Scott: Yo Apeta is coming back.

213
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,613
Scott: Season two.

214
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:21,900
Scott: We're going to find out because that show, I don't know if people watched it after our completely a hundred percent accurate review of it.

215
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,956
Rym: I'm only about halfway through it, but I really like it.

216
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:45,560
Scott: Uh, but basically they ended season one and they ended season one, not at the end of a race, not right before the end of a race, not at the beginning of a race, but they ended season one right before the end of the second day of a three day race.

217
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,277
Scott: Are you kidding me?

218
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:48,496
Rym: You know what?

219
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:56,640
Rym: I have no complaints about that because I was watching Eska flow name as it was coming out and they murder a character.

220
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,220
Scott: And then in the episode immediately, but you're not sure if they're actually murdered or not.

221
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,840
Scott: And then you have to wait for the next episode.

222
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,419
Rym: And it turns out that they did that every episode.

223
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:05,217
Scott: Yes.

224
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:06,019
Scott: Everyone.

225
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:06,616
Rym: Yup.

226
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:22,500
Rym: And also I point out that if you have the attack on Titan situation where it kind of ends in the middle of nowhere and there's a future horizon desert where no sign of life exists for more episodes, well, you can't read the manga cause it's terrible.

227
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,239
Scott: So shows come back like October something real soon.

228
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:32,160
Scott: So anyone who is a needs more bicycling, just hang tight a little longer.

229
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,019
Rym: Basically got some time.

230
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,460
Rym: Now is a good time to catch up on that show and be ready for the new season to come out.

231
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,380
Rym: In fact, if you time it right, you can watch the end of the first season and then the next day it's just the next episode will come out and watch.

232
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Scott: It'll be glorious.

233
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,179
Rym: Season two is going to start with like a multi episode flashback.

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,659
Scott: It will be a miracle.

235
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,870
Rym: So anyway, things of the day, this is the DuckTales theme with real ducks.

236
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,509
Rym: Like it's actually really cute.

237
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:01,606
Rym: That's all.

238
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:13,410
Scott: You should have just said what you told me, which is that it was a live action DuckTales theme and I expected it to be people in DuckTales cosplay, but the fact that it's actual ducks makes it actually really awesome and worth watching.

239
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,210
Rym: This is, this is actually like super worth watching.

240
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,149
Rym: It's really cute.

241
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:18,310
Rym: Also baby ducks.

242
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,248
Rym: Really cute.

243
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,349
Scott: It's my thing today.

244
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:30,110
Scott: So eighties is basically a super cut of clips from movies, mostly from the eighties, perhaps nineties where there are arcade machines present.

245
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,170
Rym: No arcade was ever that cool.

246
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:36,330
Scott: No arcade was ever like this ever for reals, but we all wish they were.

247
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,808
Scott: And they were in movies and TV.

248
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,835
Scott: So relive them.

249
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:44,110
Scott: eighties, Robocop, Terminator, Wizard, Tron, et cetera.

250
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,108
Scott: You know, I don't know if I missed it or not.

251
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,788
Scott: The cooler and all more awesome you are.

252
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,190
Rym: Because I did not see Hackers.

253
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,710
Scott: When was there an arcade in Hackers?

254
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,270
Rym: Hackers has a crazy arcade and that's how the two main characters start to fall in love.

255
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,410
Rym: because she's really good at that game.

256
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,329
Rym: I almost called her Trinity.

257
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:05,169
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of movies that include arcades that were not in the super cut.

258
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:07,567
Rym: But so it's only a mega cut.

259
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:08,244
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:09,349
Scott: It's a mega whatever.

261
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:09,908
Rym: That's fine.

262
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,210
Rym: You know, I want that.

263
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,670
Rym: You know how that, you know, we have like sci fi from the fifties is like this sort of cool.

264
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,370
Rym: Like nowadays, like that's a really cool retro futurism aesthetic.

265
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:24,270
Rym: I want a retro arcade is an aesthetic like 20 years from now.

266
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,410
Rym: Like.

267
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:28,430
Rym: I want that kind of arcade aesthetic to be like super retro cool.

268
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,590
Scott: That's already an aesthetic.

269
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,270
Scott: That's super retro.

270
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,550
Rym: Cool to us, not to society.

271
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,589
Rym: Go find an arcade that looks like that.

272
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,469
Scott: All right.

273
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:37,586
Rym: Yeah.

274
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,541
Rym: All of them.

275
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:39,350
Rym: Where?

276
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:40,929
Rym: What arcades?

277
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,850
Scott: The ones that old guys are running.

278
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,290
Rym: The only arcades I've seen lately are the ones that are like a black barcade where they're basically just a bar and they have a token number of arcade machines.

279
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,167
Rym: They can at least say, Hey, uh, you cool hip kids who like arcade aesthetics come here and play.

280
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,430
Rym: But one is too loud to actually talk to anyone.

281
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,630
Rym: Two, they have a pitiful number of games have a, which don't work.

282
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,730
Rym: And three, there's so many people in there.

283
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,168
Rym: You can't actually even play any of the games.

284
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:06,590
Scott: That's barcade.

285
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:06,870
Scott: Yeah.

286
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,159
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:07,906
Rym: I want it.

288
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,890
Rym: I want an arcade that's as cool as the arcades in this mega cut.

289
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,010
Scott: Go to retro arcade museum that we interviewed on this very podcast.

290
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,967
Rym: Many moons ago, that plays shut down.

291
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:23,165
Scott: As you may recall, go to any of the other similar exactly same places run by similar folk.

292
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:23,527
Rym: Yeah.

293
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,370
Rym: Not that many people.

294
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,808
Rym: And you know what?

295
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,890
Rym: They're usually mostly empty.

296
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,566
Rym: When you go into them.

297
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,867
Rym: You need, I want kids dressed like that dancing while they're playing an arcade movies.

298
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,650
Scott: You'll have to hire actors and extras.

299
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,169
Rym: Now I want people to be that cool.

300
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,786
Scott: No, one's going to wear those shoes.

301
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,366
Rym: Those shoes weren't that bad.

302
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,268
Scott: No, one's going to wear those pants.

303
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:47,190
Rym: So in the moment, uh, the book club book is canonical for Lebowitz.

304
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,029
Scott: I still have read two thirds of it, so I'll finish it.

305
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:57,930
Rym: Um, while rims in Singapore, you'd better because, uh, I've got, I've got four 25 hour flights coming up in the near future.

306
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,729
Rym: I'm going to read like three novels.

307
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,410
Rym: Okay.

308
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,147
Rym: So I think I'm going to pick my next book club book after Canada will leave one of those and just start it like right now.

309
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:06,710
Rym: Okay.

310
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,406
Rym: Thinking about doing water ship down.

311
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:09,589
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:09,922
Rym: Yeah.

313
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,150
Scott: Yeah.

314
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:17,489
Rym: If you so much as even hesitate, I'm just going to do a counter Monte Cristo instead.

315
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,325
Scott: Yeah.

316
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,310
Scott: And I do crime and punishment.

317
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,650
Rym: I actually want to read that one, but I've read that book like three times.

318
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,764
Rym: I don't need to read it again.

319
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,987
Scott: Point point one time.

320
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,588
Rym: God, you know what?

321
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,350
Rym: Here's the moral of crime and punishment.

322
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,410
Rym: If you commit a crime, you need to be punished.

323
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:44,170
Rym: And if you get away with it, you're going to punish yourself because that's how humans work.

324
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,110
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

325
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:46,549
Rym: The real moral.

326
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,650
Rym: You're not as clever as you think you are.

327
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,356
Rym: Yeah.

328
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,966
Scott: I still want to read it.

329
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:02,589
Scott: Let us continue using that.

330
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,269
Rym: It's a pretty good thing because anyone who gets that is like plus two to cool.

331
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,343
Scott: Here we go.

332
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,647
Rym: So yeah.

333
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,910
Rym: Uh, other announcements.

334
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,330
Rym: Uh, I will be, GeekNights will be, Scott will not be sadly at the penny arcade expo.

335
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,510
Scott: that's coming up in 51 days in Australia on the complete other side of the earth.

336
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,142
Scott: If you guys want me to go there, send money like two or $3,000 of money American.

337
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,930
Rym: Interestingly enough, I am on PayPal to my email address.

338
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:41,229
Rym: I am doing two lectures, one of which is basically the solo version of how to win every game on Sunday at noon.

339
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:45,410
Rym: So basically a version of what we just did at PAX prime.

340
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,150
Rym: And the other one is the other side of the coin.

341
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,110
Rym: I played around with a bunch of titles, but eventually I ended up just calling it losing.

342
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,550
Rym: So I'm doing losing on Saturday.

343
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,130
Scott: You should have just changed the name of the other panel to winning.

344
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,581
Rym: Yeah.

345
00:15:58,851 --> 00:15:59,670
Rym: I thought about doing that.

346
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,990
Rym: Actually, I still have four days to change the title before they go live.

347
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,050
Rym: I think I might just change.

348
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,730
Rym: I don't know though, because how to win every game is a pretty good title.

349
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,750
Rym: Like it draws the right kind of guy.

350
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,069
Scott: Make the other one how to lose every game.

351
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,710
Rym: Ah, except the point.

352
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:14,327
Rym: I don't know.

353
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:15,065
Rym: I don't know.

354
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:16,226
Rym: How should I go?

355
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,669
Rym: All this running through my head is symmetry, eh?

356
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,469
Scott: Symmetry.

357
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:24,750
Scott: We can't resist symmetry when you are a smart person.

358
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,222
Rym: Let's not go to that Dr.

359
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:26,870
Rym: Hibbard anymore.

360
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,030
Rym: Do you get what I'm referencing?

361
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:30,419
Rym: Yeah.

362
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,390
Rym: Do you really?

363
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:32,590
Rym: What am I referencing?

364
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,846
Scott: The Simpsons episode where Homer was getting like, there was.

365
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:38,347
Scott: no, it wasn't Homer.

366
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,349
Scott: It was a dude came in and like stole all the organs.

367
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,610
Rym: No, I know which one you're thinking of.

368
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,641
Scott: And there was the parents like.

369
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,329
Scott: Polly shouldn't be.

370
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,730
Rym: That's not the one I'm referencing, but that's actually pretty close.

371
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,729
Rym: So I guess that counts.

372
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,288
Rym: Okay.

373
00:16:51,531 --> 00:17:00,390
Rym: I'm referencing the one where Homer is the one that's like a pulp fiction, sort of like a bunch of stuff happens in the Springfield and Homer gets his thumb cut off, I think.

374
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,970
Rym: Thumb or a finger.

375
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,288
Rym: I forget.

376
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,509
Rym: He gets a finger cut off.

377
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,355
Rym: So they go to Dr.

378
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:07,467
Rym: Hibbard because they can't find the finger and Dr.

379
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,409
Rym: Hibbard's like, well, I can't fix it without the finger.

380
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,290
Rym: But what I could do is cut the other one off for symmetry and Homer's like symmetry.

381
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,730
Rym: So yeah, I'll be in Australia.

382
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,950
Rym: If you were going to be in Australia at Pax Australia, let me know.

383
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,270
Scott: What else are you going to do in Australia alone besides Pax?

384
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:38,450
Rym: Apparently, I don't know if I can announce this, so I won't, but a bunch of other people we know who are at Pax's who we may have been on panels with before are also going to be at Pax Australia.

385
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:38,886
Scott: Sure.

386
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,689
Scott: But what are you going to do?

387
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,810
Scott: Are you going to go like the coral reef?

388
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,710
Scott: You can see the penguins again?

389
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,749
Rym: Oh, you mean outside of Pax?

390
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:43,124
Scott: Yeah.

391
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,269
Scott: You're just going to come right back home.

392
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,250
Rym: So I'm actually giving a talk at a different convention.

393
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,550
Scott: For finance bullshit.

394
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,430
Scott: The week before Pax.

395
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,450
Scott: I'm talking about outside of conventions.

396
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,265
Rym: I'm going to go to that Wilson's Promontory that you didn't want to go to and hike that fucker.

397
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:55,805
Scott: Okay.

398
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,197
Rym: Yeah.

399
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,770
Rym: And I'm going to the beaches by Sydney.

400
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,275
Scott: Okay.

401
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,250
Rym: And I'm going to do a bunch of stuff in Sydney.

402
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:05,540
Rym: And I thought about biking between Sydney and Melbourne and I don't have time for that shit.

403
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,530
Rym: So that's not happening.

404
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,889
Scott: You're not going to the coral reef?

405
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:08,889
Rym: No, probably not.

406
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,420
Rym: Good.

407
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,909
Rym: I only have like two weeks.

408
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:19,169
Rym: I'm going to mostly do stuff like in and around Sydney and then I'm going to go past Melbourne all the way out to Wilson's Promontory and spend like an entire day hiking out there.

409
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,370
Rym: That's pretty much what I'm doing.

410
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:21,947
Scott: You'll be alone.

411
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:22,587
Scott: So don't die.

412
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,343
Rym: Yeah.

413
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:24,230
Rym: Maybe I'll get some people.

414
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,809
Rym: I think I convinced Kehil to go see the penguins.

415
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:28,509
Scott: Oh.

416
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,349
Rym: You're going to see the penguins again?

417
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:38,030
Rym: I don't know if I, you know what, I almost want to go see the penguins again now because those penguins were really, really, really, really cute.

418
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,129
Scott: They won't show up this time.

419
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,650
Rym: The thing is if they don't show up, I could be that guy who's there like, it's cool.

420
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,809
Rym: I've seen him already.

421
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:44,928
Rym: I've seen this.

422
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,589
Rym: You guys, you missed it.

423
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,145
Rym: The penguins.

424
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,667
Rym: Oh my God.

425
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,186
Rym: The penguins.

426
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:50,230
Rym: So yeah, I'll be at PAX Australia.

427
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,110
Rym: And then we have no conventions until PAX South, which actually is not that far away.

428
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,263
Scott: It's the same time as Magfest.

429
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,009
Rym: Which we're sadly not going to because PAX South.

430
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:06,030
Scott: Some guy recently on Craigslist, he got a free X-Men arcade machine.

431
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,429
Scott: He just saw it on giveaway on Craigslist and got it.

432
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:15,030
Rym: I need to set up a thing that watches Craigslist for anyone giving away an arcade cabinet.

433
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:15,630
Scott: Sure.

434
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:16,487
Rym: That's what I need to do.

435
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,130
Rym: I didn't know that happened.

436
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,550
Scott: Where are you going to put a six player X-Men or is it eight player?

437
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,250
Rym: Living room.

438
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:27,089
Rym: There's like right in the middle of the living room, like between the living room-ish area and the dining-ish area.

439
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,688
Rym: I would put it there.

440
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,590
Rym: It takes up about as much space as a DDR machine.

441
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:38,370
Rym: Anyway, so you're going to die or you're going to make it through the show?

442
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:39,747
Scott: So the show.

443
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:40,608
Rym: Captain Flems.

444
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,330
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:42,090
Scott: All right.

446
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,029
Scott: So someone messaged me on the internet and they said, "My name is

447
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:48,370
Scott: Omar.".

448
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,829
Scott: Well, they didn't say that, but his name is Omar.

449
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:50,727
Rym: Which Omar?

450
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,749
Rym: Is it Omar I know?

451
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,309
Scott: Yes, the awesome Omar.

452
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:54,589
Rym: Omar Jenkins?

453
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,212
Scott: No.

454
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,382
Scott: Atomic Trivia War 9000 Omar.

455
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,054
Scott: Okay.

456
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,606
Rym: Yeah.

457
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:00,730
Rym: That's the proper Omar.

458
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,367
Scott: The good Omar.

459
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,785
Scott: And he said to me, "You should watch this

460
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:04,107
Scott: thing.".

461
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,625
Scott: And I said the thing I usually say, which is, "I'll put it in that

462
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:07,927
Scott: queue.".

463
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:09,450
Scott: And it went in the queue.

464
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:09,706
Rym: Yeah.

465
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,108
Rym: In the queue is code for, "I will watch this when I'm retired with

466
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:13,430
Rym: Scott.".

467
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,130
Scott: That is correct.

468
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,337
Rym: Yup.

469
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,030
Scott: But then, as with most things in the world- He kept seeing it around.

470
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,727
Scott: As with Monica.

471
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,590
Rym: You saw a bear poop in the woods and there was just bears everywhere.

472
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:32,019
Scott: And as with other things, I saw that bear not only shitting in the woods, shitting in the lake, shitting in the park, shitting in my house- I mean- Shitting in my bed.

473
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,480
Rym: I saw people talking about this on Twitter all the time.

474
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,396
Scott: I saw a whole bunch of tweets about it and I saw links to it and I was like, "Well, this thing keeps coming up.

475
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,477
Scott: Guess I'll pay attention to it

476
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:46,719
Scott: more.".

477
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,158
Scott: Moved up in the queue, but didn't move to the front of the queue because I got no time for that.

478
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,091
Scott: I haven't unpacked from the woods or from packs and my apartment's a disaster and my life.

479
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,558
Scott: Oh my God.

480
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,579
Rym: Yeah, Scott, as awesome as the woods was, you know what I did?

481
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,060
Rym: Unpacked, edited video, got my shit together.

482
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,380
Scott: My shit is un-together still and I have to go to work tomorrow morning.

483
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Rym: Jimmy's at maximum rustling.

484
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,196
Scott: Yeah, so, but today I was like, "Oh shit, we got to do an episode on

485
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:13,598
Scott: something.".

486
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:19,259
Scott: And I said, "Hey, why didn't we do the episode on this thing that moved up in the

487
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:19,520
Scott: queue?".

488
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,516
Rym: First I said, "Hey, let's talk about Sailor Moon up to this point,".

489
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,460
Rym: but Scott's falling behind on the Sailor Moon bandwidth.

490
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,680
Scott: I haven't watched Sailor Moon since I last watched Sailor Moon, which is not recent.

491
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,020
Rym: Oh yeah, so it was a brief update.

492
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,960
Rym: Sailor Moon Crystal got slightly better with the most recent episode.

493
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,780
Rym: How is that possible?

494
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,759
Rym: So they introduced Sailor Jupiter.

495
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,100
Scott: Did they redo the animations?

496
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,360
Rym: They introduced Sailor Jupiter.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,620
Rym: Her transformation is almost passable and she had three distinct facial expressions.

498
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:50,579
Rym: And Amy said something funny and smirked a little bit.

499
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,539
Rym: So stuff might be happening.

500
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:55,900
Rym: They might be getting their shit together finally.

501
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Scott: So I'm still going to watch the old one.

502
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,560
Rym: Also there's this scene where Mamoru was like, "Wow, there's Usagi and she's passed out.

503
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,135
Rym: I'm going to lean over her and kiss

504
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:04,257
Rym: her.".

505
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,960
Rym: And then that scene goes on for a while and out of context is really creepy.

506
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,098
Rym: And then Luna comes over and she's basically like, "The fuck are you

507
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:12,440
Rym: doing?".

508
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:12,914
Rym: He's like,

509
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:12,996
Rym: "Ah!"

510
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:13,659
Rym: And he runs away.

511
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:15,315
Rym: That's it.

512
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,839
Rym: So anyway, we watched this thing.

513
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:27,860
Scott: So first of all, I know it's Wednesday and this is a live action show, but it has everything to do with manga that it could possibly have to do with.

514
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,100
Rym: Yes, and anime.

515
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,559
Scott: It's called Blue Blazes or Aoi Hono.

516
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:33,717
Rym: Aoi Hono.

517
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:35,057
Scott: Blue Blazes.

518
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,860
Scott: Probably pronouncing that mad wrong.

519
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:37,819
Rym: I don't know.

520
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,619
Rym: Aoi means blue.

521
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,999
Rym: I guess Hono means Blazes.

522
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,880
Scott: I guess.

523
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,100
Scott: The guy's name is Hono.

524
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,920
Scott: The main character.

525
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,287
Rym: Yep.

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,657
Rym: It's based on a manga and I don't really want to spoil some of the things that happen, like why the show is great.

527
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,419
Scott: So here's the deal.

528
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,819
Scott: It's about this guy and we found out it's somewhat autobiographical of the manga author, but it's super dramaticized.

529
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,159
Rym: It's almost as if- You know how dramaticized it is?

530
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:17,260
Rym: What I can only describe as a low rent version of the theme from Venus Wars plays in the background five or six times in the course of this first episode while he's on screen.

531
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:33,940
Scott: So imagine if you had like the, it's the story of this manga author in college, except it's super dramatized to where he's basically a hot blooded anime hero character, but he's just in college doing college stuff.

532
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,860
Rym: He's reading Shonen Magazine and he sees Ursa Edsura.

533
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,718
Scott: He's like- I was gonna say it, sir.

534
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,840
Scott: It was some baseball thing, Nine.

535
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:42,339
Rym: No, I was talking about later.

536
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,752
Rym: He sees it and he's like, "Rumiko Takahashi, I respect your skill, but I don't think this is the place for that

537
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,237
Rym: comic.".

538
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
Scott: Yeah, Shonen Sunday is not the place.

539
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:03,836
Rym: You are going in the wrong direction and the whole time the camera's zooming in on him dramatically while he's delivering this monologue to her remotely.

540
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,299
Rym: and then the girl he's with is like, "Why don't you just talk to

541
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:06,400
Rym: her?".

542
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
Rym: And he's like, "Yes, I will.

543
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,613
Rym: I will send her a fan

544
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:12,115
Rym: letter.".

545
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:15,719
Scott: It's pretty crazy.

546
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,520
Rym: This guy has exactly three modes.

547
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,139
Rym: He's either full on crazy, silently crazy with serial killer eyes, or completely silent reading a manga.

548
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,030
Scott: But everyone around him is not 100% normal, but not as crazy as him.

549
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:36,118
Rym: Except for Anno.

550
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,407
Scott: Sure.

551
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:49,860
Scott: But he has friends that are otaku, that are somewhat stereotypical, but at least they're sort of weirded out when he does crazy shit, like start yelling or running around.

552
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,829
Rym: Well, in the very beginning, he's reading this baseball manga, Nine, or Ben, Baseball, Nine.

553
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:04,920
Rym: And he's looking at it and he's talking to himself quietly, but it was kind of a Black Dynamite moment where Black Dynamite looks up and sees the microphone that's hanging in the frame.

554
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,185
Rym: The girl sitting on the bus next to him is looking over at him like, "What the fuck are you doing,

555
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:10,589
Rym: dude?".

556
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:23,139
Rym: And the whole show is like that, but imagine if there was a college, and in this class, everyone who mattered to anime in the '80s was all in the same class, and they were all rivals.

557
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,379
Scott: I think the class is real.

558
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:24,830
Rym: Yes.

559
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:27,474
Rym: And that is what this show is.

560
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:39,960
Scott: And it's really hard, so it's hard to describe- It's like history of anime and manga, plus anime and manga styling on a live action show.

561
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,339
Rym: I don't want to ruin the moment, because there's this moment where you kind of realize what the deal with this show is.

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,740
Rym: And it's basically when they make the flip books and he's like, "I am the best at everything.

563
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,070
Rym: I could just quit school right now and get a job,".

564
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:59,419
Rym: because his girlfriend girl is like- Who's not actually his girlfriend, but kind of his girlfriend.

565
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,660
Scott: Badminton team leader's girlfriend.

566
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,300
Rym: Yeah, but they're going out on dates, and they're friends, and it's weird.

567
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,859
Scott: It's weird.

568
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,016
Rym: And she's like, "You're pretty

569
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:06,200
Rym: good.".

570
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,373
Rym: He's like, "I'm the

571
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:07,798
Rym: best.".

572
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:08,939
Scott: And she's weird too.

573
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,940
Scott: You can't tell if she's serious or not.

574
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,178
Rym: Yeah, she's completely deadpan, and she's got three whooshes in her hair that really stand out.

575
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,500
Scott: Yeah, anime style.

576
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:16,900
Rym: Yep.

577
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:22,179
Rym: And he's like, "I am the best," and he makes the flip book, and he's like, "I have made a flip book.

578
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,466
Rym: The images move

579
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:24,694
Rym: dynamically.".

580
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,178
Rym: And then he gets to class, and everyone in the class is flipping out about this other flip book.

581
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,159
Rym: They're like, "Oh my God.

582
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,600
Rym: You got to see what Anno did.

583
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:32,948
Rym: Oh my

584
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,259
Rym: God.".

585
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:46,300
Rym: And you go over there, and the moment that makes this show is him seeing Anno's flip book and reacting to it, followed by Anno reacting to him in the next major scene.

586
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:46,799
Scott: Yep.

587
00:26:48,260 --> 00:27:04,280
Scott: If you like anime and manga, and you know something about the history of anime and manga- The fact that one of the characters in the show is an actor pretending to be Hideaki Anno in college- And that actor- Is already ridiculous enough.

588
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,840
Rym: When they show him, there's this glare on the glasses.

589
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,740
Scott: He's pretty much always in gendo pose all the time.

590
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:17,320
Rym: Or in what's-his-name is like, "I can't draw, and I have no intention of ever drawing.

591
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,328
Rym: I want to be a

592
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:19,619
Rym: producer.".

593
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:21,780
Scott: Yeah.

594
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:29,419
Scott: But it's just hilarious how the things they're doing in the show, making movies and animations and whatever, right?

595
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,940
Scott: But the show itself is also using the same film techniques to make the show look like a manga.

596
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:40,937
Scott: And in fact, even the things the characters in the show are making were made by the people who made the show.

597
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:49,260
Scott: It's so 80s and so apt and so- But whoever's making this is just so skilled, right?

598
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,680
Scott: The TV company, whoever.

599
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,820
Rym: Though at the same time, it makes it difficult to recommend this to everyone.

600
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,735
Scott: If you- Oh, no.

601
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,678
Scott: If you don't understand anime- If you don't recognize the name- And manga, this will just be insanity to you, and you'll be like, "What the fuck was

602
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:02,899
Scott: that?".

603
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,899
Rym: You got to at least know who Anno is.

604
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,131
Scott: Yeah, but if you're an anime or manga person, this will be the greatest thing that you will see.

605
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:22,119
Rym: So there's a moment where the crowd reacts to the film that Anno and his team made at the end of the episode, and then Anno gets mad and yells at a bunch of people for the way they reacted.

606
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:28,853
Rym: And in my mind, all I can imagine is what he was saying to people when they said, "You should really make an Evangelion

607
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,338
Rym: movie.".

608
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,819
Scott: Yeah, so think about how- No encore!

609
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,040
Rym: There will be no encore!

610
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:39,980
Scott: Think about how less funny that scene is if you don't know who the heck Anno is, right?

611
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:51,719
Rym: So if you have at least a cursory knowledge of the basic history of anime and some of the names of studios and names of people, you know who Anno is and some of the things he did, you can enjoy this.

612
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:58,639
Rym: If you don't know any of those things, you really should learn those things first and not watch this until you do.

613
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,660
Scott: Also, why don't you know those things?

614
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,600
Scott: Because you're nerdy in anime, manga-ish comic enough to listen to this episode of GeekNights on a Wednesday.

615
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,619
Scott: How come you don't know those things?

616
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,940
Rym: Scott, I only listen for the comic talk.

617
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:11,320
Rym: I only like superheroes.

618
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,818
Scott: We hardly ever do that ever.

619
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:14,160
Rym: I know.

620
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,299
Scott: Also, go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.

621
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,940
Scott: Yeah, seriously.

622
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:17,618
Scott: If you haven't seen it.

623
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,719
Scott: I mean, are you kidding me?

624
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:21,120
Scott: I should go watch it right the fuck now.

625
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,160
Rym: I can watch that show again.

626
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,680
Scott: I'll just skip work tomorrow and just marathon that motherfucker.

627
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:33,050
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

628
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:38,149
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

629
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,590
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

630
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,510
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

631
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,270
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
