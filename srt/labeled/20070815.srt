1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,787
Rym: It's Wednesday August 15th.

2
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:12,791
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,420
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:20,500
Rym: Tonight we explain how we would handle panels for a large anime convention.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,387
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:32,192
Scott: So check this Multifaceted leader bit out.

7
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:32,798
Scott: you ready for this?

8
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:36,979
Scott: Okay, let me start a little bit before so I can lead into it.

9
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:38,490
Scott: So I'm on the train to work.

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,780
Scott: get to Grand Central.

11
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:52,531
Scott: I got a poop so I go to the bathroom in Grand Central and I poop and Bathrooms not the greatest there But it's better than the bathroom on the train basically have to wait in line to get a less smelly But also smelly bathroom.

12
00:00:53,316 --> 00:01:08,760
Scott: so anyway I then go down to the subway, and I get on the subway train And I go and I go and I go and I go and then the train is pulling in to the station Where I get off and standing in front of me are two women.

13
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:16,409
Scott: They're they're obviously complete strangers and neither of them have any Acquaintances or accompanying people.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:23,140
Scott: they're they're alone all right and One woman one of the two was fat and a dignit.

15
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:34,987
Rym: You know it's funny because when I got to work Scott messages me and basically says oh, man Why I got something to talk about on the show tonight, and he wouldn't tell me what it was But you said it happened.

16
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:39,932
Rym: you know something with this commute and all I could think was you know It's not my commute because I said it when I got to work.

17
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,399
Scott: Yeah, when could it have happened?

18
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:49,900
Rym: So all I can think is it's probably Either some like a shooting or something or it's some big fat indignant person.

19
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:55,760
Scott: So this fat indignant lady is getting in the face of the non fat non indignant lady.

20
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,348
Rym: I'm going to already declare.

21
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,713
Rym: Who is the right party?

22
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,760
Rym: Who is the wrong party right now?

23
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,372
Scott: I basically didn't hear anything that either of them said.

24
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,800
Scott: not basically no words right.

25
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,020
Scott: But I watched them because it was interesting and I was getting off anyway.

26
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:15,220
Scott: And they also got off and the fattening dignit woman was getting fatter.

27
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,150
Scott: Well, maybe not fatter, but more indignant and more crazy.

28
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,000
Rym: You know she probably was actually getting fatter.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,900
Rym: I bet she had a scone or something for breakfast.

30
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:25,331
Scott: Maybe I don't know how you could lose weight when you're expending.

31
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:28,945
Scott: gain weight when you're expending that kind of energy But you eat that much food.

32
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:32,756
Scott: Maybe she wasn't super fat, but she was a fat person right.

33
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:35,285
Scott: so then you know We're going for the exit.

34
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:38,120
Scott: which of those you know this turnstiles that stupid people fuck up.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,600
Scott: You know the ones that are open all the time because you can't jump over them.

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:50,980
Scott: They're they're straight through and the non indignant person goes through not saying anything Completely ignoring the indignant lady and just walking which is what I would do.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,576
Scott: So I was like hey that lady's doing what I would do completely ignore this crazy lady and go to work.

38
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,603
Rym: was the indignant lady Still yelling or something?

39
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:59,187
Scott: she was yelling and doing whatever?

40
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:06,578
Scott: and then when the non-indignant person went through the turnstile the indignant person like Grabbed it to try to hold them in there and yell at them.

41
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,504
Rym: whoa That would have.

42
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:15,580
Rym: for me that would have been a punch to the face and a call to 911 Probably, but the the non-indignant lady just kept walking to work.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,523
Scott: she just kept going.

44
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:27,358
Scott: nah, so I go through the turnstile, and I'm following behind and The indignant lady begins to assault the non-indignant lady like really yeah, she like grabs her hair.

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,534
Scott: Then and whatever right.

46
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:41,480
Rym: once again, I would like to stress that if a stranger grabs my hair They're getting a broken nose something like that, and then the police are coming, but anyway the non-indignant lady She just kept ignoring the indignant lady.

47
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:49,351
Scott: She was sort of laughing and she kept walking as much as she could despite being assaulted And I thought to myself should I do something?

48
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:52,704
Scott: I could do something it wouldn't be hard But should I?

49
00:03:52,905 --> 00:04:11,025
Scott: and I thought back to the only similar incident we're at experience Which was the the purse snatcher, and I said in that situation Someone was being assaulted by someone else And it was perfectly legal and right for the people around who had nothing to do with it to detain The bad person.

50
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:16,959
Rym: I remember that story being great because more people came to stop and or in some way harm.

51
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:21,637
Rym: The purse snatcher then could hop possibly have helped so everyone ended up just standing around.

52
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:22,520
Rym: well like two guys got it

53
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:36,260
Scott: Basically I stayed close and I waited for the moment and The non-indignant person took the indignant lady cell phone and kind of tossed it into the street not like out into the street You know cars running over it, but like you know out on the curb.

54
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Scott: That's a pretty good diversionary tactic and then just kept walking and then I sort of grabbed the indignant lady.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,806
Scott: I detained her for like 15 seconds or so until the non-indignant person got away Just by walking.

56
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:49,850
Scott: she wasn't running or anything.

57
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,819
Scott: She was just walking and sort of going.

58
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,700
Scott: ha I didn't hear a single word that either of these people said at all.

59
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:16,417
Scott: I have no idea what was going on But I was watching them the entire time from on the subway when nothing was happening and no one was doing anything to One person clearly assaulting another person who wasn't doing shit, and then after about 15 seconds I just let her go and the only words I heard any of them say was after I let the lady go.

60
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:20,774
Scott: she said You see what she did to me, and she didn't say it to me.

61
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,180
Scott: She must because she wasn't looking at me.

62
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,607
Scott: I don't think she looked at me the whole time.

63
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:26,560
Rym: indignant people never seem to make eye contact with anyone.

64
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,447
Scott: They just come in there behind her.

65
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,592
Scott: cuz I was doing the old.

66
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,680
Scott: you know the full Nelson without applying for it.

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,327
Scott: You know the yeah full Nelson where you can't hit me, and you'd have to kick me, but you're fat So you can't possibly kick me.

68
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,156
Rym: She could have just fallen over backwards.

69
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:40,880
Rym: You would have been fucked.

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:49,879
Scott: No, I would have been fine, but you're in front of that gas station at the house did in Bleecker Lafayette over there wait Wait what did you say you were in front of like the only gas station?

71
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:54,925
Rym: Scott every time we talk about the city always ends up bringing up Yeah, there's no gas.

72
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,553
Scott: there are the number of gas.

73
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:59,726
Scott: there aren't zero gas stations But they are very very sparse.

74
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:06,439
Scott: and if you need evidence just go to this gas station and see how many Taxis go there because where else are they gonna go?

75
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:11,400
Scott: Anyway, so I gotta say the most disturbing part.

76
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,549
Scott: I mean that's not really an eventful story.

77
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:19,612
Scott: someone was indignant and was assaulting someone And I detained them for a short time, and then it was over.

78
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,237
Scott: and that was it right.

79
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,336
Scott: not very exciting But I got to say two things three things actually.

80
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:29,000
Scott: number one Touching that indignant lady was kind of disturbing.

81
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:33,940
Scott: I mean she was fat, and it really felt like she was just like I was holding her.

82
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:35,387
Scott: You know I had my arms around.

83
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:37,860
Scott: you know the under her arms and back around.

84
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:45,630
Scott: Her arms felt like they were just soft and flabby from skin to bone like there was nothing there And she didn't try to resist me either.

85
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:54,660
Scott: and if she did I didn't feel like thing Like not at all like not even a slight pushing, so it's like she was just accepting me restraining her there.

86
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,992
Rym: I don't know what maybe for all that blubber.

87
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,299
Rym: She didn't actually feel you.

88
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,870
Scott: Maybe I have no idea, but you know.

89
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,995
Scott: eventually you know.

90
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,860
Scott: after the other person was away She's like all right.

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,294
Scott: Let me go and just let her go.

92
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,948
Scott: I went to work And there was a guy at the get.

93
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,819
Scott: after that there was a guy at the gas station right just didn't you know?

94
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:11,180
Scott: a normal?

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,660
Scott: Gas-station kind of guy yeah, and he's like hey, man when people are fighting you just let him fight.

96
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:17,989
Scott: She could have had a knife or something.

97
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,765
Scott: that fat lady I was like.

98
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:21,268
Scott: I was like.

99
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,791
Scott: I knew she was all right, and I said you're afraid of her And he didn't say anything after that.

100
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,078
Rym: wow you own that guy.

101
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,017
Scott: yeah I should have said something like you're a coward, but I think no afraid of her is fine enough.

102
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:34,600
Rym: That's good enough.

103
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:38,038
Rym: Yeah, I think I would have handled the situation all told a little bit different.

104
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:38,460
Rym: probably.

105
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,973
Rym: The only difference is right way.

106
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:45,115
Rym: as soon as she touched the other lady I probably would have interposed myself and called for the police.

107
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,628
Scott: yeah the thing I realized though is like for something like this.

108
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,320
Scott: calling the police means I probably have to deal with shit.

109
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,164
Rym: Oh, no that seat.

110
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:54,149
Rym: That's fine cuz one.

111
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,959
Rym: I have an excuse to not be at work now?

112
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:57,121
Scott: No I don't want.

113
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:03,320
Scott: I'd rather go to work than deal with the be between the police and an indignant lady.

114
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:04,632
Scott: That is not where I want to be.

115
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,904
Scott: I want to go to work That.

116
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,978
Scott: I thought about that and also right.

117
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,340
Scott: I wasn't gonna wait around with these people for the police to show up when obviously the assaulted person didn't give a shit.

118
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:24,630
Rym: They just wanted to go to work and be done with this person as I could not blame them true But at the same time I feel like it's my civic duty to make sure that indignant people Get stripped of most of their dignity.

119
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,200
Scott: I think she was pretty undignified.

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:40,693
Rym: No Because you realize that people like that The dignity that they have left is pretty much just that they're still wearing clothes And they're not in jail Because they can't feel the shame of all the things that they do beyond that.

121
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:44,978
Rym: so unless you get them arrested or somehow naked There's nothing you can do anyway.

122
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:53,790
Scott: The last bit I want to add to this the meta bit that make that I think is more interesting than everything else is that While I was sitting there thinking about what to do right.

123
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,577
Scott: I was considering.

124
00:08:55,597 --> 00:09:09,510
Scott: You know all the things I already talked about considering and then such you know and Basically one thing that entered my consideration was man if I do something that'll make a great opening bit Ah, this is our cast is gonna.

125
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,154
Rym: Get us killed.

126
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:28,751
Scott: I don't know so I Thought about that for a while, and I said hey whenever we see famous people doing crazy shit And you're like what the fuck is wrong with these people There's probably something a lot like what I just thought like hey This will make a great opening bit going through their minds And they might not be as insane as we all think

127
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:29,354
Rym: it's the.

128
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:37,380
Scott: hey when I get on letterman I can talk about this or something who knows, but it sort of adds a little bit of explanation to why?

129
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,023
Scott: Famous people or other such people do things that we would say wow they're fucking nuts What's wrong with them?

130
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:51,209
Scott: and they get all over tabloids even though half of that stuff isn't true, but the stuff that is true It's like why are these people doing it living these crazy lives?

131
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,780
Scott: well because they're considering things like this.

132
00:09:55,041 --> 00:10:03,509
Scott: You know it'll make a great opening bit or similar things that normal people since you're not famous And you have no reason to ever consider those things.

133
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,488
Scott: They don't enter your mind, and they might even actually be thinking hey I'll do this crazy thing.

134
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,097
Scott: I'll be in People magazine or something.

135
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:10,479
Scott: I don't know.

136
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,720
Rym: I will say I don't think that that's Tom Cruise's motivation.

137
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:22,511
Scott: No, I don't think so either, but I do think that you know it made me realize hey famous people Slightly less crazy by a small amount than I thought.

138
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:28,673
Rym: I just want to reiterate that we here at GeekNights 100% dislike fat indignant people.

139
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:32,169
Scott: if you're fat and Indignant we don't like you.

140
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,018
Rym: you're pretty much at the top of the list.

141
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:44,512
Rym: you either You should either get unfat or get unindignant probably both at the same time because someone who's just indignant while they are very Very annoying they're not also fat.

142
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:55,879
Scott: and while someone who is like yeah The lady if it was an indignant lady and a non indignant lady, and they were both not fat it wouldn't have been Disgusting to have to detain one of them.

143
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:59,675
Rym: I think my order of hey of dislike of humans is pretty much at the top.

144
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,404
Rym: people who commit genocide And then indignant.

145
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:08,200
Scott: I don't know there are worse things you could do than genocide like well alright people who personally commit genocide.

146
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,420
Scott: Well, no you could just be completely indiscriminate and just kill millions of people for no reason with no nothing.

147
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,205
Rym: That's genocide just against humans.

148
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,716
Scott: well genocide is specifically when you're like killing one race or one.

149
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:21,060
Rym: yeah one race humans.

150
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,332
Rym: I'm just not good at it.

151
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,733
Rym: Okay, it's like in D&D when a ranger takes favored enemy human.

152
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,740
Scott: all right sure whatever.

153
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,532
Rym: But really it's like indignant people who are also fat and right under.

154
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:33,877
Rym: that is just indignant people.

155
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:38,233
Rym: and then fat people Oh, maybe people who smoke in the street in front of the building.

156
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:39,217
Rym: I'm trying to walk into it.

157
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:39,880
Scott: They're pretty bad.

158
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,540
Scott: They're usually also fat and indignant.

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,712
Rym: I always love the guys cuz there's always a bunch of them where I work smoking Right outside the door to the hospital that has a big you know law.

160
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,858
Rym: no smoking within 50 feet of the hospital.

161
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,360
Rym: sign right.

162
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,585
Scott: Why doesn't anyone do anything?

163
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:57,320
Rym: cops walk by and harass them periodically, but all right and they go away.

164
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,166
Rym: And then more people come and immediately start smoking.

165
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:02,959
Scott: they should paint a line around the thing that says you cannot smoke within this line.

166
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,112
Scott: Here's the best, and then if you smoke within that line They just take you to jail for a whole day.

167
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:12,557
Rym: the thing is Technically because of that you can't smoke anywhere in those city blocks cuz it's all hospital.

168
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:13,280
Scott: That's fine.

169
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:22,157
Scott: Oh, yeah I'm fine with that too, but but they should draw a line and say if you smoke within this line You go to jail for 24 hours, and you know what in jail no smoking.

170
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,622
Rym: now I wouldn't jail him.

171
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:24,104
Rym: why not?

172
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:33,300
Rym: because there's a much better way around this and that is to one take away their cigarette And then to find them some ludicrous amount thereby enriching the city's coffers.

173
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:37,778
Scott: I think you could find them and put them in jail so that will be without cigarettes for 24 hours.

174
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,219
Rym: Anyway, what do you got in the news?

175
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,088
Scott: Okay, so this is actually a I guess a serious news if you care about this person Or if you care about people in general.

176
00:12:49,551 --> 00:13:00,251
Scott: there's an artist for Marvel Comics I think for Marvel But it is a comic artist a famous underwear pervert comic artist named Mike Wiringo, and he died from a heart attack.

177
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:06,374
Scott: He was like 40 something or a heart disease and It seems like you know at least in my life.

178
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:07,480
Scott: I don't know about other people's lives.

179
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,779
Scott: There's a lot of dying of heart disease of middle-aged men.

180
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:27,402
Scott: It's sort of common, and you should watch out for it like my uncle and my friend's dad My other friend's dad, and yeah, and this guy so middle-aged men in America Heart disease dying not good I think it.

181
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:32,398
Rym: a lot of that has to do with poor diets lack of exercise sedentary lifestyle.

182
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,623
Scott: partially I'm a high-risk.

183
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:35,968
Scott: I think in my I am.

184
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:41,366
Rym: I'm quite certain that you are a moderate to high risk for heart disease related death Even though my cholesterol is just fine.

185
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,168
Scott: anyway for now.

186
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:42,610
Rym: You're young.

187
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,259
Scott: the thing is this guy's art is really not so bad.

188
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,603
Scott: Hey, I've looked.

189
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:49,512
Scott: I have a. I think I have one of his comics somewhere.

190
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:51,538
Scott: I think friendly neighborhood spider-man something.

191
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,945
Scott: It's it's alright It's good stuff.

192
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:53,992
Rym: So what's he done?

193
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,382
Scott: He did Like.

194
00:13:56,583 --> 00:14:16,424
Scott: I think he started off working on the flash in like 93 And he did like a recent Fantastic Four miniseries And a whole bunch of stuff, and he's pretty good at the arts, but unrelated to this guy dying You know prematurely I guess if you want to call it that I Realize something else.

195
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:25,415
Scott: when you start looking at comic creators at least American comic creators You know artists and writers of underwear perfect comics from DC and Marvel.

196
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:34,900
Scott: most of those people I mean sure right some of them are not, but most of those people are middle-aged guys Who like underwear perverts?

197
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:50,551
Scott: I mean, I think I know one or two female artists or writers of underwear perfect comics from Marvel or DC And I know like if you look at some of the better ones like Brian K Vaughn he's younger than a lot of the other guys the guy who writes DMZ.

198
00:14:50,592 --> 00:15:13,199
Scott: He's also younger than a lot of the other guys and I think that that is one of the main reasons now that I realize it It's sad that I realized it because a guy died but unrelated I realized that part of the reason underwear perfect comics are kind of stuck in a rut is because you have this one demographic of people Doing the large majority of the creative work on them.

199
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:23,420
Rym: Yep in fact I despite the fact that I mean the comic industry seems to really be trying to Kind of come back and take a stand against this manga business and actually sell some comics.

200
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:34,884
Rym: Regardless of their success or how we think they should do things differently It still just seems that there's unless they change something which might in the end just involve a whole new crop of artists and writers Coming in.

201
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,460
Rym: they're slowly going the route of sci-fi fandom.

202
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:50,250
Rym: Yeah, I mean sci-fi fandom not to disparage sci-fi or sci-fi fandom But it has definitely gotten into a rut a very deep ruts Yeah, and when I looked out me go to a sci-fi convention.

203
00:15:50,311 --> 00:16:12,869
Scott: and I realize when I look at all the other comics the non Underwear pervert non Marvel non DC mainstream comics in America like the indie comics and the manga the creators are Sort of a lot mix of genders a mix of you know Different ages, you know, you got young people you got old people you got all sorts of in-betweens and it's not just one demographic of people.

204
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:21,717
Scott: and I think that's a One of the strong reasons that the other sorts of comics are coming up with all the better ideas instead of doing the same thing over and over again.

205
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:32,847
Scott: because Comics are one of those mediums where there's a lot more Making it for yourself than there is in other things, you know when someone in Hollywood makes a movie They're making that movie to make money.

206
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,523
Scott: They're not making a movie because the director really likes the movie He's making.

207
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:44,981
Scott: but in comics when people write or draw comic There's a good chance that they like the thing they've written or drawn and it's you know it's partially.

208
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:49,170
Scott: they really wrote it or drew it for their own enjoyment to suit their own tastes.

209
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:57,980
Scott: and When you have one set of tastes doing most of the creative work like 90% plus you're only gonna get one kind of comic.

210
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:08,454
Rym: So in other news, it looks like the New York Anime Festival is once again doing everything Right, or at least as far as we can tell because they've already announced at least one of their musical acts.

211
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:11,451
Scott: Oh so early I mean the cons not until December.

212
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:12,739
Scott: they must be on the fucking ball.

213
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,780
Rym: Well considering I mean, we're pretty much already set to go with the New York Anime Festival.

214
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:24,099
Rym: But yeah, they've got unicorn table which according to the anime news network a j-pop band of some sort or j-rock.

215
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,308
Rym: I don't know Japanese pop rock.

216
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,109
Scott: Okay.

217
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,900
Scott: It's a j-prock j-prock j-prock.

218
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:33,439
Rym: But yeah, I mean, I don't have much to say about that.

219
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:43,040
Rym: But what I do have to say is that if you live anywhere in the New York City area It really might be worth your effort in December to come check out the New York Anime Festival at least for one day.

220
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:54,977
Scott: Yeah in short I used to think that the I'm still skeptical and I thought that the anime the New York Anime Festival was going to be a Complete and utter failure because it's run by the same company that runs the New York Comic Con.

221
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:55,900
Scott: It's for profit.

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,932
Scott: It's in the Javits Center in New York in December and all those things are like, whoa That's not a good formula for an anime con.

223
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:03,053
Scott: The

224
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:15,880
Rym: only reason it's not a good formula It's just that if you've been to anime cons anime cons aren't like any other kind of convention and Just the things that people do at them and the way the crowds react to things and the things the crowds expect to be there.

225
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:24,174
Rym: If you don't know you don't have any sort of expertise as to exactly how to deal with these people You're not gonna have a good time running a con.

226
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,040
Scott: and the environment.

227
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,420
Scott: I mean in the winter bad weather in the Javits Center bad convention center for profit lots of money.

228
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,632
Scott: Things aren't gonna be run this the way they're run at a fan-run convention Pissing off a lot of the goers who are used to fan-run conventions.

229
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:50,307
Scott: It's not a good recipe, but They have gotten my hopes up because they have said apparently it appears to me from information I know that they are outsourced.

230
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,234
Rym: You know, we've already talked about this a bunch of time.

231
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:52,576
Rym: Have we?

232
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:55,187
Rym: Yeah, okay I wasn't gonna bring that up.

233
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:58,340
Scott: They're outsourcing a bunch of the stuff to people who know how to do it.

234
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:00,289
Scott: It's like, you know to other people.

235
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,238
Rym: Well, it's not just that it's more that they're also just looking Asking people who do run these cards, you know.

236
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,048
Rym: So, how do you deal with anime fans?

237
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:09,640
Rym: and they seem to really have done their research on this crowd?

238
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:16,454
Scott: Yep, so I think they're gonna do Maybe the best they can given the unavoidable circumstances.

239
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:17,840
Rym: I think it's gonna be a pretty good con.

240
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,865
Rym: I mean we're gonna be set up.

241
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:22,463
Scott: we have an artist that would be fun for me whether or not it's fun for you and worth Your money.

242
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,679
Rym: Well, we've got an artist alley table.

243
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:29,619
Rym: Dave and Joel said they want to come with us and do some stuff, but they haven't gotten back to me since then.

244
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:37,967
Rym: So, I guess I'll light a little fire under their collective ass, yep, and yeah, New York anime festival We're actually gonna go to it.

245
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:40,117
Rym: We'll talk about it a lot more as the event comes up.

246
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:54,963
Rym: I mean, it's It's many months away But suffice to say we are running our match game times two and we're running a panel somewhat similar to the one We ran at Otakon, but with a much more educational bent and a much less Rape.

247
00:19:55,024 --> 00:20:04,748
Rym: tacular vents things of the day.

248
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:08,470
Scott: This thing of the day combines so many things.

249
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,105
Scott: I think it is the ultimate thing of the day in terms of things.

250
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:11,830
Scott: it has you ready.

251
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:21,018
Scott: It's from the TV in Japan blog, of course Japanese television always saving the day on Wednesday when I have no better thing of the day to go for.

252
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:25,939
Rym: yeah coach speak for if we're lazy search for Japanese TV There's gonna be something.

253
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,302
Rym: Yep.

254
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:27,471
Scott: So get ready Don't.

255
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:31,326
Scott: this is it's a Japanese TV show that shows guys making stuff with Legos.

256
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:35,043
Scott: That's pretty crazy Alright, so you got Legos and get Japanese TV.

257
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,469
Scott: What else do you have here?

258
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,489
Scott: Well at the very beginning of the first video, I hear some Paul Paul Oakenfold music going on.

259
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:42,696
Scott: So you got some trance.

260
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:44,165
Scott: there's another geeky thing.

261
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:53,782
Scott: now you've also got the they're making one guy makes like a Like a otaku maid like a maid and so there you got.

262
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,767
Scott: you got otaku and moe going on.

263
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,171
Rym: That's kind of creepy yeah,

264
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:16,465
Scott: but most of the people make animals and robots and that sort of thing and it's a seven part video and I'm linking to where there's only parts one and two but then they have a link to parts three through seven on a YouTube channel that you can go do and If you like Legos Japanese TV and all sorts of nerdy stuff all in one.

265
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,270
Scott: This is quite a thing of the day.

266
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:23,370
Rym: So we talk every now and then about how anime music videos used to be funny.

267
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,348
Rym: You're awesome back in the day and we're sick of a lot of the ones we see at cons.

268
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:36,534
Rym: now here is one of the anime music videos that we showed at the RIT anime club a long time ago to raucous applause and Thunderous laughter.

269
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:42,613
Scott: This is one of the funniest and most creative Music video.

270
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:48,370
Rym: now part of the channel music video is that it was made really kind of craftily on bad equipment and poorly.

271
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,418
Rym: It's not the most technically well done.

272
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,084
Scott: The resolution is low.

273
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,790
Rym: I mean you think YouTube's making it look bad.

274
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:54,878
Rym: No, it looked that bad.

275
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,410
Scott: It's a pretty bad video.

276
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,017
Scott: I think I had a flash of it originally.

277
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:00,750
Scott: I don't really remember but it's a low quality video.

278
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:13,990
Rym: The thing is it it's proves that if you have the core idea for a video that's good enough and you do enough clever things With the music to make it match in a good way a video no matter how craftily it's made can be awesome.

279
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,229
Scott: So I mean people made videos back in the day like the Jeff de Teric with like two VHS decks and they were.

280
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,048
Scott: some of Them were great.

281
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:30,289
Scott: So there's no reason why a low resolution low production value video can't be awesome As long as the concept and the execution of the concept are awesome.

282
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:39,310
Rym: granted I still think and I've said this before that the only reason we say music videos suck today Is that due to the ways that anime conventions handle their anime music video contests?

283
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,070
Rym: It almost self selects against the good videos because they usually won't let you enter their contest if you've already won somewhere else.

284
00:22:46,613 --> 00:23:06,142
Scott: Yes, if I was gonna say I said it before I'll say it again If I ran an anime convention ahead at any decision-making power over the AMV contest My anime convention would only allow you to enter your video if you had won a contest not entered But won a contest within the since the past.

285
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,650
Scott: is you know edition of my convention?

286
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,510
Scott: So if I had my convention on August one every year if you video didn't win some award

287
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:16,613
Rym: If you video

288
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:26,388
Scott: if your video didn't win an award at another convention, that wasn't mine since August 1st last year I'm not gonna let you show it at my convention because it didn't win an award.

289
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:26,750
Scott: It sucks.

290
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,677
Rym: I think there was an easier way to phrase that.

291
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:32,050
Rym: yeah, the video had to have won an award within the past year?

292
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:33,375
Scott: Oh something like that.

293
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,687
Scott: Yeah, I got to be real specific though because you know these people?

294
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,142
Rym: no You really don't because people don't really harp on you about things like that.

295
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,130
Scott: No, but they you just see people.

296
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:45,050
Scott: Yeah, you imagine if you're running an anime convention?

297
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,557
Rym: No, no your list of rules.

298
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:54,049
Rym: if I was running if I was actually running it then yes I'd write the rules that way, but if I was describing the idea to someone you got cuz.

299
00:23:54,109 --> 00:24:09,490
Rym: yeah I mean we actually Alex and I actually laugh at you a lot about this just because whenever we talk about a board game and You like you find out about a board game that we don't know about and you want to tell us about it Instead of telling us the core idea first you go on for like 10 minutes about the minute details that we don't care about.

300
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,570
Scott: I got to be real specific.

301
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:13,536
Rym: No You don't tell people about you.

302
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:22,609
Rym: jump on me anytime if I if I leave something out or if it's vague you like oh But you start with the guy or you got to sell it on the car the sell the idea on the car.

303
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:28,749
Rym: like How about a music video contest that only allows the best music videos in the ones that won contests recently?

304
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,240
Rym: Not imagine you Within the last year.

305
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,870
Scott: Well, what if your convention was like a year and a week ago?

306
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,061
Scott: And I might convey my my video won an award in that week.

307
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:41,004
Rym: tough shit.

308
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,017
Scott: Uh-huh doesn't matter You see where I'm going.

309
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:46,063
Rym: Yeah, I see where you're going.

310
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:58,209
Rym: All right, but anyway Speaking of running anime conventions we've talked about doing a show like this for a while partly because I don't want to bother writing an email to certain interested parties as To how I would do this.

311
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:03,388
Rym: but you all know that Otakon had some trouble with its panels department this previous year.

312
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:16,450
Scott: and Not only did Otakon have trouble with their panels department But pretty much fan run cons all cons that I've been to anime cons at least Gaming cons to in general cons a million times worse.

313
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:17,553
Rym: Yeah We won't get into that.

314
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:22,528
Scott: but cons in general that I've been to in reason that how many years we've been going to cons?

315
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,853
Scott: a long Time.

316
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:37,828
Scott: they always either have panels that are run Sub-perfectly for whatever reason it might not be the fault of people running them but panel either panels that are run with some problems or the quality of the panels is low.

317
00:25:37,908 --> 00:25:41,758
Scott: and while You can't guarantee quality of panels.

318
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,428
Scott: when the panels are run by fans you can raise the bar.

319
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,190
Scott: it is possible.

320
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:49,341
Rym: Well, I mean the real thing is I mean, I'm not.

321
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:50,826
Rym: these are people running things for fun.

322
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:51,870
Rym: They're like fan panelists.

323
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,570
Rym: I want to run a panel about Naruto and whatever and that's really what it's all about.

324
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:12,240
Rym: But at the same time cons don't really seem to worry about Checking these people out at all or making any effort to find out if these people are actually going to run a panel if they Even a shred of professionalism if they even know about the topic they're doing their panel on if they're even gonna show up.

325
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,579
Rym: and this isn't an indictment against Otakon because A lot of people think we're talking about Otakon.

326
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,246
Scott: We're not because it the recent problem, but we're not.

327
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,470
Scott: we're talking about all cons.

328
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:27,629
Rym: yes, because Otakon's problem wasn't really that there was a specific problem that happened before the con in the staff.

329
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:45,009
Rym: and Despite that all cons most of the fan panels are just really crappy and unprofessional and and they usually end up either being the one mumbly guy who shows up spends ten minutes in front of the assembled crowd fiddling with his laptop because he can't make It work and then mumbles about Resident Evil for an hour.

330
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:51,450
Rym: Or it's like the ten guys all sit up at the front and kind of make inside jokes at each other for an hour.

331
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,577
Scott: Yep, and while not all of the fan run panels are like that there are Too many that are like that.

332
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:08,288
Scott: and even if cons do do some of the things that we're gonna talk about To filter out some of the bad panelists and such they're not doing them well enough and they could be doing it better.

333
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:27,948
Scott: and we're Gonna tell you right now in this episode if we were the gods of running panels at an anime a fan run Convention anime or otherwise this is what we would do to make the panels awesome Guaranteed with such an incredibly small chance of failure like the convention center would have to set on fire to fuck it up.

334
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:31,210
Rym: now A bunch of the you know how we're gonna set this up for one.

335
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,863
Rym: This is not just like Oh pie in the sky.

336
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:41,790
Rym: if we had the resources This is what me and Scott together could do for an anime convention straight up without any impact on our lives.

337
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:48,381
Scott: Yep, you can almost consider this an offer To any anime convention that wants someone to run their panels.

338
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:51,150
Rym: Well, it's nearby any large anime convention.

339
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,175
Scott: Yeah, I'm not gonna run it.

340
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,667
Scott: I could run panels for a really small convention.

341
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:55,190
Scott: take me a day.

342
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:59,890
Rym: Well, the second thing is that we're assuming that this is a large anime convention.

343
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,733
Rym: What are the bigger ones?

344
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:11,230
Rym: because I mean if a con is really small and like 4,000 or 2,000 people show up You can't really pick and choose because you're probably going to get less panel applications than you have panel time.

345
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:14,329
Rym: Anyway, but I kind of like Otakon or Katsucon.

346
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:26,320
Rym: they're so gigantic and So many people want to run panels that you'd think they could pick and choose a little bit and at least get you know The above-average panelists overall over time.

347
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:29,170
Scott: Yeah, I mean I understand with something like the artists alley, right?

348
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,773
Scott: You might be thinking it's you know artists alley is first come first serve which is as it should be.

349
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:58,501
Scott: but you know, you might be thinking well if the panel should also become be first come first serve and Artists that you know, if you're gonna pick and choose for quality on panels You should pick and choose for quality and artists alley which sort of seems wrong But they're sort of different in that the artists alley is sort of like that you're selling tables so Choosing who you're gonna sell to is sort of like discriminatory.

350
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:04,899
Scott: Whereas choosing who gets to be an entertainer You know, it's it's not the same thing.

351
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,123
Scott: Don't make them equal.

352
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:08,150
Scott: I could make a better case, but whatever.

353
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,910
Rym: Well, it doesn't matter because we're really narrowing this down.

354
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:14,650
Rym: The other thing is we're not going to talk about industry panels guest panels any of that.

355
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:22,525
Rym: We're going to assume that either we'd had we can handle that on our own or that Another part of the staff body of our fictional con.

356
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:23,470
Rym: We'll call it con con.

357
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:27,259
Scott: Yeah Industry and guest panels are basically sort of this automatic thing.

358
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,099
Scott: if industry or guests want panels they get them that we schedule them before We schedule anything else.

359
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:37,590
Scott: they take precedence the end of story And we also we make sure that the industry and the guests don't screw up their panels.

360
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:40,244
Scott: But usually they're very professional and they don't.

361
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:48,170
Rym: so of course The first thing we have to talk about is communication because no anime con does this as far as I know and I'm really surprised.

362
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:52,270
Rym: Why don't they just use Google for domains and Gmail for domain?

363
00:29:52,510 --> 00:30:01,175
Scott: I have no idea why they don't use that because I've noticed and I used to think you know There's so many overlaps between geekeries, you know It's like video gaming people.

364
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:06,690
Scott: they tell anime people tend to like video games video gamers tend to like technology and computers, right?

365
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:15,190
Scott: But it doesn't go all the way across and anime people are mostly not Technology people and they really have a hard time with computers.

366
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:19,630
Scott: I'm always surprised at anime people who like they don't know much about computers.

367
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:27,468
Scott: They know how to go on YouTube and 4chan and it more than the average person But for the most part they don't know shit and they should listen to ignites Mondays.

368
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,870
Rym: Yep Now I'm not gonna get into all the details of why we would do that.

369
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,196
Rym: We could do a separate show on that.

370
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:35,570
Rym: even you know exactly why I can't should use Gmail for domains.

371
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:47,061
Rym: But suffice to say we would set it up so that whatever, you know panels at con con comm goes to both myself and Scott and Goes to the head of our department and to the con chair.

372
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:51,510
Rym: now maybe in a separate folders or a separate tag So they don't see all those messages.

373
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,386
Rym: But if Scott and I suddenly die all those messages are still there are.

374
00:30:56,426 --> 00:31:06,650
Rym: also if there's a problem Higher ups in the chain of command can look at what we're doing Because of course we are obligated to use our con addresses for any and all correspondence related to the con.

375
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,335
Rym: None of it so many cons.

376
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:15,617
Rym: they'll be like panels at the con comm but then whoever's running the panels will decide that they want To use their AOL account and they'll tell people.

377
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:19,870
Rym: Yeah, you should contact me this way instead and that's crap and unprofessional.

378
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,678
Rym: I'm not gonna say anything beyond that.

379
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:34,840
Scott: Another thing is that we would make sure Because whenever I send an email out Let's say I'm the panels guy and I get an email at panels whatever and I reply to it I will bcc it to panels at whatever.

380
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:43,032
Scott: that way my the people above me in the ranks of the cod can see the emails I am sending out as well as in and They will.

381
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:46,904
Scott: they should be monitoring me as they should be monitoring all the staff.

382
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,529
Scott: They are directly responsible for.

383
00:31:48,550 --> 00:32:03,457
Scott: maybe Not actively, but if they see that I'm not responding to emails, you know within a day or two If I don't get on that I should be fired and someone else should replace me as should any Position that requires communication with the public.

384
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:19,256
Rym: now also along those lines very clearly and stated on the website everywhere we would say and in any correspondence we even have a little footer that would say if you email us the panels guys and You don't get a response within 48 hours Email us again.

385
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:27,290
Rym: If you do not get a response to that within 48 hours Alternate contact info that goes to someone higher up than us who can kick our asses.

386
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:37,068
Scott: yep, and if you know it pretty much the only way that system can fail is if the entire chain of you know command and the convention is irresponsible and doesn't check their email if you.

387
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,058
Scott: This goes for anything conventions or not.

388
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:48,462
Scott: If you have an email address that is public and is You're requesting people, you know to email it for whatever reason.

389
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:50,969
Scott: Let's say you're accepting job applications or your.

390
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:56,540
Scott: Yeah, you're asking for feedback on an RFC or who knows what.

391
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,633
Scott: you should be checking that email address all the goddamn time Constantly.

392
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:09,906
Scott: no one should ever email you and then be worried that you didn't get it or not Knowing if you got it or you get you got to put up the auto away messages.

393
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:12,376
Scott: when you go on vacation You have to do those things.

394
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:22,390
Scott: if people email you and that they don't know what the status is and they are forced to wait More than like 48 hours to know what's going on at least an auto confirmation email or something.

395
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:22,952
Rym: Yes, what?

396
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:36,430
Rym: I would do no matter what even if I couldn't respond right away say we're super busy with stuff Even though I'm reasonably certain that even for the largest anime con I could personally respond to any and all emails that came into the panel's email address.

397
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,483
Rym: I I also could within 48 hours with two of us.

398
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:43,219
Rym: we could do it super easily But I'd have a couple of boilerplates ready.

399
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,770
Rym: that basically said I've received your email.

400
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,850
Rym: We will get back with you within X amount of time.

401
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,106
Rym: If you don't hear from us within X amount of time email us again or contact this person.

402
00:33:52,207 --> 00:34:01,025
Scott: the number one problem I have with pretty much all so communicating with people I don't know on the internet professionally is that I email them and they just never reply.

403
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:02,590
Scott: and I know I email them.

404
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,274
Scott: It's in my out.

405
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:04,983
Scott: It's in my sent emails box.

406
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:06,230
Scott: The address is correct.

407
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:07,776
Scott: What what's wrong with them?

408
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:08,780
Scott: check your email?

409
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:11,030
Scott: If you're not checking your email, you're not cut out for the job.

410
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,629
Scott: Do something else is not for you.

411
00:34:12,871 --> 00:34:19,353
Rym: Well, like last year, you know We did all these cons and all our shows everywhere and the only con we wanted to do things at that We didn't is the.

412
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:23,150
Rym: it was anime next because I emailed them like four or five times.

413
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:32,350
Scott: I even one of the guys who runs amv's at anime next is a listener and I met him at Otakon And I know him and he he's kind of cool and even so didn't help anything.

414
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:35,300
Rym: Yeah, just no one ever responded to any address.

415
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,623
Rym: I sent anything to with that con.

416
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:42,469
Rym: So eventually I just said fine We're not gonna bother giving you guys our content and I like anime next.

417
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,764
Rym: But unless they contact us, I don't know if any of them listen.

418
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,170
Rym: They're never gonna get us there.

419
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,255
Scott: I told you one of them listens.

420
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,444
Rym: Yeah, maybe other of them should.

421
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:56,321
Scott: maybe they should but Respond to email all the email addresses that are on your website.

422
00:34:56,681 --> 00:35:01,413
Scott: if someone emails any of those they should get some sort of response Very quickly.

423
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,743
Scott: You should not leave anyone hanging ever for any reason.

424
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,330
Scott: There's no reason email is so easy.

425
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:08,361
Scott: What's wrong with you?

426
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:09,169
Scott: learn to type now?

427
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:19,066
Rym: Obviously the exceptions to that are like the super high staffers like the con chair and the whatever the con chairs job is not to Respond to even the people who shouldn't be dealing with the public directly on a day-to-day basis.

428
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:23,220
Scott: and in that case But I'm saying it's so every email address.

429
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,224
Scott: It's someone's job.

430
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:32,270
Rym: No, I'm saying even with those It'd be pretty easy to have a boilerplate that basically says you should probably contact someone else for your concern.

431
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,229
Rym: Yeah, all right, even so all right.

432
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:36,529
Rym: The second thing is time now.

433
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:45,961
Rym: I don't think is out of the realm that I would say that say the con ended this past weekend and You know con con and the next con con is a year from now.

434
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:51,190
Rym: I would start planning the panels About two weeks after the previous con ended.

435
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:59,190
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not like if you know that you're going to have another con and it's not some question mark sort of thing Why not get started on panels immediately?

436
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,330
Scott: I mean, you know that you're gonna need, you know, many many hours of panel entertainment.

437
00:36:04,753 --> 00:36:07,390
Scott: Why not give people an entire year to get ready for it?

438
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,222
Scott: There's no reason not to start right away.

439
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:09,283
Scott: in

440
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:34,510
Rym: the very least The first thing I would do is now we'll talk about How I would decide who to contact later when we talk about what to do at the con, but I would email Everyone who did a panel that was good in some way based on the metrics we had and basically say all right You did a good job get in touch with us Once you have ideas for what you might like to run next year and I can pretty much guarantee that will give you high consideration.

441
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:52,250
Rym: Yeah I'd maintain relationships Relationships with all the people who did good panels in previous years and I keep in contact with them throughout the year to make sure That if they want to do something and I think that what they want to do is good and I know they've done good things In the past that I am there to help them do the thing they want to do.

442
00:36:52,934 --> 00:37:02,599
Scott: But on the same token if someone did a bad panel I would make sure to know who they were and not let them do a panel again Even if they ask and are very nice and professional.

443
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,308
Rym: Yes, we would definitely have the good list and the shit list.

444
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,865
Rym: now These would be private and internal and secret.

445
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:12,149
Scott: Yes You don't tell people that they're on the shit list of the good list, but you just you do it.

446
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,389
Scott: You know, there's no what's wrong with you.

447
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:22,930
Scott: The other thing is that remember we were just talking about Responding to emails in the same way that the con has to respond to emails very quickly and efficiently.

448
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:26,788
Scott: So do the panelists if I email panelists and they don't get back to me.

449
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:27,313
Scott: They're.

450
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,428
Scott: just forget about you.

451
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:32,203
Scott: If you're you know, you're not if you don't respond within the dates that I set.

452
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:35,481
Scott: if you miss the deadline by you know A day forget you.

453
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:39,064
Scott: I got other people Yes more people who want panels at this con.

454
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:40,030
Scott: it could do a good job.

455
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:43,209
Scott: Then there are is time for there to be panels.

456
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:47,566
Scott: Therefore I have no problem just kicking people off for the slightest reason.

457
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:53,350
Rym: now early on You know for the months after the previous car, you know kicking people off then because it's it's so early.

458
00:37:53,410 --> 00:38:03,350
Rym: Yeah, the deadlines would pretty much be like I'd set a point like maybe a month before the con whereupon Panelists must maintain either semi constant contact like once a week.

459
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:07,189
Rym: I'm gonna email you to check on your status and I want you to respond to me.

460
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:20,999
Rym: Of course, we could set up considerations for I'm going out of town for two weeks before the con But I'm committing to being there and those kinds of people, you know, you make exceptions But I would know everyone's situation whatever that situation was.

461
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:31,110
Rym: the moral is be documented if I Cannot get into contact with a panelist in the month before the con and I try and I give and I don't know where they are.

462
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:32,598
Rym: They're not getting a panel.

463
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:35,935
Rym: and if they show up the con and say I thought I had a panel Well, they're not getting one.

464
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:37,924
Scott: Why didn't I hear from you when I emailed you?

465
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,250
Scott: I didn't hear from you.

466
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:41,579
Scott: I thought you let you I thought you died or I could.

467
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,603
Scott: I couldn't guarantee that you were gonna show up and do this panel So I just canceled you.

468
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:57,383
Rym: now Along those lines if a panelist, you know gives an application and the email address they give me is not valid in bounces I am NOT going to attempt to contact them again, and they do not have a panel.

469
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,170
Scott: Yeah, basically there's you have.

470
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:07,790
Scott: As long as I was at a big enough con where the demand for panels was less than the supply I would basically Well, I think you mean the other way around.

471
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:12,544
Scott: No, the demand for panels is less than the supply of time to do panels in.

472
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:14,210
Rym: oh you mean the demand of people.

473
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,010
Rym: What what demand are you talking about?

474
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,964
Scott: There are more people who want panels.

475
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:18,891
Scott: the demand I.

476
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:21,582
Rym: there are panels to give out because normally it's the demand.

477
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,630
Rym: as in how many panels does the con need?

478
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,500
Scott: I'm talking about demand from the people not demand from the con.

479
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:31,234
Scott: All right, so the con has a greater as Less of a demand.

480
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:32,699
Scott: whatever you get the point.

481
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,750
Rym: There are more panelists than panel slots to fill exactly.

482
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:46,208
Scott: Yes, then I would have no qualms about just canceling panelists and eliminating them for even What would some people would consider to be slight transgressions?

483
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:54,599
Scott: I mean if I say this is the application form to fill out to apply for a panel and someone fills out the form improperly I'm no second chances.

484
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:55,021
Scott: You're done.

485
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:56,910
Scott: Oh, no, I really throw those in the trash.

486
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,479
Rym: I mean it depends on how much how many panels we need.

487
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,459
Rym: it does because I would probably email them back and say All right, you did not fill the form out correctly.

488
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:09,913
Scott: try again, yeah, it depends, you know, but if it's if it's deadline time Oh, yeah, it's.

489
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:17,870
Rym: it's not enough all this, you know being harsh with panelists And if you're not in contact and you can't we can't talk to you and you don't fill things out, right?

490
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,448
Rym: Then you're done.

491
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:22,100
Rym: That is all reserved for the month before the con.

492
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:31,110
Scott: the point that I'm trying to make is that I'll be much more harsh Than conventions currently are Because if I was you have no reason not to be more harsh.

493
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,100
Scott: That's the way to up the quality is to cut the wheat from the chaff.

494
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:39,449
Rym: now in terms of the applications themselves I would probably set up if the con could get it.

495
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,110
Rym: I mean a lot of con websites are really piss-poor behind the scenes.

496
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:53,250
Rym: But some sort of panels application on the website I could make it because I have the knowledge to do so Yeah, it's just a matter of it could be integrated properly with the convention website.

497
00:40:53,378 --> 00:41:03,070
Rym: Yeah But aside from that I would also in addition to that have a link on that page to a template in Various formats and that template you could just fill it out and then email it to us.

498
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,638
Rym: So there's two ways to apply for a panel.

499
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,444
Rym: now the template itself.

500
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:12,360
Rym: the way you have to apply for a panel Would be a lot more than most cons ask for.

501
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:22,290
Rym: I mean certain unnamed cons have in the past Basically asked us what our names were and what the title of our panel was and they didn't ever respond.

502
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:25,521
Rym: And then we showed up at the panel and sure enough there we were.

503
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:26,625
Rym: we had a panel listed.

504
00:41:26,705 --> 00:41:33,890
Scott: just by telling them our names And our panel title they were able to decide which panels to have and which ones not just based on the titles and the names.

505
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:34,854
Rym: Now we're talking.

506
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:36,923
Rym: they didn't even respond and confirm.

507
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:38,530
Rym: We assumed we didn't have a panel.

508
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:41,746
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of better not even trying.

509
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,650
Rym: I showed up at the con.

510
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,018
Rym: I was like, yeah, we're guests and they just gave us guest badges.

511
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,062
Scott: great.

512
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:46,844
Rym: Awesome.

513
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:49,553
Rym: Sadly a lot of cons are like that But that's again.

514
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,958
Rym: That's a totally different issue.

515
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,306
Rym: Yeah, and I can say that Otakon is good about that.

516
00:41:53,326 --> 00:42:08,875
Scott: They are but Pretty much the application form would have your names and I would not allow you to put the names of you the contact person and their email address and your phone number and The names email address and phone numbers of all the other Panelists and I would never.

517
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:13,293
Scott: I would have a limit on the number of people you could have as panelists now Maybe like four.

518
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,023
Rym: I think four is the absolute maximum I would allow.

519
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,910
Rym: now, of course that is on the application.

520
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:31,850
Rym: Obviously someone could convince me this panel requires more whatever But I will say that it has been my experience that any panel that is more than four people on it is almost Invariably now again only fan panels not industry or whatever going to be shitty.

521
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:35,010
Rym: Yep, but again, that's a case-by-case basis thing.

522
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,379
Rym: But in terms of contact information.

523
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,010
Rym: one person is applying for the panel.

524
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:46,907
Rym: They will give me a list of all the panelists they expect or if they don't know that right away Then the number of panelists they expect to have.

525
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:52,090
Rym: yeah And they will give me if they can an alternate contact person in case I cannot reach them.

526
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:59,759
Rym: but suffice to say They're gonna have to give me contact info and if they don't respond They're probably not going to get a panel and two.

527
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,087
Rym: they have to apply with their real name.

528
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:05,845
Scott: Mm-hmm Not you know, Joey Jojo Shava dude.

529
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:07,172
Scott: That's not gonna work out Right.

530
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,810
Scott: next they got to give me the panel title or what?

531
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,969
Rym: They'd like the panel title to be or at least the topic of the panel.

532
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:20,273
Scott: Yep, then they got to give me a description of the panel and I'm not talking like this is gonna be a panel where I talk About Robo tech.

533
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,697
Scott: that's not gonna cut it.

534
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:28,470
Rym: You need I need some paragraphs here possibly essay quality stuff I think for this, I mean we're talking about the initial applications.

535
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:40,329
Rym: I need two solid paragraphs that describe what you want this panel to be what bases you want to cover how long it should run What resources you're probably gonna need or expect to need all that sort of stuff?

536
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:54,050
Rym: Yep, and then along right after that There's another section kind of your con essay where you have to tell me what cons you've presented for in the past What panels you have run what clubs you have run what the experience you have?

537
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,903
Rym: Maybe you have a public speaking degree or something.

538
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:56,366
Rym: I don't care.

539
00:43:56,386 --> 00:44:02,548
Scott: basically I want to know what credentials you and or any other panelists have.

540
00:44:02,568 --> 00:44:08,126
Scott: that Try to convince me with you know, your credentials why you're a good panelist.

541
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:16,630
Scott: if you say yeah I ran this robo tech panel at my local con for like 10 people and it was a huge hit Let me run it at your con.

542
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,209
Scott: I guess that's better than nothing.

543
00:44:18,631 --> 00:44:30,980
Scott: but you're not gonna beat out the person who went to Japan and studied anime and is fluent in Japanese and wrote wrote a book on it and His public been a public speaker and etc.

544
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,301
Scott: Etc.

545
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:31,763
Scott: Etc.

546
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,874
Scott: I'm gonna pick them before I pick you now Obviously you don't.

547
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:38,370
Rym: I mean it's not like oh if you don't put anything there or this is your first panel.

548
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:40,142
Rym: It's not like we're gonna discount you out of hand.

549
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:41,270
Rym: That's not from the truth.

550
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:42,516
Rym: The point is that you're.

551
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:49,313
Scott: I mean if you're asked if your description of what the panel is sounds awesome And I contact you and you're awesome It doesn't.

552
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,870
Scott: it's not gonna matter to me that you never did a panel before cuz I can tell that you're awesome.

553
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:54,790
Rym: This is all basically just the pre selection.

554
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,770
Rym: It's kind of a you're trying to sell us on the idea of I want to run a panel.

555
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:01,970
Rym: Is there any reason why we should give you this panel?

556
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,054
Rym: Is there any reason at all?

557
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:09,657
Rym: and even if you say, you know, I've never run a panel before but I've prepared this and this And I think I can run a good panel.

558
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:18,188
Rym: if someone runs arts a paragraph of why they think they can run a good panel Even if they've never run one before that's already a thousand times more than most cons asked for.

559
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:18,609
Rym: yep.

560
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:27,568
Scott: Also, I would make sure to advertise all over the place not just on the internet But elsewhere to make sure the people knew that.

561
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,521
Scott: you know Here's the panel application.

562
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:40,764
Scott: anyone can fill out this Application because if we're gonna be so much more harsh than other cons in deciding who gets a panel and who doesn't We're gonna need a large quantity of applications to filter through that way.

563
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:45,170
Scott: after our harsh filtering There are enough left over to fill out the con schedule.

564
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:52,120
Rym: Yes because I see this a lot in con forums where there'll be the thread about Panels for the next con coming up and there'll be a little.

565
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:54,770
Rym: PM me if you want to run a panel or something stupid like.

566
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:02,710
Scott: So only people who go to the forum for this convention and join that forum and private message one person get to run panels.

567
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,174
Scott: That's weak sauce.

568
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:09,290
Rym: even worse is that you look in those and a lot of times all the posts are things like man.

569
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,125
Rym: It'd be great if there was a blob panel or someone should run a blob panel.

570
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:15,742
Rym: or people say yeah I'd like to run a blob panel, but they don't actually apply.

571
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:17,390
Rym: They just kind of say it out into the ether.

572
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:24,543
Rym: You've got to make it clear that if you want to run a panel This is the only way you are going to be able to run a panel.

573
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:26,370
Rym: You must fill out this small form.

574
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:28,810
Rym: It is less than a pages worth of writing.

575
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,940
Rym: You're gonna have to write maybe five paragraphs.

576
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,310
Rym: if you can't write five paragraphs you were not cut out to run a panel.

577
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,824
Scott: Yep, and also, you know people suggesting to a fan run con what panels they should have.

578
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:43,894
Scott: the con doesn't decide what panels They should have.

579
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:47,690
Scott: that it's depends on what people offer to run as panels.

580
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:55,969
Scott: I mean if 20 if the con is sitting there and they have 20 panels and all they get are 20 Applications of people who are on Naruto panels and that's it.

581
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:58,337
Scott: It doesn't matter how bad those panels are.

582
00:46:58,377 --> 00:47:02,650
Scott: the con pretty much is forced to have 20 Naruto panels or just cancel panels altogether.

583
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:10,402
Rym: but what I would do is I'd have a thread in the forum that basically after explaining, you know how to apply and link to The form and everything asking in general though.

584
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:12,150
Rym: What kind of panels do you guys want to see?

585
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,195
Rym: What do you like in a panel?

586
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:15,990
Rym: So yeah, at least I can kind of gauge to their interest.

587
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:23,761
Rym: I mean if people are really liking that hot new show Bicano or whatever and They really like they really want to see stuff about that thing and

588
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:34,766
Scott: I have to choose between a good panel about that And a good panel about something old that's not so popular I'll probably choose the equally good but more popular panel over the equally good less popular panel.

589
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:38,890
Rym: now don't get us wrong I mean we made it sound like this is gonna be really arduous and horrible.

590
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:45,387
Rym: But in this initial, you know apply for a panel thing Which is gonna start almost immediately after the previous kind thing it we talked about it.

591
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:50,329
Scott: Like it's some Bureaucratic fascist nonsense, but really when you think about it, what is it?

592
00:47:50,691 --> 00:48:03,948
Scott: You fill out an application you type in some words Some guys actually read those words and pay attention to them to decide whether who should have a panel and in the end The best panels get panels and the ones that aren't so good don't get them.

593
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:11,099
Rym: now The thing is this little bit this little at least tell us why you're gonna run a panel is Already more of a hurdle.

594
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,201
Scott: that can even ask a question Like why do you want to run a panel?

595
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:15,470
Scott: or you know something fun like that?

596
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,285
Scott: And then you could sort of gauge the attitude of the people running the panel.

597
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:24,724
Rym: now granted a lot of the Information we're asking for might be gotten later and will definitely confirm later.

598
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,410
Rym: The idea here is very simple.

599
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:28,070
Rym: This is the ulterior motive.

600
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:37,169
Rym: There has to be a small but and admit not necessarily difficult But at least enough to weed out the stupid people barrier to entry.

601
00:48:37,926 --> 00:48:47,870
Rym: Yeah And if you can't bring yourself if you're not willing to put forth the effort to write One page worth of why you want to run a panel and what you think this panel should be.

602
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:51,830
Scott: You're not willing to put in the work to run a good panel and I know your panels gonna suck.

603
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:55,110
Rym: So, you know, we'll have periodic updates and keep reminding people.

604
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,998
Rym: Hey apply for panels and we'll set a deadline.

605
00:48:58,258 --> 00:49:09,210
Rym: not a deadline to apply but a deadline being that after this point We are going to start selecting and the likelihood of you getting a panel will diminish period from this point forward.

606
00:49:09,732 --> 00:49:13,430
Rym: Apply by this date if you want to have a good chance of getting a panel.

607
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:16,930
Rym: But if you have a suddenly good idea you can apply after the date.

608
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:22,487
Scott: But it might not be as easy and then we'll have an actual deadline which is this is the schedule.

609
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:23,350
Scott: end of story.

610
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,172
Rym: Well the deadline.

611
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:29,347
Rym: as in at this date, we will no longer be accepting panel applications from this.

612
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:34,370
Rym: at that point We are only going to be accepting panels from the list of panels that have already been submitted.

613
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:41,359
Scott: Yeah, and that's pretty much all we would do before the actual convention itself, you know I mean what else are you gonna do before the convention besides?

614
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:44,130
Scott: take the applications and sort the wheat from the chaff?

615
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:50,328
Scott: Maintain contact with panelists and make sure that everyone knows exactly what they have to do at the convention.

616
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:58,530
Scott: make sure this Everyone has all the information necessary and if anything screws up make sure that it's never our fault and it's always their fault.

617
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:10,463
Rym: Now in terms of selecting the panelists, I mean, I'm not gonna go into super great detail But we could if people ask if any cons out there want some details I'm sure we can send you an email but basically it would just come down to one.

618
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,430
Rym: did the people spell properly?

619
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:16,984
Rym: Yep, was that was the application and the follow-up emails professional?

620
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:18,870
Rym: do they respond in a timely manner?

621
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,055
Rym: Do they actually answer the questions?

622
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:23,463
Rym: I ask them does their panel sound interesting?

623
00:50:23,544 --> 00:50:25,510
Scott: is their panel different from other panels?

624
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:26,478
Scott: Is it you know?

625
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:27,929
Scott: does it not just interest me?

626
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,157
Scott: But does it interest other people that I tell about it?

627
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:33,830
Rym: if I bring up a concern can they answer to that concern?

628
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,496
Scott: Yeah, like huh?

629
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:43,150
Scott: I think your panel might have might go over time You know, can you convince me that it's only gonna be an hour long and then we'll see what they say?

630
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:47,750
Rym: Or I think your panel might be a little too hardcore for this convention and the audience.

631
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:52,670
Rym: Do you think you could tone it down a little or could we at least set a you know a set of guidelines?

632
00:50:53,310 --> 00:51:08,890
Rym: Basically once we've narrowed it down to like the finalists like the panels that we're pretty sure we're gonna have We cut we'd start talking to the panelists that we know we want on a much more intimate basis Like, you know, we'd work with them and we'd come down to a consensus as to exactly how this panel is going to be run.

633
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:13,863
Scott: Yep Now at the convention itself, what are you gonna do?

634
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,430
Scott: You got all these people?

635
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,907
Scott: They may or may not show up.

636
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:27,570
Scott: You got to do something with them and you got to make sure everyone gets to their panel room on time runs their panel has The equipment they need knows what the score is runs their panels and then gets out of the room on time.

637
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:38,799
Rym: Now first off as soon as the schedule is finalized which of course is before the con But it'll also be double finalized at the con Every panelist has got to check in.

638
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,590
Rym: I mean during registration, you know, they get their con badge, whatever.

639
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:43,690
Rym: I'm sure the panelists are comped in some way.

640
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,575
Rym: We'll have a system for that.

641
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:47,190
Rym: it that varies so much by con that we can't talk about it.

642
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:52,870
Rym: Yeah, but when you pick up your badge, you must then immediately and you will be reminded.

643
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,769
Rym: You'll be flagged as a panelist in some way.

644
00:51:55,292 --> 00:52:00,534
Rym: You will be told to go to panel ops where we are sitting and check in Personally with us.

645
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:05,993
Rym: if you can't do it for whatever reason you've got to check in at some point well before your Possible.

646
00:52:06,114 --> 00:52:13,100
Scott: I would have a system where I would have a pre-made badge for each Panelist and they would have to come and get it from me.

647
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:15,589
Scott: that way I would know physically, huh?

648
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:16,993
Scott: These people aren't here.

649
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:17,936
Scott: I have their badges.

650
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:18,839
Rym: Yep.

651
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:20,483
Scott: I will assume that they're not here.

652
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:22,710
Scott: if they bought a badge screw them now.

653
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:24,488
Rym: ConnectiCon did this really well.

654
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:28,322
Rym: when you show up like when we showed up we went to the panel ops.

655
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,453
Rym: they came over and they gave us an Itinerary.

656
00:52:31,754 --> 00:52:34,343
Rym: it showed us any and all of the panels we were running.

657
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:43,357
Rym: it showed us all the contact info We needed all the rules all the room numbers all the times every possible piece of information We could need on this piece of paper.

658
00:52:43,438 --> 00:52:46,810
Scott: It was a like a personal schedule for us at the convention.

659
00:52:46,951 --> 00:52:55,650
Scott: I would have a personal schedule and personal information sheet just one piece of paper Per panelist so that if they had that I would say hold on to this piece of paper.

660
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,979
Scott: May I give them two copies each?

661
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,483
Scott: What is this?

662
00:52:57,503 --> 00:52:58,490
Scott: a couple copies big deal?

663
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:05,838
Scott: Yeah, right This paper tells you what you need to do with this con you will do with this piece of paper says you will sign this Piece of paper in front of me.

664
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:07,630
Scott: I'll have a signed copy of this piece of paper.

665
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,183
Scott: So I can come and get you, you know your phone number.

666
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:13,700
Scott: I will have everything, you know I'll call your cell phone with you standing in front of me.

667
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,564
Scott: So I know it rings.

668
00:53:14,604 --> 00:53:28,240
Scott: Well, you're not lying to me I'll do whatever I have to do to make sure you do what that piece of paper says because that's what you promise You would do in order to get this free badge I'm handing you and if you don't do it You didn't earn your free badge and I'm gonna come and get you

669
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:28,883
Rym: now.

670
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,794
Rym: depending on the scheduling and all that I mean.

671
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:44,114
Rym: if the schedule for the con for whatever reason couldn't be finalized until very close to the con Then I would definitely make some leeway or have backups that we'll talk about later for the panels for the morning on Friday Yeah, and the morning

672
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:48,690
Scott: would definitely be quite a few backup panelists ready to go including myself.

673
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:52,086
Scott: I could run a panel and just spur of the moment BAM if it ever needs to be.

674
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:52,890
Rym: but anyway.

675
00:53:52,970 --> 00:54:04,264
Rym: So I mean we will skip on some of those details just because while we have thought of them In fact, we have thought of this in excruciating detail like we have the go plan ready But we really can't get into that much detailer.

676
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:16,716
Rym: This would be three hours long Yep but if a panelist did not check in within a Certain number of hours before their panel was due to go with exceptions for the first panels on Friday morning Which obviously no

677
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:18,284
Scott: one really goes to so much anyway,

678
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,450
Rym: except a ConnectiCon yeah

679
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:20,012
Scott: But for

680
00:54:20,032 --> 00:54:26,186
Rym: those people we would have worked something out of head of time some sort of alright, dude Are you cool with running a panel at 10 a.m.

681
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:26,710
Rym: On Friday?

682
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:29,080
Rym: We're gonna make sure you get your badge right away.

683
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,824
Rym: You get right in.

684
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:32,456
Rym: You don't need to check in with me Just go to your panel do your thing.

685
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:38,922
Rym: Yep, but for everyone else if you haven't checked in Let's say three hours at minimum before your panel.

686
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:41,772
Rym: Your panel is canceled Period.

687
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:48,080
Rym: we will probably try to call your cell phone which you've provided to us And if you don't answer your panel is canceled.

688
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:51,733
Rym: if you answer and you tell us that you're going to be there You were just delayed.

689
00:54:52,174 --> 00:54:56,670
Rym: All right, but suffice to say I'm gonna say that a lot because Jim Vowles doesn't like it.

690
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:00,310
Rym: Suffice to say yeah, your panel is canceled.

691
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:02,576
Rym: Yes Now a lot of cons.

692
00:55:02,937 --> 00:55:06,270
Rym: they try to accommodate panelists who screw up or show up late or whatever.

693
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:09,530
Scott: Accommodating guests is different from accommodating panelists.

694
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,956
Rym: You accommodate the guests.

695
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:17,880
Rym: if a panel has to be moved because a guest needs a time slot We deal with that because the guests definitely have precedents.

696
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,344
Scott: Yes get whatever they want.

697
00:55:19,605 --> 00:55:21,430
Scott: panelists get the short end of the stick.

698
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,273
Scott: You're a fan.

699
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:26,270
Scott: You're running a panel in exchange for a free badge if I screw you.

700
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,861
Scott: Oh, if I screw you over you're still gonna get your free badge.

701
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:32,930
Scott: Yes, if you screw me over you're you're getting in trouble.

702
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:41,350
Rym: So if a panelist doesn't show up and doesn't check in no panel now at that point the schedule change is going to be You know made at the room.

703
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,469
Rym: It's not going to be announced over the PA because most cows don't have anything like that.

704
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:58,270
Rym: but basically what we would do is for all the panels that were good, but we couldn't fit him into the schedule or Just for people who were willing to take on this responsibility who had a good panel who said I'm willing to be the backup panelist.

705
00:55:59,057 --> 00:56:00,430
Rym: We would run a backup panel.

706
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:06,070
Rym: We would have a list of people who in a pinch maybe just staffers who you know could run a funny thing.

707
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:08,146
Rym: We'll be ready to be in that room.

708
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:19,949
Rym: at the time The panel was supposed to start announced that the panelists failed to show up and then either try to run an event Similarly themed to their event to the best of their ability which a lot of people could do.

709
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:25,750
Rym: I'm pretty confident that I could have run most of the panels that were listed at Otakon and Katsucon last year.

710
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:33,068
Scott: I mean I would have two or three awesome people who I know could run a panel at just any moment like hey you Can you run a panel right now?

711
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:35,951
Scott: I can because I don't suck and BAM.

712
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:45,026
Scott: they run a panel when everyone gets canceled and I really don't think it's gonna be likely even at the biggest of cons For there to be like four or five simultaneous panels all canceled.

713
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:45,889
Scott: That's just not gonna happen.

714
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:46,251
Rym: Now.

715
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:49,850
Rym: also if we can't do something like that, we just don't have someone who could run that panel.

716
00:56:50,111 --> 00:57:03,670
Scott: We'll probably have a couple of predetermined straight-up backup filler panels that are probably Comedic in nature or I would have some sort of Videoed thing to show in the room because all panel rooms usually have a projector and such.

717
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:11,450
Scott: I could show a video of a panel in the room or something else interesting While instead of a canceled panel I could use a video as the replacement panel.

718
00:57:11,672 --> 00:57:21,102
Rym: The point is if a panelist didn't show up Someone would be at that panel room from the con to say exactly what happened Yeah, and to say here's what we were going to do to make this up for you.

719
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:22,890
Rym: Enjoy the alternate events.

720
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:30,118
Scott: Yep, and the thing is there's a lot of complaining always about like con members and con guests who go around and they say Oh, I went to the panel.

721
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:30,702
Scott: It was moved.

722
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:31,427
Scott: I went to this.

723
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:35,662
Scott: Every panel at every con I've ever been to right has?

724
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:38,450
Scott: they've always had a staffer at every panel.

725
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:39,214
Scott: You know to con.

726
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:40,139
Scott: does it get a con?

727
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:40,924
Scott: does it they?

728
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:42,030
Scott: if there's a panel?

729
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:46,701
Scott: There's one staff person assigned to deal with that panel that staff person.

730
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:57,030
Scott: if they're doing a good job, but their responsibilities are Relatively few I mean they basically have to sit at the panel and make sure there's no hokey-pokey going on and such.

731
00:57:57,571 --> 00:58:08,550
Scott: Right, I would make it so that they also if there's any change at all in that panel would be announcing it constantly saying The such-and-such panel that was originally scheduled for this room has been canceled.

732
00:58:08,991 --> 00:58:18,649
Scott: This panel will be here instead blah blah blah just constantly as people are coming in so that everyone knows I would have them kick panelists out of the room as soon as their time is up.

733
00:58:19,072 --> 00:58:22,630
Scott: I would have them make sure that they know how all the equipment in the room works.

734
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:30,030
Scott: They can deal with if there's a problem and if there's some sort of contractor who deals with the equipment that they would be In the room at the start of all the panels.

735
00:58:30,577 --> 00:58:39,273
Scott: I would have that staffer Sort of keep track of what they thought of the panel and what they the gent what they thought the reaction of the people attending The panel was.

736
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:41,703
Scott: you know did the people at the panel seem to like it did?

737
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:42,406
Scott: were they upset?

738
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:43,510
Scott: did a lot of people leave?

739
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:48,730
Scott: Did a lot of people not show up and write down count how many people are in the panel?

740
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:50,567
Scott: When it's like the biggest and write it down?

741
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:55,925
Rym: yes ConnectiCon actually took our advice this past year and the staffers went around and counted the audience.

742
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:57,570
Scott: one staff guy who was awesome.

743
00:58:57,791 --> 00:59:03,815
Scott: Oh, yeah, he had the con schedule in his hand and basically every box on the schedule That was a panel.

744
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:06,226
Scott: he wrote the attendance number in the box.

745
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:11,435
Scott: so at the end He had this schedule full of attendance numbers on every single event And it was pretty cool.

746
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:11,877
Scott: basically

747
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:24,890
Rym: just have the staffers who were in the rooms dealing with these panels Take them as much information as they can and even give them a means to do so and then that way we can go through That after the fact and find out like this panel was really popular among the people who went.

748
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:28,370
Rym: But not many people went maybe because it was alternate to the cosplay.

749
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:35,209
Rym: Let's let these people run the exact same panel at a better time next year or a Lot of people came to this panel and a lot of people walked out.

750
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,010
Rym: Yeah, I mean those people are never coming back.

751
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,364
Scott: It does seem to me like a lot of people that seems to be like these have truths about.

752
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:46,123
Scott: oh if you're running your panel Against the cosplay no one's gonna come if you're running your panel early Sunday morning.

753
00:59:46,144 --> 00:59:46,887
Scott: That's a bad time.

754
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:47,630
Scott: This is a good time.

755
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,127
Scott: Well who really keeps numbers and who really knows what's a good time?

756
00:59:51,147 --> 00:59:51,770
Scott: What's a bad time?

757
00:59:51,850 --> 01:00:00,070
Scott: I used to think that like Saturday morning was a good time and Saturday afternoon was also a good time and Friday Morning was a really bad time.

758
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,710
Scott: But I've seen Friday morning panels that are packed and Saturday afternoon panels that are empty.

759
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:09,290
Rym: So dude are how to run an anime club panel at Connecticut was standing room only Friday morning.

760
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:14,073
Scott: Yeah, so I think a lot of those things are all are not really true And we need to.

761
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:21,680
Scott: it would be a good idea to collect statistics of some sort some sort of metric however Unscientific to help you figure it out.

762
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:30,914
Scott: plus if you see for instance Hey There were like four panels that start at the same time as the cosplay and one of them had a whole ton of people And the other ones were empty.

763
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:35,770
Scott: ha maybe I should put you know that really that panel must have a really big draw.

764
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:47,822
Scott: I'll put that at a different time not concurrent with the masquerade And I'll put four of these average panels from another time there and keep mixing it up until you figure it out to get the Highest total panel attendance across the board.

765
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:57,010
Rym: now to make this easy for those staffers I just make a little form that just has a bunch of little Boxes little checks and little things and little boxes to write quick things in and just make it really really simple.

766
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,879
Rym: You know how much did people clap like?

767
01:00:58,919 --> 01:00:59,843
Rym: on a scale of one to five?

768
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,130
Rym: how much did people cheer when it was done?

769
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:03,858
Rym: Did the panelists show up on time?

770
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,263
Scott: did they leave on time?

771
01:01:05,403 --> 01:01:07,490
Rym: did they start their panel on time?

772
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,903
Rym: Did they sit up on stage and mumble for five minutes before they were ready?

773
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:11,305
Rym: all that it?

774
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:12,750
Scott: was there any problems with the equipment?

775
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,652
Scott: If so, what?

776
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:15,758
Scott: if were they resolved you know etc.

777
01:01:15,799 --> 01:01:16,200
Scott: etc.

778
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:31,530
Scott: and I'd have a little piece of paper that and that would one of these Pieces of paper would be filled out for every panel and at the end after the con I can go through these pieces of paper And I'm not gonna use them as some sort of ultimate decision-maker like oh no one clapped at this panel.

779
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:32,130
Scott: It's gone.

780
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:40,543
Scott: But I will examine them all and add the math up and take the stats and use them in my Considerations for how to make the panels better next year.

781
01:01:40,683 --> 01:01:58,326
Rym: like a fears down the road Let's say that there's one group of people who always run the same like kind of panels and every year a lot of people show Up to the panel no matter what time it is and then also a lot of people leave the panel early and the applause are pretty And a lot of people are disappointed with the panel in the forums.

782
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:03,780
Rym: after the con I'm probably gonna get rid of that panel or Obviously the panel idea is good.

783
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,010
Rym: I will not let them run that panel.

784
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,470
Rym: I'll try to find someone else to run a similar panel.

785
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:16,670
Scott: Yes Cuz if something like you can see something like that You know that the title of the panel or the description of it in the con book are very appealing and have a big draw.

786
01:02:17,092 --> 01:02:22,110
Scott: But the way the panel is run or the content of the panel isn't interesting to people and they leave.

787
01:02:22,491 --> 01:02:28,997
Scott: So I would keep the title and description and get someone else to run it or get the people who run it to run it Differently to get people to stay.

788
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:32,650
Scott: probably just change the people because it's pretty hard to get people to run something differently.

789
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,011
Scott: Yeah,

790
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:53,810
Rym: no, I mean really we talked about people and I I'm not gonna go into the whole vetting process But by emailing these people I would try to get a sense of if they're they really care about their panel or not And if they're gonna do a good job for any big panels or panels that are going to be important for whatever reason I would probably try to arrange his time to call them on the phone and talk to them in person.

791
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,357
Scott: Yeah, why not?

792
01:02:55,478 --> 01:02:58,150
Scott: I mean, I'm not doing anything else all year.

793
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:06,236
Scott: I mean if my panels more than once annually probably couldn't do this much probably to cut it back a little bit, but My panels once a year.

794
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,126
Scott: I got plenty of time to arrange all of this all year.

795
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,230
Scott: I'm not doing anything else.

796
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:13,029
Scott: I don't have any other responsibilities other than at the con itself.

797
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:17,230
Scott: So why not do as much as I can to make the panels as good as I can?

798
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:18,493
Rym: Yeah, I mean look at this.

799
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:26,750
Rym: basically all we've really said we do is have an actual definitive good and consistent year-to-year process for applying to panels.

800
01:03:27,332 --> 01:03:33,749
Rym: Apply rigorous standards to panelists and not allow someone who is obviously going to do a crappy job to have a panel in the first place.

801
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:47,522
Rym: To have the con pay attention to who runs panels and how well they go over in order to determine How to let panels get run the next years and then to follow up with people who run good panels to make sure they continue To run good panels in the future and

802
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:52,870
Scott: repeat this process Every year and your panels will start out awesome and get more awesome.

803
01:03:52,930 --> 01:04:02,905
Scott: the only way this this process can be screwed over is if no one good wants to run panels or if Demand and people don't want to run panels anymore.

804
01:04:02,925 --> 01:04:03,528
Scott: Here's the thing.

805
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,257
Rym: something It's always the other.

806
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:07,430
Rym: it's a passive process with most most cons.

807
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:11,788
Rym: But in addition to you know soliciting hey you want to run a panel in general.

808
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:26,690
Rym: on the website I would seek out people who I had seen run good panels in the past or people who I know could run a good panel or People who are recommended to me by other people I trust and ask them Hey, we would like you to run a panel.

809
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:28,176
Rym: Would you like to?

810
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:31,630
Rym: if so you can skip the process and send me this information?

811
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:46,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I go I'd go to other conventions or go to other conventions message boards And if I see a lot of people saying OMG at you know something con two states away That this panel went over re crazily well and packed the house and everyone loved it.

812
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:56,728
Scott: I would find out who did it and call them up and see if they could do the same thing again from icon Which is two states away and thus more people would enjoy the greatness that is their panel.

813
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:59,305
Rym: Yep They might not be able to but it's worth a shot.

814
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:03,628
Rym: I mean it can't hurt Yeah, and also that's a good way to find better panelists.

815
01:05:04,272 --> 01:05:05,829
Scott: It's same way you find better AMVs.

816
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,040
Scott: Did your AMV win a year before?

817
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,070
Scott: you know in the previous year at another convention?

818
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,359
Scott: If so, you can have it at my convention.

819
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,030
Scott: was your panel a hit at another convention this year You can run it again at my convention.

820
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:24,699
Scott: Yeah, that way my convention would sort of be the best of but in that way would also be the best Better than the others.

821
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:41,103
Rym: Anyway, all right I think that's enough about that, but I do want to say that everything we've said and I'm dead serious Scott and I alone could handle 100% of that except for the at-con stuff and honestly GeekNights as an organization.

822
01:05:41,183 --> 01:05:54,360
Rym: We have the staff Personally to handle the at-con part as well as long if it's the conventions too big We might need gophers under those people, but the conventions have gophers Yeah, plus we could get some gophers if we needed to.

823
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,445
