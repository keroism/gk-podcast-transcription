00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,812
Rym: It's Monday December 21st 2020.

2
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,939
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,778
Rym: tonight We are talking about the last decade in technology.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,079
Rym: It's like a mega tech news roundup, let's do this.

5
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,599
Rym: It's uh, you know, it's funny because we did that.

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:40,190
Rym: Usually we'll talk about this more in the main bit but we usually skip a lot of episodes around this time of year because we got like holiday stuff going on in conventions and We kind of baked that into our schedule and our process.

7
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:45,199
Rym: and I realized part of the reason why we were struggling to come up With shows that we weren't skipping shows like we normally do.

8
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,460
Scott: We're always struggling to come with shows.

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,594
Rym: Oh, yeah But we were struggling more because we usually have some slack at the end of the year.

10
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:51,620
Rym: where there's like a week or two where?

11
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,418
Rym: We won't do shows.

12
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:57,660
Scott: Well anyway, so, you know normally nothing's happening because we're staying at home doing nothing.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,892
Scott: But something happened that I got to talk about right?

14
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:04,215
Scott: All right, so My family long ago, right?

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,544
Rym: It's about the tapestry No, and the children?

16
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:13,336
Scott: when the children became adults right in the late 90s to the early 2000s, right?

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,114
Scott: It became sort of silly to continue to buy gifts for you know each other.

18
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,500
Scott: Yeah, so and also bothersome.

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:30,812
Scott: so we did like one time we tried to do like a Not Secret Santa where you'd still have to buy a gift.

20
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:36,679
Scott: right but like one of those Trading game ones, you know and it was it was meh.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,325
Scott: So that was it the end.

22
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:43,047
Scott: just hey the gift we give to each other is you don't have to deal with any of that gift.

23
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:43,520
Scott: nonsense.

24
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,195
Scott: It's like fuck that noise, right?

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:02:01,639
Scott: Amanda's family still does Christmas with presents or whatever and they all feel obligated to buy presents for every single other person and it seems like a big hassle and they What they end up doing is just telling each other exactly what they want and then buying it.

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,448
Rym: Emily's family is a good middle ground where it's a lot of like low-key gifts that are just like generally nice but not like what I mean.

27
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,131
Rym: Yeah, not like the traditional like here is a present.

28
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,040
Rym: That is a big deal and might be expensive.

29
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:16,929
Scott: It's more like well It's like my family does not like never buy gifts.

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,856
Scott: what they do is like sometimes they'll be somewhere and they'll see something and they're Like, you know so and so would fuck.

31
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:23,824
Scott: Oh my god Look at that.

32
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:25,758
Scott: so and so would fucking love that and they'll just buy it.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,784
Rym: Oh, it's a trial device.

34
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,534
Rym: It looks like a boo in a cornucopia.

35
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:32,234
Scott: All right, right It's like and the next time they see that person they'll be like here.

36
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,300
Scott: I got you this, right?

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,885
Scott: Yeah, you know, that's our friends.

38
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,191
Rym: all are like we give each other gifts.

39
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:43,840
Scott: when like we find something that is gift-worthy Or someone will just be like, you know, oh man, you know, I lost my you know scarf.

40
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,690
Scott: It's like oh, I mean, I'll knit you one.

41
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,540
Scott: Yeah, which one you want, right?

42
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:53,017
Scott: You know that kind of thing, right, but there's not this formal must buy gift holiday thing, right?

43
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,509
Scott: So You know, we don't really Need or want anything.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,578
Scott: we have everything we could.

45
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:10,175
Scott: possibly We're well off and live in New York like right when I get Secret Santa's I'm like donate to a charity in my name.

46
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:19,080
Rym: that is not racist or You know, etc, etc, like literally everything that I transphobic or I either have or is not reasonable.

47
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:26,830
Scott: right, they all the things that you could actually get me as a gift are Unreasonable to give as a gift.

48
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:31,726
Scott: like yes, please Let me upgrade my.

49
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:37,020
Scott: you know, too many thousand dollar bicycle with a bicycle that is five times more money.

50
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:43,094
Scott: it's like Upgrade my computer with one that has four 3080s in it.

51
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,178
Scott: You can do that.

52
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:44,660
Scott: That works.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,647
Scott: You can put four 3080s in one computer.

54
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,613
Scott: They make those right?

55
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,456
Scott: It's like there's nothing.

56
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,259
Scott: What else could you get me?

57
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,715
Scott: Right, I can't even imagine a boat.

58
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:53,380
Scott: get me a boat.

59
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,246
Scott: It's like what can you buy me?

60
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,551
Rym: give me some mansions gig.

61
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,860
Rym: get me a life of idle pleasure.

62
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,159
Scott: Get me a DDR machine and a place in which to keep it.

63
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:22,500
Scott: Now if someone could get me those things like yeah Sure, so Amanda's mom messages and she's like, you know The gift that she's getting us was like in the mail and it was many pounds like 50 plus pounds already.

64
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:27,179
Scott: I'm like, I'm like, oh There is nothing that weighs that much.

65
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,431
Scott: That is something that we need and want.

66
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,744
Rym: maybe a 30 90. there are three slots wide Right.

67
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:41,330
Rym: I'm like and we'll go in this house The house where I can't record without tearing down my living room.

68
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,276
Scott: This is already trouble.

69
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:56,014
Scott: whatever the hell this is I Love it because I already know the story of what this is, but I don't know what the dimensions are right, but anyway, the box shows up and we drag it upstairs.

70
00:04:56,034 --> 00:05:00,107
Scott: Amanda drags upstairs and Luckily, it's a box in a box.

71
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,614
Scott: So opening the outer box.

72
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,276
Scott: I didn't I was.

73
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,117
Scott: I already said, okay I'm gonna open the outer box.

74
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:11,820
Scott: I'm gonna try to see if I can identify the item simply from the writings and whatever papers are in there packing slip something.

75
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:17,260
Scott: So I don't have to open the inner box because already good chance of me needing to get rid of this thing.

76
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:18,458
Scott: Whatever it is, right?

77
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,892
Scott: So what it is, it was a lot of money.

78
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:32,740
Scott: first of all, right, which is ridiculous but it's some sort of like Automatic hydroponic garden thing and it's way too big to fit anywhere in our apartment.

79
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,711
Scott: The idea at its core is not awful.

80
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,414
Rym: Oh, that's the kind of thing.

81
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,880
Rym: I would love if I had a house.

82
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:39,988
Scott: Well, the problem is the.

83
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,680
Scott: the idea at its core is not an awful idea.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,100
Scott: Right a little hydroponic system to grow stuff because you know, you don't have a yard, right?

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,547
Scott: That's that's like the core idea is good.

86
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,799
Scott: The problem is the size obviously is a problem.

87
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:57,379
Scott: The cost is also a problem, but it was a gift.

88
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:04,313
Scott: but the cost is still a problem because what this amounts to is a pot and A light.

89
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,918
Scott: that's it's really.

90
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:06,861
Scott: it's a pot and a light.

91
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:11,088
Rym: so it's a weed grub gonna grow some weed pretty much Not that kind of pot.

92
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:18,133
Scott: It's like I could go to the garden store and even if I bought a very good growing light because there are cheapo ones And it's and fan.

93
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:21,209
Rym: Yeah, we got a cheap one hanging from the ceiling to keep our plants alive in the winter.

94
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:26,874
Scott: Yeah, but if you got a fancy one, it still would only be less money than this thing And I mean ours is literally.

95
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:29,985
Rym: I bought a light bulb for $20 and I hung it right.

96
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,610
Scott: you have a four dollar outlet Yeah, but I mean you could buy a good one.

97
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,456
Scott: It would wouldn't be as expensive as this.

98
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:39,310
Scott: Yeah, and you can get a pot at the garden store for nothing, right?

99
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,387
Scott: They just got stacks of them.

100
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,010
Rym: That kind of stuff is just like in every shape and size timing it for like what kind of plant you're growing.

101
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:46,814
Scott: Sure.

102
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,076
Scott: Sure.

103
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:56,981
Scott: Sure, but that's the thing is you could just You know just on your phone use like your reminders app to be like I actually just for my crap old plants on the windowsill.

104
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:58,486
Scott: I have a Google task.

105
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,050
Scott: That's like water the plants It just boop, right?

106
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:14,130
Scott: What this thing has to justify its enormous price is all sorts of unnecessary technological integrations akin to remember that juice thing the where you'd like juicer.

107
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,039
Scott: Yeah, you put the bag of fruit and it would.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,410
Scott: it was like connect to Wi-Fi and squeeze the juice out or whatever.

109
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,157
Scott: This is like that.

110
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,141
Scott: It's like it has.

111
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,266
Scott: I shit you not.

112
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,270
Scott: it's not an exaggeration.

113
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,297
Scott: This is why I'm talking about in tech day as Amazon Alexa integration Right.

114
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,228
Scott: It's got Wi-Fi.

115
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:35,515
Scott: It's got like all this ridiculous stuff To like.

116
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,625
Scott: it can take care of the plants when you're not at home.

117
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,829
Scott: when you are at home It can adjust the lights.

118
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:52,093
Rym: It's like this really sounds like a weed grower because the thing so from trying to invest in that industry Is that weed plants in particular compared to most other plants are little divas and if you look at them wrong They just die.

119
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:57,230
Scott: So people is the thing very much sold environments much like the juicer.

120
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,297
Scott: Oh, it comes with you have to.

121
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,604
Scott: you can't just like get some seeds and toss them in.

122
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:10,620
Scott: it has these proprietary Like little seed things you have to buy from them Coffee cups or some bullshit, right?

123
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,409
Scott: So they're like these little triangle.

124
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,542
Rym: That is very different from what I was imagining.

125
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,795
Scott: So basically at the top of the pot There's like a plastic.

126
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:20,539
Scott: I didn't open it to.

127
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,970
Scott: I just looked at the pictures on the internet at the top of the pot.

128
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:34,625
Scott: Imagine that there is a sort of piece of plastic with holes in it and You have these sort of cones and you put the cones through the holes Pointy side down and the pointy side is now where the seeds are in the water.

129
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,769
Scott: the hydroponic right?

130
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,297
Scott: No dirt Yeah, and then it comes the.

131
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,246
Scott: the plant would come out the top of the cone and towards the.

132
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:55,763
Scott: the light that you have Right, so without some I guess you could just get like a cone of some kind that fits in the hole And as long as the bottom reaches the water and is appropriately has holes in it You could grow other things you wanted to in there.

133
00:08:56,144 --> 00:09:00,039
Scott: You can't just toss a seed in the water That's just a seed in water.

134
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,349
Scott: That's not gonna do anything.

135
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,688
Scott: So, yeah, don't buy this thing.

136
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,415
Scott: But also be.

137
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:12,470
Scott: we are now burdened with this giant box taking up a lot of our apartment Waiting to figure out how to get rid of it.

138
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,564
Scott: It's not like we can carry it to those full disclosure.

139
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:18,790
Rym: when we heard this story We were like, ooh, I wonder like because we would need up we needed a better girl life.

140
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,270
Rym: Then we looked it up to like see what the deal was and we were both like yeah that can stay at Scott's apartment.

141
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,420
Scott: Yeah, like getting rid of it is now an ordeal.

142
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,889
Scott: so instead of giving us a gift we have been given an ordeal.

143
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:36,990
Rym: At least it's not a great ordeal.

144
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,044
Scott: Yeah, I'm hoping that I emailed the company.

145
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:40,970
Scott: They haven't gotten back to me.

146
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:51,530
Scott: I'm hoping that they will say yes some sort of delivery person will come And just take it right away and the money will go back to whoever we want to deal with it.

147
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,070
Scott: But um, I don't know what's gonna happen.

148
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:54,606
Scott: We'll see.

149
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,230
Rym: Yeah Cuz I think back way back when my camera died and I finally had to like ship it back to get a replacement.

150
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:04,810
Rym: The only way to actually ship it back was to like go physically to a UPS store or a FedEx.

151
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:14,025
Scott: Yeah, I feel bad though for whatever delivery person had to unnecessarily Carry this thing from A to B and now B to who knows where.

152
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:24,300
Rym: oh, it's tough in general Like the like obligation rituals of American society can often be odd Yeah, but I mean like, you know, some delivery person's got to do this.

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,869
Scott: and then how much fossil fuel was wasted transporting this.

154
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,836
Scott: It's just like it's just.

155
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,063
Rym: oh, you know, yeah, I was these were I was the kid rose.

156
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,110
Rym: the gifts were like I just wanted anything.

157
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,680
Scott: Yeah I didn't have any money and I have wanted stuff.

158
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,307
Scott: You know how many Nintendo it's like.

159
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:39,890
Scott: I would go to it.

160
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,849
Scott: I would go to Toys R Us and there was a wall of Nintendo and I got to pick one like once a month.

161
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,976
Scott: Yeah, right, maybe.

162
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:53,143
Scott: and so it would be like hey, I want every single one of these I don't care what even the crappy ones.

163
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,210
Scott: I want every single one.

164
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,455
Scott: So it's like you could.

165
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:57,626
Scott: you could never run out of gifts to get me.

166
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,025
Scott: just keep buying ones I don't have and we're good to go.

167
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:07,710
Scott: But now I have every NES game that has ever been made in any country ever on a hard drive or a micro SD card.

168
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:16,850
Rym: That is now very silly Yeah, so my only my only recent tech adventure is I actually bought a Fitbit because I wanted a more reliable heart rate monitor.

169
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,945
Scott: How is it any more reliable than like Apple watch?

170
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:20,910
Scott: Well, partly the same method.

171
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,181
Scott: This is the same method.

172
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,170
Scott: the Apple watch does so one.

173
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,610
Scott: I don't have an apple like shiny Android watches and they but I'm saying it just shines a light into your arm.

174
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,732
Scott: Oh, yeah doesn't use a different method It's.

175
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,010
Rym: it's more like what algorithms does it use and how often does it track and everything?

176
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:40,410
Rym: But basically my Android watch was only good for like specific like I'm going for run right now And I wanted to do like more long-term like heart track.

177
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,952
Scott: So it doesn't.

178
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,021
Scott: it doesn't track when you're not running.

179
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,230
Rym: It doesn't unless I turn that stuff on like it doesn't.

180
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,770
Scott: Oh the Apple watch just tracks all the time.

181
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:55,370
Scott: But obviously if you do exercise it then it like yeah Constantly tracks for the duration if you're not actively if you haven't told it you are currently working out.

182
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,809
Scott: It'll just check it once in a while.

183
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,672
Rym: Yeah That's what this does.

184
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:04,189
Scott: you can even if you like pay attention which I never do but you can actually see the green light turning on underneath.

185
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:05,873
Scott: You know.

186
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:06,596
Rym: the other thing was.

187
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:11,174
Rym: I realized that Strava at some point seems to have gotten rid of the ability to just connect sensors To it directly.

188
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,269
Rym: it'll only integrate with like other apps to get heart rate data.

189
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:23,525
Rym: Yeah, I've never tried to connect to it directly used to be able to used to be able to buy like a Bluetooth like ant Whatever like a whatever compliant heart rate monitor, and it would just work.

190
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:29,470
Scott: and they seem to have gotten really I just I mean I'm these days and doing everything in Swift and then Swift just when it Swift is done.

191
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,688
Scott: It just saves its results to Strava.

192
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:38,324
Scott: And if I do another a non biking exercise You know I just use on the Apple watch.

193
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,438
Scott: I just say Apple watch I am Italy.

194
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:47,598
Scott: Apple watch will actually tell me it'll be like hey Are you walking outside now, and I'll be like you got me Outside and it's like okay.

195
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:49,590
Scott: You want to record this and I'm like yeah fine, whatever.

196
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:55,828
Scott: But the only time I would use Strava directly is if I'm biking outside, which not doing too much of yeah.

197
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:08,082
Rym: But it was interesting because one thing I wanted to see was you know it's been a while since I tracked like My heart rate all the time like overnight into data analysis And I've been training really hard like Morse like this year when kovat.

198
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:08,624
Rym: What did I do?

199
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,190
Rym: I doubled down on getting totally ripped.

200
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:13,220
Rym: So I wanted to like actually track like.

201
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,067
Rym: how is that affecting my heart rate long term?

202
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:22,922
Rym: because we had a conversation recently among our friends where people were Calling into question my current max heart rate and my current resting heart rate.

203
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,045
Scott: well you were used.

204
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:24,326
Scott: you were.

205
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:33,159
Scott: you were you know doing A usual Rym right saying something that is technically correct, but is also an exaggeration Like yes my maximum heart rate is this and it's like.

206
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,410
Scott: that is a heart rate that your heart reached for like one Single reading at one moment.

207
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,837
Rym: Now that I've had this Fitbit I'm tracking it kind of reliably with the same measure.

208
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,161
Rym: I discovered that the Android watch.

209
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,127
Rym: I have not that accurate.

210
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,650
Rym: this thing is way more consistent.

211
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,177
Scott: Okay, I'm actually surprised.

212
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,764
Scott: How consistent the Apple watches.

213
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:52,708
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'm sure they have watch.

214
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,997
Rym: I don't great I just don't have an eye now.

215
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:54,199
Scott: Well.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,429
Scott: I now no longer feel it.

217
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:58,367
Scott: I was thinking of buying one of the strappy chest ones now.

218
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:04,736
Rym: I don't care I would only get enough stress chest one if I was also getting the ones that track Chest expansion and compression.

219
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:09,470
Rym: so I can do more advanced metrics, but you can't use those with Strava anymore, so I bother.

220
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:11,825
Scott: Well, I could use them with Swift.

221
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:25,910
Rym: Yep Yeah I can safely say that my resting heart rate is like locked in at 47 beats per minute and my sleeping heart rate is like Okay, yeah, I don't know my sleepy one because I just I charge the Apple watch overnight.

222
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:32,494
Rym: Part of the thing about the Fitbit is it'll last constantly tracking for like a week Like nothing.

223
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,484
Scott: it's probably not doing anything else.

224
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:35,690
Rym: Oh, it is doing nothing else.

225
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:44,106
Rym: It'll show me the time with the screen a little bit and I can see my heart right now And it doesn't fucking do anything else, but it won't show you like your text messages.

226
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:44,186
Scott: now.

227
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:47,433
Scott: Two watches.

228
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,276
Scott: you weren't two watches?

229
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:54,975
Rym: well actually I don't know where my Android watch is anymore cuz about Couple months into COVID I just stopped wearing it.

230
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,400
Rym: cuz I'm not going anywhere.

231
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,329
Scott: can't on your phone say find my watch and then your watch will start.

232
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,579
Rym: beep I could but my watch ran out of battery probably months ago.

233
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,523
Rym: It's somewhere in the apartment.

234
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:07,598
Rym: Oh Notice how I stopped talking about my heart rate for a while.

235
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,943
Rym: that's cuz I don't know where my watch is.

236
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:10,529
Scott: good job.

237
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:12,882
Scott: Well, it's not far.

238
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:17,150
Rym: That's good I guess but mostly the only before we get into the actual like tech show.

239
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,529
Rym: The thing I noticed is if it's alright like yeah, take it or leave it.

240
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:37,381
Rym: But what bothers me is that thing I noticed about Strava and as I poked around the ecosystem of Health related metrics collection devices just being able to be used with software is getting increasingly Siloed and monetized in a way that I am uncomfortable with.

241
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,030
Scott: Oh, I mean, I'm feeling in the bicycle area, right?

242
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,490
Scott: There's the ant ant plus standard whatever and everything seems to work with that no matter what you get.

243
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,869
Scott: So I'm not feeling too bad in the biking area, but I guess there and there might be problems in other areas.

244
00:15:50,150 --> 00:16:00,169
Scott: Yeah, because I mostly all the bike computers all the bike all the bike sensors that I've seen are ant ant plus whatever It's called and all the bike computers support them.

245
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:10,510
Scott: Yeah, and all of the apps that bike people actually use, you know Zwift Strava the other ones that compete with those right ride with GPS, whatever.

246
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,230
Scott: They're all using the same thing and they all work together.

247
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:21,162
Scott: and I feel like it's in a situation where if any of Those apps tried to say we don't want to work together.

248
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,285
Scott: We want to do our own thing.

249
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,850
Scott: Everyone just stop using that.

250
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,723
Rym: Yeah It's mostly what Strava seems to have stopped working with is just use a raw device that doesn't have some sort of other app or service associated with it.

251
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:39,539
Scott: Also at the same but at the same time in the bike computing space There is pretty much Wahoo and Garmin and no one else's.

252
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:40,442
Scott: that's it.

253
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:40,803
Scott: Right?

254
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:48,710
Scott: So but neither of those The Wahoo apps on your phone don't really do what Strava ride with GPS do.

255
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,970
Scott: They're really just for sort of yeah working with the computer.

256
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:55,201
Scott: So you think so they need those integrations.

257
00:16:55,301 --> 00:17:07,348
Scott: if Wahoo or Garmin made a Strava Competitor or a you know ride with GPS competitor, which would be hard to do, but they could do it Then they could pull away if they wanted to yep.

258
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:14,259
Rym: But basically that's part of the other reason I got this thing is what I've been using to track all my other health stuff is Google Health and just.

259
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:21,170
Rym: I was thinking a lot recently about What's Google gonna shut down next and I don't really trust that any of the Google Fit stuff is gonna stick around.

260
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,816
Scott: Google Health is so shutting down.

261
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:26,810
Rym: Yeah, so I need I wanted to move to something that will probably stick around longer.

262
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,896
Rym: So Fitbit does all the stuff.

263
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,182
Rym: I was using Google Hell or Google Fit or whatever for.

264
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:41,314
Scott: so there is something though to say that Even though I think under normal circumstances Google would have shut down a lot of things that it has I mean even more than it already has.

265
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:48,430
Scott: yeah, is that anything that is basically a part of Android that is sort of matching a feature?

266
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,618
Scott: Yeah

267
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:53,330
Rym: Like an Android phone will just kind of do some health stuff automatically because that Google Fit exists

268
00:17:53,912 --> 00:18:00,318
Scott: Right is like there are things that they have to have on Android because iOS has them right so they feel like they also have To have them even if no one uses them.

269
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:08,390
Scott: Yeah, so whereas on Apple's side It's like Apple has all this stuff and you're like how many people are actually using that shit?

270
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:14,210
Scott: Using the Apple home automation thing that they have the Apple I home or whatever the hell it's called, right?

271
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,281
Scott: It's like there's got to be no one fucking using that thing But Apple keeps it there and that forces.

272
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:25,257
Scott: I guess Google now thinks it has to have that also For some god-awful reason right?

273
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,550
Scott: So it's like, you know an Apple people will never tell you right?

274
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,197
Scott: It's like how many people actually talk to Siri.

275
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:38,330
Scott: how many people actually you know use the like the EKG thing that you put in the Apple watch?

276
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:53,950
Scott: How many people are actually doing that versus you put it there you talk about it you forget about it And it's now just a thing Whereas you know, but Apple won't kill those things whereas Google wants to but they might not because Apple is there.

277
00:18:54,331 --> 00:19:01,450
Rym: Yeah, but I'm just being cautious with Google on anything that I'm actually like, yeah, I'm back up that I back up that shit.

278
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,519
Rym: Oh, yeah, I've exported all that data out.

279
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,945
Rym: I've got a plan now.

280
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:05,648
Rym: Yeah.

281
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,509
Rym: Oh, yeah Even though it's really hard to get data out of Fitbit too, but I think that'll last longer.

282
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,749
Rym: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

283
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:13,928
Rym: Anyway got any news?

284
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:16,818
Scott: What was my news?

285
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,969
Scott: oh, yeah really tiny news.

286
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:19,673
Scott: So, you know how?

287
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,920
Scott: these days you go to some websites and this banners.

288
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,296
Scott: they say yo, we got some cookies you want them And I've you know, you can install.

289
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:31,702
Scott: I have a plug-in in Firefox a Firefox add-on that hides a lot of those Banners, which is nice.

290
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:37,890
Rym: Oh, yeah I should still add block micro block just to not show me the GDPR banners, right?

291
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,705
Scott: So this is because of the GDPR law in Europe general data protection regulation.

292
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,190
Scott: It's not a US law.

293
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:52,450
Scott: so if you're not operating your You know business in Europe, I feel like a US only like eShop or something.

294
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,414
Scott: You don't have to do this.

295
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:54,980
Scott: and what's Europe gonna do right?

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,226
Scott: Just don't take European orders.

297
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,210
Scott: Yeah, you're good to go.

298
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:03,539
Rym: And if you do but if Europe isn't a big deal you see some people who just like Block Europe from their site.

299
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,207
Rym: the end that's happened actually more often.

300
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:05,809
Scott: You can do it.

301
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:07,618
Scott: So github is.

302
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,550
Scott: this is owned by Microsoft now, right?

303
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:15,331
Scott: It has been for a little while and they operate worldwide as worldwide as they can places They're.

304
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:20,150
Scott: they're usually the ones getting blocked right because they're hosting something that the country doesn't want, right?

305
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,226
Scott: Like software that helps you get through, you know, evil firewalls and things like that.

306
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:33,244
Scott: So anyway so GitHub has removed all of these GDPR cookie banners from its site.

307
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,950
Scott: Well, they're clearly operating in Europe.

308
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,710
Scott: They have a lot of users in Europe and they're a business operating in Europe.

309
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,610
Scott: They charge money to European companies to use github with their company accounts.

310
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,538
Scott: So how how are they doing this?

311
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,884
Scott: How do they get rid of their banners?

312
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,090
Scott: It's really fucking simple.

313
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,969
Scott: How they got rid of the banners, they stopped using fucking cookies.

314
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,400
Rym: The buried lead the thing.

315
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,070
Rym: no one fucking talks about that.

316
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,070
Rym: Those banners are only there because you're collecting evil data for advertising networks, right?

317
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,160
Scott: So you're actually allowed to have cookies on your site.

318
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:07,157
Scott: You're just not allowed to have any Non-essential cookies, right?

319
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:11,150
Scott: So the cookie that keeps you logged in to github that cookies allowed.

320
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,700
Scott: That's a normal cookie usage, right.

321
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:22,749
Scott: if the cookie added some other features to your website Like maybe I don't know what else you would use a cookie for besides keeping you logged in these days There's other ways to do this, but that's it.

322
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:28,172
Rym: Every site that has a GDPR cookie warning is using cookies for nefarious purposes Right.

323
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:33,285
Scott: GitHub does not send any information to third-party analytics services, right?

324
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,130
Scott: I guess they're analyzing you themselves.

325
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,809
Scott: Yeah, that's just their own analytics, right?

326
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:39,734
Rym: They only have like.

327
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:41,321
Rym: no third party can uniquely track you.

328
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,550
Rym: only they can uniquely track you use the website.

329
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:51,652
Scott: GitHub will only ever use cookies that are required and none to track display ads or send information Anywhere.

330
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:59,918
Scott: and because they're only using cookies basically to keep you logged into github, right and nothing else They don't have to display the stupid banner.

331
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,506
Scott: So when you see the banner on the website, right?

332
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,481
Scott: Don't just think Oh this stupid law.

333
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:06,890
Scott: It's just like a reminder.

334
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,582
Scott: It's like you knew this already, but I just want to remind you right that it's like.

335
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:14,780
Scott: don't just blame this law from Europe Right, don't just blame.

336
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,890
Scott: there are other parts of that law we can discuss other times.

337
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:24,830
Scott: Yeah, that may or may be good or bad that laws Is it both a blessing and a curse is my opinion, but this aspect of the law the cookie banner aspect, right?

338
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,413
Scott: You see the banner.

339
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,540
Scott: you're like all the stupid law put this banner here.

340
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,490
Scott: It's like no that website you're visiting, right?

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,649
Scott: Maybe they poorly designed the banner and made it extra annoying, you know, maybe that's their fault, right?

342
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:45,618
Scott: Maybe you know, right but what's really is that website that's putting up that banner is a operating in Europe Which is why not right?

343
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:49,133
Scott: and be they are Announcing to you.

344
00:22:49,675 --> 00:23:03,575
Scott: They're tracking your ass and selling information about your behavior on that website to someone else and therefore If you're going to accept those, you know, don't like accept the cookie Right.

345
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:06,730
Scott: Just try to get rid of the banner without accepting the cookies.

346
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,349
Scott: Fuck them.

347
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:20,240
Scott: yeah, they could get rid of that banner if they just decided that your experience on the website and having you be a Happy customer slash visitor was more important to them than selling your data to somebody.

348
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,501
Rym: black dynamite.

349
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:33,642
Scott: So right, so when I when you see that banner right in your I think most of the time myself included people think That annoying law or I make this banner go away.

350
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,790
Scott: You need to think this evil.

351
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:39,530
Scott: This is an evil website telling me it's evil website.

352
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:40,855
Scott: yeah, that's what you need to test.

353
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:50,010
Scott: the first thought you need to think when you see the banner show up right is This is an evil website that's been forced by law to tell it to notify me of its evil ways.

354
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:51,435
Scott: Fuck this website.

355
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:53,282
Rym: Yeah, also a subtle point.

356
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,230
Rym: You don't have to click accept to use websites.

357
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,289
Rym: You're actually they're not allowed to do that.

358
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:04,749
Rym: You can instead click on the banner and go in and actually say no don't fucking use those cookies and they have to comply Or they're a deep shit.

359
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,234
Scott: Yep, you can basically find some way to get rid of the banner without clicking Except cookies.

360
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:13,104
Scott: I don't think I've ever clicked except cookies once in my life.

361
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:14,550
Rym: No, I don't think I have either.

362
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,130
Rym: Of course, I usually don't ignore the banner.

363
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,485
Scott: Yeah, there may I don't remember I may I don't know it's and I can't guarantee that.

364
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:26,059
Scott: but like I don't remember doing it And I guess I can look at my people see what's in there.

365
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,330
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely not my default behavior.

366
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,530
Scott: And yeah, you could always do that.

367
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,267
Scott: If you're worried that you might have clicked it one time just delete all your cookies and start over again Into places, right?

368
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,033
Rym: So, uh, we're.

369
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,397
Rym: we don't really have like.

370
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:44,645
Rym: there's not enough information for us to talk about the biggest news like deeply But I just want to touch on it and link to a couple of websites you can read about it.

371
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:59,520
Rym: But if you're not aware solar winds got hacked like crazy and For for a bunch of complicated reasons almost definitely Russian state-sponsored espionage and this is a big deal.

372
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:12,690
Rym: like this story is one of the most important tech stories of the decade and Ongoing, like we don't know the extent of the damage from this because it's a big deal and everyone's trying to figure it out.

373
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:17,543
Scott: Yep, so if you don't know solar winds is basically sort of like a Cisco competitor kind of.

374
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:19,610
Rym: yeah sort of easy way to ish.

375
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:26,587
Rym: Kinda, you know How do I manage my network and enterprise infrastructure generally?

376
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,273
Scott: Yeah, you're like, you know Why you?

377
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:34,430
Rym: this is literally like the enterprise kind of crap that I built my whole career around.

378
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:42,218
Scott: Yeah, it's like you don't you know, this is not a something that normal people are, you know Concerned about right?

379
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:43,629
Scott: It's like it's only a business thing.

380
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:52,510
Rym: Yeah like the kind of person who knows a lot about solar wind stuff is the kind of person who uses like computer associate software or BMC software.

381
00:25:53,551 --> 00:26:08,881
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, what happened was is in order to log in to some solar wind stuff they were using this thing called duo which is a single sign-on service right sort of like one login or even you know, Like login with Google is a is a single sign.

382
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,350
Rym: single sign on is not trivial to implement.

383
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,325
Rym: There's a reason why there are vendors that provide tools and even hosting to do it.

384
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:26,190
Scott: Yeah active directory Solution right, you know kinda but anyway So what happened was is there was some sort of vulnerability?

385
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,114
Scott: where by There are these?

386
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:33,285
Scott: when you set up duo right on your end, right?

387
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:38,190
Scott: You're the company and you're gonna say, okay I want all my employees to log into all of our company systems with duo.

388
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:58,670
Scott: So we're gonna set up duo and we need a private key that we're gonna hide from everybody right except for us and the duo company and then That will be used for you know, verifying when people log in right generating You Know TOTP all kinds of secret stuff.

389
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,402
Rym: We're trying to avoid like this in detail because it's it's.

390
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,230
Rym: it's a little bit as a point.

391
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,309
Rym: You don't know how this stuff works.

392
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:12,870
Scott: the point is if you get a hold of that key, right the only ones who should have that key are duo and The company that is using duo for their systems, right?

393
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,609
Scott: If you someone else were to get that key, you could just log in.

394
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,015
Scott: Yeah, as anybody.

395
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,270
Rym: in general having a private key to anything gives you absolute power.

396
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:28,430
Scott: Yeah, so and duo even in the documentation is like yeah, don't let anyone get this key y'all you'll be you'll be boned.

397
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:55,952
Scott: and so SolarWinds was using duo and the key got out and Therefore people were able to log in to SolarWinds systems at many companies And they were able to log in, you know, basically almost Undetectedly because obviously it was detected as almost undetectedly, but basically they didn't need to have the two-factor authentication Right.

398
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:56,957
Scott: They were able to.

399
00:27:56,997 --> 00:28:03,608
Scott: just you know, sometimes you go to a website and it'll be like, okay Tell me your two-factor authentication code and you're like remember me for 30 days.

400
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:09,614
Scott: So I don't have to do this hassle again and it's like, okay And the way it does that is with a cookie Not a cookie.

401
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,610
Scott: that will not a cookie that will generate a GDPR banner a normal cookie.

402
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,509
Scott: And now you don't have to type in your to TP again for 30 days, right?

403
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,116
Scott: But if you have the secret key You could just use that secret key.

404
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:25,170
Scott: just make the cookie and just put it in your browser out of whole cloth.

405
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:31,244
Scott: Just open up a blank web browser Take the secret key run some code Go to into your browser and be like new.

406
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:32,070
Scott: you can actually do this.

407
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,930
Scott: You can go into your browser if you didn't know and go new cookie and just create cookie up.

408
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,093
Rym: Just type some stuff in there.

409
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:39,220
Scott: You can be like front row crew.

410
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,748
Scott: calm new cookie, right of key.

411
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:50,452
Scott: Your name You know value, you know, Joey Jojo Shabbat in the early days of cookies and web browsing Are you?

412
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:54,110
Rym: I would like look at cookies that were on my computer to learn things about websites.

413
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,982
Rym: I might have been interested in messing with it.

414
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,150
Scott: You can still do that.

415
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,475
Scott: But yeah, and then we're going to be a lot more human readable and simple Sure, but then you go to front row crew.

416
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:05,002
Scott: calm and guess what your bread browser is gonna send.

417
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:10,450
Scott: front row crew calm the information That your name is Joey Jojo Shabbat.

418
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:18,288
Scott: You won't see it but that data will go over the wire and our web server will ignore it and do nothing with it Because it's not looking for that, right?

419
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,549
Scott: But regardless you could go in and say yes session ID equals a correct working session ID and you'll just be logged in.

420
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:34,790
Rym: Yeah, you don't have to you don't have to type in any username password do to be nothing Yeah, and depending on the system you're interacting with you might not even leave like log traces.

421
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,936
Scott: Yeah, it'll just look like you.

422
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:42,182
Scott: someone was logged in and doing stuff and the only way you could like notice That's something shady was going on.

423
00:29:42,222 --> 00:29:47,170
Scott: You'd be like, wait a minute Because you couldn't like make a user you had still a login as an existing user.

424
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:48,555
Scott: You could like wait a minute.

425
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:59,469
Scott: Rym was logged in and doing stuff from Russia Right from the shady VPN service in I don't know an island, right?

426
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,313
Scott: Something.

427
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:00,676
Scott: Yep.

428
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,270
Rym: Now there's a lot of things going on here.

429
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:09,560
Rym: Like there are reports that solarwinds they are their own update server had a password that was literally like solarwinds 1 2 3.

430
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:16,249
Rym: But suppose That was not even used as part of this attack that was just discovered by accident.

431
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:22,330
Scott: Like well, it's you know, once you get attacked suddenly, you know, the eye of Sauron is upon you.

432
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,070
Rym: I guess there's two takeaways for all three takeaways.

433
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,314
Rym: I think you need like.

434
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:28,903
Rym: we cannot talk about this yet because there's not enough info.

435
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:29,786
Rym: just read these articles.

436
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:39,737
Rym: But number one Probably the single biggest threat to large enterprises and governments like in the United States For like a hackers and attacks like this.

437
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,550
Rym: It's probably this this kind of attack the supply chain attack.

438
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,775
Rym: You don't attack the fancy bank.

439
00:30:46,116 --> 00:31:00,090
Rym: you attack the dumpy ass software vendor that the fancy bank uses to do something boring Mm-hmm, because the bank is gonna run that software inside of its network and just trust it in many cases Mm-hmm.

440
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:21,995
Rym: The second takeaway is Uh as this as you know, like that password thing we talked about even without supply chain attacks The guess the best way to put this is security in most places like everywhere is a lot less Capable than you probably think and very much at the edges of these networks.

441
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:24,586
Rym: if you get past the edge You're bait.

442
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,039
Rym: you basically get root at that point.

443
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:27,623
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

444
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,589
Rym: and the third sort of like.

445
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:39,800
Scott: it's sort of like you can take really good care of your keys to your safe Deposit box, you know keep them separate and be super hide them in a really good place And that does nothing for you.

446
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,660
Scott: If the safe deposit box at the bank has like, you know a drop ceiling and someone just comes in through the roof of the bank.

447
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:46,767
Scott: Yeah, which has happened.

448
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:47,794
Scott: I've seen that in the news.

449
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,599
Scott: That's why I mentioned it.

450
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,440
Rym: Yep, or like case in point, you know many of my jobs.

451
00:31:52,681 --> 00:32:03,540
Rym: I you know, I'm an expert in the fixed protocol this like finance protocol Like that's a. I know a terrifying amount about the stupid protocol, but in the old days like a decade ago You know how that protocol was secured.

452
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:04,484
Rym: It wasn't.

453
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:13,960
Rym: it was plain text stock orders and transactions all this stuff We're just ASCII raw human readable being sent over networks with no security at all.

454
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,826
Rym: Why was that not a problem?

455
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:22,299
Rym: because it was all inside of private networks and private lease lines So no one really had access to that.

456
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,211
Rym: But if anyone got inside that network, it was all just there.

457
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:29,480
Rym: get root on any server that interacted with this stuff.

458
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,052
Rym: There's the whole transaction log.

459
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:31,717
Rym: There's everything.

460
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,813
Scott: So you can start trade and you can start trading.

461
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,820
Rym: yeah, you should.

462
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:50,604
Rym: In fact, I was once at a place where it wasn't me, but someone else a developed a QA person Accidentally connected to a production connection and century like hundred thousand dollars worth of orders of a test suite out to the market And they all executed

463
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:51,589
Scott: only a hundred thousand.

464
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:51,830
Scott: Whoo.

465
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:53,740
Rym: Yeah, you know how we fixed it.

466
00:32:54,101 --> 00:33:01,218
Rym: He wrote a script that wrote the inverse of every one of those orders and we ran it through the same QA pipeline to undo the positions.

467
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,808
Rym: Okay, and we actually made a profit.

468
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,462
Rym: so it was really funny in the end, but it was also Terrifying.

469
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,751
Scott: also, you're fired.

470
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:12,870
Scott: Yeah Accidentally made us money and you're fired.

471
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:15,159
Scott: We have to tell the SEC about this.

472
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,517
Rym: We did have to tell them about it, of course he did.

473
00:33:19,537 --> 00:33:23,380
Rym: I'm not joking Yeah, no, no, it was I. I helped write some of the incident report for that.

474
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,370
Rym: It was a. that was a. that was what I know.

475
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,099
Rym: that was early in my capital markets.

476
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,578
Rym: career Shall we say cost several multiple jobs ago?

477
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:41,377
Rym: but the third takeaway here that I think is Really needs to be talked about and it's kind of terrifying that our own government because of the incompetence of the current Republican administration Is not talking about it.

478
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:47,793
Rym: This is a state-sponsored Attack on American markets and American infrastructure.

479
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,720
Scott: Well, I mean also world, you know.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,119
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's except the state committing the thing.

481
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:53,065
Rym: Oh, they're definitely.

482
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:53,769
Rym: I'm confident.

483
00:33:53,829 --> 00:34:02,620
Rym: similar attacks are going on globally right now But it is pretty directly clear that the Russian government is behind these attacks.

484
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:14,091
Rym: no one seems to disagree on this fact and I don't think the United States is even like Remotely prepared to deal with actual modern cyber warfare.

485
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,460
Scott: No, I was trying to tell this to someone the other day.

486
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,627
Rym: It's I was watching that conversation you were having.

487
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:28,480
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're a Russian right a Russian tech person Yeah, and you are for some reason the evil and not opposed to your own government, right?

488
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,340
Scott: You like you're a Russian who likes Russia.

489
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,920
Rym: Yeah, like you're into Putin like you're down for this or at least you're not, you know opposed, right?

490
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,800
Rym: Yeah, it's like you're or maybe you know, you're terrified of that government and this is a way to not get you know.

491
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,600
Rym: There's a lot of reasons someone might do this kind of thing.

492
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,351
Scott: I'm saying the only like even me as a tech person.

493
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:54,639
Scott: the only reason that I could see not Wanting like if I imagine Scott, would you like to apply for the job work for Russia being you know?

494
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,720
Scott: You know engaging in you know clandestine espionage via computer.

495
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,580
Scott: I would say the only thing I don't like about that job is the morality of who I'm working for.

496
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:09,614
Scott: There's literally nothing else about that job that I find unfun uninteresting unexciting.

497
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,753
Rym: that kind of job itself would be Super fun.

498
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:19,380
Scott: some of the best About that job sounds fucking awesome, except I'll be working for the bad guy.

499
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:25,760
Rym: All of RIT was the class where half of us were computer security and the other half were hackers.

500
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:28,392
Rym: And then you swap the next quarter one group.

501
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:30,000
Rym: You got to provide a bunch of services.

502
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:30,945
Rym: Don't get hacked.

503
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,633
Rym: the other group your only job.

504
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:34,020
Scott: I took that class as well.

505
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,765
Rym: No, it was a fun class anyway So the own.

506
00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:48,898
Scott: so obviously there are probably plenty of highly skilled Technological people in Russia who are loyal to Russia and are perfectly happy with that Otherwise awesome job because they don't consider it to be an evil job the way I do.

507
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,666
Scott: yeah Meanwhile in the United States right.

508
00:35:52,087 --> 00:36:00,655
Scott: if the United States was hiring that for position come to the NSA or the CIA and do clandestine computer espionage for United States right.

509
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:09,650
Scott: and even if The you know we got rid of all the Republicans and was only Democrats in both Congress and the president And it was all Democrats.

510
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:15,433
Rym: Let's even assume magically It's the only that is always doing the right thing and there is no ethical question.

511
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:17,700
Rym: magical future world right?

512
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,022
Scott: They're only asking me to do Espionage.

513
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,186
Scott: is that I am okay with?

514
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:21,949
Scott: right?

515
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,795
Scott: that I can see are for the good of the world.

516
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,320
Scott: that job sounds like awful.

517
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:30,600
Scott: That sounds like the worst job to work right with all sorts of government bureaucracy bullshit.

518
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,902
Rym: This is.

519
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:38,140
Rym: the US government would never ever hire the kind of person who is good at that kind of thing, right?

520
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,120
Scott: It's like you know and not even I'm not opposed like the core principle of being a public servant like I'm all down with that.

521
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:54,512
Scott: Yeah, it's just actually being a public servant in the United States especially for the federal government is Awful, it's like there's so much bullshit.

522
00:36:54,532 --> 00:37:05,530
Rym: You got a deal like oh wait, so I work That in my life I can work way harder make like a tenth what I will not attend more like a fifth of what I Make now have to move somewhere.

523
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,380
Rym: I don't want to live and deal with bureaucracy.

524
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,419
Rym: Yeah, maybe I'll just stay in the private sector.

525
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,880
Scott: Right exactly And that's why we're getting our asses kicked.

526
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:26,809
Rym: Yeah, but one of the one of the one of the major reasons we're getting our asses kicked Yeah, but what I'll leave you with is and I'm not saying that a kinetic force is what we should do Don't get me wrong, but no American doctrine.

527
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,196
Rym: Is that a text like this?

528
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:33,706
Rym: cyber attacks are tantamount to kinetic attacks like.

529
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:41,489
Rym: that is an act of war and we reserve the right as a nation to respond with either Cyberattacks or kinetic attacks like.

530
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,315
Scott: yeah, that's only that's I'm pretty sure.

531
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:51,719
Scott: you know I've that's been true for a while But I believe that since no one has ever fucking you know Done that it's pretty much become a you.

532
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:52,986
Scott: You know.

533
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:56,000
Scott: yeah Yosemite Sam you're crossing this line.

534
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:00,731
Scott: Nobody is ever gonna do it.

535
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,480
Scott: It's not it's not actually true.

536
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Scott: It's only written on paper an excuse in case someone actually gets the balls to do it, but there's something even worse.

537
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,195
Rym: It's there's this like there's a way worse.

538
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:11,658
Rym: part of this.

539
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:26,832
Rym: everything We're talking about is like they attack the government directly which happened like the Department of Energy got hacked by this like FYI Yep, and if you don't know what the Department of Energy does go look it up because if you don't know what it does You're probably gonna be really surprised when you find out what it does.

540
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:29,240
Scott: the Department of Energy doesn't handle the power plant.

541
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:31,760
Rym: Yeah, the Department of Energy handles energy.

542
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:34,286
Scott: The big energy.

543
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,020
Rym: yeah the biggest the biggest we know about.

544
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:53,231
Rym: Anyway, but the real places where these where these attacks will happen Even if our government was secure is all the support structure around our government the economy itself Private power companies like that whole sector.

545
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:59,680
Rym: if you think it sucks to work for the federal government doing IT Imagine working for like a power company in Oregon.

546
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:03,285
Scott: Yeah, right Con Edison's IT.

547
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:04,610
Rym: Yeah imagine that job.

548
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,657
Scott: I see I see their website and how it works.

549
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:07,640
Rym: Yeah, I see that website.

550
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:08,766
Rym: I know what it would be like to be.

551
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:09,168
Rym: it's not.

552
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,979
Scott: oh, it's got okay parts, but it's also Obviously not a place I want to work.

553
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,579
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

554
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,160
Rym: So remember a while ago, we found the worth it kids channel and had a million great things.

555
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,123
Rym: So can't just leave.

556
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:27,785
Scott: that was that.

557
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,212
Scott: was you who found that I actually watched any of those?

558
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:31,416
Rym: you haven't watched Big Top Burger.

559
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,730
Rym: I Don't remember though the Wow go watch Big Top Burger.

560
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,634
Rym: The show is really short.

561
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:37,898
Scott: I might have.

562
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:38,400
Scott: I don't remember.

563
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:43,395
Rym: It's about a clown and a bunch of people dressed as clowns working in a burger truck.

564
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,047
Scott: I Don't think I saw that.

565
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:49,314
Rym: It's it's up your alley specifically anyway.

566
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,018
Rym: So I found another channel like this randomly this jewel haver.

567
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,104
Rym: But this channel I just found.

568
00:39:56,124 --> 00:40:09,159
Rym: this video was recommended to me by the algorithm, but it was just this like weird like early 80s looking computer rotoscope kind of thing and it's called playing an RPG for the first time and it's just this.

569
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:15,480
Rym: Animated comedy sketch of an adventurer is often his first adventure and he sees a rat and he murders it.

570
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,408
Rym: then he sees a ghoul and he murders it.

571
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:30,546
Rym: and then he goes into town looking for a quest and I thought it was gonna be okay funny, but about halfway through it goes from pretty funny to Really funny.

572
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:33,600
Rym: the voice acting in this is stellar.

573
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:37,673
Rym: This is equally funny to some of the worth it kids, but for different reasons.

574
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,920
Rym: this thing was really really funny to me.

575
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,949
Rym: I'm not even gonna spoil it.

576
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,119
Rym: It's three minutes long.

577
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,532
Rym: This channel is worth subscribing to based on this video alone.

578
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:58,318
Scott: I Actually just in my mind as I was thinking of my current thing of the day a Flash came in and was like wasn't that gonna be the thing of the day, but I guess that one will be Wednesday.

579
00:40:58,378 --> 00:41:04,042
Scott: So You know me I like a fossil but I really like a trilobite That's.

580
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,539
Rym: one of the first things I learned about you was that you like trilobites.

581
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,613
Scott: Trilobite is a cool-looking fossil.

582
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,480
Scott: if you find a cute one.

583
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,520
Scott: Yeah, the problem is if you had an actual live trilobite somehow that would be scary as fuck.

584
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,318
Scott: Get that thing away from me, right but a trilobite fossil is hella cool.

585
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:27,920
Scott: So I found this article like a month ago and I dug it up here for my thing of the day today And it's basically do you know like the first time anyone saw a trilobite?

586
00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:38,600
Scott: And it's like there was this guy in like, you know, some royal collection and like Oxford who noted this fossil He thought it was some kind of flat fish or something Welsh the Reverend lewd.

587
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:42,360
Scott: Yeah, they don't know if it's like Lloyd lewd something like that.

588
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,620
Scott: Anyway, but he was you know credited as yeah, this is Southwestern Wales.

589
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Scott: Yeah credited as being like the trilobite discoverer, but that's obviously the colonialist interpretation.

590
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,240
Scott: Yeah, it's like he didn't discover the trilobite, right?

591
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:05,140
Scott: He's just the first person to in English writing in the West, you know Make note of it in a scientific journal, right?

592
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,723
Scott: So that's something.

593
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,570
Scott: but it's not like a discover right.

594
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:13,771
Scott: and this article really goes pretty interesting Goes into like.

595
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:23,070
Scott: yeah, actually People going way way way way way back to super ancient times You know, these were you know Stone Age right.

596
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,772
Scott: think Stone Age.

597
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,820
Scott: the rocks are real important in the Stone Age.

598
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,185
Scott: That's why it's the Stone Age right.

599
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,751
Scott: people are making things out of stone.

600
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:31,180
Scott: They were paying a lot of attention to stones.

601
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,165
Scott: They didn't have television.

602
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:32,888
Scott: They didn't have internet.

603
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,200
Scott: So yeah, they're playing with rocks.

604
00:42:35,842 --> 00:42:39,955
Scott: They would note and be like, you know what this rock is a real special rock.

605
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:56,805
Scott: It's got look it's different Look, it's a mini and there were like cave drawings of trilobites, right and people would make You know jewelry's out of trilobite fossils and stuff and it's like the trilobite was discovered way before This dude at Oxford.

606
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,409
Scott: so really fascinating here.

607
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:01,458
Scott: history of the trilobite that I did not know is is obvious.

608
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,354
Scott: in retrospect Trilobites are cool.

609
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:08,471
Rym: All right in the meta moment.

610
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,840
Rym: I have not put up the signal.

611
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:13,200
Rym: I have not read for the Tale of Genshin.

612
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:16,975
Scott: I I thought I was in bed last night and I'm like I could do it.

613
00:43:17,457 --> 00:43:20,191
Scott: I could do it Cuz I don't have to go to work.

614
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:20,995
Scott: I don't gotta do nothing.

615
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,879
Scott: I could just do it right now.

616
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,845
Rym: You know what I ended up doing.

617
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:32,639
Rym: I never reading a long article about CIA tactics Because I've been watching a bunch of lectures from that woman who did the TED talk on like CIA Disguises and I went down a deep rabbit hole.

618
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:37,353
Scott: I'm going back to playing that um that Hades game that I almost beat.

619
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,240
Scott: I'm just gonna beat it and then I'll be good.

620
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:43,265
Rym: Ah, yeah, I'm finished I'm getting near the end.

621
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:44,930
Scott: You think you're getting near the end?

622
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,492
Scott: You have the eye?

623
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:46,314
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:48,260
Rym: Yeah that that opened up some things.

625
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,960
Rym: I found some interesting conversations.

626
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:52,064
Rym: Some people are were.

627
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:55,820
Rym: some of the characters in this game are worse than I thought and some of them are actually better than I thought.

628
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,721
Scott: Yep Chowderman Showed.

629
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:07,231
Rym: I pointed some friends at the Chowderman's music video the other day.

630
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:10,720
Scott: There's one spread the chowder love.

631
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:19,579
Rym: You know what the Chowderman music video from that game reminds me of the music videos that were on Windows PCs in the multimedia era.

632
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:25,599
Rym: Well, that's what this is trying exactly, but specifically octopus of love if anyone remembers that one.

633
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,225
Scott: Yes So, yeah the Conventions not happening.

634
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:36,196
Rym: at least there's gonna be like an online Zenkai con so we'll figure out.

635
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,219
Rym: we'll probably do something for that.

636
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,247
Scott: Am I gonna go to Zenkai con?

637
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:39,789
Scott: Whoa.

638
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,299
Rym: Yes, this would be Scott's first Zenkai con in like a decade.

639
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:44,286
Scott: It's been that long.

640
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:46,740
Rym: I think the last Zenkai con you went to it was still in King of Prussia.

641
00:44:48,401 --> 00:44:51,451
Scott: I know I went to one in the other in the nuke in Lancaster.

642
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:59,765
Rym: Yeah once you lent Lancaster one time I go every year because it's actually my favorite small Lancaster two times.

643
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:00,468
Scott: it's possible.

644
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:01,672
Rym: I could check the archive.

645
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:03,720
Rym: I have that database of every convention performance.

646
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Scott: They have gone to Lancaster two times, but I definitely went at least one time because there's a comic book store near the train station.

647
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,042
Rym: You know what?

648
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:10,110
Rym: I actually don't track.

649
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,137
Rym: Yes, you did.

650
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:13,470
Rym: We stopped at that comic book station both years.

651
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:15,320
Rym: a comic book store by the station.

652
00:45:15,825 --> 00:45:17,320
Rym: I don't track which of us went to a con.

653
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,647
Rym: I only track what panels we did.

654
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:28,100
Rym: but I can usually derive if you were at a con Because you really never do cons without me, but I often do cons without you and I'm gonna go do a con without Rym.

655
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:29,679
Rym: Now do it go for it go.

656
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:45,060
Rym: But if anyone wants Scott at their con to do a talk without any rims because you don't need some you don't need hair then Invite Scott with that but then come to me privately and make sure that I'm also there and make me the moderator of Scott's panel.

657
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:46,663
Scott: Don't do that.

658
00:45:46,723 --> 00:45:47,506
Rym: That'll be really funny.

659
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,553
Scott: It won't be funny someday.

660
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:51,580
Scott: Maybe the moderator of rims panel.

661
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,697
Rym: But for the time being we're gonna be doing online cons only.

662
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:56,220
Rym: so stay tuned.

663
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,622
Rym: We're gonna.

664
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:06,318
Rym: if there is an online convention that you would like to see us do something at especially if you'd like to see us do something other than just pre record a panel and give it to you like

665
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:12,740
Scott: and The online convention already has enough not white not straight not dudes on its roster.

666
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:17,320
Scott: That is the point for it that they can afford to add two white dudes and still be okay.

667
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,014
Scott: Then have the convention call us up.

668
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:24,220
Rym: Yep Otherwise, I don't have any more work the rest of this week.

669
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,472
Rym: So, uh, I'm gonna work out some stuff, but I'm not gonna say what.

670
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:29,440
Rym: so I don't shit-talk anything, but I'm working on two.

671
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:37,182
Rym: I'm working on two projects that you might see the fruits of and a third project that I ain't saying shit about for another couple Years.

672
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:48,832
Scott: the only things I am actually doing that I've Can say that I'm doing because I've done them is I am streaming myself solving advent of code every day Yes, and some good Scott problem-solving ASMR.

673
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:50,661
Rym: I Guess.

674
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:55,495
Scott: and then I'm a bike and I biked again after a little break.

675
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,588
Scott: I'm biking to nowhere.

676
00:46:57,669 --> 00:47:18,620
Scott: so you can come and watch a twitch stream of me biking in place stationary biking And talk to me about anything appropriate while I am For when I know and if you don't and there's no times on these things, it's pretty much whenever I feel like doing them Every day that I'm not working just on my twitch channel.

677
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:22,794
Scott: You can also come to our discord and there is a channel on the discord.

678
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:26,388
Scott: that will tell you when the twitch goes live And you can click on that and so forth.

679
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,960
Rym: I haven't been hanging out in that discord much the last couple weeks.

680
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,740
Rym: I've just been really busy, but I'm getting back to my normal life.

681
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:33,159
Rym: I got a bunch of work stuff going on.

682
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:40,079
Rym: That's actually taking a lot of brainpower and time But I'm trying to get back to my normal life of goofing off more and doing more like GeekNights stuff with all of you.

683
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:45,305
Rym: So stay tuned Mm-hmm, uh That's all I really got there.

684
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:46,289
Rym: Let's get right to the main bit.

685
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,185
Rym: We we thought for you know, we're not going anywhere There's no holiday travel.

686
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:53,360
Rym: So we're actually around for the entire end of the year to do shows.

687
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:58,519
Rym: We happen to have exactly two weeks left of the year meaning one GeekNights episode of every day.

688
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:06,755
Rym: So a great way to not have to come up with a show I thought was let's talk about like 2020 like what we did in 2020.

689
00:48:06,755 --> 00:48:14,300
Scott: Yeah Every magazine and every media outlet in the whole world has these stupid repeating things.

690
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,240
Scott: This is why you know, you know time magazine is always like person of the year.

691
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
Scott: You know why they do that because that's a whole one whole issue.

692
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,020
Scott: They don't have to fucking think about what the title of the cover story is gonna be.

693
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,860
Rym: Why do you think I get so excited when Scott lets me do a tech news roundups?

694
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,266
Rym: Like I don't have to do anything.

695
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:30,334
Rym: Let's just go find some tech news, right?

696
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:31,880
Scott: So here we go four episodes.

697
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,191
Scott: You don't have to think about what the thing is.

698
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:37,693
Scott: We're just gonna do Decade and maybe also year in whatever.

699
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:39,200
Scott: so in tech, right?

700
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,475
Scott: 2010 verse 2020 and also I guess 2019 verse 2020 maybe right?

701
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:44,539
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

702
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,874
Rym: So we'll keep it fluid for the Monday show.

703
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:47,720
Rym: We'll see how this goes.

704
00:48:47,880 --> 00:49:02,395
Rym: But this is actually particularly easy for me because I moved to New York City In late 2009, yep I also moved to New York City in very early 2010 like the end of 2009 right after you.

705
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:07,445
Scott: so for my life right Everything changed very.

706
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:14,792
Scott: it's very easy for me to remember what 2010 this Decade was like because I just have to think about my entire time.

707
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:21,422
Scott: not not, you know working in New York City Which is much longer but living on my own in New York City Right.

708
00:49:21,824 --> 00:49:22,887
Scott: is this decade?

709
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,809
Scott: where is the previous?

710
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,460
Scott: anything that isn't me living in New York was a previous decade.

711
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:28,120
Rym: No, what's weird?

712
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:37,523
Rym: so you think about the fact that the previous decade included the entirety of college and Like the first five years of GeekNights That's right.

713
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:40,800
Rym: Like I was being on the radio in Tokyo.

714
00:49:42,142 --> 00:49:43,633
Scott: Yes, that happened.

715
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:44,459
Rym: That was the thing.

716
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,292
Scott: That was the thing one time in the ancient.

717
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:48,980
Scott: I have the wave file for it somewhere.

718
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,009
Scott: Yep, I saw it in my backups.

719
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:52,716
Rym: Anyway, I also had this idea.

720
00:49:52,797 --> 00:50:04,409
Rym: I thought all right I'm gonna go back in Google Photos and scroll back down to like January 2010 and I'm hoping those photos will like jog my memory of like things I Didn't start using Google Photos until 2011.

721
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:10,613
Scott: So I have a better way to jog my memory because Luckily or at least for technology specific.

722
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:12,000
Rym: Oh, yeah new egg orders.

723
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,950
Scott: No, luckily or unluckily, right?

724
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:21,617
Scott: I was my apartment in 2010 Maybe 2011. it was early in the decade.

725
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:24,386
Rym: Oh, yeah You got was burgled.

726
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:25,832
Scott: It was burgled.

727
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:35,380
Scott: There's an episode about it and I Had to list all the things that were burgled for insurance purposes because I had renters insurance.

728
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,968
Scott: You should get renters insurance if you rent.

729
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:37,551
Scott: get it today.

730
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:38,757
Scott: It's so cheap cost like a dollar.

731
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:43,089
Scott: If you can afford to rent you can afford renters insurance you.

732
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,032
Scott: it's like must-have.

733
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:47,100
Rym: you spend more money on losing quarters in the laundry.

734
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,590
Scott: I've spent like $100 a year on renters insurance for ten years.

735
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:55,020
Scott: the one payout is I'm still making a profit anyway.

736
00:50:56,749 --> 00:51:01,753
Scott: so What kinds of things Technology were?

737
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:02,500
Rym: so here's a big one.

738
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:17,200
Rym: I can think of a big change that began right in the early 2010s like it was actually 2011 when this happened, but Adobe switched from buy our software to we are software as the service pay us a monthly fee and you'll always be up to date.

739
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:36,504
Rym: that was about a decade ago, but I think there's a theme of the decade of this was the decade of a huge amount of software used by professionals shifted to subscription models and the whole like ecosystem of software as a service completely Reimagined itself.

740
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,932
Scott: Well, I just think cloud everything in general.

741
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:39,454
Scott: Yep, right.

742
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:40,477
Rym: I mean creative everything.

743
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:43,368
Rym: It's in the title Yeah, everything clouded.

744
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:43,649
Scott: right.

745
00:51:43,689 --> 00:51:48,123
Scott: you stopped using Microsoft Office, right and you started using Google Drive.

746
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:53,340
Rym: Yeah, or you started using like Microsoft's Office cloud thing, right in 2010.

747
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,220
Scott: What was Google Drive was just like what like a cute thing that they bought from someone else like Google Docs.

748
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,535
Rym: I wonder what my oldest file even is on Google Drive.

749
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:01,220
Rym: Let me do a query.

750
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,750
Scott: Yeah, it's like everything moved to the cloud.

751
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:05,970
Rym: Like.

752
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:08,778
Rym: I moved everything I do to the cloud.

753
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:10,425
Rym: for the most part I like change how.

754
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:17,660
Scott: it wasn't just a place for it wasn't just like Flickr where it's like, okay, you have your local file collection and you share it on Flickr.

755
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,571
Scott: It's like no now your your file collection is just on.

756
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,639
Rym: the 2010s was the decade where I shifted to.

757
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:25,292
Rym: Almost everything I do is either software.

758
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:26,860
Rym: I subscribe to or a web browser.

759
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,806
Scott: Yep, pretty much All.

760
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:30,872
Scott: but here in 2010, right?

761
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,876
Scott: The con the game console that I had was a week and maybe Xbox 360 that I barely.

762
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,449
Rym: we both bought those Xbox 360s and they got rid of them.

763
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:43,110
Scott: Yeah Is that right?

764
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:46,469
Scott: that 4k was not a thing in 2010?

765
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,563
Scott: right 20 the 2010s was 4k going from.

766
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:53,489
Scott: basically in the beginning part of the decade only.

767
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:58,754
Scott: maybe like ultra professional TV movie people could have any 4k fucking anything.

768
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:03,264
Scott: and now like GoPros have had 4k since forever.

769
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:17,446
Scott: I bought the gh4 this decade, which was like the first like, you know Consume almost almost consumer like highest end but still consumer Possible prosumer camera and it could record 4k video.

770
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:24,067
Scott: It was like the first one Basically, and now every camera has 4k like the cheapo.

771
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:24,789
Scott: GoPros have 4k.

772
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,033
Scott: They've had him for years.

773
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:26,635
Scott: right.

774
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:28,923
Scott: 4k TVs are not ridiculous.

775
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:30,990
Scott: 4k monitors are not ridiculous.

776
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:33,666
Rym: I'm looking at two 4k monitors right now doing gig nights.

777
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:34,390
Rym: I bought them recently.

778
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:39,676
Scott: People have monitor, you know, people have very high-resolution screens Even if they're not 4k.

779
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:41,264
Scott: the pixels now are so small.

780
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:45,157
Scott: at the beginning of the decade 1080p was like the best right?

781
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:46,802
Scott: It was like yeah 1080p's fuck.

782
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:49,730
Scott: Yeah, right now 1080p's like yeah.

783
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:56,286
Rym: This was the decade where 16 by 10 as an aspect ratio just finally disappeared completely.

784
00:53:56,727 --> 00:53:57,288
Rym: rest in peace.

785
00:53:57,348 --> 00:53:57,790
Rym: I miss you.

786
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:04,773
Rym: the world standardized on 16 by 9 or but I you know what I noticed with compute.

787
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:18,028
Rym: computing shifted to like tablets for one thing, but monitors are all 16 by 9 or the ultra wide gamer format and Laptops shifted to whatever fucking weird aspect ratio just to make the hardware good.

788
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,550
Rym: No one cares.

789
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:26,420
Rym: Yep, pretty much like laptops are all weird aspect ratios, which would have messed with my early 2010 sensibilities And I just don't care in the 2020s.

790
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:35,170
Scott: Now the smartphone, you know was really Originated in the previous decade with the palm trio the other palms.

791
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:36,756
Scott: iPhone is from 2000.

792
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,884
Rym: I got my first smartphone in like 10.

793
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:40,631
Scott: It was the first iPhone 2006 or 7.

794
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:40,992
Scott: I don't know.

795
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,317
Scott: iPod nano was 2005.

796
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:46,310
Scott: I want to say it was late 2008.

797
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:54,140
Rym: I got my first smartphone ever because my work gave me a modern blackberry like a like a one that actually Blackberries were very last decade blackberries.

798
00:54:54,281 --> 00:55:03,984
Scott: Um, but if you look at the numbers on smartphone adoption Smartphone adoption while they did exist there were iPhones in the late 2000s.

799
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,730
Scott: They were numbers wise.

800
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:14,324
Scott: They were only the domain of the wealthy the tech enthusiasts the well-connected the you know I guess elite whatever you want to call it people like me.

801
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:19,190
Scott: Yeah Who had a lot of money with those are the only people who had like iPhones?

802
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:28,890
Scott: By the way with 3g only right in the late 2000s Only in this decade that everyone has a smartphone.

803
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,877
Scott: Everyone has 4g.

804
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,352
Scott: right 4g didn't really exist in the late 2000s.

805
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:45,370
Rym: like we went from smartphones are this playground and people like really rely on Wi-Fi or Specialized tethering devices - and like people have replaced their computers with smartphones.

806
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:50,150
Scott: Yeah, people just don't have computers anymore and that goes hand in hand with the cloud thing.

807
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,090
Scott: Right is that it used to be that you needed your even though you had this other smartphone II stuff.

808
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,396
Scott: Right those first smartphones.

809
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,450
Scott: you would plug in your iPhone to your computer to sync it with iTunes, right?

810
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,760
Scott: It couldn't do its own thing.

811
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,790
Scott: It couldn't live on its own.

812
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:06,162
Scott: Whereas we went from that to well everything's in the cloud.

813
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:08,090
Scott: So really your computer doesn't matter.

814
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:09,370
Scott: You're not storing anything locally.

815
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,489
Scott: You can just throw your computer in the garbage as long as you've erased it.

816
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,225
Scott: You know for safety's sake right get a brand new one and be up and running so quickly because all you do is log into All your services and you're good to go.

817
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:20,434
Scott: Everything.

818
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:21,940
Scott: nothing's on your computer anymore.

819
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,970
Scott: All right, your software's not your computer anymore.

820
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:32,456
Scott: And that was like this dream that they had in the 90s or 80s even older of this sort of Networked computer.

821
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,844
Scott: and that's actually what they started with.

822
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:34,770
Scott: right the mainframes.

823
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,957
Scott: You would just be at a terminal.

824
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:47,310
Scott: and so what they were thinking with like You know thin clients and stuff right in the 90s 2000s was like hey You're gonna have a computer and I guess the chrome the chromebook was also sort of attempting to do this.

825
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:53,410
Scott: You're gonna have a computer that's really just a terminal and you're gonna all the work is gonna be done by CPUs in the cloud.

826
00:56:53,651 --> 00:57:06,021
Scott: Right, you're gonna do nothing locally, but what ended up happening was simply absconding right sort of repurposing the web Right and web api's as a way to.

827
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:06,623
Scott: okay.

828
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,147
Scott: You still have a local CPU.

829
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:26,330
Scott: that's doing a bunch of stuff but Most of your data and the software is on some other computer and we're gonna send you part of the software to run locally but not all of it and So you're getting that effect right but not necessarily the original imagined implementation.

830
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,440
Scott: Yeah, the you know client-only computer.

831
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,690
Scott: I think in general though that all happened in the past ten years.

832
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:43,610
Rym: Yeah, so computer workstations like an actual like full-on PC as much as they decline in terms of normal people using them People who don't have like a purpose for them as a tool or a gaming PC or whatever.

833
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:47,222
Rym: we saw the like full talk of this more on Tuesday next week.

834
00:57:47,543 --> 00:58:04,669
Rym: the fall of and then like ultra Renaissance of PC gaming like PC gaming in the previous decade before the 2010s was in a real like coming into a really bad state and Like it has had a lot of ups and downs, but it's like it always exists.

835
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,020
Scott: So we like can never die.

836
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:29,343
Rym: Yeah, but it's like exploded over this past decade coupled with It's easy to forget like the beginning of this decade was an era where Intel was the undisputed master computer chips Like that was like the end of the Nehalem era in the beginning of the Sandy Bridge era Like that was when we went from don't waste your money on an Intel to fucking.

837
00:58:29,363 --> 00:58:30,647
Rym: don't buy anything but Intel.

838
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,741
Rym: for the love of God Yep, it'll boot on the first.

839
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,871
Rym: try works every time like that We.

840
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:36,313
Rym: that was.

841
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,406
Rym: that was a sea change for me and how I worked with computers.

842
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:46,921
Scott: computers became now I don't know if I'm gonna buy another Intel, you know That's a long time the one I have but like.

843
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:52,642
Rym: but it's hard to remember that the decade that 2010 computers unless you had a lot of money.

844
00:58:52,662 --> 00:59:04,542
Rym: We're still fickle and unstable Mmm, and the 2010 through 2020 computers like desktop workstations are so rock-solid Even if you get like an AMD like.

845
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,510
Rym: they're fine.

846
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,014
Rym: They're easy to build.

847
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:10,505
Rym: people can build computers without knowing a lot about computers.

848
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:12,130
Rym: that happened during that decade.

849
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,656
Rym: Like that whole decade was like that.

850
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:14,420
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,886
Scott: Oh, we started with Windows Vista.

852
00:59:15,906 --> 00:59:17,011
Scott: now, we got Windows 10.

853
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:22,330
Scott: Yeah, all those other windowses were in between there, whatever Storage.

854
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,802
Rym: I'm trying to think about what kind of storage I had in 2010.

855
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:28,230
Scott: But uh, oh, yeah, let's talk about right.

856
00:59:28,591 --> 00:59:30,159
Scott: So we went from.

857
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:38,767
Scott: there were SD cards in The 2010s because I'm in the early the late 2000s because I had a crap.

858
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:44,030
Scott: Oh digital camera Right a little pocket cannon power shot, whatever and it took an SD card.

859
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:51,436
Scott: But I think that SD card was maybe like I don't know what the maximum size was like four gigs Maybe 16 gigs at the most.

860
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:52,360
Scott: like it was not big.

861
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,524
Scott: Yeah at all.

862
00:59:53,605 --> 00:59:55,010
Scott: It might not even been that big.

863
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,016
Scott: I might just be missed.

864
00:59:56,077 --> 01:00:02,304
Rym: and like USB flash drives went from Critical to why do you even own one over the course of this past decade?

865
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:06,637
Scott: I see best SD card 2009. can I even find this?

866
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:10,970
Rym: Yeah, I usually look at what was I buying in 2009?

867
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,095
Scott: Which flavor of SD?

868
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:14,526
Scott: Yeah, four gigabyte something like that.

869
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:15,350
Scott: eight or sixteen?

870
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:15,931
Scott: Yeah, four.

871
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:19,988
Rym: so in the 2009 so like four minutes of a gig nights panel, right?

872
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,244
Scott: So in 2009 you could get like 16 gigs would be like a big one.

873
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:31,054
Scott: 32 was like the biggest expensive mega one like if you had a camera that shot raw Most people.

874
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:35,130
Scott: I guess we're using compact flash then because the SD wasn't big enough.

875
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:38,549
Rym: Yeah, like the Marantz not the Marantz takes compact flash still, right?

876
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:39,851
Scott: Now.

877
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:44,145
Scott: so I think that 2010s were clearly the rise of flash memory.

878
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:50,678
Scott: not just SD micro SD right But also m2.

879
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:52,267
Scott: right m2 basically didn't exist.

880
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:59,210
Rym: Yes, these were still like oh if you're fancy put an SSD in your computer and they weren't that big either.

881
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,059
Scott: Nor were they actually the best right.

882
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:10,456
Scott: the density of flash memory Absolutely exploded this decade and now you can get you know ridiculously large Storage you can get.

883
01:01:10,476 --> 01:01:11,039
Scott: like an iPad.

884
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:11,703
Scott: you can get an iPad.

885
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:13,070
Scott: I think with like a terabyte of storage.

886
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,499
Scott: I think and I've had Pro does is there?

887
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,803
Scott: is there a terabyte option?

888
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:17,827
Scott: Let me see.

889
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:19,915
Scott: Hold on This big ones is?

890
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:25,398
Rym: I mean the computer I have now that I built several years ago Like fuck God like five years ago at this point.

891
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,750
Rym: I bought a one terabyte m.2 by NVMe drive.

892
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:32,081
Scott: If you buy an iPad Pro your choices are 128 256 512 or a terabyte.

893
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,107
Scott: So big big flash storage is taking over the world.

894
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,670
Scott: Yeah tiny micro SD cards.

895
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:46,344
Scott: We started off last decade with like a regular old fucking USB.

896
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:46,826
Scott: I don't even know.

897
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:48,030
Scott: do we even have micro USB?

898
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:49,234
Scott: I think I might only had mini.

899
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:49,897
Rym: I think we had.

900
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:53,110
Rym: I think we had made I don't remember but yeah, I feel I don't remember.

901
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:57,043
Scott: But anyway, the point is micro but now USB C.

902
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:04,724
Rym: Yeah, it took over like lightning cables Is like the cheap option for like crappy stuff and stuff.

903
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:06,670
Rym: that doesn't matter but everything's USB C now.

904
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:15,115
Scott: Yep Camera sensors, I already talked about 4k, but you know, that's not just the screens But I just want to say also the cameras.

905
01:02:15,195 --> 01:02:16,921
Scott: right cameras at the beginning.

906
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:22,021
Scott: get a get a digital camera from 2010 and compare it To 2020. it's like chocolate and shit.

907
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:23,750
Scott: Yeah, it's not even close.

908
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,650
Rym: I mean I think about the camera we used to use to record gig nights compared to what I got now, right?

909
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:39,489
Scott: The camera that you get in an iPhone today even a low-end iPhone today is better than a like a Canon Multi-d mark whatever from ten years ago, right?

910
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:50,646
Scott: That camera obviously also has advantages that the iPhone won't have but I'm talking about just like the image, you know sensor Right just unbelievable advancement in that area.

911
01:02:50,706 --> 01:02:57,470
Rym: Oh, yeah in 2010 I bought a 4 gigabyte USB flash drive USB 2 so slow as molasses.

912
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:01,013
Rym: I spent ten bucks on that thing day.

913
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:07,883
Rym: four gigabytes of very slow storage Mm-hmm, but it's not just that you like.

914
01:03:07,944 --> 01:03:09,210
Rym: storage like that got bigger.

915
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:14,573
Rym: It's that how people use storage changed a lot Like we went from.

916
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:18,303
Rym: you put files on USB sticks and pass them around to everyone.

917
01:03:18,323 --> 01:03:20,570
Rym: just transfers files directly via or via the cloud.

918
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:23,739
Rym: Yep, pretty much like I have.

919
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,525
Rym: you know what I use the USB store.

920
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:26,790
Rym: I was a stick for recently.

921
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:31,483
Rym: I had a. I have a cheap car to get through COVID if there's emergency travel.

922
01:03:31,804 --> 01:03:33,730
Rym: It has a USB hole in it.

923
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:36,220
Rym: I put a USB stick in that hole.

924
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:38,610
Rym: It'll play mp3s on that USB stick.

925
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:41,137
Scott: There's better ways to do that, but that's a way.

926
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:45,416
Rym: Yeah, it's a way that that car supports natively cuz that cars from 2012.

927
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,879
Scott: Yeah So what was I gonna say?

928
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:49,744
Scott: There was something else?

929
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:54,410
Scott: Oh Oh my god, why did it just slip my mind?

930
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:57,730
Scott: I Talk about something while I try to remember.

931
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:04,901
Rym: So let's talk about some other big changes that have happened Especially in technology that affects us like I think about how we record gig nights.

932
01:04:05,322 --> 01:04:07,470
Rym: We saw the final death of firewire.

933
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:22,790
Rym: like firewire is finally gone and there is professional audio equipment that uses modern stuff like USB-c has basically actually Finally replaced firewire and I went driving this giant Mackie mixer.

934
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:23,352
Rym: Do.

935
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:29,016
Rym: now I have this tiny little one you thing that does like everything that Mackie did and more is Just better in every way.

936
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:32,413
Rym: just plugs in with USB-c just works Like the geek.

937
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:38,153
Rym: nice pipeline has gotten so much tighter and the other thing related to that We went from.

938
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:44,348
Rym: it is a gigantic difficult expert pet task to stream any video to anyone to.

939
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,220
Rym: OBS exists and streaming is trivial and free for people to do.

940
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:51,608
Scott: Yeah, we're using like you stream right?

941
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,338
Rym: Oh my god We did a live stream.

942
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:55,244
Rym: What did we do that?

943
01:04:55,264 --> 01:05:00,230
Rym: I think that was actually 2007. we did that streams something like that.

944
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,295
Rym: But streaming was hard.

945
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:02,179
Rym: like think of what.

946
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:04,610
Rym: think about when did we start streaming gig nights live?

947
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,410
Rym: Kind of recently during this decade because it was kind of a pain in the ass until pretty recently.

948
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:13,153
Scott: So for consumer technology Right.

949
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:29,410
Scott: I think the absolute biggest advancement in any single like narrow thing and versus its impact on the entire world is It wasn't invented this decade, but the advancement of the lithium ion battery.

950
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,078
Scott: Oh my god.

951
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,775
Scott: and the last ten years is basically behind Everything else right?

952
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:41,110
Scott: It's like, you know, I'm not a fan of the electric car not a fan of any car, right?

953
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:45,263
Scott: But you got your electric car basically was not a thing ten years ago.

954
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,230
Scott: Now people just drive them around like it's no big deal.

955
01:05:47,481 --> 01:06:00,245
Scott: Yeah You got your every single device you have that you walk around with being not super heavy had lasting a long time Right all these things even if the chips were all.

956
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:06,282
Scott: they all kept up with all the chip Advancements and every other area right that we've you know advanced in.

957
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:20,369
Scott: if the lithium ion battery had not advanced It's like Apple would be like, well, we made this really tiny Apple watch at this tiny amazing screen and this tiny little CPU But the battery lasts ten minutes or it's as big as your arm.

958
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:33,389
Rym: Yeah like I got to the point to where I have a hot and it burns your arm like I have a powerful laptop that I Could play like sieve six on for like hat like four to six hours before I have to plug it in.

959
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:37,387
Rym: like That's kind of amazing how far that advanced from.

960
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:47,342
Rym: like How desperate I was for there to be holes if I was on like a plane or a train like by the time there was An outlet on those two things I could plug computers into.

961
01:06:47,362 --> 01:06:50,353
Rym: I didn't need that outlet anymore You know.

962
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:56,567
Scott: and obviously all these technologies that we've been talking about have Horrifying capitalist externalities.

963
01:06:56,648 --> 01:06:57,612
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, you want to talk.

964
01:06:57,632 --> 01:07:02,290
Rym: the biggest theme of the last decade is technologies converged on a singularity of cyberpunk dystopia.

965
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:15,354
Scott: Yes, but I think the lithium Right the need for the world's desire for lithium going up has maybe caused more damage than any of the other Things.

966
01:07:15,374 --> 01:07:15,976
Scott: Yeah, right.

967
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:16,478
Scott: It's like.

968
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,806
Scott: it's like yeah horrifying.

969
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:25,410
Rym: they you know Not just lithium and rare earth metals like there's a small number of things we need to drive.

970
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:28,882
Scott: It is like the elephant in the rare earth metal room, right?

971
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:34,522
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like, okay Yeah, they're mistreating workers in a factory making phones.

972
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:36,650
Scott: That's horrifying and the worst right?

973
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,101
Scott: It's like where do you see where the lithium comes from?

974
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:42,610
Scott: It's even more horrible, right?

975
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:51,272
Scott: It's like and and that lithium is in Everything Like almost like it's rare that you would even want to buy something Like.

976
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:56,330
Scott: what do you need in life that you don't already have unless it's powered by a lithium-ion battery?

977
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:56,652
Scott: so

978
01:07:56,713 --> 01:08:13,470
Rym: one thing I have appreciated about this is that We also saw because lithium batteries got better and because like the software and the understanding of how to manage them got better a lot of things converge to the point to where a Lot of stuff now charges in a standard unified way via USB.

979
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:21,993
Rym: Like who would have thought over the last decade that USB would become the modern power outlet for most things Mmm, like.

980
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:25,011
Rym: I didn't think USB would be it Mm-hmm.

981
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,362
Scott: So yeah, I guess yeah, you know, obviously, you know the Twitter.

982
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:31,564
Scott: we talked about the dystopia.

983
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:33,368
Scott: right Twitter existed in the late 2000s.

984
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,956
Scott: Yeah Facebook existed way before then.

985
01:08:36,996 --> 01:08:42,450
Rym: who would have thought that Facebook would rise to cause possibly more damage to American society than any other social technology?

986
01:08:42,611 --> 01:08:43,616
Rym: I mean that seriously.

987
01:08:43,657 --> 01:08:44,401
Rym: Facebook should be right.

988
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:51,305
Scott: but none of those things Really took off and became world conquering.

989
01:08:51,404 --> 01:08:54,657
Scott: world owning things Until this decade, right?

990
01:08:54,676 --> 01:09:00,456
Scott: Yeah, they existed last decade, but they were pretty much the realm of like Computer people right?

991
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:05,149
Scott: It's because of the battery the phone the cloud.

992
01:09:05,732 --> 01:09:12,917
Scott: That was the the only platform which could skyrocket those existing things To be more than what they were right.

993
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:20,049
Scott: they were, you know, maybe not completely innocent But relatively innocent in there, you know young days.

994
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:28,250
Scott: But the that platform that we invented this decade is what allowed those things to just conquer the entire world and ruin us all.

995
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:28,633
Rym: well, I'd say.

996
01:09:28,674 --> 01:09:47,533
Rym: in general technology like if you look at like 1990 through 2000, you know The information age like internet went from not existing for any practical purpose for normal people to existing But wasn't like fully realized yet and there was a lot of ideas about like what we could do with it But it wasn't quite in

997
01:09:47,553 --> 01:09:48,457
Scott: the space outlaw.

998
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:48,899
Scott: Yep.

999
01:09:49,683 --> 01:10:05,370
Rym: The 2010s was like, all right We're building and like the 20 things were we build all this stuff and we almost Discovered that humans might not have been ready to be able to talk to each other all at the same time Mm-hmm, like it might literally be that humans are not ready for that technology.

1000
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:09,150
Rym: I said this a decade ago and I think I was right.

1001
01:10:09,855 --> 01:10:16,508
Rym: Not that it was hard to be wrong about this that Social technology like this and the idea of like memetic warfare would become real.

1002
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:17,292
Rym: here We are.

1003
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:38,430
Rym: our news was literally about hacking and like cybersecurity Meme warfare has became real in a literal sense this decade And I don't know what's gonna happen like I can't even predict like that space evolved more between 2016 and 2020 than it did between 2016 and like 1916. yeah, right.

1004
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:45,764
Scott: So it's like on the one hand it sort of feels like man Technology doesn't move anymore like it used to right because we had huge movements, right?

1005
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:51,674
Scott: We went from you know CD to mp3 Spotify.

1006
01:10:51,794 --> 01:11:02,290
Rym: I went from like cassette 8-track to cassette Like a decade but cuz you have to CD to mp3 to nothing like I just stream stuff that went by like a lightning.

1007
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:08,030
Scott: Right also, yeah that because of the cloud thing right we went from mp3 to stream this decade.

1008
01:11:08,095 --> 01:11:16,725
Rym: Yeah We killed physical media except for collectors and nerds and people who don't have access And people who really just insist on principle and like collectors and take it down.

1009
01:11:16,745 --> 01:11:17,888
Scott: I'll just pirate it.

1010
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:21,734
Rym: Come on Oh Piracy you didn't get destroyed.

1011
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:23,841
Rym: piracy kept plugging along in about the same rate.

1012
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:24,543
Rym: It always has.

1013
01:11:24,563 --> 01:11:26,489
Rym: Oh, yeah, absolutely nature.

1014
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:40,025
Scott: well life finds a way Sure, obviously But you know if you think it's like even though there were these huge Change, you know society shattering advancements in technology in the 2010s, right?

1015
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:50,353
Scott: like what we said where we started and where we are now it feels like it's slower because Those changes are like more Incremental.

1016
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:58,484
Scott: it's like ah, we've replaced this USB with yup USB C Whereas before we were replacing like serial cable with us.

1017
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:03,570
Rym: before we replaced nothing With cell phone and then we replace cell phone with smartphone.

1018
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:04,853
Scott: Right.

1019
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:06,581
Scott: It's like, you know, we're the.

1020
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:11,562
Scott: they're meaningful upgrades We're getting but we're still getting and they're.

1021
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:13,370
Scott: they're you know, just as earth-shattering.

1022
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:16,100
Scott: But when you just look at them on face value, right?

1023
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:16,923
Scott: It's like you.

1024
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:25,145
Scott: look at 2000 verse 2010 2000. it was like, you know, Motorola StarTech and 2010 was like iPhone.

1025
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:31,369
Scott: Yeah, or I want to say great Maybe iPhone 420 like the difference between but but different, right?

1026
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:37,870
Rym: For like 3.1 is almost earth-shattering by itself, right?

1027
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,691
Scott: But then you look at like iPhone 4 from 2010.

1028
01:12:40,691 --> 01:12:46,205
Scott: I think that's right versus iPhone 12 and it's like oh that's not actually That huge.

1029
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,055
Rym: Yeah well part of this is there's.

1030
01:12:48,096 --> 01:12:49,340
Rym: there's a trailing edge of.

1031
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:52,332
Rym: some of what happened this decade is Brand new.

1032
01:12:52,352 --> 01:12:59,637
Rym: technology is extremely destabilizing and even though like you said we have this perceptionist moving slower It's actually moving faster and faster.

1033
01:12:59,718 --> 01:13:10,370
Rym: The rate of change is accelerating and the but - there's this lagging indicator of People are adopting the technology that came about us in the beginning of this decade exactly.

1034
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:15,186
Scott: We are way ahead of the curve the curve right that we hit in the 2000s.

1035
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:16,109
Scott: We had all this stuff.

1036
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:22,197
Scott: Yeah that stuff was adopted by the entire world and then Polished in the 2010.

1037
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,490
Rym: that is where a lot of this earth-shattering societal change happened.

1038
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,737
Rym: It wasn't someone invented social media.

1039
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:31,530
Rym: It was a critical mass of humans have access to social media.

1040
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:46,410
Scott: All the things we invented in the 2000s the 2010s wasn't about inventing new things as much as it was about Deploying the inventions of the previous decade to all humans who could possibly access it.

1041
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:46,973
Scott: Yeah, right.

1042
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:53,930
Scott: and then making it easier and you know Incrementally making it nicer and nicer and nicer because so many people have it.

1043
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,549
Scott: Well now there's more money in it to do that part, right?

1044
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:04,279
Rym: So something that's actually stuck out in my mind the last couple of months partly cuz I'm at home a lot I'm watching a lot of documentaries and read more just like nonfiction science.

1045
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:19,230
Rym: It is easy to forget that in the last decade a Terrifying number of Scientific discoveries and advancements have happened that are kind of literally pushing into understanding the nature of existence.

1046
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:21,824
Rym: We there are things that we just think we know that.

1047
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:25,237
Rym: yeah We're literally discovered this decade.

1048
01:14:25,578 --> 01:14:31,355
Scott: quantum all that stuff about like teleporting photons and shit all that stuff happened this day Like cut like there are.

1049
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:44,530
Rym: we've discovered all more about space in the last decade than possibly the previous 30 years Mm-hmm, and it seems like we almost have this and I say we is like society especially American society even like nerds like us.

1050
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:45,428
Rym: We're very guilty of it.

1051
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:51,390
Rym: The example I always use is doesn't it feel like Pokemon always existed like Pokemon's been around forever?

1052
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:55,068
Rym: You almost like your brain almost make up memories of it around since then the mid to late 90s.

1053
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:59,785
Rym: Yeah, like I was in high school and Pokemon was invented like yep, pretty much.

1054
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:05,086
Rym: Yeah, but it's easy to think Oh, yeah, this quantum physics thing that just seems obvious like yeah, what we knew?

1055
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,150
Rym: we knew that what a hundred years ago.

1056
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,336
Rym: It's like no we learned that thing Four years ago.

1057
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:11,365
Rym: No one knew that before.

1058
01:15:11,426 --> 01:15:17,490
Scott: four years ago Or at least someone had written it as a theory and that was in it floating around in your mind.

1059
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:21,684
Scott: But then the experiment that proved it right is like happened here.

1060
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:23,350
Rym: Yeah, but we're also large.

1061
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:29,350
Scott: Large Hadron Collider was 2010s, but right some of these last decade talk about that trailing edge.

1062
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:35,250
Rym: This decade was a huge advancement of material science and quantum mechanics.

1063
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:47,004
Rym: The next decade is going to be not the met like not the like mass-market societal adoption of technology using that but the early practical applications of some of that advancement.

1064
01:15:47,366 --> 01:15:57,130
Rym: the danger is Those advancements are Almost too powerful and too dangerous and the only people who will be able to leverage them in the next decade are mega corpse and states.

1065
01:15:57,992 --> 01:16:02,575
Scott: Yeah, I mean the perfect example of material science I think is carbon fiber right.

1066
01:16:02,616 --> 01:16:07,310
Scott: if you look in the 2000s carbon fiber was like this thing you saw someone making in a lab.

1067
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:13,349
Scott: Yeah, right for some fan Or maybe it was and then it was on like an f1 car or something which is still is you see like a concept for a?

1068
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,593
Rym: Carbon-fiber bike.

1069
01:16:14,774 --> 01:16:17,222
Scott: Yeah, right and now I mean there.

1070
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:22,430
Scott: I think there were carbon-fiber bikes maybe in 2000 But the point they were not accessible, right?

1071
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,909
Scott: It's still not it's still not cheap.

1072
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,002
Scott: But now if you have money, you can just get carbon fiber whatever.

1073
01:16:27,022 --> 01:16:34,110
Scott: you can get a carbon fiber camera tripod You can get a carbon fiber, you know backpack, you know the carbon fiber fucking anything, right?

1074
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,640
Scott: So whatever fit, you know, there are other fancy materials were.

1075
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:42,409
Rym: so the first carbon fiber bike wasn't until the late 80s And it was bespoke.

1076
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:44,897
Scott: Yep, yeah, I mean they.

1077
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:51,260
Rym: I was saying they existed but like now I go to a bike shop Like every bike has a carbon fiber fork at least.

1078
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:53,969
Scott: Yep, ever all of them pretty much, right?

1079
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:55,853
Scott: It's all over the place.

1080
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:56,536
Scott: Yep, but

1081
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:16,130
Rym: I sued like a thing that I this sounds dumb But I've thought about this this whole decade cuz I I travel a lot I always like my whole adult life a lot of my career has been traveling and the thing that has stuck with me is you can tell when there are big advancements in material science when things get thinner and smaller to the like and planes

1082
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:17,334
Scott: Seats

1083
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:22,474
Rym: and armrests and backrests and like all that like boring stuff You don't think about.

1084
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:29,270
Rym: we're able to get thin enough to like cram Additional rows of seats into planes without reducing the space people have access to.

1085
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,089
Scott: Also they took away legroom because they're assholes.

1086
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:40,489
Rym: Oh, yeah They did also reduce space but some of that change was because the seats could literally be thinner Because material science had advanced to that point.

1087
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:44,250
Rym: Material science advanced to a I keep saying terrifying degree.

1088
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:49,590
Rym: But it's kind of true in the last decade in ways that are not obvious to people who don't work in these fields.

1089
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:55,655
Scott: so now it's hard to see a decade out right because You know, it's hard to see.

1090
01:17:55,735 --> 01:17:57,682
Scott: but what I can see in the more immediate future.

1091
01:17:57,702 --> 01:17:59,830
Scott: We're talking about the chip war, right?

1092
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,034
Scott: That's happening, right?

1093
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:04,166
Scott: I still believe everything I've said about chip wars so far.

1094
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:05,370
Scott: It's gonna have a huge impact.

1095
01:18:06,076 --> 01:18:13,391
Scott: I think something else, you know What you have to do is you have to look around and you have to be able to see Right.

1096
01:18:13,452 --> 01:18:17,144
Scott: It's like we look at like an iPod right an original iPod classic.

1097
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:19,955
Scott: and you look at an iPod classic today The first iPod.

1098
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,730
Scott: and you say wow, look at that chunky ugly boy.

1099
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:26,784
Scott: But when it was new, it's like wow, that's fucking amazing, right?

1100
01:18:26,965 --> 01:18:28,210
Scott: It didn't look chunky at all.

1101
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:31,789
Scott: It didn't look stupid that it was making a bunch of noise with the spinning hard drive in it.

1102
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:36,730
Scott: Yeah, you know, it didn't look stupid that it's hard drive is small or any, you know, anything like that, right?

1103
01:18:37,195 --> 01:18:44,410
Scott: It looked perfectly amazing But only in retrospect does it look chunky and bulky and obviously there was so much room for improvement.

1104
01:18:44,470 --> 01:19:00,010
Scott: Yeah, so you have to do is you have to look around at things that seem To you currently as normal and you know great But actually they're chunky chunky boys in 2020 and they can be shrunk down.

1105
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:09,907
Rym: So the chunky chunky boys that I see right now CRT is for me Unless CRT is monitors like LCDs because CRT is couldn't really shrink beyond a certain point but LCDs wouldn't like.

1106
01:19:09,947 --> 01:19:17,801
Rym: they were pretty thick at the beginning of this decade and Now like even a pretty cheap LCD is crazy thin.

1107
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:21,552
Scott: I'm talking about things that are chunky in 2020 Right.

1108
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:27,690
Scott: Can you see something now that looks normal now, but is actually in 2030?

1109
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,219
Scott: You're gonna look at it and say right.

1110
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,410
Scott: So the things I see are the phones that fold.

1111
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:37,542
Scott: Yep, right full screens that bend screens that bend.

1112
01:19:37,562 --> 01:19:40,190
Scott: they're gonna make the screens because now they're selling them.

1113
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,240
Scott: They're selling them in the store right now.

1114
01:19:42,823 --> 01:19:46,859
Scott: So in ten years You're gonna have the screen that bends.

1115
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:52,987
Scott: I think is gonna be the real like super thin like in your bag Like the tablet is just gonna be like floppy like flop a flop a flop.

1116
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:56,018
Scott: Ah, right It's not gonna be like a rigid rectangle.

1117
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,082
Scott: You can roll it up.

1118
01:19:57,122 --> 01:19:59,269
Scott: You can whack your fly with it, right?

1119
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:01,600
Scott: It'll be fine something like that.

1120
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:15,114
Scott: the other thing I see this really chunky Again in the battery department, you'll look at like e-bikes, right, you know The lithium-ion battery applied to so much transportation not just cars bikes scooters all those things You know.

1121
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:16,161
Scott: drones all 2010s, right?

1122
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:26,143
Scott: the e-bike is of 2020. a 2030 is gonna look like Not an e-bike.

1123
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:29,480
Rym: I think By not be chunky right now the e-bike.

1124
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,170
Scott: It's like it's chunky things stuck on your down tube, right?

1125
01:20:32,451 --> 01:20:32,993
Scott: No, it's just not.

1126
01:20:33,154 --> 01:20:33,616
Scott: you're not good.

1127
01:20:33,637 --> 01:20:34,320
Scott: It's not gonna be there.

1128
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,204
Scott: It's gonna look like a bike.

1129
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,404
Scott: I Think I'm gonna know it's an evil.

1130
01:20:37,485 --> 01:20:44,956
Rym: even broader I think e-bikes over the next decade are going to become an ubiquitous and critical part of transportation Infrastructure in cities and sub.

1131
01:20:44,976 --> 01:20:45,418
Rym: hopefully.

1132
01:20:45,498 --> 01:20:47,266
Scott: well, that depends on policy not on tech.

1133
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:50,995
Scott: Well, the Biden Is there for that?

1134
01:20:51,196 --> 01:20:53,786
Rym: Yeah, the cabinet pick for transportation seems down for this.

1135
01:20:53,866 --> 01:20:54,348
Rym: so we'll see.

1136
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:56,889
Scott: well You know, he's half there, right?

1137
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:09,090
Scott: You know, he's a compromise, dude but yeah, there's Those are the only chunky boys that I can see in my immediate eyeball that come to mind.

1138
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:16,035
Rym: yeah, I this over the course of this decade because we've gone on way long so we can probably wrap this up soon, but My relationship with technology.

1139
01:21:16,055 --> 01:21:23,217
Rym: I used to have to carry a lot of devices and I used to have to like think about how will I do X in location Y?

1140
01:21:23,237 --> 01:21:26,150
Rym: and I used to have to still plan a little bit for certain kind.

1141
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,548
Scott: We went to mag fest carrying a big tub of stuff.

1142
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:31,078
Rym: Yep I don't be carried less and less and less.

1143
01:21:31,098 --> 01:21:37,042
Rym: I don't carry like anything with me anywhere anymore And I always have access with our.

1144
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:38,187
Scott: we can pay with your phone.

1145
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,880
Scott: now for real Yeah, just pretend like like oh that'll never happen.

1146
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,081
Scott: Nope.

1147
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:43,666
Scott: You I do it at the grocery store.

1148
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:44,850
Scott: Yep every friggin time.

1149
01:21:46,811 --> 01:21:54,869
Rym: So, you know, so hopefully we don't descend into an even deeper cyberpunk dystopia But I don't know if we can avoid it in the near term.

1150
01:21:55,572 --> 01:21:59,230
Scott: So I guess we're not gonna talk about just 2020 or just this year.

1151
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,584
Rym: Oh, we've already gone on for almost like an hour and a half here.

1152
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:02,550
Scott: All right, that's all right.

1153
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:04,637
Scott: Then the rest of the episodes will be decade only.

1154
01:22:04,737 --> 01:22:05,540
Scott: no decade.

1155
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,724
Scott: Oh, right.

1156
01:22:06,744 --> 01:22:08,390
Scott: We didn't do any other year, right?

1157
01:22:08,831 --> 01:22:14,950
Scott: So decade only and I guess we missed our first opportunity in 2010.

1158
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:16,816
