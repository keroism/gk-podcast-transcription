1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,327
Rym: It's Tuesday January 1st.

2
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:13,470
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:18,392
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight We talk about those house rules.

4
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:19,459
Rym: y'all be rolling with.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,117
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,784
Rym: Man, I don't know if tonight's episode is going to top last night's.

7
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:32,837
Scott: Oh last night I was the best episode of GeekNights.

8
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:35,750
Rym: I think I think that really is pretty much our triumph.

9
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:36,501
Rym: It's it's over.

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,565
Scott: after this I mean you can always tell when an episode is quality because it's so easy to do.

11
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:46,068
Scott: the episodes that are hard to do are Usually bad and the easy ones do are very good and it was like four hours long.

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,054
Scott: So Good time.

13
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:48,677
Scott: Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,450
Scott: So yeah today you can just forget today's episode.

15
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,004
Scott: It's not worth it.

16
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:54,956
Rym: Yeah, it is New Year's Day.

17
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:55,920
Rym: So you're lucky.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,326
Rym: We're even doing an episode today.

19
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,230
Scott: You're real lucky.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:05,290
Scott: We're just we got some time to kill and we're sort of waiting to for stomachs to settle and maybe eat dinner and go to Bed cuz you got to go to work tomorrow.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,909
Rym: Well, really the only reason this is happening is that I have 12 fluid ounces of Red Bull right here.

22
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,384
Scott: Oh, yeah, cuz someone brought those to the party and they didn't drink them.

23
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:15,649
Rym: Oh, he drank one of them.

24
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,160
Scott: That's about all a man can drink.

25
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:20,430
Rym: So, uh, this is kind of important.

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,950
Rym: So I figured I should talk about this in the news, but Xbox Live it's down.

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:34,736
Scott: Wow, they killed a sold so many Xboxes on Christmas that all those people trying to sign in totally destroyed The the system there.

28
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:38,750
Rym: I think there is in fact a relevant penny arcade from some number of years ago.

29
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:41,782
Scott: Yeah, something like that, I mean the we didn't.

30
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,210
Scott: we had similar problems.

31
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,330
Scott: I mean I tried to go to the we store.

32
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:51,090
Scott: You know the we shopping channel on like Christmas Day or the day after Christmas and he wasn't working.

33
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,156
Scott: It was not going.

34
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:54,200
Rym: so think of this.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,836
Rym: think about how many weaves have been purchased in the last I don't know four months.

36
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,110
Rym: pretty much every single one of them was a gift.

37
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:03,780
Rym: They all turned on at about 7 a.m.

38
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:13,422
Scott: Christmas Day and a large percentage of them went online Though not all of them because a lot of people, you know, can't set that shit up Of course, so we thought we had some problems later, but it turned out.

39
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:14,950
Rym: the wireless router just crapped out.

40
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,499
Scott: Yeah, just I reset the wireless router with the button.

41
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,290
Scott: that didn't help but unplugging it and then plugging it back in that work.

42
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:24,547
Rym: You know, it might not have helped that we had like 12 laptops in the house.

43
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,089
Scott: pretty much It's like we own one Mac.

44
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:35,710
Scott: but yet when people come over to visit us that are more max in the house than anything else and we're nerds with a Lot of computers like we got like five or six computers in this house, but goddamn

45
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:40,990
Rym: We really need to set up that Scott Johnson slash katsu computer in the living room to keep them busy.

46
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:41,993
Scott: Yeah I think we should.

47
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:49,170
Scott: really we should get a computer set up in the living room for people to use and Also, anyone who doesn't have a laptop should get one and I'm working on it.

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,288
Scott: You see I think we need to get a higher quality wireless access point.

49
00:02:53,589 --> 00:03:01,677
Rym: remember I was going to buy your laptop only with a better processor and pretty much better everything else But the power went out.

50
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,227
Rym: Yeah, and I didn't and now I'm waiting for that better laptop.

51
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:04,830
Rym: That's not out.

52
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:08,525
Scott: I think anyone who wants to buy a laptop should wait exactly two months.

53
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:09,510
Scott: then you will.

54
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:13,484
Scott: Well about a month maybe but February is the month to buy laptops.

55
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:14,970
Scott: Let me tell you it's just a race.

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,312
Scott: Can I hold out whose January is when all the shits gonna go down and then in February when you're gonna be able to buy all the shit.

57
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:29,164
Rym: so I can say one thing though Microsoft is actually going to Refund the money for all the time down for the people who pay for Xbox Live.

58
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,769
Scott: No, that's nice of them at least.

59
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:40,890
Rym: Well, I don't get a refund for the time the we shopping channel was down, yeah Well, if anything you should probably pay Nintendo for the fact that you're not using their stupid wireless.

60
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:45,149
Scott: Actually, I bought about punch-out from them today, even though it doesn't have Mike Tyson in it.

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,607
Rym: But is it otherwise exactly Mike Tyson's punch-out?

62
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,030
Rym: I didn't look.

63
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:56,867
Scott: Yes, it's otherwise exactly Mike Tyson's punch-out and other than the fact that Mike Tyson is replaced with mr Dream who I assume is the exact same thing as Mike Tyson only looks different.

64
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:01,078
Scott: Ah Yeah And the word Mike Tyson has been removed.

65
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,190
Scott: well, obviously I played and I was fine.

66
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:05,114
Scott: I got.

67
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:08,247
Scott: I lost a bald bull twice, but I you know, I rematched him and got.

68
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:13,868
Rym: no you got to remember He goes but doom but doom but doom and on the second and a half of doom you punch him in the gut.

69
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:21,209
Scott: Yep and then After that was the second piston Honda fight and oh, that's like the first hard fight in the hole.

70
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,135
Scott: Yeah, he took me out.

71
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,196
Scott: He took me out and I couldn't you think you're ready for him Thing.

72
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,561
Scott: I told he does it twice.

73
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,770
Scott: Yeah, I totally forgot the order of the guys.

74
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,950
Scott: So I kept thinking the next guy was gonna be soda Popinski and he's way late in the game.

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,410
Scott: He was I think he's after that second piston Honda.

76
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,722
Scott: But yeah, I really wanted to get to sort of Popinski cuz he's hilarious.

77
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,650
Scott: His head is shaped like a bottle of soda pop.

78
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,065
Scott: All right, so what kind of what was your news wasn't it?

79
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:48,850
Scott: Yes, it was All right, so I got a double news here ready.

80
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:59,170
Scott: So in this glorious New Year's week, or I think the week before the New Year There were four game for new games for the Wii released in the u.s All right only four games.

81
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:05,534
Rym: You know what, you know four games they were I do but I think I'll let you Tell the world.

82
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,750
Scott: Well, the first one was called Kawasaki four by four quad bikes.

83
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,030
Rym: Oh those Kawasaki four by four whatever games cuz they have things like that in the arcade.

84
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,917
Rym: Let me tell you those are some great games.

85
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:22,130
Scott: Yeah, then they got classic British motor racing Monster trucks with an X colon off-road.

86
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:33,503
Rym: I think the X is better a little bit classier than the Z you see in games like cats or dolphins And the best one rig racer - where you race in big rig.

87
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:43,989
Scott: Wow rig racer Okay, so Yeah, four shitty racing games are the only games that come out for the Wii in the last week of the year.

88
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,554
Scott: What does this tell you?

89
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:50,800
Scott: it tells you the Wii is the system that's getting a lot of crappy games for it and only a Few good games.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,327
Scott: and you know what?

91
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,882
Scott: Sounds a lot like the ps2 to me.

92
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:54,849
Rym: I think so.

93
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,730
Rym: I mean people always talk about how many great games there were for the ps2 and that is true.

94
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,275
Rym: There are a lot of great games like games that will go down in history as some of those great games for our time on The ps2.

95
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:04,905
Rym: but you know what?

96
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:08,410
Rym: 99% of the games on the ps2 are worthless.

97
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,581
Scott: yeah, you go to the store GameStop or whatever.

98
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:17,053
Scott: you look at the shelf for ps2 games and You see a row that has all those great games that people, you know We'll talk about forever.

99
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:21,227
Scott: and then you see 20 rows of games that are complete shit.

100
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:24,569
Scott: and you know People would never trash talk the ps2 for that.

101
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:28,250
Scott: But when they look over at the Wii and DS shelves and they see all these crap games.

102
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,450
Scott: You know, they trash talk the Wii and DS for that and it's like what the hell man?

103
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,453
Rym: well not everyone.

104
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:45,470
Scott: a bunch of crappy games for a system is a sign that the system is doing well because it means that This there's so many consoles out there that you're still gonna make plenty of money Even if you put out a shit game with you know, mediocre sales.

105
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:50,850
Rym: I mean remember when the GameCube was out and then bit by bit the third parties started abandoning it.

106
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,048
Rym: I mean there weren't a lot of crappy games for the GameCube just because there weren't a lot of third-party games.

107
00:06:56,108 --> 00:07:02,830
Rym: and Generally third-party games on Nintendo systems pale in comparison to actual first-party games on Nintendo systems.

108
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:07,810
Scott: Yep, and everyone always says, uh, you don't want to make third-party games for Nintendo systems.

109
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,650
Scott: If I'm not gonna talk about that now, that's that's a separate topic.

110
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:20,690
Scott: But anyway, yeah that ps2 with all its crappy games, you know When the ps2 came out a long time ago the year 2000 cuz remember we were at RIT and there was that casino night.

111
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,570
Rym: We're young and we were gonna pool all our money together to try and win it.

112
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,899
Rym: But it wasn't enough and we didn't win.

113
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,490
Scott: well cuz we bet it all on black.

114
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,717
Scott: We had a big pile of money.

115
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,601
Scott: if we bet it on black if it would have come up black We would have won a ps2, but it didn't.

116
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:33,447
Scott: so we didn't win a ps2.

117
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:44,349
Rym: Oh, yeah we had a 48% chance of getting a ps2 and then Much like when Bart and Milhouse got radioactive man number one, there would have been trouble as we tried to walk home.

118
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:46,556
Scott: There would have quite been some trouble.

119
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:50,670
Scott: and that was like that casino night at college was like right after the ps2 came out.

120
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,943
Scott: That was like ps2 on day one.

121
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:54,050
Scott: So what games would be a played?

122
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,110
Scott: I don't even know what the release games of the ps2 were.

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,810
Rym: Well, someone had because there weren't even that many ps2s at RIT as nerdy as the school was there just weren't enough.

124
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,983
Scott: Well after a couple years there were plenty.

125
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:07,621
Rym: Yeah, but when they first came out I remember there was some robot game that was really pretty.

126
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,530
Rym: it was one of the laws one of the Enders.

127
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,658
Scott: That was a release game.

128
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:11,785
Rym: I believe but then I played it.

129
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:12,470
Rym: It wasn't so great.

130
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,330
Scott: Well, it was actually not a bad game, but it was very short.

131
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,888
Scott: It was basically like a robot tech demo kind of thing.

132
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:22,624
Rym: But any oh a launch game tech demo kind of like Luigi's Mansion.

133
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,590
Rym: Yeah, not actually much of a game.

134
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,014
Rym: Yeah, Scott beat it.

135
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:31,290
Scott: for some reason it basically zone of the Enders Luigi's Mansion equivalents for their respective consoles.

136
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:33,119
Scott: But I mean I know got.

137
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,717
Scott: maybe Nintendo made Luigi's Mansion and said wow This is just sort of a short tech demo.

138
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:39,549
Scott: and they said it's okay Sony put out that zone of the Enders.

139
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,072
Scott: We're all right.

140
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,015
Rym: I do point out.

141
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:44,089
Rym: However, that one of those games has general beauregard and one does not.

142
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:45,246
Scott: Okay.

143
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:52,510
Scott: So speaking of that ps2 with its piles and piles and piles of crappy games Quite a bit of build-up to your news.

144
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,111
Scott: It is quite a bit of build-up to my news the ps2 which came out in the year 2000.

145
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:57,469
Scott: So it was now eight years old.

146
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,060
Rym: Well, I didn't believe what you told me.

147
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,204
Rym: cuz you know Scott was secretive.

148
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,535
Rym: sometimes when he thinks he has a good news He won't tell me what it is.

149
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,586
Rym: He'll just kind of say I got something.

150
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:05,968
Rym: Just let me.

151
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:08,804
Scott: yeah Because how what good is it if we discuss the news beforehand?

152
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:13,122
Scott: because if it's an amazing news You're gonna have to say something about it before the show and then that ruins it.

153
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:20,700
Rym: So he's trying to verify it and when he told me what it was, I Actually didn't believe him and I told him to continue verifying.

154
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:21,122
Rym: Yep.

155
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,551
Scott: So the ps2 came out in the year 2000.

156
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:32,800
Scott: Yep, the DS came out in the year 2004. all right, so it's four years of Ps2 existence with no DS existence.

157
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,768
Scott: So it's four versus eight.

158
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:39,948
Scott: basically In Japan, we're not talking about the rest of the world talking about Japan only here.

159
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:45,450
Scott: Total all time since the history of the universe, you know existed.

160
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:52,008
Rym: There have been more dear might have been game consoles in pre-human civilizations, you don't know that.

161
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:52,689
Scott: that doesn't count.

162
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,942
Rym: They might have been called the DS.

163
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:57,692
Scott: It doesn't count in Japan.

164
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,416
Rym: you specified the wide window not me.

165
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:04,188
Scott: Yes, there have been more DS is sold than ps2 sold ever.

166
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:07,333
Scott: That you think.

167
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:12,950
Scott: all the ps2 sold for eight years and all the DS is sold for four years more DS is sold.

168
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:20,170
Rym: Well, I mean it goes without saying that Nintendo has pretty much been for as long as the portable gaming market has existed.

169
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,659
Rym: Nintendo has basically had a monopoly on it.

170
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,670
Rym: The fact that the PSP still exists is amazing.

171
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,410
Scott: It is amazing indeed and they're actually, you know, a few interesting PSP games.

172
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,564
Scott: Yeah, but uh, I still wouldn't buy.

173
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,635
Scott: it's not worth it to buy a PSP But if you got one at least it's something to do.

174
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:39,066
Scott: But anyway, yeah, that's it's absolutely insane.

175
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:50,276
Scott: the ps2 the most successful Craziest biggest selling most hit games Console that has dominated the world for eight years and is still selling This portable system outsold it.

176
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:57,294
Scott: I think though there's a bit of cheating going on here and I got to point this out or ideas like Yeah, think about it.

177
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,867
Scott: people DS is very likely to replace them with DS lights.

178
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:04,521
Scott: people with ps2s Not very likely to replace them with slim ps2s.

179
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,570
Rym: not very likely to replace them with ps3s.

180
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,221
Scott: No, not very likely to replace them with ps3s either.

181
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:20,932
Scott: so yeah DS lights definitely sort of fudged those numbers a bit because you you pretty much got to take the DS fat sales and subtract them from the total sales leaving a Small percentage.

182
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:29,999
Rym: and then but at the same time the fact remains that the the DS is pretty much the number one gaming Platform in the world outside of South Korea.

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,350
Scott: Yeah, pretty much at least in places where it is sold and You know PC gaming doesn't have a strangle.

184
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:42,270
Rym: Oh, yeah, we can't count South America where the Sega Genesis still has a strong lead Also, I think you know in Europe, I think DS is broke.

185
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,470
Scott: I can't really figure out exactly how popular DS's are in Europe.

186
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:54,823
Scott: I assume they're kind of popular but places where mobile phones are just so crazily popular like that Of course, it's it's weird cuz Japan the mobile phones are also crazily popular.

187
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,087
Scott: So I don't know.

188
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,295
Scott: but yeah Yeah, I don't think in Europe.

189
00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:58,918
Scott: It's that big.

190
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,970
Scott: I think there's more mobile phone gaming in Europe than there is DS gaming.

191
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,356
Scott: That's just the vibe I get.

192
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,361
Scott: I had to figure it out.

193
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:04,903
Scott: Exactly.

194
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:05,124
Scott: But

195
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:27,849
Rym: yeah, though I think part of it I mean while Nintendo always has the best portable is partly because they seem to always They understand that portable games like the actual games you play on a portable console Cannot be the same games you play at home because you can't have a game Where you're on the train going somewhere waiting for the doctor and now you have to spend 10 minutes finding a save point Waiting for loading time.

196
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,570
Scott: This is this is Sony's mistake still which I think I talked about this when the PSP first came out.

197
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:43,970
Scott: Is that look now they're making it so you can like play ps1 games on your PSP via your ps3 and it's like, okay But none of those ps1 games are actually games that are designed to be portable.

198
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,452
Scott: They're not.

199
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,881
Scott: they're not good games to play on the go.

200
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:49,470
Rym: Yeah, it's basically just a Sega Nomad and we know how that ended.

201
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,387
Scott: Yeah, Gran Turismo is not something you can play while you walk about town and get on the train.

202
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,050
Scott: It just doesn't work.

203
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,610
Rym: I think part of the the PSP is getting games like Pat upon and I think they might have realized this.

204
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,402
Scott: I think they're just what Sony has done.

205
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:13,101
Scott: is I think ever since Katamari They realized the way to to try to get those gamers and keep them in is to get these Exclusive games that are sort of quirky in a Katamari way.

206
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,890
Scott: that might you know be a smash hit on every gaming site.

207
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,289
Scott: Of course portal sort of took that away from them.

208
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:29,386
Scott: Well portals the best video game ever made and that's why they've been paying You know to get things like the Pat upon and they paid a lot of money to the person who made flow to get flow on the ps3 and all that stuff.

209
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:37,360
Rym: so things of the day.

210
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,831
Scott: Oh Yeah.

211
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:39,553
Scott: Oh, wow.

212
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,186
Scott: I just realized something extra about my thing of the day just now.

213
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:43,707
Rym: Oh, did you?

214
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:52,230
Scott: Oh I did Alright, so, you know how some people make off those knockoffs of PSPs and DS's and stuff like that.

215
00:13:52,351 --> 00:14:04,350
Scott: Yes And you know you go and you go to the dollar store and there's something that looks just like a PSP But it's a dollar or the V. Yeah, and you buy it, but it's just that it just looks like a PSP.

216
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:10,650
Scott: But really the games it plays are like Tiger LCD games and it's mostly to trick grandmas who don't know any better.

217
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,321
Scott: You know, oh my son wants a PS my grandson wants a PSP.

218
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,765
Scott: Oh, there's one by.

219
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:19,664
Rym: these are the same like the game Like cats or dolphins gay or dogs.

220
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:25,658
Rym: these games that Nintendogs sold crazily so they made What looks like on the surface the same game.

221
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,661
Rym: because grandma doesn't know.

222
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:34,504
Rym: she knows that little Susie wants that dogs game Game with the dogs and she goes and she sees dogs only $20.

223
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:42,068
Rym: It's got Nintendo on it and she's Nintendogs $35 and then little Susie gets probably one of the worst games to be made ever.

224
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,682
Scott: Yep So most of those things.

225
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:45,950
Scott: there's some funny videos.

226
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,544
Scott: I think we're things of the day in the past where a guy makes fun of them.

227
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:49,590
Scott: Those those are pretty good.

228
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,505
Rym: I love when they open the V and see what was inside.

229
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,249
Scott: That was a good one.

230
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:57,010
Scott: But anyway, one company has done something I think is pretty cool.

231
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:58,695
Scott: They made this thing.

232
00:14:58,735 --> 00:14:59,820
Scott: It looks like a PSP.

233
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:07,290
Scott: It's actually pretty close to a PSP and You know the idea of it is remember back when you're a kid, you know, someone had that.

234
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:12,250
Scott: You know gum and it looked exactly like double mint gum, but when you took the stick of gum, it snapped your finger.

235
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:17,390
Rym: I remember that or the and it really only hurt buzzer in the palm.

236
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:22,390
Scott: Yeah it only really hurt if you're a little kid with little fleshy fingers and if someone does it to you now you just like.

237
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:28,066
Rym: See the problem was it always, you know, it looked like gum kinda.

238
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:35,570
Rym: but at the same time No, five-year-old ever knew how to properly present that gum in a manner where I would not immediately be suspicious.

239
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:37,350
Scott: I knew how to present that gum in a manner.

240
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,810
Scott: You had to conceal the fake packaging with your hand and only allow the stick of gum to be pointing out.

241
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:47,270
Rym: Actually, what you do is you take a real stick of gum and you put it under the fake stick.

242
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:51,530
Rym: You pull it out put it in your mouth in view of someone and then you say oh, hey you want some?

243
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:52,814
Scott: It's a good one.

244
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,869
Rym: I was the master of conning when I was five years old.

245
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:58,361
Scott: Yes, because he is easy to con five-year-olds.

246
00:15:58,481 --> 00:15:59,566
Scott: Yes mind of a ten-year-old.

247
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,558
Scott: so Yeah, so they they got this thing.

248
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:13,956
Scott: It's obviously to anyone who's ever seen a PSP this is not a PSP, but it's pretty close and you give it to someone and they try to play it and Nothing actually happens on the screen.

249
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,060
Scott: It just shocks them.

250
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,990
Rym: how badly we talking like electrocution.

251
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:19,807
Scott: I assume it shocks that you ever.

252
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,187
Scott: you know We've talked about that shocking roulette thing right.

253
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:27,888
Scott: Someone at my old job had it and Shocking roulette is actually a really good thing for almost any gamer to have.

254
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:28,370
Scott: what it is?

255
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,944
Scott: It's a little box and has four holes and everyone puts their finger in one of the holes.

256
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,790
Rym: It's reminiscent of a thunderball.

257
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:41,068
Scott: Yep, you push a button on it and one of the four fingers will get electrically shocked and the other three will not.

258
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:44,741
Rym: what better Way to determine who goes first in a game of tigers and Euphrates.

259
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,110
Scott: I can think of no better way none.

260
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,316
Scott: So that's a shocking roulette.

261
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:59,065
Scott: So this I assume shocks you in a similar manner to shocking roulette, you know illegal non deadly But possibly painful and surprising shock, you know good for a gag not good for hurting anyone.

262
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,329
Rym: now is those things are never.

263
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,275
Rym: I mean It's.

264
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:06,305
Rym: I'm not saying they need to actually cause harm But they need to cause a little bit more pain than they do.

265
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,656
Rym: Mm-hmm Now we can fix that.

266
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,382
Scott: you thought that PSP was good.

267
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,433
Scott: I clicked on a link and I see something else Here.

268
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,626
Scott: they have you know, those laser pen keychains.

269
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:18,218
Scott: Yes They've got a laser pen keychain.

270
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,109
Scott: that also shocks people if they try to use.

271
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:25,401
Scott: So you can be like ooh laser pen want to play with my laser pen yet.

272
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,430
Scott: Oh, it hurts even better than that.

273
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:30,355
Scott: They got a fake iPod.

274
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:35,110
Scott: listen in music doo-doo-doo, hey you want to hear what do you want listen to something?

275
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,394
Scott: Okay, hey shock.

276
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,499
Scott: It's good stuff.

277
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,633
Rym: Except usually you just hand them the headphones and not the iPod.

278
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:45,346
Rym: I know but you know now unless maybe it shocks you in the ear.

279
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,755
Rym: Oh That would be hardcore.

280
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:51,849
Scott: That would be hardcore, but possibly lawsuit action could be quite quite.

281
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,709
Scott: Yes It's also a really fake looking iPod.

282
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,677
Scott: They may I really wish people made these things.

283
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:12,229
Rym: look at least the laser pen looks exactly yes because I'm sure Sony is perfectly okay with you making a product on the market that looks Exactly like their product only instead of allowing you to play enjoyable games like pat upon it fucking shocks you.

284
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:17,870
Scott: What if we just made some sort of add-on for the PSP where we put a thing on a real?

285
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,456
Scott: Shocker the PSP shocker.

286
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:24,330
Scott: you give someone your real PSP and they try to create and they get shocked.

287
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,433
Rym: you Know that way.

288
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:31,270
Scott: it would be really easy to fool somebody because they would actually you'd have a game running on there.

289
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:37,733
Scott: And if you're if you know how to if you were the person who installed the shocker like there is maybe a hidden like child Safety switch.

290
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:42,329
Scott: so you put your finger on it while you're playing on the secret button behind the PSP.

291
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:43,666
Scott: So you don't get shocked.

292
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:45,295
Scott: You're like you're playing the PSP.

293
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:51,584
Scott: then you give it to someone and they don't push the secret button on the back of the PSP While they're playing and they they you know, it shocks them.

294
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:52,448
Scott: and there you go.

295
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,520
Rym: Good time You seem to have a lot of plans ready to administer the shocker.

296
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:57,904
Scott: Oh everyone better beware.

297
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,910
Scott: There's a lot of shocking coming through.

298
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,350
Rym: Yeah, I think the studio audience might have leaked into the microphones a little bit.

299
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:12,162
Rym: This is actually for the first time in a long time We actually have a live studio audience that is greater than size and then one.

300
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:20,288
Rym: usually it's just Emily like playing her DS And listening to us idly or Alex downstairs on his laptop and you might think he's downstairs.

301
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:20,950
Rym: How can he hear you?

302
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:26,850
Rym: We're pretty loud pretty loud, but I Remember one time Emily went out for a walk while we were doing the show and it was summers.

303
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,733
Rym: I had my windows open.

304
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:32,429
Rym: she could hear us like way further down the block that you should be able to hear us.

305
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,005
Rym: awesome Yeah, but I did not give them a microphone.

306
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:38,930
Scott: you got thing of the day over there.

307
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,614
Rym: Oh, I do in fact now up.

308
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:44,265
Rym: Emily showed me this actually last night and this was kind of amazing.

309
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:55,010
Rym: now the story here is that there's an advertising agency whatever and They wanted to grow their companies like commercial CG department like just make it better.

310
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,749
Scott: Yes, you can make cool CG commercials and people would pay to make them and you make money.

311
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:12,454
Rym: now You could send them off to a school or one of those I don't know classes things, you know, like go off on a business trip and learn how to do whatever but instead they just said alright guys make a short film and They made a short film.

312
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:17,150
Rym: The film is called one rat shorts, and it's kind of amazing.

313
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:23,185
Scott: It's kind of amazing But the only problem I can find with this film is that the lab is a terrible terrible lab.

314
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,689
Scott: not in I guess also In what it does.

315
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:31,627
Scott: but What kind of lab has event that goes directly to the outside maybe and a door that goes directly to the outside?

316
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,510
Rym: what they're testing?

317
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,835
Rym: Because I note that the rats were up on treadmills.

318
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:40,490
Rym: They're testing the effects of the environmental air conditions in an average office.

319
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,817
Scott: It's a terrible Non-scientific laboratory, what do you want?

320
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,942
Rym: I do better laboratory.

321
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:47,404
Scott: Apparently.

322
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,894
Scott: I want to be able to maintain my believability.

323
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:58,027
Rym: apparently the Protocol for failure if the system fails is to let all the rats free turn off the lights and open the front door.

324
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:02,057
Rym: Yep But I'll warn you this film is really good.

325
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:04,424
Rym: It's an incredibly well animated like.

326
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,889
Rym: this is some damn good 3d.

327
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,190
Scott: Yeah, they must have had some really good people working at the advertising agency to begin with and they probably brought some good people in.

328
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,627
Rym: It's one like ten short film awards.

329
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:23,860
Scott: Yes, pretty But I'll warn you they're gonna get a lot of business from people who need ads and I think that anyone who buys ads for Them is gonna end up with amazing CG commercials.

330
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:30,690
Rym: It is one very sad and two Very kind of frighteningly reminiscent of portal.

331
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:38,710
Scott: There are many similarities between this this short film and portal and I would not bet against someone who said that the people who?

332
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,717
Scott: I've made this video.

333
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:45,149
Rym: We're also playing portal though I can't say that I'll quote the art director for this.

334
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:49,709
Rym: One of my favorite short films which I saw as a child was the red balloon.

335
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:54,690
Rym: I think the melancholic and innocent spirit of that film inhabits one red short.

336
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,699
Scott: I think he should.

337
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,130
Rym: I think he actually based it on portal.

338
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:05,135
Rym: I think he needs to watch tales because I the red balloon is not a I. I Did not enjoy the red balloon.

339
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,561
Scott: No, but I think he needs to watch.

340
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:07,846
Rym: you ever seen the red balloon.

341
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:11,100
Scott: Yes balloon Yes, he needs to watch tales from a street corner.

342
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,868
Rym: Not the good balloon who fights air power.

343
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:13,330
Scott: Oh my god.

344
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:14,893
Scott: Audience.

345
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:15,275
Scott: audience.

346
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:20,237
Scott: audience raise your hand if you seen tales from a street corner Okay, so maybe we should watch it.

347
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:21,865
Scott: I don't know I could always watch that.

348
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:22,729
Rym: It's really good.

349
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,933
Scott: It's really sad.

350
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,120
Rym: doesn't give you the moral you think it's gonna give you.

351
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:26,903
Scott: it's amazing.

352
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,869
Scott: Anyway, we did show about it.

353
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,221
Rym: So we were playing, you know, it was a weekend.

354
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,566
Rym: We got all our board gaming in.

355
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,814
Rym: since we had the whole crew here We rubbed out a quick T&E.

356
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:36,617
Rym: Scott won.

357
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:37,079
Scott: I won.

358
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:37,902
Scott: That's right.

359
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:38,303
Scott: Who won?

360
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:38,946
Scott: It's got one.

361
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:39,969
Rym: You know, what's funny though?

362
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,277
Scott: How about who won the previous T&E?

363
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,428
Rym: Oh Scott has won two games of Tigers and Euphrates.

364
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:47,989
Rym: I believe It's pretty impressive.

365
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:48,452
Scott: I believe.

366
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,450
Scott: objectively you could call me the reigning king of Tigris and Euphrates.

367
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,159
Scott: Two rivers two rivers.

368
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:54,802
Scott: who can take that?

369
00:22:55,465 --> 00:23:01,790
Rym: I will point out that If you were the reigning king of that region of the world, it's not gonna go so well for your civilization.

370
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,055
Scott: You want to play some Amun Ray.

371
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,099
Scott: I'll take the Nile too.

372
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,982
Scott: Nile next stop.

373
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:06,809
Rym: Have you ever won Amun Ray?

374
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:10,384
Scott: No No, not in a meaningful game, but Nile next stop.

375
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:11,470
Scott: Let's go.

376
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,050
Scott: Oh shit floods.

377
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:23,592
Rym: So we're playing all these games and we played one of those cheap ass games that we've got a while ago And we've been oh, yeah we did

378
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:28,489
Scott: a show on apples to apples and one of our listeners suggested to us to play big idea, which is a similar game.

379
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:36,996
Scott: and We I finally after having owning this game for weeks and weeks and weeks New Year's I was finally we I think we played the Game three or four times.

380
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,429
Scott: I was surprised I was able to get people to play it.

381
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:42,230
Rym: Yeah Correctly captain Bob wonder pants.

382
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:48,470
Scott: I was very tired and Such over the New Year's with the partying and the loudness and the waking up early and the going to bed late.

383
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,062
Rym: So we yes because Scott didn't have to go to work on Monday.

384
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,006
Rym: Anyway wasn't?

385
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:52,850
Rym: I had to go to work.

386
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,470
Rym: So yeah, he had to wrangle the Visigoths and I did for once.

387
00:23:56,671 --> 00:24:00,695
Rym: I wasn't there and he had to handle on his own and They're not even out.

388
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:02,381
Scott: It's very headache to wrangle them.

389
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,384
Scott: We'll see cuz they're loud.

390
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:04,970
Scott: You like you go into the living room.

391
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:06,100
Rym: Oh, they're loud.

392
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,150
Rym: We're not loud at all.

393
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,297
Rym: We don't make noise.

394
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:10,088
Scott: is the difference between the loudness of one?

395
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,106
Scott: Conversation with a loud talking person and being in a room where there are just like 30 people talking.

396
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,310
Rym: It's like ah my head.

397
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:18,443
Rym: I love the front row crew.

398
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:18,869
Scott: That's great.

399
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:25,370
Rym: But the games like the concepts there and I think my powder decadence was quite delectable.

400
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,635
Scott: I liked my.

401
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,320
Scott: I liked my.

402
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,943
Scott: what you called the permanent gasoline.

403
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,227
Rym: permanent gasoline is good.

404
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,936
Rym: I think the best invention There were.

405
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:35,521
Rym: we won't get into that.

406
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,589
Rym: We're gonna do the show another time.

407
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,050
Rym: Yes, but after the game the game was fun, but it wasn't her.

408
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:51,289
Scott: Yeah, basically, it's a game of trying to sell products but there's also this investing thing and the only reason the investing thing is there is because The point of this game is to sell products and be funny.

409
00:24:51,752 --> 00:25:00,103
Scott: The investing thing is there's that you have some way of determining the winner and the loser and The investing thing kind of works, but it's kind of shitty and it's not fun.

410
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:01,328
Scott: It's just kind of tacked on.

411
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:09,997
Rym: now Of course after the game ended we do what we do with every board game we own or ever play which is analyze it Seriously in great detail.

412
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,930
Rym: we spend quite a bit of time talking about how the game could be made.

413
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:17,105
Scott: I took this silly little cheap-ass game when we analyzed it as if it were.

414
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:22,489
Rym: that's like when Corbin was trying to play that PB&J game with Luke and Gabby back at RIT.

415
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:28,859
Rym: this is a game made for five-year-olds and The rules weren't exactly clear.

416
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:43,499
Rym: So I remember a long argument where Basically, they Corbin Oh Colin not Corbin Colin Colin was arguing with Luke about a race condition that occurred in the game as to what if I play two PBJ's before you play your one.

417
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,380
Scott: a game for five-year-olds people Arguing about the rules rules lawyering in.

418
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:49,906
Scott: it's like rules learning in Candyland.

419
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:50,810
Scott: That's what was going on here.

420
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,789
Scott: I recorded that we'll talk about if I go down the chute and then up the ladder - I had to.

421
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:59,030
Rym: Well, if you go down the chute and go up the ladder, there's nothing wrong with that.

422
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,730
Rym: Yeah, I know because there's no chute that goes to the place where the same ladder went.

423
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:03,636
Scott: I know but I'm.

424
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:04,482
Scott: you know what I'm saying?

425
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:05,529
Rym: Yeah, but that can't happen.

426
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:07,577
Scott: See, I'm just may see.

427
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,387
Scott: see this is exactly what's going on.

428
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,937
Rym: So Earlier in the weekend.

429
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,250
Rym: We had a bunch of people over and we needed to play another game.

430
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,284
Rym: And what better game to play than Gloria Mundy simply because he doesn't?

431
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,550
Rym: Bob is probably my favorite character in Futurama.

432
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:23,358
Rym: That isn't bender.

433
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:31,920
Rym: Yeah And also especially isn't but Except you eat nism, but man, so he comes up a lot.

434
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,525
Rym: He just lately for some reason.

435
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:42,470
Rym: I don't know why but That game is also a game that had a lot of potential but actually playing it is not that fun.

436
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:53,241
Scott: Yeah, I mean it the basic concept of the game of you're running away from Rome because you're all hedonism and the Goths are going To sacrum no matter what is a good concept and also the game mechanics.

437
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:56,090
Rym: each individual game mechanic is like solid gold.

438
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,487
Scott: Yeah, I mean playing the resources.

439
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:10,367
Scott: Yep It's good stuff But the way the game works out largely because of the costs of the buildings and the way the buildings work and the way the Goth works the game ends up not being so fun and there's not a lot of strategy or tactics.

440
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:13,017
Scott: That's meaningful Of course, I won that game too.

441
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:16,770
Scott: I had a fist full of resources rocking on regular running away to Carthage.

442
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,178
Rym: Yep, so, uh, you know we played that game.

443
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:24,314
Rym: then we talked for a while about how that game could be made better and we Realized what can we talk about?

444
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:29,310
Rym: but house rules and making games better augmenting games you already own and play now.

445
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,277
Scott: Here's the fundamental question here.

446
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,843
Scott: right is what defines a game?

447
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,670
Scott: What makes one game different from another game?

448
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,838
Scott: You know when I mean if I change let's say rules exactly I mean if I let's have a game of baseball, right?

449
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,030
Scott: What if in baseball I say four strikes you're out?

450
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,154
Scott: Is that still baseball?

451
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:49,650
Rym: Well now because baseball is defined by the lexicon of the rules exactly.

452
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:54,404
Scott: So when you take monopoly and you say landing on free parking gets you money.

453
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:55,668
Scott: That's not monopoly anymore.

454
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:56,450
Scott: That's something else.

455
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,344
Scott: That's monopoly with free parking money monopoly with a house rule.

456
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:04,868
Scott: Yep, and It completely changes the game to a different game.

457
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:09,470
Scott: now I'm not saying that you know just because a game is changed that it's bad.

458
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:19,403
Scott: You know I mean if you have a game that is bad and somehow Taking some of the rules of that game and adding some other rules that you make up or figure out Creates a newer better game.

459
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:20,370
Scott: That's awesome.

460
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:32,611
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that, but a lot of people, you know, they sort of have these house rules like no, this is the way you play monopoly with the money on the free parking and the free jail whatever's and the BS and That's.

461
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,740
Scott: you know, they're not trying to make a game better.

462
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,990
Scott: They're just changing a game with random house rules.

463
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:53,390
Rym: Well, one thing I've run into a lot is that especially with the like monopolies of probably the best example of this I think that most people in America who play monopoly play it wrong and Don't realize it because they've never in in their entire lives actually looked in that rule book.

464
00:28:53,611 --> 00:29:12,642
Rym: No, they learn from someone else to learn from someone else because everyone I've ever met other than people at RIT Who are really hardcore into board games didn't do the bidding didn't even know there was bidding in that game and For some reason thought that if you land on free parking you get all the money that was given to the bank From all those taxes and things.

465
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:18,529
Rym: Yep, and Taking out the bidding pretty much takes out the whole game.

466
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,690
Scott: It's not that even though if you follow the rules of monopoly, it's still a terrible game.

467
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:26,626
Scott: In fact, if you take if you play by the real rules, it's even less fun.

468
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:27,490
Scott: if that's possible.

469
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:35,359
Rym: You know, I find it very fun to play it with the real rules once per year at best kind of like say I haven't played it in like a few years.

470
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:36,890
Scott: So do you want to play it with the real rules?

471
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:45,739
Rym: I think we should play a game of Monopoly with the whole crew as I have a really fancy Millennium Monopoly set with the real Official exactly what the original rules said.

472
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,890
Scott: rules, you know, I would do that, you know, it sounds good.

473
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:59,394
Scott: Plus I like that set is really fancy and I like to fiddle with it because the money is really shiny whatever but Why would I do that when I could play one of the other hundred awesome better games that I have when I know that's not So well,

474
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:01,968
Rym: the thing is playing Monopoly like that is okay.

475
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,673
Rym: It doesn't take that long as long as you don't let the Ken Nicole Situation.

476
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:08,918
Scott: that was x-men monopoly.

477
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:09,781
Scott: That's completely different.

478
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:10,946
Rym: It's the same stupid game.

479
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:15,864
Rym: I know I know I mean we were playing Monopoly and it was really fun for like 10 minutes.

480
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:16,627
Rym: then everyone like it.

481
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,353
Rym: everyone suddenly went Oh, wait a minute.

482
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:19,055
Rym: That's right.

483
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,240
Rym: Monopoly sucks.

484
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:20,882
Scott: Yep.

485
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:21,645
Rym: This sucks.

486
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,837
Rym: Luckily everyone bankrupt Except Ken and Nicole.

487
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,107
Rym: and like alright, let's just quit and play something else.

488
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:30,038
Rym: and Ken says, alright Yeah, if you forfeit then I win and we'll play something else.

489
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,601
Rym: and then Nicole says well, no you quit I'll win and then we'll play something else.

490
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:38,990
Rym: and I think four hours later one of them won.

491
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:41,950
Scott: If I didn't even think it was possible.

492
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:44,982
Rym: Well, we pretty much ignored him and played another game.

493
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:45,263
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:46,790
Scott: Alright, so house rules.

495
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,917
Scott: We're gonna talk about house rules.

496
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:48,661
Rym: I think so.

497
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,170
Scott: Alright, what house rules you want to talk about?

498
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,413
Rym: I don't see how to.

499
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:59,230
Rym: I guess we could talk mostly about how to not suck at making house rules because a Lot of people just kind of make house rules without thinking about it.

500
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:06,898
Rym: and we talked about this before with mods and games and changing the rules of a game how you can Really take away any actuals.

501
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,110
Rym: You can ruin a game real quickly by changing the rules without thinking.

502
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,365
Scott: Well, a lot of people I think what they do like.

503
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:13,130
Scott: look at Monopoly, right?

504
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:16,530
Scott: They add a house rule to make the game.

505
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:18,420
Scott: It's it's like when they're playing the game.

506
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:20,450
Scott: there might be something they want, right?

507
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:27,389
Scott: For example, you'll be playing Vinci and you will really want to have three things for your civilization instead of two.

508
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:33,928
Scott: like man I like my barbarians revolutionary civilization, but I wish it was barbarians revolutionary livestock breeding.

509
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:34,630
Scott: That would be awesome.

510
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:44,367
Scott: so they change a rule to be where you have three things instead of two or You'll be playing Tigris and Euphrates right and so many times during the game.

511
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:47,398
Scott: you'll say man I wish I had three actions instead of two.

512
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:48,783
Scott: So they'll say man.

513
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:50,529
Scott: We all want three actions, don't we?

514
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:56,250
Scott: Yeah Okay, let's play with three actions and they don't actually think about will they make this game a better game a worse game?

515
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,069
Scott: They just think it'll be more fun because they'll be getting what they want sort of like the same reason.

516
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,461
Scott: People cheat and counter-strike, you know, it's like man.

517
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,907
Scott: I wish I could do this.

518
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:06,610
Scott: That would be great.

519
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:18,776
Rym: I wish I could shoot everyone in the head and not get shot in the head with my TMP and be Everyone in the head Yeah, and if you don't really.

520
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:24,359
Scott: but if you ever cheated a counter-strike you realize that after a while It just it's not fun.

521
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:24,862
Rym: Are you kidding?

522
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,949
Rym: That's never not fun.

523
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:28,844
Scott: I think that's only fun because there's real people on the other end.

524
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:32,505
Rym: Yes, exactly Have we done a show on griefing specifically?

525
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:35,417
Scott: I don't know Because we probably should otherwise.

526
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:38,970
Scott: because uh on one hand I think we've definitely discussed it.

527
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,057
Rym: I hate griefing and I hate griefers because I want to have a serious game.

528
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,926
Rym: But on the other hand, I Really?

529
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:59,930
Rym: Really enjoy griefing people online that there's a reason why I spent there was a period of about two months when out in FARC I never posted unless it was trot to try to start a religious flame war and I succeeded about two-thirds of the time.

530
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,097
Scott: Okay, I don't think I know.

531
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:08,460
Scott: I'm pretty sure we've discussed griefing on the show before but In oh six twelve twenty dubs and subs.

532
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:16,629
Scott: my thing of the day was I don't know what this thing of the day is But the thing of the day was gross genitals grief grief, and I'm gonna click on it.

533
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:16,870
Rym: What?

534
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,559
Scott: I don't know what the hell this is.

535
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:18,981
Scott: Great.

536
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:21,354
Scott: I have no idea what this thing of the day Are you sure that was the word?

537
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:25,170
Scott: Oh, no, it was the time we talked about griefing because it was the time I clicked on it.

538
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,920
Scott: The penises in the Xbox live penises and say in Second Life.

539
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:30,464
Rym: Oh, yeah penises.

540
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,467
Rym: It's always penises.

541
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:32,450
Rym: Why is it always penises?

542
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,236
Scott: I don't know.

543
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,790
Scott: Okay See ya when you want to make a house rule, right?

544
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,722
Scott: Generally, the first thing you have to ask yourself is is this game not fun?

545
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,817
Scott: Because if the game is fun don't change it There's nothing wrong with it.

546
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,282
Rym: Yep.

547
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,775
Rym: I mean Actually, you know, I've noticed something.

548
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:55,869
Rym: it seems like most games that have house rules that people use just kind of willy-nilly Are generally bad games to begin with.

549
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:04,350
Scott: yeah Cuz I mean if the game is fun to begin with there's not gonna be anything that Frustrates you or makes you feel bad while you're playing the game and you're not gonna think to change anything.

550
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:19,610
Scott: So when someone changes something like house rules a monopoly which I think is evidence that most people realize the monopoly is a bad game and don't have fun with it that they feel the Need to have to change it because you know, like they want to play it but some you know Cuz maybe something about it is fun, but it's not completely fun.

551
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:30,996
Rym: I've noticed that most people's house rules seem to Oftentimes add a very large element of randomness or some sort of just like oh the crazy thing can happen The games up in the air until the end.

552
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:31,900
Rym: Oh, man.

553
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:34,590
Scott: Yeah, it's very hard because it's very difficult to think up.

554
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,270
Scott: You know a really good rule.

555
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:41,429
Scott: I mean it takes a lot of time and a lot of thinking to design a balanced and quality board game.

556
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:50,489
Scott: You know then or any kind of game and coming up with a house rule just sort of randomly is almost never Unless you put a lot of thought into it going to make the game good.

557
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:54,059
Rym: Yeah It basically comes down to the utility of the game.

558
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:04,290
Rym: utility is what you want what you're getting out of playing this game And if you're not enjoying the game You have to alter your utility or alter the game to provide the utility you want.

559
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,499
Scott: Yep for example in the game the big idea game.

560
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:12,707
Scott: right the utility of the game is We want people to make we want to encourage people to do two things.

561
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:17,364
Scott: number one We want people to come up with funny products to sell and sell them.

562
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:30,064
Scott: Well high priority booze hammer yep, and the second thing we want to do is we want people to have an incentive to vote for the Funniest and best products and the people who you know pitch the best products.

563
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:30,986
Rym: cuz what in the end?

564
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:42,916
Rym: we just want to be entertained Yep But the games utility is get the most money and the mechanic to get the most money is to basically Ignore What the funny things are.

565
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:54,128
Rym: you actually don't really want to have the funniest thing because you'll make a lot more money having like The second or third funniest thing that maybe one person invests in and then you pretty much roll dice and it's totally random.

566
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,389
Scott: Yep So what we did is we said hey, why don't we do this?

567
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,710
Scott: Obviously, this is a different game because we're completely changing the rules.

568
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,301
Scott: But everyone makes a funny product and tries to sell it.

569
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:08,517
Scott: then everyone votes for one product that's not their own and they have to vote.

570
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:17,330
Scott: they can't withhold their vote right like you can in the normal rules and Whichever product, you know for every person who votes for your product you get one point.

571
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:20,570
Scott: So if six if five people vote for mine, I get five points.

572
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:29,450
Scott: All right, so you want to make something funny to get lots of people to vote for it now For all the people who you know voted for it, right?

573
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:30,549
Scott: They get money too.

574
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,488
Scott: So if I vote for something and Rym votes for something then we each get one dollar.

575
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:39,050
Scott: that way Voting for the thing that everyone else votes for gets you more points.

576
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:46,101
Scott: so there's an incentive to vote for the thing everyone else votes for and There's also an incentive to make the thing that everyone's going to vote for.

577
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,530
Scott: and that's all that's all there is very easy now.

578
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,410
Rym: Luckily, this is an incredibly simple game incredibly simple.

579
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,850
Scott: So it's why it was very easy to come up with house rules.

580
00:36:55,211 --> 00:37:00,429
Rym: In fact, it was easy to come up with a lot more complex schemes and basically make a much larger game out of it.

581
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:04,934
Scott: That was not necessary because all of it detracted from An excuse.

582
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:09,048
Scott: the only thing you need is an excuse to make funny products and sell them now.

583
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:12,990
Rym: number two Say you decide to have a new house rule or try someone else's house rule.

584
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:21,824
Rym: You really have to go into the first couple times you play Expecting the game to be broken and being a kind of cognizant of how it might break.

585
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:24,896
Rym: so you can try to maybe fix the house Rule make it better.

586
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,309
Rym: maybe realize it's not the best house rule that sort of.

587
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:27,450
Rym: yeah.

588
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:35,170
Scott: Like if you come up with a house rule play the game and if you see that, you know The person who you know is sort of doing stupid things ends up winning.

589
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,981
Scott: Something's wrong or like.

590
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:48,330
Rym: if I make a house rule I don't know the Harkonnen get a hundred spice instead of ten at the start of doom and you notice that I get and then I get pissed because the guy playing the Harkonnen wins and it feels unfair and cheap.

591
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,770
Rym: Well, you were playing kind of an asterisk game anyway, so it's not like you can really.

592
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,570
Rym: Yeah, actually this is probably the most important thing when it comes to house rules.

593
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:05,184
Rym: If you ever play like say you have house rules good used all the time like in D&D We roll d30s instead of d20.

594
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:07,172
Rym: Oh Whatever.

595
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:09,342
Rym: or our burning wheel d4s.

596
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,355
Scott: Oh Think about that.

597
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:14,403
Scott: You couldn't mix you couldn't succeed on anything.

598
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:16,110
Scott: You could barely ever.

599
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:19,003
Rym: How's white shades become a lot more important than they sure do?

600
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:21,130
Rym: but uh alright.

601
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:28,276
Rym: so you've been playing with this house rule like in settlers roll the robber and Everyone has to bribe the guy who rolled the robber.

602
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:31,153
Rym: and now like that's what you have to do You.

603
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:40,635
Rym: uh, if you ever play with anyone who isn't in your little crew you'd better tell them about the house rule before you start playing because otherwise I Guarantee this.

604
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:49,730
Rym: I've seen this happen way too often Especially in like gaming clubs or large groups of friends not so much in the crew because we're kind of anal about our board game rules.

605
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,199
Rym: You'll be halfway through the game.

606
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:59,690
Rym: Someone will do something under the Misapprehension that the rules are not the way everyone else thinks they are and then the game is totally broken.

607
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,949
Rym: There's gonna be an argument and someone's going home crying something like that.

608
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:16,410
Scott: There's also a problem of people who have a house rule and they play the game a certain way to the point where it sort Of becomes natural and then they go somewhere else and play the game say at a gaming convention And they sort of naturally play it with their house rule forgetting.

609
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,490
Rym: That's not how that happened at the world settlers tournament at uber con several years ago.

610
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,402
Rym: Really in the first round, right?

611
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:24,530
Rym: The first round is version ups.

612
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:29,909
Rym: I won like 10 to 6 to 4 to 4 like something crazy.

613
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:41,310
Rym: and I remember on the first round like right away robber comes up and I'm like, alright bitches I'm about to throw the robber down and two of the players say no, it's in the first four rounds.

614
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,480
Rym: You can't do that blah blah blah.

615
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:43,550
Rym: We got to just reroll.

616
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:45,774
Scott: You called the judge over.

617
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:47,480
Rym: I said, uh, that's not the rules.

618
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:48,423
Rym: called the judge over.

619
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,069
Rym: He said it's not in the rules.

620
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:55,410
Scott: and Yeah, yep, you got to remember what's a house rule and what's a real rule?

621
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:20,256
Scott: Make sure you read your rule books because I give you you know This might happen a lot with things like magic the gathering and stuff like that where you know Be aware of what the real official rules of a game are even if you don't play by them So that you know when you play that game in public because you're probably gonna want to if you like the game That you're not being stupid because you will get laughed at and put okay show kind of short Not as good as yesterday's show.

622
00:40:20,357 --> 00:40:22,206
Rym: Like we said, yeah, I'm what can you do?

623
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:23,090
Rym: That was a triumph?

624
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:26,090
Rym: I know I mean for all of you who are still alive.

625
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:38,839
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of people here hanging out being bored while we're making a show and you know We should go and you know dinner and all that kind of other stuff and then go to bed early So, you know and clean all this crap out of the house.

626
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,867
Rym: Oh great work tomorrow.

627
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:41,408
Rym: Yeah.

628
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:41,870
Rym: It's alright.

629
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,390
Rym: We got a lot down actually and just for the record because we did some of the final planning.

630
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:49,866
Rym: We said this before but it's gaming day.

631
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,716
Rym: It's the new year So we're gonna say it pretty much straight up.

635
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,299
Rym: I can't promise we'll be doing any shows or anything.

636
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:02,680
Rym: We might.

637
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:16,419
Scott: I'm working on that, but we will be at packs Guaranteed 100 unless something happens such as the plane crashes We know I before then if both of us die We both lose our jobs and have no money.

638
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:23,144
Rym: if we both lose our jobs and have no money We're kind of fucked anyway, so we'll just road trip across the country with whatever we've got left.

639
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:26,950
