1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,205
Rym: Bunnies and flying.

2
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:11,700
Rym: Bunnies like flying less than they like most things.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,840
Scott: Lucky rabbit's foot in Vegas.

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,999
Rym: You know, the lucky rabbit's foots are really unlucky for the rabbits they get them from.

5
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:21,199
Scott: Rabbit doesn't need money.

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,540
Rym: How's a rabbit gonna get all that swag of hay?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,817
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,780
Scott: It just grows out of the fucking ground.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,966
Rym: Yeah, where are they gonna get it?

10
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,060
Rym: Rabbit in the city, not a lot of good grass.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,100
Rym: You need money.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,805
Scott: You gotta move.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,594
Scott: You're a rabbit, you're quick.

14
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:35,160
Scott: You can get there.

15
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:36,860
Rym: But you wanna leave New York?

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,008
Rym: You wanna leave New York?

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,179
Rym: That's where all the jobs are.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:39,824
Scott: You're a rabbit?

19
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,079
Scott: There's no rabbit jobs in New York.

20
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,600
Rym: I think there are plenty of rabbit jobs in New York.

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:43,943
Rym: Really?

22
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,460
Scott: What's a rabbit job gonna get for a job?

23
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,759
Rym: Eat all the dandelions.

24
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:47,526
Rym: Where?

25
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:48,459
Rym: Get 'em out of the park.

26
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,170
Rym: No more dandelions.

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,059
Scott: Rabbit live in the park?

28
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,268
Rym: Uh, be cute.

29
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:52,854
Rym: Photo ops.

30
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:53,400
Rym: Rabbit model.

31
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,860
Rym: If the internet has taught me anything, being cute is a business model.

32
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,179
Scott: Alright, well, how come you're not taking advantage of that?

33
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:07,600
Rym: Uh, there is no way to read that but you having just said that I'm cute.

34
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:09,620
Scott: Oh, 'cause you own rabbits.

35
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:13,820
Scott: You're not selling your rabbits for cute photo ops.

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,220
Rym: So, uh, the other day, I was biking home from work.

37
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,158
Scott: We did an intro to this show.

38
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,666
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess we didn't.

39
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,800
Rym: It's mechanical for Liebowitz.

40
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,539
Rym: We recorded this way later than normal.

41
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,120
Rym: It's October 2nd, GeekNights.

42
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:28,358
Rym: Great.

43
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,699
Rym: Yeah.

44
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:34,659
Rym: So, uh, anyway, so I'm biking home from work.

45
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:39,339
Rym: And because they've added, like, three stop signs and a new light to my old way home.

46
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:39,851
Rym: Uh-huh.

47
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,279
Rym: So now, I actually go out of my way to take the bike path along the East River, like, all the way home.

48
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:48,340
Rym: 'Cause that's just way... It's actually faster now most of the time.

49
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,080
Rym: Unless I run every stoplight.

50
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,488
Rym: But, which is fine.

51
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,100
Rym: Like, I'll do the Idaho whatever protocol.

52
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,340
Rym: But lately, there's been cops there, like, hanging out at the intersections.

53
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,020
Rym: And I saw a biker getting a ticket.

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,740
Rym: So, gonna just let that hang out for a while.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,337
Rym: Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,586
Rym: So, I'm biking on the bike path.

57
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:08,360
Rym: It's a separated, two-lane bike path.

58
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:08,713
Scott: Yep.

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,779
Scott: A green painted one.

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,919
Scott: It has some shitty areas, though, but most of it's okay.

61
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,733
Rym: And they've actually, they've fixed it bit by bit.

62
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:14,560
Rym: Like, it's getting better and better.

63
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,880
Scott: Some of the good parts are even better than they used to be, but the shitty parts are still shitty.

64
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,380
Scott: Like, the part by the power plant where it's really narrow.

65
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:20,648
Rym: Yep.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Scott: And the part by the little warehouses where the street is, you're basically just going on this beat-up old sidewalk.

67
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,579
Rym: Oh, that's the worst.

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,096
Scott: And the part where you have to go onto First Avenue because it ends and the

69
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:30,237
Scott: U.N.'

70
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:30,720
Scott: 's on the way.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,075
Rym: Yep.

72
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,149
Scott: I don't know, I just don't go around the U.N So, I'm biking and there's a thing.

73
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,480
Rym: Oh, no, no, you're thinking of the East River Bikeway.

74
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:38,220
Scott: Yeah.

75
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,919
Rym: I'm on the opposite side of the river.

76
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:40,265
Rym: Oh.

77
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,599
Rym: There's another, there's a bikeway right there, too.

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Scott: And it has the same properties as the one on the other side of the East River?

79
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,480
Rym: Yes, it took three properties.

80
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:50,898
Scott: It has a power plant that doesn't exist with a narrow bridge.

81
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,880
Rym: So, it has a bunch of old warehouses and, like, generating stations that are being torn down.

82
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,859
Scott: Yeah, by the sugar factory.

83
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,313
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:57,800
Rym: Yeah.

85
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,920
Rym: So, anyway, so it took a couple of aspects.

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
Rym: I was like, I think he's talking about the wrong, anyway.

87
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,639
Rym: So, I'm biking there.

88
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,260
Rym: I'm going, like, 24-ish miles an hour.

89
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,080
Rym: I'm going pretty fast because it's, like, downhill.

90
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,759
Rym: And this woman just literally steps out between two cars jaywalking right in front of me.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,169
Rym: Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,580
Rym: So, I swerve to the right because she doesn't even notice me and she keeps walking.

93
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,200
Rym: And then her hand is back and she pulls into my path her young daughter.

94
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,010
Scott: Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,020
Rym: So, now I literally almost flipped over my handlebars trying to not hit her daughter and probably severely injure her.

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,620
Rym: Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,079
Rym: I considered just slamming into the woman because I figured she could take it.

98
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,059
Rym: There's no way to avoid them both.

99
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,280
Rym: I almost flipped over my handlebars.

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,860
Rym: I stopped.

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,958
Rym: I barely avoid them.

102
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:44,359
Rym: She screams and starts yelling at me.

103
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:44,832
Rym: Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,220
Rym: And for once, like, usually I just ignore people when that happens.

105
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
Rym: I just, like, keep biking.

106
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,593
Rym: Mm-hmm.

107
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,440
Rym: But I was like, "Listen, lady, you almost got your daughter killed.

108
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,780
Rym: You're a terrible mother.

109
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:54,464
Rym: Don't

110
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,013
Rym: jaywalk.".

111
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:55,755
Rym: Mm-hmm.

112
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:59,080
Rym: And she was stunned into indignant silence.

113
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:02,697
Rym: And then her daughter was like, "Mommy, you should really listen to the

114
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:03,119
Rym: man.".

115
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:03,817
Rym: Yeah.

116
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:07,240
Rym: And then I started laughing so hard that I almost cried.

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,100
Rym: And I biked away because she was so curious.

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,820
Scott: You should have high-fived the little daughter and then biked away.

119
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:17,100
Rym: But it was, like, it was the kind of thing that normally only happens in movies.

120
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,298
Rym: Like, it was too perfect.

121
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,933
Scott: Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,877
Scott: Go, little daughter, go.

123
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,326
Scott: Yup.

124
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,380
Scott: You're not gonna get killed once you cross the street on your own.

125
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:26,193
Rym: Yup.

126
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,200
Rym: Though, funnily enough, I saw a video this morning.

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,676
Rym: The Gothamist was like, "This is what it looks like when a pedestrian

128
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,219
Rym: jaywalks.".

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,539
Scott: Well, that guy, did you read that?

130
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:34,059
Scott: Yeah.

131
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,579
Rym: That guy had a car horn.

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,136
Scott: Well, no.

133
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,980
Scott: He saw this dude coming because he had a light on his bike like he's supposed to.

134
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,277
Scott: Yup.

135
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,059
Scott: And he knew the guy wasn't looking, and he knew he wouldn't hit him.

136
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,120
Scott: So he intentionally made it a close call to teach the guy a lesson.

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,618
Rym: You know what?

138
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:47,660
Rym: I approve.

139
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,543
Scott: Eh.

140
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:49,899
Rym: You know what it's like?

141
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,100
Scott: It's like- I think that was just an old guy who's not, can't learn a lesson.

142
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:53,778
Scott: He's too old.

143
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:54,228
Rym: Yeah.

144
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,220
Rym: The look of terror on his face, though, was kind of beautiful.

145
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:58,892
Rym: Mm-hmm.

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,875
Rym: So, yeah.

147
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,580
Rym: It's Thursday.

148
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,539
Rym: It's the lounge.

149
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:02,600
Scott: No, it's not.

150
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Scott: Talk about anything.

151
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,779
Scott: You don't have book clubs in a lounge.

152
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,229
Scott: Yeah?

153
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,040
Scott: Imagine a lounge with a book club in it.

154
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,198
Scott: Not getting out of a good mix.

155
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,880
Scott: Your book club belongs in the library or the Barnes and Noble.

156
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,300
Rym: There actually is a writer's lounge near our building.

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Scott: Yeah, but that's not a lounge like the kind of lounge that- That's the kind of lounge I'm thinking about.

158
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,260
Scott: A lounge is the place where you have a lounge singer.

159
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,140
Rym: I was thinking about the book lounge.

160
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,218
Scott: That's not a lounge.

161
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,959
Rym: I guess in the Midwest, you could have the lounge as a room separate from the family room.

162
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,955
Scott: A lounge is a place with leopard print couches and alcohol and a small tiny stage with a shitty keyboard on it.

163
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:41,680
Scott: Possibly an organ with one of those circle curtains that goes around it.

164
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Rym: Now, if it's fancy, it'll be a real piano and there'll be a lady singing.

165
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,359
Scott: That might be more of a club.

166
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,020
Scott: If it gets too good, it's no longer a lounge.

167
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,719
Scott: It becomes a club.

168
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,880
Rym: Thing is, nowadays, club means bad music, playing so loud you can't talk to anyone.

169
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,139
Scott: Well, there are many kinds of clubs.

170
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,420
Scott: There's an anime club too, right?

171
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,780
Scott: A lounge is much more specific.

172
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,438
Rym: So, if you hit someone with a club- That's right.

173
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:04,539
Rym: All right.

174
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,015
Rym: All right.

175
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,019
Rym: So, anyway, it's the lounge.

176
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,740
Scott: No, it's not.

177
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,700
Rym: And recently, a time capsule was unearthed in New York.

178
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,173
Rym: This is a time capsule from 1950, buried in Brooklyn.

179
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,177
Rym: I think it was buried by the MTA or by the organization that became it.

180
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,580
Rym: Time capsule buried beneath old Metropolitan Transportation Authority headquarters in downtown Brooklyn.

181
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,200
Rym: They cracked it open yesterday.

182
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:37,779
Rym: And what they found inside was basically a note to the past saying, "Time capsules need to be waterproof,

183
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,220
Rym: motherfuckers.".

184
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
Rym: It was just a rotten mess of garbage.

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,040
Scott: You got to make a high-quality time capsule.

186
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,180
Scott: That's what makes it a capsule.

187
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,740
Rym: So, the funniest thing, everything was ruined.

188
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,860
Rym: The microfiche, the document, it was all just this tomato soup-looking rust sludge.

189
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:55,900
Rym: The line at the bottom of this article is beautiful.

190
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,939
Rym: The line at the bottom of this article is why I made this my news.

191
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:08,498
Rym: Quote, "The capsule itself might, however, be salvageable and will be put on display at the New York Transit

192
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:08,899
Rym: Museum.".

193
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,560
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

194
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,760
Rym: Unless the caption is just the word "fail" in impact fonts.

195
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,520
Scott: Out and flushing at the World's Fairgrounds in the park, there's a real time capsule that is definitely still in one piece.

196
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:21,440
Rym: I know about that time capsule.

197
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,980
Scott: It's not supposed to be open until well after we're dead.

198
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,397
Scott: We should sneak there at night with jackhammers and get it.

199
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,147
Rym: Hold it hostage?

200
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,760
Rym: Scott, that's some Lupin shit.

201
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,780
Scott: That's what I'm talking about.

202
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,239
Rym: Oh my god, I could pull that off.

203
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,560
Scott: Do you know how to use a jackhammer?

204
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,659
Scott: Do you know how to make it so no one will hear it?

205
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,599
Rym: I know how to use a jackhammer.

206
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:44,060
Rym: Maybe put a silencer on it.

207
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,860
Scott: There's a concrete sidewalk with a metal plaque thingy, and then underneath that is a bunch of dirt.

208
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,000
Scott: I don't know if it's directly underneath that or not.

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,367
Scott: It might be offset slightly.

210
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,539
Scott: If we dig straight down, we might not find it.

211
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,060
Rym: There is a better time capsule that we could steal.

212
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,514
Rym: Where?

213
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:02,720
Rym: Oh no, it's the same one.

214
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,880
Rym: The people who made the Westinghouse time capsule, the one in the Corona Meadows Park, they used that design to make a couple other ones as well.

215
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,834
Scott: The quality ones.

216
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,938
Rym: You know how these things work?

217
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,200
Rym: They're suspended by a string, like a big metal cable, so they're just floating down in a deep pit.

218
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:28,980
Rym: They're covered in this alloy that's designed to last 5,000 years without any sort of measurable corrosion.

219
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,584
Rym: They're shaped like a missile.

220
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:34,480
Rym: They have glass, wool, nose cushions, and all these things in case they break.

221
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,240
Rym: The inside is actually Pyrex glass, and then inside of that is a ridiculous amount of shit.

222
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,504
Scott: Actually, we don't have to dig.

223
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:46,740
Scott: We just have to basically flip the lid open, grab the hook that it's hanging on, and lift it up.

224
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,768
Rym: I think the lid is sealed.

225
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:49,912
Rym: Look, here's what it looks like.

226
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:50,655
Rym: The lid is sealed.

227
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:51,780
Rym: You have to jackhammer this thing off.

228
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,430
Scott: That is not sticking out of the ground anymore.

229
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,100
Scott: You can't see that part there now.

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,467
Rym: No, this is the exhibit.

231
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:57,879
Rym: This just shows you what they look like.

232
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,340
Scott: If you go there now, it's a piece of metal on the ground.

233
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,978
Scott: Yeah, there it is.

234
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:06,180
Rym: You have to bust the concrete up, and then winch it out of the ground.

235
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,820
Scott: Why don't we just get a crane?

236
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:10,868
Rym: No one will notice that.

237
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,740
Rym: There's the problem with this time capsule.

238
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,659
Rym: Here's a picture of what's in it from when they buried it.

239
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,284
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:18,200
Scott: Sure.

241
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,260
Rym: It's got to last a thousand years, and no one's going to care, because here's the picture.

242
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,978
Scott: But we could have that stuff.

243
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,462
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

244
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:24,904
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

245
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:29,420
Rym: I saw this exact camera for sale at a lomography shop in Brooklyn.

246
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,759
Scott: Yeah, but that camera has film in it.

247
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,744
Rym: That is true.

248
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,400
Rym: These three things are reels of film.

249
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,139
Scott: Yes, we could watch those films.

250
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,000
Rym: That looks like a computer mouse, but obviously it's not.

251
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,020
Scott: There's good stuff in there.

252
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,578
Rym: So, anyway, got any news?

253
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,780
Scott: I mean, well, I guess it's not really much news, but Windows 10, Windows 9 got skipped.

254
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,006
Scott: I don't know.

255
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,060
Scott: There's nothing really to say about it.

256
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,361
Rym: Did you see?

257
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:57,780
Rym: I saw an article where someone posited why Windows 9 was skipped.

258
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:58,659
Scott: It's a bad number.

259
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:00,019
Rym: No, here's the deal.

260
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,020
Rym: And they showed some code examples, so there's some plausibility to this.

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,317
Scott: The catch up to Apple, which is OS X.

262
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:09,630
Rym: A lot of Windows version detection functions.

263
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:14,780
Rym: look for Windows space nine dot star.

264
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:15,457
Scott: Why?

265
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,700
Rym: Because they're trying to detect Windows 95 or 98.

266
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,743
Scott: Oh.

267
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,680
Rym: That might be the only reason.

268
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:23,820
Scott: That's a good reason, though.

269
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:24,639
Rym: It is actually a good reason.

270
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,553
Scott: Also, you know, 10's a much better number.

271
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,540
Scott: It catches up to Apple.

272
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,440
Scott: Apple has been on OS X for a thousand years.

273
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,560
Rym: Remember when Winamp went one, two, three, five?

274
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:37,262
Scott: But anyway, you know, the thing about it is I'm still using Windows 7.

275
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:37,878
Rym: As am I.

276
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,980
Scott: And it still feels perfectly new.

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Scott: It doesn't feel like there is a newer Windows.

278
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,000
Scott: It's like, oh, yeah, Windows 8 is a thing that exists.

279
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,540
Rym: Right.

280
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:49,260
Rym: Well, I would have gotten Windows 8 if I built a new computer.

281
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:50,900
Scott: Maybe, I guess.

282
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,840
Rym: Since Windows 7 came out.

283
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,602
Scott: But it's like, until there's a reason to get a new computer, it's like there's no reason for me to spend money on Windows 10.

284
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,599
Scott: And I'm definitely not going to get a shady pirated one.

285
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,156
Rym: Well, yeah, that's the thing is with Windows.

286
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:02,820
Rym: now is that desktop.

287
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,260
Scott: And everything that you still use your computer for, Windows 7 is totally fully supported.

288
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,860
Scott: It supports everything.

289
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,980
Scott: Every hardware is supported.

290
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,099
Rym: On a desktop computer.

291
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,400
Scott: All new software supports Windows 7 and all the hardware I already have is supported by Windows 7.

292
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,461
Rym: Well, Scott, here are the reasons to buy Windows 10.

293
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,000
Rym: One, you build a new computer.

294
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,880
Scott: And you can't get a copy of Windows 7.

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,840
Rym: And you can't transfer your license that you already paid for because you bought the OEM license or whatever.

296
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:28,338
Scott: Maybe.

297
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:32,960
Rym: Two, your current version of Windows is actually out of support.

298
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,568
Scott: Maybe.

299
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,219
Rym: Those are all the reasons.

300
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,140
Scott: So, I don't, you know.

301
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Rym: The thing is I feel like Windows 8 was the, it's not ME.

302
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,340
Rym: Like people always talk, like I saw all these charts.

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,900
Rym: It's like everyone's so young.

304
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,380
Rym: They don't understand or remember Windows.

305
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,640
Rym: They're like, man, every other version of Windows sucks.

306
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,160
Rym: Like the TikTok with the Apple phones.

307
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,480
Rym: They're like, Windows 95 sucked and 98 was awesome.

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Rym: I was like, alright kid, already you're stupid.

309
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,380
Rym: Windows 95 was possibly one of the most revolutionary operating systems in modern history.

310
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,460
Scott: If I was Microsoft, what I would do is I would just be like, alright, you know what the fuck?

311
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,280
Scott: It's called Windows.

312
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,560
Scott: It's free for everyone except businesses.

313
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,379
Scott: Businesses have to pay a fucking fortune.

314
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:12,336
Scott: The end.

315
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:19,399
Scott: And then the business windows, the only differences would be things that businesses absolutely need that no human being.

316
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,059
Rym: Well, you know what I'd sell?

317
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,920
Rym: I'd sell things like holding, staging, and pushing patches.

318
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,859
Rym: Security restrictions.

319
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:40,080
Scott: No, I would just be like, yeah, uh, what's, what makes windows 10 like business-y, not windows 10, but like the business version, the business version, these applications that we also make that you absolutely need will refuse to run on the regular one.

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,516
Scott: So it's like, oh, you need SharePoint that absolutely will just refuse to run on the free one.

321
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:50,460
Rym: It's just really a shame that, I mean, there's Apple, which is always on hardware.

322
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,939
Rym: There's windows and that's it.

323
00:12:55,722 --> 00:13:00,240
Rym: That in all this time there is still no BOS, Linux.

324
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,778
Rym: So at my company, we were talking about, you know, like charting frameworks and whatever and all this stuff.

325
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:12,899
Rym: And we were looking at compatibility and at one point we're like, wow, that framework is great, but it only works on windows.

326
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,500
Rym: And then we were all quiet for like several seconds.

327
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:22,420
Rym: And then our new developer heard is like, do we support the client on Linux?

328
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,900
Rym: And I was like, well, yeah, it's Java, so it runs.

329
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Rym: And he was like, does any, has anyone ever used it on Linux?

330
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:36,140
Rym: And I was like, my QA team, Linux desktop is a joke.

331
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:36,835
Scott: Yes.

332
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:38,499
Rym: But it's not Monday.

333
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,718
Rym: It's Thursday.

334
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,916
Scott: This shows you how little news there is.

335
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:43,880
Rym: Well, there's plenty of news.

336
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:44,520
Rym: It's just not news.

337
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,059
Rym: We like, what am I going to say about Ebola?

338
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:47,035
Scott: Don't get it.

339
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,579
Rym: You know what you can learn about Ebola?

340
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,416
Rym: Go to CNN.

341
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,540
Rym: My opinion, don't touch people who look like they have Ebola.

342
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,200
Scott: Don't go anywhere that you've heard about Ebola being.

343
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,740
Rym: Unless you are an altruist who really wants to go help and make a difference.

344
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,480
Scott: If you are a doctor, not just a dumb altruist who's not a doctor.

345
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,759
Rym: I don't want, I don't want some like lame-o.

346
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,059
Scott: And also a real doctor, not a made up doctor.

347
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Rym: Hi everybody.

348
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,135
Scott: Yes.

349
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:13,480
Scott: And like you actually know something about viruses too.

350
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,180
Scott: If you're some other like an orthopedist, you're not going to be able to help.

351
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:23,379
Rym: I'd happily talk about the fact that Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un, might have broken his ankles because he's fat.

352
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Scott: He's just walking around?

353
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,280
Rym: Yeah, like he might have fractured his ankles.

354
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,580
Scott: He must have been doing something.

355
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,420
Scott: Isn't he always riding horses and shit?

356
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,259
Scott: He probably fell off one.

357
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:31,509
Rym: No.

358
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,260
Rym: So there's a lot of video evidence that he's been gaining a lot of weight.

359
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,819
Scott: Well, wouldn't you if you were eating the whole country's worth of food and everyone else was starving?

360
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,220
Rym: I have access to infinite numbers of calories compared to what my body could consume.

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,458
Rym: I ate seven or eight hundred calories of cookies right before we did the show and I'm drinking a beer.

362
00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:01,200
Rym: I consume as much calorie as I can on an hourly basis and I've weighed 150 pounds since like I was 16.

363
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,719
Scott: Right, but he's eating food for an entire country of people to make sure that they continue to starve.

364
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,259
Scott: That's a lot more than 700 calories.

365
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,800
Rym: In a way, that noble man is protecting his people from obesity and type 2 diabetes.

366
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,800
Scott: Yes, instead giving them things like scurvy.

367
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,920
Rym: I would love to talk about Ukraine, but you don't know or care.

368
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,519
Rym: I need Andrew.

369
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:22,320
Rym: Andrew's my Ukraine buddy.

370
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,158
Scott: Don't go there.

371
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,160
Scott: Any place that's in the news is usually a place you don't want to go.

372
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,479
Scott: That's my news.

373
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:28,800
Scott: Oh, that's my advice.

374
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,020
Rym: Oh, trying to think of an exception to that.

375
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,619
Rym: PAX isn't really in the news.

376
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,440
Rym: New York Comic Con is in the news and you don't want to go to that.

377
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,219
Rym: It holds out.

378
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,155
Rym: It holds up.

379
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,139
Scott: Usually 9 times out of 10 or even more than that.

380
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,000
Scott: If a place of a location is in the news, don't go there.

381
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,840
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

382
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,359
Rym: This is cute and weird.

383
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,439
Rym: So bear with me here.

384
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,660
Rym: There is a pop song apparently called Anaconda that I'd never heard of.

385
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,720
Scott: I didn't hear this either, but apparently it's just a Sir Mix-A-Lot remix.

386
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:08,035
Scott: Yes, so it's basically Sir Mix-A-Lot, but with girls.

387
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:12,980
Rym: It's not the greatest thing in the world.

388
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,200
Rym: But the reason I found out about it is because CollegeHumor posted Anaconda, the educational version.

389
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:27,319
Scott: So I saw this and I thought it was just a remix of Sir Mix-A-Lot because I didn't know that it was a remix of a remix of Sir Mix-A-Lot.

390
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,677
Rym: So that is very much like the people who quote the phrase, "We don't need no stinking

391
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:34,359
Rym: badges."

392
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:36,280
Rym: And they don't know where it's from.

393
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
Rym: That is from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

394
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,559
Scott: They think it's from Blazing Saddle.

395
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,799
Rym: Actually, I've seen conversations.

396
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,280
Scott: Which it is from, but it's also from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

397
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,480
Rym: I witnessed a conversation several years ago at a convention.

398
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,855
Rym: The conversation went like this, "We don't need no stinking

399
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:53,398
Rym: badges.".

400
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,113
Rym: And then the guy was like, "Ah, The

401
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,037
Rym: Simpsons.".

402
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:02,111
Rym: And the guy was like, "Uh, no.

403
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:03,457
Rym: It's from Blazing

404
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:03,979
Rym: Saddles.".

405
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,698
Rym: And then this other guy who was sitting nearby at a table looks up and he's like, "You two are

406
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:10,339
Rym: children.".

407
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,740
Rym: And he did not explain what he meant by that.

408
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,960
Scott: That is the person that you should sit down and have a conversation with.

409
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,400
Rym: That's the person you go sit and play Hanabi with right away.

410
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,997
Scott: That's right.

411
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:25,498
Scott: Anyone who has listened to this who has not seen Treasure of the Sierra Madre, that movie is...

412
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,429
Rym: So anyway, this is a parody of a song.

413
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,535
Rym: that is a remix of a song.

414
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,260
Rym: And it's kind of cute and funny because it's basically just a sexy, rappy kind of music video.

415
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,260
Rym: Except it's literally about anacondas, the snakes, and sexual dimorphism.

416
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:49,558
Rym: And it's just... I don't know.

417
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,980
Rym: All my other things of the day would require way too much explanation.

418
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,400
Rym: And I gotta save them for an appropriate... Like, I need them to segue into something.

419
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,240
Scott: So, continuing my hockey-themed things of the day this week.

420
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,519
Scott: Here's another hockey-themed thing of the day.

421
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Scott: The Dallas Stars, who are not very good at hockey right now.

422
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,999
Scott: Not the worst!

423
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Scott: No, I mean, you know, it's still pre-season hockey.

424
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,357
Scott: We don't know how... They could suddenly be great this year.

425
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:12,780
Scott: Unlikely.

426
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,479
Rym: Meanwhile, Scott, I read a headline today.

427
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,549
Rym: And it was basically like, "Rangers!

428
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,097
Rym: Not seeing the Stanley Cup this

429
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:20,398
Rym: year!".

430
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,486
Scott: No kidding.

431
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:26,100
Scott: It's pretty much probably going to be the West again.

432
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,937
Scott: Because all the good players are still in the West.

433
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:28,260
Scott: Anyway.

434
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:44,420
Scott: So, the Dallas Stars, during their pre-season hockey game, on the scoreboard, put up memes that came up with making fun of the fans of opposing teams that were in the stands.

435
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,046
Rym: The winter is coming one is great.

436
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:46,950
Rym: Brace yourselves.

437
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,320
Rym: Bandwagon Blackhawks fans are coming.

438
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,771
Rym: You know what this is?

439
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,140
Rym: This is Anime News Nina.

440
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,479
Rym: For those of you who don't listen to the Anime Night.

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,420
Rym: The Anime News Network, which is pretty much the Reuters press of anime.

442
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,399
Rym: Well, in an English-speaking world.

443
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,340
Rym: Like, outside of Japan.

444
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:13,500
Scott: If you want anime news, or news about anime, manga, Japan stuff in the US, Anime News Network is the place.

445
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,770
Rym: It is pretty much the top.

446
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,060
Rym: Like, the top top.

447
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:19,209
Rym: One step under that is, like, Anime World Order.

448
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,240
Rym: Another step under that is, like, Oz and Dave and Joel.

449
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:23,760
Scott: Uh, Taku USA Magazine?

450
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:31,640
Rym: Uh, I put them on the level of... Halfway between Anime News Network and Anime World Order.

451
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,699
Rym: Because there's a Venn diagram at that point.

452
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:33,986
Scott: Anyway.

453
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,821
Rym: Anyway.

454
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:40,400
Rym: But they had a comic, Anime News Nina, that was pretty sardonic and funny.

455
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,620
Rym: But the point was that it made fun of itself and of the thing that the organization was about.

456
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,280
Rym: It's like the company making fun of itself and making the kind of humor that might offend really offendable people.

457
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:55,119
Rym: But is actually funny.

458
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:56,443
Rym: This is that.

459
00:19:56,765 --> 00:20:00,060
Rym: This is the kind of thing that I wish more everythings did.

460
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,587
Rym: Actually be funny.

461
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,060
Rym: Don't be completely corporate lame humor.

462
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,260
Rym: And also just don't be, like, racist and sexist.

463
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,600
Scott: Just hire young people and let them have control and don't put stupid restrictions on them or punish them for being cool.

464
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:11,960
Rym: Yeah.

465
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:21,289
Rym: Because seriously, if you're old, like, over the age of 40, and you're 21 year old, like, just out of college, motion graphics guy says, "Trust me, this is

466
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:21,831
Rym: hilarious.".

467
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,040
Rym: I guarantee it is hilarious.

468
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,600
Rym: At least to the people who are at your hockey game.

469
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Scott: Just verify that it's not also offensive.

470
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,543
Rym: Yeah.

471
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:34,160
Rym: Because the other problem with that person is that he is trying to sneak the goatee in.

472
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,783
Scott: That's right.

473
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,540
Scott: There could be a hidden goatee there.

474
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
Rym: You know how hard I'm trying to sneak the goatee into everything I ever do?

475
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,700
Scott: Have you snuck the goatee into anything at work?

476
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:45,339
Rym: No, I have not, but I've snuck a whole bunch of pony in.

477
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:45,840
Rym: Alright.

478
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,959
Rym: Lots of pones.

479
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:49,259
Scott: Metamoments?

480
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,923
Scott: In the metamoment.

481
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,413
Rym: The Book Club book is Can it Go for?

482
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,560
Rym: Leave It, which we're going to talk about it.

483
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,740
Scott: What's the next Book Club book?

484
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,878
Rym: I don't know.

485
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:55,760
Scott: Oh, okay.

486
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,400
Rym: I'm debating whether or not to punish Scott for taking so long.

487
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
Scott: Summer, would you want me to read books when the sun is out?

488
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:16,140
Rym: Yeah, to be fair, it's a little one-sided because the reason I read seven novels since I finished Can it Go for Liebowitz, well, six and a half, I'm not done with the seventh one, is because I've had a number of transatlantic flights.

489
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:16,937
Scott: On your own.

490
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:17,495
Scott: Yes.

491
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:18,280
Scott: With no one else.

492
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:30,999
Rym: So, if you're not flying with a friend and you're flying, like, nine hours multiple times over the course of a month, you're going to read a lot of books because you can only watch so many cut-down shitty movies on the back of a headrest and your laptop only lasts a few hours.

493
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,720
Rym: So, uh, I gotta pick a book and I gotta decide how much I want to punish Scott.

494
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,580
Scott: Alright, so in the metamoment, I want to talk about just a few events that are happening in and around New York City and other nerdy places, I guess, mostly New York City.

495
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,260
Rym: Oh, there's a secret burger crawl next weekend in New York City that you should go to.

496
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:50,438
Scott: Okay, that's good to know.

497
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,849
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:57,900
Scott: So, most of these things are actually happening, like, October 11th, 12th, when we're at a wedding in Albany.

499
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,660
Scott: It's Columbus Day weekend, I guess.

500
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:04,620
Scott: Fuck Columbus Day, but, you know, that's a day off for work.

501
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,859
Scott: Anyway, so here's the thing.

502
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:17,720
Scott: So, first of all, because New York Comic Con is also that weekend, I'm pretty sure, there's a bunch of crazy nerdy events going on surrounding New York Comic Con that are vastly superior to New York Comic Con itself.

503
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,740
Scott: So, I think the Ghibli movie is now screening in New York City.

504
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,160
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think Emily might have bought tickets for that.

505
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,519
Scott: Okay, that's number one.

506
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:38,480
Scott: Number two, there's the Hatsune Miku Expo in New York City, which includes Hatsune Miku concert in the Nokia Theater, which is 11th and 12th, but then there's also this, like, art exhibit you can just go to, so we can go to that later.

507
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:39,499
Scott: That's open for longer.

508
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,179
Scott: There is New York City, this is unrelated to nerdery.

509
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:50,820
Scott: It's like New York City open house, where you can sort of sign up and go to things that are normally not open.

510
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,018
Rym: That's super nerdy.

511
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,041
Scott: Sort of.

512
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:58,800
Scott: So, I really wanted to go to the CWA terminal at JFK, which you can go to.

513
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,220
Scott: I think you can also go to, like, Woolworth Building and other shit.

514
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,339
Rym: I was thinking about going to the onion domes, the digesters.

515
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,088
Scott: Oh, you can just go there.

516
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,000
Scott: That's not a special day, but yeah, we can go there.

517
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:12,759
Scott: So, the website to sign up for those things is open now, but I'm not gonna be here.

518
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,332
Scott: And the last one, I don't think it's that weekend.

519
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,998
Scott: I think it's maybe November 1st.

520
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,080
Scott: I gotta check the actual date and provide a link at some point.

521
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,140
Scott: I'll mention this one again, because there's more time between now and it.

522
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,722
Scott: College Humor.

523
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:33,200
Scott: Super Art Fight team up to bring you Super Art Fight vs College Humor in Brooklyn.

524
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:33,956
Rym: Guys.

525
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,259
Scott: Super Art Fight in Brooklyn for the first time ever.

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,920
Rym: If you don't know what Super Art Fight is, go to this thing.

527
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,494
Rym: If you know what it is, go to this thing.

528
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:42,400
Rym: Seriously.

529
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:43,079
Scott: It's happening.

530
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,479
Rym: The College Humor team, like the people from College Humor.

531
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:51,440
Rym: If anyone's gonna take down some of these long-reigning champions of Super Art Fight.

532
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,440
Scott: I mean, Caldwell is not new to the Super Art Fight, you know, canvas.

533
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,220
Rym: No, he is not, but I imagine Caldwell teamed up with, I'd have to pick who I'd team up with.

534
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,886
Rym: You know what we need?

535
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:00,960
Rym: You know what we should make?

536
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:03,359
Rym: Fantasy Super Art Fight League.

537
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:07,019
Scott: You get points whenever they get a win.

538
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:07,411
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,159
Scott: Every time they draw a monocle, it scores a half point.

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,418
Scott: Two points for a top hat.

541
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:13,664
Rym: Yeah.

542
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,420
Rym: Man, then you have a separate scoring system for, like, if someone does a webcomic.

543
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:21,400
Rym: When those elements are included in the media they're publishing elsewhere, it's like the fantasy player.

544
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:24,139
Rym: Someone else make that.

545
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:24,878
Scott: Yeah.

546
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,900
Scott: That's all the things I can think of right now, but I'm sure there's more going down.

547
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,300
Rym: So, in a few weeks, October 31st through November 2nd, Halloween, the anniversary of GeekNights.

548
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:38,220
Rym: I will be live at PAX Australia without Scott.

549
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,079
Scott: Unless someone wants to give me, like, a real lot of money right now.

550
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,420
Scott: It's still theoretically possible if I'm given enough money in some currency.

551
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,060
Scott: What's the number?

552
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,680
Scott: That is legit.

553
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,260
Rym: Would you go if someone gave you two grand?

554
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,879
Scott: Well, no.

555
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:50,956
Rym: Two grand would...

556
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:52,280
Scott: I need a price of a plane ticket.

557
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
Rym: I'm saying two grand would cover the plane tickets.

558
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:04,300
Scott: Alright, and then I need a hotel to stay there, and then enough money to go from PAX, because I'm basically, if I'm going to go there, I'm going to go to PAX Aus, and then leave Melbourne immediately to go to the coral reef area.

559
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,093
Rym: See, I'm landing in Sydney first, and I'm doing a professional conference.

560
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,200
Rym: I'm lecturing, actually, on games at that.

561
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,436
Rym: So, I'm doing a lecture called, I think, Games, Trades, Regulation.

562
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:15,040
Rym: I forget what I'm doing.

563
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,479
Rym: I've got to make slides for that.

564
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,260
Scott: But, yeah, I want to go to PAX Aus, basically, like, a day before.

565
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,680
Scott: See, you know, see the Melbourne stuff that now I'm familiar with.

566
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,160
Rym: Yup.

567
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:23,540
Scott: Right?

568
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:26,300
Rym: I'm going to go to Wilson's fucking Promontory this time.

569
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:26,860
Rym: Sure.

570
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:31,200
Scott: And I'm going to go to PAX Aus, and then I want to go to the coral reef area, which is far away.

571
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,955
Rym: Uh-oh, I typed Wilson's into Google, and it didn't say Promontory.

572
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,320
Rym: It said, uh, disease.

573
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,025
Scott: Great.

574
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:37,619
Scott: Don't get that.

575
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:39,480
Scott: Uh, just like, don't get your bullet.

576
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,240
Scott: Go to the coral reef, hang out there for, like, a week or two, and then come back.

577
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,359
Scott: So, that's how much money I need.

578
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,200
Rym: Oh, also known as the prom.

579
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,480
Scott: And to make up for the money I'm going to lose not working.

580
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,640
Rym: Wilson's Promontory, also known as the prom, is Victoria's most loved place.

581
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,319
Scott: Sure.

582
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:52,745
Rym: Huh.

583
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:53,684
Rym: Ooh.

584
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,459
Rym: We really should have gone here.

585
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,520
Scott: Well, you know, we were only there for so long.

586
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,380
Rym: Take that Phillip Island hike we did and just multiply it by, like, a hundred.

587
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:01,735
Scott: Uh, that's too long.

588
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:02,040
Scott: Alright.

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,860
Rym: Anyway, so I will be at PAX Australia on Saturday presenting losing, and on Sunday presenting winning.

590
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,419
Scott: I'll be in the United States chilling out, maybe streaming something, playing Netrunner, baking things.

591
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,674
Scott: Someone at work today said, "Put cheddar cheese on an apple pie," and I said, "Fuck

592
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:20,855
Scott: no.".

593
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:26,059
Rym: That, I would do Swiss if I was going to do that.

594
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,960
Rym: No, I would do Port Salut.

595
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:31,819
Scott: I would not do any cheese.

596
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,580
Rym: Port Salut.

597
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,760
Scott: The only dairy product that belongs in apple pie is an ice cream.

598
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:38,419
Rym: So, in Albany, right?

599
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,940
Rym: Pete and Nury, they asked me if I wanted apple pie, and then they looked at each other like he doesn't know.

600
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:49,100
Scott: How would they have apple pie that would be gluten free?

601
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Rym: You can make apple pie that's gluten free.

602
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:51,040
Scott: Okay.

603
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,620
Rym: Pie crusts are actually one of the easier things to make gluten free.

604
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,179
Scott: Why would you want a gluten free pie, though?

605
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:57,815
Rym: Apples are the primary part of the pie.

606
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:58,260
Rym: It's a good pie.

607
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,439
Scott: Well, just have baked apples, then.

608
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,200
Rym: So, instead of ice cream, they gave me white chocolate mousse.

609
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:06,579
Scott: That's not a bad choice.

610
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,399
Rym: It was dangerously good.

611
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:10,058
Rym: Yeah.

612
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,499
Rym: To the point that I ate so much.

613
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,679
Scott: Was it actual white chocolate, or?

614
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
Rym: It was actual white chocolate.

615
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,306
Rym: Whoa.

616
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,223
Rym: White chocolate mousse.

617
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:18,460
Rym: It was so thick with caloric joy.

618
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,500
Scott: Where do you get white chocolate mousse from?

619
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,280
Rym: A mother makes it, is how you get that.

620
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,179
Scott: That's how you get that.

621
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:28,460
Scott: That mother doesn't have accurate recipes that I can follow.

622
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,296
Rym: In fact, I asked, "What's the

623
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:31,519
Rym: recipe?"

624
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,798
Rym: Which was followed by more laughter and, "Will you take some amount of

625
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:36,060
Rym: cream?".

626
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:36,840
Scott: That's right.

627
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:38,719
Scott: I don't know.

628
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,779
Scott: I can get the internet.

629
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,254
Scott: The internet will help.

630
00:27:47,743 --> 00:27:49,259
Rym: So, the book club.

631
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:52,380
Rym: A canticle for Leibowitz, which Scott chose.

632
00:27:52,741 --> 00:28:04,539
Scott: So, I chose this because, based on my knowledge of it, I thought it was in the genre of, it is a post-apocalyptic story, which it is, where specifically society has been sealed in.

633
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:11,180
Scott: Such as in Logan's Run, or Phoenix Future, or Fallout, where the character, you're in a vault.

634
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,019
Rym: Well, knowledge was sealed in.

635
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,365
Scott: Yes.

636
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:18,539
Scott: So, in the first chapter, it sort of is in that genre, right?

637
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:23,160
Scott: Where it's about monks in a monastery that's far away from everything else.

638
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,460
Scott: They're basically sealed.

639
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:30,440
Scott: They encounter a vault where people were sealed at one point.

640
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:35,620
Scott: But really, it's not about a society that is sealed in.

641
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,280
Scott: It's about something completely different.

642
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,760
Scott: So, I think it is not actually in that genre.

643
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,740
Rym: I'm going to start off by saying that.

644
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,200
Rym: It is definitely post-apocalyptic.

645
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,838
Scott: It is the most post-apocalyptic.

646
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:48,860
Rym: And it is one of the earlier instances of what we would call modern post-apocalyptic.

647
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,008
Rym: Because I've heard most apocalypse stories before.

648
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:56,580
Rym: books like this were floods, and mythology, and those kinds of things.

649
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:06,220
Scott: Yeah, this is a pretty typical old-school sci-fi book in a post-apocalypse on Earth with a dystopian society and whatnot.

650
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:13,280
Rym: Arguably, I guess, Mary Shelley's The Last Man is the first work in this genre of post-apocalypse.

651
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,440
Rym: mechanical for liebowitz is widely regarded to be one of the earliest modern takes.

652
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
Rym: A lot of people point to this as being the precursor.

653
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,000
Rym: Like, a lot of books are based on this book in some fashion.

654
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,860
Rym: Though, I suspect that that number is dwindling because this book seems to be increasingly unknown.

655
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:31,822
Scott: I don't know.

656
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:32,909
Scott: I heard more about it.

657
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:33,653
Scott: That's why it came up.

658
00:29:33,694 --> 00:29:34,740
Scott: It came up in so many places.

659
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,282
Rym: I don't know.

660
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,458
Rym: It seems to come up in the same circles that a lot of our Book Club books come up in.

661
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,420
Rym: That is not pop nerd culture at all.

662
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:52,160
Scott: Anyway, so the book is really sort of these three books that are loosely tied together, covering three periods in history of this post-apocalypse world.

663
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,800
Scott: So the first one is still long after the apocalypse, but not so long after it.

664
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,100
Scott: The second part is hundreds of years after that.

665
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,160
Rym: It's like Renaissance, and then Space Future.

666
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,816
Scott: And then the third part is way after the apocalypse.

667
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,314
Rym: Now, if you guys read it, it's the Book Club.

668
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,039
Rym: Spoilers.

669
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,159
Rym: We're going to talk about the book and assume you read it.

670
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,760
Rym: So if you didn't read A Canticle for Leibowitz, you should go read it before you listen, because we're not going to explain any of the plot.

671
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,318
Rym: We're assuming you read it.

672
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:25,540
Rym: Also, I read it a long-ass time ago, so my memory might be fuzzy.

673
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,960
Rym: I already lost -- like, I had a bunch of specific parts I wanted to quote.

674
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,240
Rym: I don't remember any of that anymore.

675
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:31,040
Scott: That's okay.

676
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Rym: But if I had to summarize it, the moral of the first one, the Fiat Homo, is basically the church survives Renaissance dark ages, humans always have dark ages.

677
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,200
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

678
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,220
Rym: And then monks in monasteries and staticness.

679
00:30:49,400 --> 00:31:01,340
Rym: The feeling of Fiat Homo, it feels like it's the idea of being static, that whenever there's a dark age, whenever society falls behind, parts of it wall themselves off, and they can't innovate.

680
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,940
Rym: They become entirely static.

681
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,100
Rym: So these monks, generation by generation, nothing changes.

682
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,859
Rym: Nothing changes.

683
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:16,220
Rym: That chapter drills it into your head that fucking nothing has happened as far back as anyone can remember.

684
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Scott: Right, he's making a commentary on the history of our existing world by showing you this new history of a world that happens after our world ends.

685
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:31,700
Scott: A human society emerges after ours, presumably the real one that we live in now, ends.

686
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,640
Scott: And then it's like, oh, it goes through the same exact shit that this one went through.

687
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:44,080
Scott: And the first chapter goes through the dark age where there is still some sort of intelligence, but really it's a dark age and there isn't any overall.

688
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,360
Scott: So the people who have it need to wall off and protect it and weather the storm.

689
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,919
Rym: It's static and ritualized.

690
00:31:52,743 --> 00:32:08,177
Rym: The spores of society become static, become unchanging, become ritualized, and their only purpose is to replicate that data such to the point that when society catches up to where they can understand its meaning, you get chapter two.

691
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:10,699
Scott: In a way, they're a time capsule.

692
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:14,858
Rym: That story was actually my favorite.

693
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,319
Rym: I enjoyed the book less as it went on.

694
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:19,480
Scott: I agree.

695
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:20,511
Scott: I mean, I guess I cared less.

696
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:29,300
Rym: I like the interplay between the guy who runs the monastery and the main character because the main character was way smarter than everyone gave him credit for.

697
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,279
Scott: But he was so humble.

698
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:31,060
Rym: Exactly.

699
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,015
Scott: But the other thing, that first chapter, I think the other reason I liked it more is because it gives you the world-building.

700
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,719
Scott: The second and third chapters, the world has already been built by the first chapter, so they sort of just take it for granted.

701
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,980
Scott: Whereas the first one's a bit longer.

702
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:49,940
Scott: It's sort of explaining to you, introducing you to this post-apocalyptic world, and that part is just really interesting.

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,436
Scott: So you're like, "Oh, it went down like

704
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:51,679
Scott: this.".

705
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,100
Rym: It's definitely, I believe, the first novel like this to use in this post-apocalypse.

706
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:01,720
Rym: the idea of the reader knows more than the characters.

707
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:09,880
Rym: So there's one point where they're obviously referring to resistors, like the resistors that actually most of you Geek Guys listeners have probably never seen.

708
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,680
Rym: So that reference would be lost.

709
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:24,328
Rym: But the kinds of resistors I played with when I was a kid that I'd buy at Radio Shack with little colored bands, there are a lot of references like that that are obviously looking to the reader and going, "You know what these are.

710
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,955
Rym: You know what's going

711
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:26,677
Rym: on.".

712
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,639
Rym: And I see that trope used a lot recently in stories like this.

713
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,720
Scott: He's making a bunch of little points along the way.

714
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,615
Scott: When he's talking about the blueprints, like, "Why did they put white on

715
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,117
Scott: blue?"

716
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,375
Scott: It's like, "It makes no

717
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:43,699
Scott: sense.".

718
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,440
Scott: And he's coloring in the whole thing, trying to reproduce, just assuming that the people from the ancient pre-apocalypse smarter times knew better.

719
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,385
Rym: I mean, think.

720
00:33:52,546 --> 00:34:03,660
Rym: Say I didn't know anything about computers and I found a computer in a post-apocalypse and I was trying to make it work again and make a new one, I would copy it exactly, not understanding why I was doing what I was doing.

721
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,418
Scott: And do a lot of things that are dumb and be like, "Why did they do it this

722
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:07,700
Scott: way?".

723
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,275
Scott: It's like, "Well, because there's other things you don't

724
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:09,476
Scott: know.".

725
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:17,239
Scott: It's just interesting to think about recovering, just having the artifacts and then trying to recover the knowledge.

726
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:24,600
Scott: That's what we do with archaeology in this world, when we look at ancient artifacts from some old civilization.

727
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:35,119
Scott: We think we get it right, but you look at them and it's like, "Oh, it's obvious he's doing archaeology on our artifacts and look at him fucking

728
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,280
Scott: up.".

729
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,279
Scott: But it's sort of obvious how he fucks up, but we're fucking up in that same way with the archaeology that we do.

730
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:49,719
Scott: We're probably much better at it than them because we are more advanced, looking at something less advanced, but even so.

731
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Rym: In a way, I found this interesting because most of the stories I read like this, the future society doesn't understand that the past was more advanced.

732
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,920
Rym: In this story, every character is like, they know pretty much what went down.

733
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:06,860
Rym: They know that there was a nuclear war.

734
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,619
Rym: They understand the danger of those things.

735
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,699
Scott: It's sort of like Adventure Time, like the Mushroom War.

736
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,619
Scott: They have funny names for it, but they sort of know.

737
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:25,900
Rym: How Liebowitzch is basically just like this nuclear engineer, just worked in the facility and had some personal drama, and how he became a saint, and I like that whole story there.

738
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,852
Rym: I was disappointed, however, that St.

739
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,858
Rym: Liebowitzch was a legit supernatural entity, as far as I can tell.

740
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,580
Scott: Yeah, from what I can tell, he was as well.

741
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:38,300
Rym: That is the only part of this book I did not like.

742
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,157
Scott: It didn't really seem to matter too much because he hardly appears or does anything notable.

743
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,740
Rym: Yeah, I mean, you could try to make an argument about maybe it was an allegory or something, but I just don't see that having been Walter Miller's intent.

744
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:52,310
Scott: No.

745
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:56,740
Rym: I feel like these books were written semi-rambly.

746
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:11,779
Rym: I feel like when he was writing them, he was exploring these ideas, and I think his main goal was just to impress upon people the cyclical nature of human society, and how we're on the edge of a dark age again.

747
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,020
Scott: Well, yeah, this was written in a Cold War time.

748
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,684
Rym: I mean, it was written in, what, 1960?

749
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:16,813
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:21,680
Rym: That was one of the most dangerous times in all of human history.

751
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,940
Scott: Right, so he's writing like, "Don't have nuclear war, guys," and that was the time that we could have had it.

752
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,640
Rym: But at the same time, he was almost arguing that it's inevitable.

753
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,720
Scott: Yeah, well, it wasn't yet.

754
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,339
Rym: Because look at the third part at the end.

755
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,840
Rym: The spaceship goes into space.

756
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,080
Rym: It's a monastery in space now because the second chapter will always happen.

757
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Rym: The Fiat Lux, the second chapter is basically suddenly the world catches up, and smart people can figure out what this shit all meant, but how the monasteries on their own were not capable of doing it on their own.

758
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
Rym: They were only doing it for academic purpose.

759
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,019
Rym: Someone has a practical purpose, and suddenly the world advances very quickly, and then the third chapter is they're going to nuke again and monastery in space.

760
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,531
Scott: You wonder, was there a monastery in space the first time, right?

761
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:23,660
Scott: Because this is the second nuclear war that happens on this planet Earth, this fictional Earth, and the second one, they have nukes, and they have spaceships at the same time, and the first one, didn't they have spaceships and nukes at the same time or not?

762
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:35,159
Rym: If it was written in 1960, at that time, we did not have spaceships that were really capable of anything like that, and it seems like the nuclear war happened around that time.

763
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:42,260
Rym: They had not gotten too far, as far as I could tell, technologically, beyond what was predicted in the near future.

764
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:48,500
Scott: The technology in that third chapter is a bit weird, where some things are way advanced, like you can just walk onto the spaceship in your sandals.

765
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,477
Rym: But his conception of a computer.

766
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,259
Scott: It has a nuclear drive, and you can just go.

767
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:56,440
Scott: Yeah, the computer is like ENIAC, and it draws instead of having a monitor.

768
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,299
Rym: Well, that part made sense, because computers were kind of like that back then.

769
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:01,101
Scott: But

770
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:21,540
Rym: it's interesting how they implied a lot of highly advanced capabilities to a lot of other things, but computers, as he envisioned them, were not significantly advanced in any interesting way beyond what existed at that time, and yet simultaneously had a few powers that to this day are basically impossible.

771
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:30,940
Scott: Right, but it's like he could somehow imagine technologies being super advanced in some aspects, but couldn't imagine them being advanced at all in other aspects.

772
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,760
Rym: Yeah, though it seems like the space stuff was the only thing that was really super advanced.

773
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
Scott: Yeah, the medicine wasn't advanced, really, at all.

774
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,580
Rym: It was partly just because he needed that for his plot at the end, I think.

775
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,325
Scott: I guess so.

776
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:44,600
Scott: Anyway.

777
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,640
Scott: So, yeah, the first chapter is pretty much this dark age.

778
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:54,457
Scott: The second chapter is this renaissance, where people suddenly actually care what the monks are up to, right?

779
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,199
Scott: But the monks are only inventing light bulbs and getting all Thomas Edison, because research.

780
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
Scott: They don't actually want anyone to have light bulbs everywhere.

781
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,598
Scott: But then, of course, the dude from far away comes, and he wants light bulbs everywhere, and he's like, "Oh,

782
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:08,780
Scott: shit.".

783
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:32,040
Scott: But the one thing in that chapter that actually stood out as interesting to me, because the rest of it was kind of eh, was the fact that it's like that guy, you know, the guy who thought he was the hot shit, I forget his name, he realized, you know, he was all proud of being a smart inventor, but because this was the second society, he was really only a discoverer.

784
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:33,340
Scott: He couldn't be an inventor.

785
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,660
Scott: There was no way he could be an inventor of anything.

786
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:38,980
Scott: All he could do is rediscover things that were already invented.

787
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,577
Scott: And it's like, whoa.

788
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:45,458
Scott: Imagine, like, your whole life, you spend discovering shit, but it's like, no.

789
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:57,100
Scott: Your whole life has to go into this, and knowing that you put all this hard work in, but there were previous people who were way ahead of you, and you will never catch up to them ever.

790
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,018
Scott: There's no chance.

791
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,980
Scott: And all you're doing is you're discovering and not actually inventing.

792
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,201
Rym: Yup.

793
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:13,719
Rym: And also, simultaneously there, the idea that if secular, there's definitely this vibe that if secular, pragmatic uses of technology are brought about, nuclear war is inevitable again.

794
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:15,477
Rym: There's no way around that.

795
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,915
Rym: That's definitely heavily implied by the way the book is put together.

796
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:30,780
Rym: Though, the third chapter felt really rambly, like the section about whether or not to let the woman commit suicide.

797
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:31,123
Scott: Right.

798
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:32,137
Scott: I mean, like, half--.

799
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,940
Rym: It really zoomed in on that for a long time.

800
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:42,540
Scott: So that third part is like 50% nuclear war, and 50% let's talk about abortion and euthanasia.

801
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,899
Scott: And it's like, what?

802
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:46,980
Scott: Was he trying to tie them together?

803
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,700
Scott: Because he really didn't tie them together at all.

804
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,080
Scott: They were just sort of like two separate topics.

805
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,000
Rym: The best way I could tie them together, this is kind of--.

806
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,320
Scott: Does he want to say that God is punishing everyone with nuclear war?

807
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:57,685
Rym: No, no, no.

808
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,700
Rym: This is kind of a stretch.

809
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:18,800
Rym: So here's the way, if I were in high school, and I had to write a paper on this book, what I would say is that the woman deciding whether or not to euthanize herself and her child is basically an allegory for society, because the woman knows she will die horribly.

810
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:23,580
Rym: Society knows if it continues, it will nuke itself.

811
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:35,860
Rym: Her choice is to stop the cycle and not exist, or accept her fate and die by the nuclear flame, knowing that society will be rewarded.

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,099
Rym: That's where the analogy starts to break down already, because her kid won't survive if she does that.

813
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,380
Rym: But at the same time, if everybody committed suicide, there'd never be another nuclear war.

814
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,959
Rym: If society did not advance, if the second chapter didn't happen, you can never have a nuclear war.

815
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,440
Rym: But it's hard to say what the author was advocating.

816
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,359
Scott: Well, he's definitely advocating against nuclear war.

817
00:41:58,045 --> 00:41:59,820
Scott: I don't think anyone's advocating for nuclear war.

818
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,840
Rym: But was he pro- or anti-euthanasia, the author?

819
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,839
Rym: Because the character, the priest, was against it.

820
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:07,999
Scott: And the priest stayed against it.

821
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,819
Scott: It wasn't one of those obvious ones where the priest sees the light at the end.

822
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,880
Rym: And also, the whole thing was futile at that point anyway.

823
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:22,560
Rym: And the priest was not portrayed terribly sympathetically in the book.

824
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,220
Rym: He's kind of portrayed as this old, crufty priest.

825
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:36,079
Scott: Well, the first thing they say in that third chapter is, "Yeah, this abbot was quick to action and didn't sit around thinking about things for a long

826
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:36,280
Scott: time.".

827
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:43,000
Scott: And the other ones in the first two chapters were the kind of person who would think, and is very impulsive and whatnot.

828
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,720
Scott: And then you see him exhibiting those characteristics.

829
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,640
Rym: Him and the church are kind of portrayed as adding to the suffering here.

830
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:52,939
Rym: The book is very ambivalent on the issue.

831
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:54,879
Rym: At least as far as I could read.

832
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,719
Rym: Again, this is going from- I read this a long time ago.

833
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,114
Scott: But also, at the same time, they're the ones who are saving, I guess, whatever.

834
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:17,100
Scott: But what I find interesting is that- So, in the very first chapter, they're all about protecting the memorabilia, the things from the first civilization that are so important.

835
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,360
Rym: Because they know that one day they'll be able to figure out what they are.

836
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:20,959
Scott: Exactly.

837
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,500
Scott: At the end of the third chapter, they go into space again.

838
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,838
Scott: And what do they bring with them?

839
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
Scott: The shit from the first civilization.

840
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,800
Scott: They didn't bring memorabilia from their own second civilization.

841
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,234
Scott: Right?

842
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:39,195
Scott: The history of the second civilization is just, like, unimportant.

843
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,660
Scott: It's like the first civilization is the one that, I guess, matters.

844
00:43:47,163 --> 00:43:49,800
Scott: Anything that happened in the second one, they couldn't even remember.

845
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:57,699
Scott: They had all this history of the first civilization, but you see him lying there at the end, and he's got a bone with an arrow in it.

846
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,059
Scott: It's clearly- we know who that is.

847
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,260
Rym: What's his name from the first book?

848
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,580
Scott: Right, but they don't have their own history down.

849
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,500
Scott: They didn't record any of their own history.

850
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,800
Scott: They were so obsessed with the history of that first civilization.

851
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,540
Rym: Well, that's where this book gets complicated.

852
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:20,980
Rym: Because there's a way to read this, I think, where if you look at the second chapter and really think about it, the church's preservation of the previous era was irrelevant.

853
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,340
Rym: Those smart people were discovering these things and inventing them.

854
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,120
Rym: The only reason they couldn't invent new things is because the knowledge already existed.

855
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,680
Rym: But look at how far they'd gotten before they got access to that memorabilia.

856
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:41,399
Scott: Yeah, that guy was on the verge of lightbulb, and they only barely beat him to the punch on lightbulb because they had the memorabilia.

857
00:44:41,683 --> 00:44:42,860
Scott: It was barely helpful.

858
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,040
Rym: Whether or not it's intentional, this book is arguing that the preservation aspect of the church is irrelevant.

859
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,716
Scott: As long as you preserved humans, right?

860
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,600
Scott: And they can live and have resources.

861
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,452
Scott: They're going to figure out the same things humans figured out again with just enough time.

862
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:09,040
Rym: I don't know if the author intended this to be read this way, but it's very easy to interpret this book as though- Doesn't matter what the author intended, right?

863
00:45:09,564 --> 00:45:11,540
Rym: I think this is the one case where it does.

864
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:24,640
Rym: Not the one case, but the reason I think it matters is that the book is obviously the author exploring these ideas at a time when the world is literally actually dealing with these ideas.

865
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,741
Scott: Right.

866
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:29,760
Scott: If we were in the '60s, this book would be a completely different read if we read it when it was written.

867
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:31,867
Scott: Yes, because in the '60s- What is this book?

868
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:32,714
Scott: We don't care about the '60s.

869
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,268
Scott: We care about today.

870
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:35,499
Scott: We don't care about then.

871
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:37,118
Scott: Then doesn't matter to us.

872
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,032
Scott: We're reading this book.

873
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:39,760
Scott: We're alive today.

874
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:41,140
Scott: That's what is important.

875
00:45:41,562 --> 00:45:44,640
Rym: Yeah, but also, I was reading his history.

876
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,716
Rym: He converted to Catholicism after the war.

877
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:59,120
Rym: I think he was a tail gunner and a radio man in bombers, and he bombed a Catholic church as part of his duties being a bomber.

878
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,160
Rym: Some other guy said- That's definitely irrelevant.

879
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,500
Rym: That he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

880
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:06,451
Scott: Makes sense.

881
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:06,957
Scott: I would too.

882
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:19,020
Rym: This is a man who saw the horrors of war, perpetuated them, not saying the war was bad or unjustified, but saying that he was a bomber.

883
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:19,876
Rym: That's what he did.

884
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:26,359
Rym: He lived in the shadow of nuclear annihilation, and he wrote a book about it.

885
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:32,360
Rym: You cannot read this book, but in the context of the world at that time.

886
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:32,778
Scott: Sure.

887
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:46,180
Rym: Because a lot of the stuff in the third chapter, there's a lot of terminology that I think would not be recognized by kids today because kids today don't really think about nuclear war the way that our parents thought about it.

888
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,999
Scott: Isn't that a good thing?

889
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:48,859
Rym: I think it is definitely a good thing.

890
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:57,640
Rym: I feel like human society got to at least one major precipice, and we all collectively said, "Okay, guys, let's just back up a little

891
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:57,720
Rym: bit.".

892
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,959
Scott: Actually, I read something recently.

893
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,980
Scott: The US was going to basically dismantle a bunch of nukes like we do because we don't really need them.

894
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,343
Rym: And we didn't.

895
00:47:03,444 --> 00:47:04,699
Rym: in case we have to blow up an asteroid.

896
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,559
Scott: But you know what?

897
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,080
Scott: I'm sure some nut out there is going to be like, "Oh, see?

898
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:11,738
Scott: They're just making up excuses to keep a bunch of nukes

899
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:11,980
Scott: around.".

900
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,099
Scott: But actually, I kind of believe that.

901
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:13,411
Scott: Yeah.

902
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:17,360
Rym: I feel like we should still keep the nukes that we have right now.

903
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,519
Scott: I don't really believe that nukes are definitely going to save us from an asteroid, but what else do we have?

904
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:25,540
Scott: I'd rather shoot them and try than just sit there and get hit by an asteroid.

905
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,560
Rym: I still think we need to keep them from a complicated geopolitical game theory perspective.

906
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:31,131
Scott: Maybe.

907
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:31,375
Scott: Sure.

908
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:31,640
Scott: Whatever.

909
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,060
Rym: That's a separate discussion.

910
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:34,059
Rym: But think about it.

911
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:46,660
Rym: We just read a book on the horrors of nuclear war and the inevitability of nuclear war so long as humans make nukes, yet I still feel like we should not destroy all the nukes we have because I don't trust everybody.

912
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:54,799
Scott: Anyway, so the one thing in this book that really kind of -- I had no idea what it was there for, but it was fun -- is the poet guy.

913
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:55,859
Rym: That poet guy.

914
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,520
Scott: That poet guy is kind of awesome.

915
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,000
Rym: He reminded me of the poet in Hyperion.

916
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:00,465
Rym: He did.

917
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:04,298
Scott: We all felt like the Hyperion poet, and he felt like a little bit of choose goose going on.

918
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:06,360
Scott: I can see that.

919
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,360
Scott: A little bit of choose goose.

920
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,280
Rym: I can totally see that.

921
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,920
Scott: I was kind of into him as a character.

922
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,660
Scott: He was all cool and, you know, whatever.

923
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:22,020
Scott: But at the same time, I couldn't understand what his meaning was to anything whatsoever, and then they bring him up again in the third chapter as sort of another one of those.

924
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:27,660
Scott: they don't know their own history, they don't remember who the poet was, you know, the poet of the eyeball or something.

925
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:30,080
Scott: What is the meaning of the glass eye?

926
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,979
Scott: I have no fucking clue.

927
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:32,498
Scott: I couldn't even guess.

928
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,740
Rym: The eye of knowledge.

929
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,779
Rym: I had a bunch of notes I wrote down, but they don't make sense to me now because I read the book a while ago.

930
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,320
Scott: Right, and is there -- the only thing I could think of was like -- so the poet was sort of like the guy without an eye.

931
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:47,860
Scott: was the sort of poet character of the third chapter, the lady with two heads?

932
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:49,834
Scott: Was that sort of like the --?

933
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,380
Scott: and then who was the poet character of the first chapter?

934
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:52,796
Scott: I don't know.

935
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,939
Rym: Well, the lady with two heads and the quote "miracle" there was interesting because -- That could have easily been a hallucination, too.

936
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:00,430
Scott: Yes.

937
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:06,260
Scott: I was half -- you know, going on the hallucination -- or he was already in some sort of afterlife seeing that shit.

938
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,420
Rym: So let's go yet again to reading this book in a particular way.

939
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:22,020
Rym: So we have -- you know, Leibowitz becomes a saint, and there's this mythology around his life and his wife and all those things based on incomplete knowledge.

940
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:26,200
Rym: There's the skull of the guy who got shot with the arrow.

941
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:27,680
Rym: There's all these legends -- the eye.

942
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:45,120
Rym: The fact that the eye thing was, from a literal reading, a totally just generic -- you know, the guy just had the eye, and the famous guy tried to give it back to him and couldn't, and you can see how later there became a mythology around this completely mundane and kind of humorous event.

943
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:52,119
Rym: A mundane and humorous event became a for real serious mythology once enough time had passed.

944
00:49:53,542 --> 00:50:17,019
Rym: So the miracles of the Bible and all the times before these books even take place could easily be misinterpretations and failings of human memory from mundane events of that era, and him seeing that vision at the end could just be him hallucinating or interpreting something in a way that would make sense in light of his mythology.

945
00:50:18,904 --> 00:50:24,720
Rym: There's a lot of ways to read this book that basically really put down religion, the church, and preservationism.

946
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,460
Scott: For someone who converted to a Catholic.

947
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:34,700
Rym: But even though on a surface level, I think people who read this book and don't think about it too much would say it says the exact opposite.

948
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,980
Scott: A deeper read -- it's almost like -- I almost feel like -- You can read it either way, and maybe that was intentional, right?

949
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:54,900
Scott: Whether you're Catholic or not or anything else, religious or non, you'll read it and you can basically feel like it was telling you that you're right, but it's always telling you you're right, nukes are bad.

950
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:02,120
Rym: Yep, I found some essays where people very passionately argued opposite positions on whether or not the book was pro or anti-euthanasia.

951
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,160
Rym: I think Luke Burge even posted some of that stuff.

952
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,958
Rym: That's why I was reading it.

953
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:13,020
Scott: But either way, it makes you think about it, and it presents pretty much all the arguments both ways.

954
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,439
Rym: May I present a crazy idea?

955
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:21,580
Scott: It presents religious arguments a lot, but it presents secular arguments in both directions as well.

956
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,600
Rym: I wonder if Miller, writing this book -- Didn't have a firm conviction himself?

957
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:38,080
Rym: Or even if he thought he did, in actually exploring the idea, he went from optimistic to cynical in every chapter.

958
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:47,159
Rym: That him writing, he started to see the flaws in the optimistic or religious arguments, and then started undermining them either consciously or not.

959
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,300
Rym: Also, a note here about his life that might be relevant.

960
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,519
Scott: It's going to be.

961
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:58,580
Rym: After the success of Mechanical for Leibovitz, Miller never published another novel or story in his lifetime.

962
00:51:58,947 --> 00:51:59,198
Scott: Okay.

963
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,320
Scott: In Miller's later years -- How successful was it when he wrote it?

964
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,197
Scott: Really successful.

965
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:03,569
Scott: Okay.

966
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,379
Rym: He became a recluse, avoided his family, lived alone, never talked to his literary agent, never let him meet him.

967
00:52:10,904 --> 00:52:12,100
Scott: He was protecting the memorabilia.

968
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:20,639
Rym: Struggled with depression, wrote a 600-page manuscript as a sequel to Mechanical for Leibovitz, and then took his own life with a gun.

969
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:21,660
Scott: Where's the manuscript?

970
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,040
Rym: In 1996.

971
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,148
Rym: The sequel, St.

972
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:29,761
Rym: Leibovitz and the Wild Horsewoman, was completed and published in 1997.

973
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:29,903
Scott: Oh.

974
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:31,080
Scott: We should read the sequel.

975
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:31,887
Scott: No, we shouldn't.

976
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:32,497
Scott: It's 600 pages.

977
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:41,400
Rym: Set 80 years after the events of the second part, so it takes place between the second and third part, so I feel like this is gonna be a fall of Hyperion.

978
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,294
Scott: I feel like there's no reason to read 600 pages.

979
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,236
Rym: Yeah, it's all about Texark stuff.

980
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:50,820
Scott: That are written by a guy who is a crazy hermit in the woods.

981
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:57,300
Rym: This looks like pulpy drama rather than serious exploration of nuclear holocaust.

982
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,080
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you sort of had that sort of, you know, that Texarkana.

983
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:04,319
Scott: That really felt more like a fallout.

984
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,500
Scott: Like, you could see hints of that coming in, the plot of a fallout kind of world.

985
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,159
Scott: When they were talking about the different bandit groups out there.

986
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:26,300
Scott: There was this other universe where fallout kind of stuff was happening, but it was far away, and it only barely interacted with the characters of any of these chapters.

987
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:33,660
Rym: So, I'm glad I read it, because it's such a precursor work to a lot of other things.

988
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:37,079
Rym: I don't know if I enjoyed it that much.

989
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:41,019
Scott: I mean, it didn't just take me a long time to read, because it was summertime.

990
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:47,260
Scott: It's because any time I was sitting there, and there was a list of media to consume, it did not rank highly at any given moment.

991
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,399
Scott: I mean, once I actually started, the first chapter went by pretty quickly.

992
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,839
Scott: Then I didn't start the second one.

993
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:03,100
Scott: And I feel actually the fact that it was split into chapters also sort of delayed the reading, because once I finished a chapter, it's like I didn't want to start the next one.

994
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,039
Scott: But once I started one, I was able to go through it.

995
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,059
Rym: But then again, look at books that are written, like The Prince of Nothing is an example.

996
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,979
Rym: A lot of times, they're reading a chapter that follows a character, and I'm really invested in that.

997
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:15,840
Rym: And then the chapter ends, and the next chapter is about a character I don't care about.

998
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,279
Scott: Yeah, that's a good time I'll stop.

999
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,840
Rym: But, if I read more than one paragraph of that next page, Oh, forget it.

1000
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,599
Rym: Now I'm invested.

1001
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,640
Scott: And then, if you finish that chapter, it goes back to the other character.

1002
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,797
Rym: And then you're like, "Oh shit, Ryan, I wonder what Kellis is up

1003
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:27,918
Rym: to.".

1004
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:28,333
Scott: Yeah.

1005
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:31,380
Scott: But this is completely different.

1006
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:40,400
Scott: It's like three stories in one that are barely, they're not barely related, but it's not like you're skipping around different characters at the same point in the same story.

1007
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:43,998
Scott: It's really three short stories in the same universe with a tiny thread connecting them.

1008
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,359
Scott: And each one makes a lot of subtle and disparate points.

1009
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,200
Rym: I like Robotechs.

1010
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,880
Rym: Well, look at when the guy, I keep thinking, it's maybe not Catterley, but I was thinking of him as Catterley, the smart dumb monk in the beginning.

1011
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:55,459
Scott: Oh, I forget.

1012
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,540
Rym: You don't remember his name either.

1013
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,540
Scott: I don't remember names from people in books.

1014
00:54:58,601 --> 00:54:59,599
Rym: He's surviving the war.

1015
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,839
Rym: Albertian order of Leibovitz.

1016
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,540
Rym: What's the guy's fucking name, Wikipedia?

1017
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,700
Rym: What's the guy's fucking name?

1018
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,620
Rym: Doesn't say whatever.

1019
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,359
Scott: I can just look through the book here, but it's an e-book, so it's kind of hard.

1020
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:19,020
Rym: So, reading the book from, just reading that first section, there's a bit about how he goes to the pope.

1021
00:55:20,203 --> 00:55:20,839
Scott: Oh, yep, yep.

1022
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:36,860
Rym: And that long section about how overwhelming the experience of being in that place is and how different it is from the monastery and how it overwhelms the senses and it's so large and powerful and thick with portents.

1023
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,999
Scott: But at the same time, it's sort of run down.

1024
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:46,100
Rym: Yeah, but then after he's not overwhelmed by it anymore and he talks to the pope, he realizes that it's not any different.

1025
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,739
Rym: It's just more worldly.

1026
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,339
Rym: Everything's run down.

1027
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:56,980
Rym: The symbols are more powerful than the reality and the idea that that's why people are hustled in and out.

1028
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:05,879
Rym: The church has all this symbolic power, but no real power, but the symbolic power works unless you let people hang around too long or look too closely.

1029
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:17,880
Rym: It also has the whole bit about, not iconoclasm, but the book-leggers trying to save knowledge from the fact that when the apocalypse happens, there's a lot of survivors.

1030
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:25,397
Rym: It's a much more realistic nuclear war than most stories and the survivors destroy all knowledge because fuck those guys.

1031
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:30,119
Rym: And that whole section has a lot of interesting ideas, but again, they're all over the place.

1032
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,760
Rym: The rampaging mobs who call themselves simpletons, it's a lot like the Luddites.

1033
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,340
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's in a way, right?

1034
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,700
Scott: The book is, again, you can find things in this book to support.

1035
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:45,157
Scott: Whoever wrote this book was a Luddite.

1036
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,000
Scott: He wanted anti-technology.

1037
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,660
Scott: You could also say the opposite.

1038
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:52,960
Scott: He shows how awesome all that technology is in the third chapter, except nukes.

1039
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,480
Rym: He was a sad, disturbed, complicated person.

1040
00:56:55,881 --> 00:57:02,880
Rym: Who had a complicated, evolving view of what all these things meant.

1041
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,419
Rym: And this book is him exploring these ideas.

1042
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:06,839
Rym: And that's all it is.

1043
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,820
Rym: It's him exploring the ideas.

1044
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,040
Rym: The book, the chapters don't end with like, "Oh, that is what I should think.

1045
00:57:13,344 --> 00:57:13,854
Rym: That is the

1046
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:14,140
Rym: moral.".

1047
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,988
Rym: The book ends with, "Wow, that's a lot of ideas and things are

1048
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:18,633
Rym: complicated.".

1049
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:21,000
Rym: So I guess I like it on that front.

1050
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:24,939
Rym: It's a lot like trying to interpret the man who was Thursday.

1051
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,091
Scott: Yeah.

1052
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:27,620
Rym: In that regard.

1053
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,559
Scott: Only a lot less action.

1054
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:35,960
Rym: Though at the same time, the action in The Man Who Was Thursday was largely incomprehensible, but that's just an artifact of the writing.

1055
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:37,877
Rym: Thaddio.

1056
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:38,936
Rym: That's the cool guy.

1057
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,557
Rym: Thon Thaddio.

1058
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:41,733
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1059
00:57:42,162 --> 00:57:42,919
Rym: I like Thon Thaddio.

1060
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:43,777
Scott: That's a good name, too.

1061
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:52,260
Rym: I like how Thon Thaddio was, he realized the danger of what he was doing, but he did it anyway, but he tried to be honorable.

1062
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:54,180
Rym: He's just a fun character.

1063
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:54,929
Rym: I liked him.

1064
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:56,760
Scott: All right.

1065
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,479
Scott: Is there anything else to say about this book?

1066
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,217
Scott: I don't think so.

1067
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,800
Scott: It's relatively short, actually.

1068
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,316
Scott: I shouldn't have taken that long to read it if I actually tried.

1069
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,199
Scott: I mean, once I started reading the third chapter, it took literally like a day.

1070
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,519
Scott: Not even, like a couple hours.

1071
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:12,840
Scott: So you could probably read the book in eight hours total.

1072
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,820
Rym: Yep, easily.

1073
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,510
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1074
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:27,610
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1075
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:33,010
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1076
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,970
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1077
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,689
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
