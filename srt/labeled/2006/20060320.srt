1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,578
Rym: It's Monday March 20th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,880
Rym: tonight We talk about how to put a computer in your living room attached to your television.

3
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:18,797
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:26,220
Scott: So I've been getting a lot of emails and messages of various sorts of people saying I heard this separate feeds for each day.

5
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:31,340
Scott: How do I how do I you listen to just one day of GeekNights instead of all four days?

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,580
Rym: Now people on iTunes have already seemed to have found these on their own Because they're listed and there's about 20 subscribers to each already.

7
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:43,194
Scott: Yeah, if you go to iTunes or Yahoo podcast you can see there will be the.

8
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,260
Scott: there'll be like five different entries.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,074
Rym: If you search for GeekNights actually scratch Yahoo podcasts, they've got issues.

10
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,940
Scott: Yeah, but it's the feeds are still there.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,326
Rym: You know, they disappeared again randomly.

12
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:59,320
Rym: what Yahoo podcasts has problems with GeekNights, and I don't know why.

13
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:09,080
Rym: Sometimes it'll show us normally, you know It says we have 30 Yahoo subscribers and we have you know 70-whatever episodes and we have one feed or five feeds or four feeds.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,677
Rym: Sometimes it says we have like three subscribers and like 12 episodes.

15
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:24,756
Scott: Oh, yeah Look, there's only one feed there now with eight subscribers and yeah Yeah, Yahoo doesn't understand us or Yahoo's weird.

16
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:25,660
Rym: I don't know I've given up.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,949
Rym: I made that thread away back when I was trying to figure it out.

18
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:28,471
Rym: I gave up.

19
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:30,540
Rym: Yahoo podcast is just kind of broken.

20
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,752
Scott: Yeah yesterday I saw all four feeds there.

21
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,214
Scott: whatever.

22
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,188
Rym: it's not just us either It's it's a lot of podcasts.

23
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,480
Rym: just move up and down and left and right and the tags changed.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,916
Rym: I just don't think Yahoo knows what they're doing.

25
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:44,073
Rym: Obviously not because I don't think they monitor it.

26
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:45,600
Rym: I think they just let computers do it.

27
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:47,439
Scott: I think the computer is coded poorly.

28
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:55,640
Scott: Anyway, if you go to iTunes You'll see if you search for GeekNights in the podcast section of the store You'll see like four or five different GeekNights choices.

29
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,660
Scott: One of them is normal GeekNights in which you will get every single episode.

30
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,934
Rym: We're not gonna call that GeekNights full or anything because that should be the default.

31
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,097
Scott: It's total GeekNights.

32
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,632
Rym: Just like Well, that means there's an ultra GeekNights out there somewhere.

33
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:10,876
Rym: you get an episode on Friday.

34
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:14,134
Scott: Ooh It's just Rym farting into the microphone.

35
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,140
Rym: actually, you know what?

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,070
Rym: Yeah, you can get ultra GeekNights right now for a hundred dollars a year.

37
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:22,560
Rym: You will get access to ultra GeekNights.

38
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,600
Scott: Yeah, we have this fifth episodes that we've been making every Friday and keeping secret and yeah.

39
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,207
Scott: So no one had access to them.

40
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,112
Rym: one dude has been getting access.

41
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,763
Scott: one dude one dude, who's that one, dude I don't know.

42
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,993
Rym: I couldn't think of any funny name to say in the interim.

43
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:42,256
Rym: Okay, see He's totally unscripted.

44
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:42,780
Scott: Yeah.

45
00:02:43,101 --> 00:03:01,039
Scott: So anyway, if you want to get if you're the kind of guy who wants to listen to you as Monday just Tuesday Just Wednesday just Thursday You can go now to front row crew calm and I made a giant blog post and on the right side in the feed section There are now six feeds.

46
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:08,104
Scott: There's the raw blog feed which isn't actually a podcast feed even though I guess you could use it as one even though you probably Don't want to know.

47
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:08,505
Rym: you don't.

48
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,110
Rym: the enclosures aren't there or anything.

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,574
Scott: Well, yeah, they are actually are.

50
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:16,249
Scott: yeah, but it's not formatted for Like quality with the titles and everything.

51
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,876
Rym: Oh, yeah, so it won't have any of the feed burner stuff in it.

52
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,542
Scott: Yeah, but It'll.

53
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:25,960
Scott: you'll get every single post to front row crew calm whether it's a podcast or not.

54
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:30,608
Scott: So if you want to like keep track of when we put news items there That's probably a good feed.

55
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,380
Scott: you want to throw in your Firefox or something?

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,086
Scott: The rest of the feeds are all podcast feeds.

57
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:39,840
Scott: The first one is every episode then it's just Monday just Tuesday just Wednesday and just Thursday.

58
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:45,932
Scott: So if you're using podcasting stuff You have to change what feed you want.

59
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:56,959
Scott: and I'm gonna say this Probably every day this week because in case someone is listening to just one day Yeah, because there's a surprising number of people found these feeds before we really advertise them.

60
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:57,700
Rym: Yeah.

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,490
Rym: So if you're one of those people who found GeekNights and you think it's awesome and you wish it was more than one day A week today is your lucky day.

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,918
Scott: and if you're someone who?

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,040
Scott: Listen to GeekNights four days a week, but would really only want to listen to one day a week.

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,274
Scott: Well, you can do that too now.

65
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:22,860
Rym: Well, I will recommend not for any self-serving interest because I don't care how many people listen to Thursdays But GeekNights Thursdays are actually usually fairly interesting and we always get the most feedback from those days

66
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,403
Scott: Though really at

67
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,075
Rym: least the feedback from the people who I am me all the time.

68
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,871
Scott: Yeah Which is like the same two or three people over and over again?

69
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:31,213
Rym: Yeah.

70
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,720
Rym: Yeah, but no one else has anything.

71
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:34,365
Scott: That means they're perfectly.

72
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:35,187
Scott: Oh, all right.

73
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:38,217
Scott: Let me while I'm remembering we have a forum.

74
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,280
Scott: It's happened.

75
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,919
Rym: Yeah, it's hopping in a way that pleases me to no end.

76
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:49,769
Scott: Yes, so go to front row crew calm and Join the forum and say stuff there.

77
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,274
Scott: Don't just like poke around and look.

78
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,800
Scott: I can tell you lurkers are out there.

79
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,753
Rym: Yeah, we can see everything all of you do.

80
00:04:55,774 --> 00:05:02,113
Scott: Aha No, I don't do that, oh and there's a frapper map.

81
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:03,116
Scott: it's on the right side.

82
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,440
Scott: there's a link in the Scott's link.

83
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,570
Rym: Yeah, you might have remembered it.

84
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:06,560
Rym: I think it was two weeks ago.

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,240
Rym: We rediscovered the frapper map that we had made and forgotten about and there were a bunch of people in it.

86
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:14,360
Scott: It's just a little map and you put a pushpin where you are.

87
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,220
Scott: So that way anyone can look at the map and say oh look where the GeekNights listeners are around the world.

88
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:18,731
Scott: There's one.

89
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:19,059
Scott: there's one.

90
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,415
Rym: I'll tell you one thing for all of you out there if you zoom way out You'll notice that there's pins in many other countries by many.

91
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:26,138
Rym: I mean three.

92
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,258
Scott: Do you have any Canadians yet?

93
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,078
Rym: Actually, I don't remember.

94
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:39,963
Scott: I haven't looked at it in a while me either but people go there and put your pushpins in and I think we should say This stuff.

95
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,379
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna keep reminding people all week.

96
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,007
Scott: It's a reminders week here on GeekNights.

97
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,291
Rym: That's a great week.

98
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,375
Scott: Yeah, great.

99
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:52,407
Scott: So, you know, they have those little Robot car rover things on Mars, right?

100
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,800
Rym: No, I was completely unaware of these scientific advancements of the previous several years.

101
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:06,820
Scott: Anyway, these guys are like, you know, it's like kind of a flat remote control guy Who's got like three or four wheels on each side and a bunch of scoops and cameras and all that sort of thing.

102
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,540
Scott: Yeah, all kinds of little scientific lab equipments for testing soil and a camera.

103
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,679
Scott: Yeah, the top is all solar panels to fill the battery up.

104
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:22,939
Rym: Well, it hasn't been in the mainstream news much lately because you know people seem to immediately stop caring about space Like the second after anything is announced about it.

105
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,977
Scott: Well because the only part of space people like is the giant rockets and then once the Rockets put a satellite in space No one cares about the satellite going around space anymore.

106
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:31,400
Scott: Who cares?

107
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,390
Scott: Anyway One of the they were supposed to last.

108
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,040
Scott: what like six months or something like that?

109
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,250
Rym: not too long and they're still going.

110
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,719
Scott: because well, they're freaking crazy and it's been like the most bang for the buck of any space mission ever probably.

111
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,334
Scott: and What happened recently?

112
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:49,597
Scott: is it?

113
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,684
Scott: Almost was the end.

114
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:55,600
Scott: like if it was the end it would have been crazy like when that jeopardy guy finally lost.

115
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:57,497
Scott: That's what it would have been like, you know.

116
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:01,020
Scott: But actually what happened was one of the wheels broke.

117
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:07,759
Scott: So you have this thing that had like eight wheels and now it has seven But it still has enough power.

118
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:14,586
Scott: So what they're doing is they're having it drive up this little hill or kind of a big hill I don't even know I didn't see a picture.

119
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,399
Scott: and it's gonna drag this dead wheel along And recharge the solar cell at the top of the hill and keep going.

120
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,807
Scott: It's just unbelievable.

121
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,395
Rym: I think it's really cool.

122
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:36,358
Rym: Just the ingenuity here It's like, you know, if any of you aren't familiar with the space program if you ever seen I don't know Apollo 13 Kind of or read anything about the Russian space program Well the Russians yeah.

123
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:41,475
Rym: Just the things that they'll do Because it's not like there's a procedure for everything that goes wrong.

124
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:46,460
Rym: almost every problem The space program has ever run into was a new problem like new to humanity

125
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:53,868
Scott: Because they think about most of the problems that have like quadruple redundant, you know backups so that those problems never happen You know,

126
00:07:54,251 --> 00:08:00,004
Rym: so when there is a problem They have engineers who have to figure out how to fix it based on what's up They're like right now.

127
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:04,200
Scott: because if there's a problem that means it's obviously something you didn't think of beforehand.

128
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,369
Rym: Yeah, I went to space camp when I was a kid.

129
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,779
Scott: So yeah, that's pretty much the job of space.

130
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,659
Scott: People is think of stuff beforehand.

131
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:20,239
Rym: Unless you are that that kid who was appointed to the head of NASA by Bush then your job is suppress research.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,480
Scott: Ah That's that's a much less pleasant job Probably but at least lives aren't on the line in that job.

133
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:32,491
Scott: No, not so much so you wouldn't feel guilty if you failed to find a way to.

134
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:34,619
Scott: you know duct tape the space helmet or something.

135
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:45,660
Rym: Now in other tech news much more computer tech Delicious, which we all know and love and use, you know, the web 2.0 is bookmark II thing online.

136
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,040
Rym: If you don't know what delicious is there's a link anyway.

137
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:56,300
Rym: They have now added private bookmarking meaning you can add a site to your delicious and flag it so no one else can see it.

138
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:05,460
Scott: This is something that I you know thought of quite a while ago and a lot of other people are clamoring for it But the only real use that I can see for it is number one.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,718
Scott: I could bookmark like my bank or like my credit card and no one else can see it Which is which is good.

140
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:18,890
Scott: Now the other thing is I could keep track of all sorts of porn links in there and no one else Would see that I was hoarding porn links.

141
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,240
Rym: now both of those are very good and valid.

142
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:28,027
Rym: But there's one other thing that I don't think Scott even thought of and when I realized this because it's a problem I've always had with delicious.

143
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:45,860
Rym: if you work at a company Where you have a large company where you have an internal intranet like IBM where I work currently we have our own internet all on our own with our own web servers and everything inside and It's completely inaccessible to the outside and the links are useless and broken if you try to access them from the outside world.

144
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:58,739
Rym: having those private in my delicious is very useful because There's basically an internal equivalent of Google that I have to use to find things and I have hundreds and hundreds of internal bookmarks that I need to access on a regular basis.

145
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:04,100
Rym: So using delicious I can still as long as I can get to the outside world internet.

146
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:11,932
Rym: I can use delicious to find those things in IBM And I mean a lot of other companies have similar infrastructure.

147
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,460
Scott: So isn't it great that you're not gonna be at IBM so much longer?

148
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,872
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

149
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:23,499
Scott: like my company We have some internal web servers But I write the web things that are on most of them and I only use like two of them.

150
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,830
Scott: Yeah, well, I want that I'm making and the one that I just made.

151
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,500
Rym: so yeah, I wish I could talk more.

152
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,415
Rym: There's a lot of other IBM news today actually, but it's not stuff that's been released yet.

153
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:35,960
Rym: All I can say is that god damn it.

154
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:41,463
Scott: Mm-hmm Big blue evil.

155
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:50,514
Rym: no, no, no, not evil definitely not evil, but I will say this IBM is doing fine compared to Sony.

156
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,097
Rym: Yeah

157
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:56,598
Scott: I'm doing fine compared to Sony profitable despite debt

158
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:10,517
Rym: alright, so I got one more news here because we might go a little short on the tail end of the show, but Microsoft supposedly this seems to be more rumor than truth currently is Going to make an iPod killer.

159
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,970
Rym: Now they didn't just say iPod in this rumor.

160
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:14,853
Rym: It's what was.

161
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:19,827
Rym: it was an iPod DS PSP Camera blood killer.

162
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:23,639
Rym: It'll kill every small consumer electronics product that's out there.

163
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,687
Scott: Now I have two feelings on this number.

164
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,411
Rym: one lie blatant lie.

165
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:33,905
Scott: Well, no if you look right I realized recently I've been looking for a phone Replacement.

166
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:36,119
Scott: right and I want to get right.

167
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,220
Scott: now I have a blackberry and a phone and I want to combine them into one device.

168
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,650
Scott: The blackberry is a phone but there's a long story.

169
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,160
Scott: I can't actually get phone service on it and whatever.

170
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:53,732
Scott: so the really the only good option these days at least in America is HTC wizard HTC Apache HTC whatever.

171
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,780
Scott: These are all Windows mobile devices.

172
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,764
Scott: Microsoft doesn't make them.

173
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:02,158
Scott: Microsoft just develop the technology and licenses it to other people.

174
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:15,900
Scott: So basically, I think Microsoft is doing is they're gonna develop some sort of technology that Will like an OS or something that will be iPod PSP whatever killer.

175
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:22,059
Scott: But it'll be up to other companies to pay Microsoft to license it and then attempt to profit off of it.

176
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,006
Scott: Microsoft profits no matter what.

177
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,935
Scott: if at least one person tries to use it Microsoft profits.

178
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,500
Rym: Microsoft seems to do that often.

179
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,068
Rym: It's definitely the strategy of develop something.

180
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,433
Rym: make money off it no matter what.

181
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:33,617
Rym: let everyone else take the risk.

182
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:40,040
Scott: Yeah, exactly It's like hey, we can you know develop a risky new in you know kind of technology.

183
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,633
Scott: That's never been done before and then if it fails, it doesn't matter.

184
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,120
Scott: We still make out now.

185
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,169
Rym: I've seen some other ideas as to what this could be.

186
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:57,071
Rym: some people seem to be suggesting that Microsoft Leaked this rumor on purpose in order to convince the market that they're competing in a market that they're not actually competing it.

187
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:07,188
Rym: Okay, maybe if they're gonna release a handheld device a year from now They start making the buzz now and then they announce it, you know a year from now Who knows?

188
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,320
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

189
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:09,725
Scott: Is it SanDisk?

190
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:10,648
Scott: SanDisk?

191
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,940
Scott: the people who make like the little flash chips for your cameras and stuff?

192
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,657
Scott: Yeah, that's probably the only product you buy with their name on it.

193
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:27,280
Scott: They're actually competing pretty well in the mp3 player market Because they have all that flash storage production capability.

194
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:35,300
Scott: I think they actually make like the cheapest like space per dollar Flash player on the market, huh?

195
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,780
Scott: and they say that they're gonna start eating away at Apple's market share and everyone's kind of like.

196
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:41,305
Scott: I think you're.

197
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:45,360
Scott: you know, it seems like they're saying they're doing a lot better than they are like they're lying.

198
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,430
Scott: But at the same time who know?

199
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:48,194
Scott: it's kind of weird.

200
00:13:48,697 --> 00:14:05,739
Rym: now the other Observation I have and this is more me than what other people have been saying but I'll just note that an mp3 player uses processing power and thus uses batteries a Camera uses batteries independently of that and all these other little bits use battery power.

201
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,151
Rym: Having a device that does everything will require a monster battery.

202
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:15,145
Scott: Not really because it only does any one thing at one time Yeah, but even then think about it.

203
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:20,325
Rym: most people listen mp3 is pretty much constantly and then they still expect to be able to make A call and play games.

204
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:24,440
Rym: a lot of people I know at least would listen to an iPod while they play their DS.

205
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,936
Rym: I just don't think the device that Microsoft wants to make is feasible in a way.

206
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:29,900
Rym: That would be affordable?

207
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,166
Scott: No, no, no, it could be done.

208
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:35,600
Rym: If you spend a million bucks, you could make a perfect little piece of technology.

209
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,087
Scott: No one says it'll be cheap.

210
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,704
Scott: They didn't say we're gonna make it cheap, but if it's GSP SP It's cheap.

211
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:46,019
Rym: It's not a killer because it doesn't compete with that product Just how the PSP doesn't compete with the DS anymore.

212
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:48,593
Scott: Well, the PSP doesn't have games.

213
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:53,119
Scott: That could be why it doesn't Do it the price.

214
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:06,560
Rym: so my thing of the day I Chose it and something I found a long time ago and I had meant to make it a thing of the day.

215
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,044
Rym: I just never did for various reasons.

216
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:13,160
Rym: I mean better things kept coming up, but it's basically I'm throwing it as a bone.

217
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:20,604
Rym: To all the people arguing about religion in the forums and one I just like to say that I'm very pleased that everyone is arguing About religion in the forums.

218
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,451
Scott: Everyone loves a good religion argument.

219
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,680
Rym: I've been not just an argument a flame war.

220
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:34,196
Rym: I was hoping for some sort of epic flame war to kind of break the forums in and we finally have a topic where enough People are strongly opinionated enough on to where you guys are arguing.

221
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:34,959
Rym: I'm real happy.

222
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,847
Scott: Let's start some more flame wars in that forum.

223
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,155
Scott: All right more people new people though.

224
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,519
Rym: Here's some fodder for the flame war.

225
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:48,759
Rym: this is a list of almost every comic book character anyone's ever heard of and their religious affiliations.

226
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,029
Rym: It's got the golem here.

227
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,479
Rym: He was a Jewish obviously.

228
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:56,112
Rym: Superman was a Methodist apparently.

229
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,003
Scott: I Don't know what's up with that.

230
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,706
Scott: He's an alien.

231
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:05,350
Rym: Yeah, my favorite one is there's a superhero called the atheist and It lists his religion as atheist.

232
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:06,715
Scott: Okay, at least it makes sense.

233
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:10,378
Scott: Yeah This doesn't like the atheist secretly.

234
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,562
Scott: Scientologists.

235
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:15,033
Rym: now there are any Scientologists, uh, let me look.

236
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:24,396
Rym: Let me look Actually, there's one Triathlon is a triune understanding which is based on Scientology.

237
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,724
Scott: Oh Okay, so he's a culty.

238
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:27,948
Rym: Yeah, basically.

239
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:28,410
Rym: Mm-hmm.

240
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:35,636
Rym: But anyway, I thought this was interesting and I hope to see some arguments along the lines of Superman belief in God.

241
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:36,038
Rym: Why don't you?

242
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,080
Rym: Yeah, anyway.

243
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,540
Scott: So my thing of the day is this way cool video I found this morning.

244
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:50,120
Scott: Actually, I'm pretty sure this entire website is funny because it seems to have a lot of links to other videos.

245
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:54,063
Scott: some of them are just Family Guy clips and whatever but Whatever.

246
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:55,129
Scott: It's I think it's pimp.

247
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,833
Scott: Panther.

248
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:56,880
Scott: comm is the name of their site.

249
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:10,451
Scott: the funny video that I'm specifically going to link to now is A few guys are playing a video game Up, I started playing it by accident In the video game, they're controlling this giant kind of army dude.

250
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:15,969
Scott: Who's like the main character, I guess and You know in a video game where you can't die.

251
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:25,492
Scott: It's always fun to do silly things like, you know Jump off a building and get up Shoot yourself run into a wall repeatedly.

252
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:25,593
Rym: Yeah,

253
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:44,906
Scott: I remember like in double golden I used to do all kinds of stuff for like the invincible code you'd like jump off of stuff and Shoot thing like stand in the middle of giant explosions of fire and get burnt without dying anyway, they keep doing that sort of thing and then Well, you'll have to see for yourself.

254
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,351
Rym: It's yeah, we can't ruin this one.

255
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,420
Scott: It's got high production values and it's awesome.

256
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:58,919
Rym: All I want to say is the sheer ferocity of the beating and beatdown that ensue is classic more than classic I would say.

257
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:00,991
Scott: What's older than classic?

258
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:01,896
Rym: Uh timeless.

259
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,738
Scott: There you go perhaps even more so.

260
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,079
Rym: antiquities All right, wasn't that an expansion for magic?

261
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,780
Rym: Those antiquities close enough.

262
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:21,632
Rym: Anyway, today is Monday and we're not doing a themed week but it is science and tech day and we have a lot of ideas for shows that we didn't feel like doing any research for.

263
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:29,321
Rym: and we realize that there's one topic that We've actually just embroiled ourselves in yet again Awesome.

264
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:33,095
Rym: it is hooking a computer up to your living room TV.

265
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:45,040
Scott: Ah the living room The place where a computer must go in fact is Quickly becoming the most important place to have a computer much more useful than on the desk.

266
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:50,999
Rym: I mean, honestly, we didn't really have a computer hooked up to our TV until we moved into this big house.

267
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:56,580
Rym: So all through college whenever we wanted to watch something we all huddle around my computer because I had the biggest monitor.

268
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,799
Scott: Or we would like burn a VCD.

269
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,048
Rym: Yeah, those are the highest of quality items.

270
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,194
Scott: then later we would burn a DVD.

271
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:08,147
Rym: by the time we were burning DVDs We were almost moved out.

272
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,380
Scott: Anyway, you're definitely almost moved out by that point.

273
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:16,019
Rym: So at one point when we moved here We were talking about building a nice micro ATX little PC to hook up to the TV.

274
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:19,420
Scott: But it turned out we had enough parts to just make extra computers.

275
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,915
Rym: We have several extra computers many.

276
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:25,289
Rym: if you're a geek You'll eventually accumulate several extra computers.

277
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:31,068
Scott: if you're not accumulating several extra computers as a geek Either a you're getting rid of your computers.

278
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:31,891
Scott: bad move.

279
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:38,087
Scott: Well now again, you're not biting enough new computers If you only have one computer in your house.

280
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:40,274
Scott: buy two more is better.

281
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:44,988
Rym: now, we're not going to talk about myth TV Because while myth TV is awesome.

282
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,595
Rym: We have not yet set it up for reason.

283
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:47,158
Rym: We'll get into.

284
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:53,417
Scott: yeah We're gonna have a whole nother episode about myth TV and perhaps some things from that episode will become entwined.

285
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,195
Scott: and yet a third episode relating to a different topic.

286
00:19:56,518 --> 00:20:02,900
Scott: and Yeah, I want to figure actually get myth TV working before I talk about it, but actually let's talk about what myth TV is though.

287
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:03,345
Rym: All right.

288
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:06,566
Rym: It's basically a you know TiVo Or whatever.

289
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,995
Rym: all the other PVRs are out there.

290
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:08,780
Rym: I forget what they're all called.

291
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:14,692
Rym: Anyway, myth TV is just an open source implementation of something very much like that.

292
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:24,625
Scott: in other words instead of buying a TiVo and paying TiVo every month you take a computer and you plug it into your television and you install myth TV on it Which is absolutely free.

293
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,452
Scott: it runs on Linux, which is absolutely free.

294
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,160
Rym: freeze in both speech and beer.

295
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,035
Scott: Yeah, so you pay nothing except for the cost of the computer obviously, which is obviously.

296
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:37,151
Scott: you already have one lying around Obviously and it does the same thing.

297
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:38,920
Scott: a TiVo does in fact better.

298
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:49,886
Rym: Well almost the one thing you don't get is the directory that you pay TiVo for but there is a free directory You can connect to online Yep, and it's mostly as good.

299
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:50,909
Rym: as far as I can tell.

300
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:51,571
Rym: we don't know.

301
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,680
Rym: we don't actually have any sort of television service whatsoever.

302
00:20:54,701 --> 00:21:04,420
Scott: But yeah I mean if we're you if we're gonna use myth TV The reason we want to use it is not to watch television or record TV shows, which is its primary function.

303
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,715
Rym: Yeah, though we might get an antenna to record.

304
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,523
Rym: I don't know Simpsons Yeah, who knows.

305
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:14,680
Scott: but it is also just a very good interface for using a computer attached to a television.

306
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:18,464
Rym: Yes, especially emulation and Well emulation.

307
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:24,948
Scott: Yeah, it gets really hard to use a computer when you just plug it into your TV and try to use the Mouse and keyboard especially at a high resolution.

308
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:27,800
Rym: You can't see shit, especially if you don't have an HD TV.

309
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:30,570
Rym: Yeah, like we don't yeah, we could have had one.

310
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,574
Rym: It just wasn't worth the money.

311
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:32,558
Scott: No, it's not worth it.

312
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:37,114
Scott: So You know myth TV Let's use like a remote control.

313
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:59,880
Scott: if you set it up right and it just has big text and nice easy to scroll through menus and You know, you can set it up to check the weather check the news read RSS feeds run emulators from nice You know and all it does is put nice easy menus on all this stuff To play video files that are just stored on your computer that you downloaded with bit torrent all that good stuff.

314
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,126
Scott: I think it even has bit torrent.

315
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:04,240
Scott: I'm not sharing web browser for has a web browser.

316
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:12,479
Scott: So if it gets really hard to use gnome or KDE or whatever your choice of desktop You know system is on Linux.

317
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:17,677
Scott: You can just run like a crap desktop environment like flux box or flux box.

318
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:19,102
Scott: people are gonna yell at me now But fuck.

319
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:19,424
Scott: Yes.

320
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:20,328
Rym: All right fine.

321
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:31,840
Scott: I still um, no one will defend that maybe not all right, you can you run rat poison and then Run myth TV and you'll never have to look at rat poison or use it and it'll be really easy to use your computer plug.

322
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:32,284
Rym: All right.

323
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:41,185
Rym: for any of you who don't know what rat poison is I'll put it very briefly in that once I went to the website to read about rat poison and There is no screenshot section.

324
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:47,020
Rym: instead there was text explaining that if you need a screenshot rat poison is not for you exactly.

325
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:52,618
Rym: But instead of talking about myth TV We're gonna talk about just the basic.

326
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:56,414
Rym: What if you want to have a TV in the living room with a computer attached to it?

327
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:01,299
Rym: all the things you've got to consider Because we recently went through all this and we've learned our lessons.

328
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:05,311
Scott: Step one you're going to want a computer.

329
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,394
Scott: You don't need so much RAM.

330
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:08,119
Scott: That's the first thing you only need.

331
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,230
Scott: about 256 might even get you by but RAM is so cheap.

332
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,040
Scott: Yeah 512 is more than enough way more than enough.

333
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,560
Scott: You're not gonna need a whole lot of RAM.

334
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,560
Scott: You need only enough RAM to like hold a video file in memory and not even that, you know, it's just nothing.

335
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,788
Scott: So don't spend don't get a gig of RAM.

336
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:25,270
Scott: That's silly.

337
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,000
Rym: Yeah, basically the key factors I would consider.

338
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,996
Rym: I guess it depends on whether or not you're scavenging an old computer or buying a new computer for the purpose.

339
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:35,927
Rym: Yep, but Quiet you want it to be quiet.

340
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,340
Scott: get big fans and not so many of them.

341
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:45,773
Rym: Yeah, and keep in mind that it's not gonna be a gaming machine It's not gonna heat up that much the video cards not gonna be doing 3d whatever.

342
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,182
Rym: so you can get away with less powerful Cooling.

343
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,816
Rym: if you can try to get away with passive cooling wherever you can put it in.

344
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:55,277
Scott: Yep Number two, you're gonna want a CPU.

345
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,647
Scott: That's you don't want to get one.

346
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,100
Scott: that's crazy stupid fast because you don't need that.

347
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,017
Scott: But you have to make sure you don't skip too much or else you have like videos that skip and that's no good.

348
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:19,272
Rym: a broad broad broad Idea, and I hate using a number like this, especially a number like megahertz, but more than 1.2 gigahertz You're probably gonna want maybe like two or one and a half.

349
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,578
Rym: We've got what we got a duron 900 down there.

350
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,945
Scott: Yeah, duron 900 is not enough.

351
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:25,851
Rym: That's like that's just below the line.

352
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:30,804
Scott: My desktop computer currently is a 1.8 gigahertz Athlon XP.

353
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:41,560
Scott: if you get a high-end sempron or a low-end AMD 64 or pretty much any Pentium 4 you'll be fine.

354
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:45,399
Scott: Yeah, or anything better than a Pentium 4 is more than fine.

355
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:52,199
Rym: And I'll just say it because I have to if you even consider overclocking a rig like this just kill yourself right now.

356
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,020
Rym: Yeah, there's there's no reason no reason at all.

357
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,556
Rym: In fact, if anything you'd want to underclock it that way it'll be quieter and less hot.

358
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:07,020
Scott: Mm-hmm The third thing you're gonna want is just buy like a $20 something that plays DVDs.

359
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:12,326
Scott: You don't need to burn DVDs next to your living room TV You just need to play them.

360
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:17,726
Rym: or in the very least when someone comes over with a DVD full of crap You can put it on there and watch it.

361
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:18,409
Rym: Mm-hmm.

362
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,158
Scott: So you want to get something that's a DVD reader.

363
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:25,053
Scott: now these days You can get a DVD burner reader/rewriter thing for like 20 bucks.

364
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,720
Scott: So just get the cheap one off Newegg.

365
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:36,440
Rym: Yeah, I mean having a DVD burner there would probably be real handy especially a CD burner for you know Your friends are over burn a CD for the car or whatever, but don't spend money if you don't have to.

366
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:40,375
Rym: We'll talk at the end about if you're gonna spend money what you want to do.

367
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:41,079
Rym: Oh, yeah.

368
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:45,059
Scott: Third thing the most important thing is a video card.

369
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:59,854
Scott: you're probably gonna want from my experience an Nvidia video card only because Especially with Linux but also with Windows the Nvidia video cards are the best at supporting TV out Regardless of operating system.

370
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:06,737
Scott: Yes Like we had an ATI card and we plugged it into the TV with s video and we just couldn't.

371
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:07,660
Scott: no matter what we did.

372
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:11,294
Scott: Could we get any video to come out of that s video hole now?

373
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:12,980
Rym: There's nothing wrong with ATIs hardware.

374
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:14,625
Rym: I mean ATI and Nvidia.

375
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:17,094
Rym: I'd say their hardware is equal just their beaches.

376
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:18,900
Rym: each has itself pros and cons.

377
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:23,659
Rym: The problem is Nvidia's drivers are incredibly well-written and awesome.

378
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,786
Scott: ATIs drivers are crap.

379
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:30,430
Scott: ATIs drivers are a travesty unto man But this doesn't even have to do with drivers.

380
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:38,444
Scott: if you have an Nvidia video card Right and your computer has no hard drive and no operating system and you plug in the s video cable to the television It'll work.

381
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,440
Scott: You will see the BIOS going by on the television.

382
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,773
Rym: It might it might not take up the whole screen or something, but it'll be there.

383
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:45,597
Rym: No, it'll.

384
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:48,946
Scott: it'll actually be Unless your TV is wicked old.

385
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,980
Rym: Yeah, assuming you're I don't want to make an assurance here that we can't back up in the.

386
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,102
Rym: Yeah, but if you're using an s video cable or better your then it's able to detect your television settings unless that s video cable is then converted to RCA and then run through an RC are an RF modulator and then into an old TV through.

387
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,166
Rym: and yeah, we're talking.

388
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:06,769
Scott: we're talking.

389
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:08,274
Scott: that's one thing you had to be sure of.

390
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,525
Scott: you're gonna want to plug your computer Directly into your television.

391
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,830
Rym: There's a lot of reasons for that.

392
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,316
Scott: You're gonna need a television.

393
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:15,400
Scott: That's somewhat modern.

394
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,064
Scott: It's sad.

395
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:16,547
Rym: Now.

396
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:18,338
Rym: The other thing here is, you know talking about the TV.

397
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,408
Rym: We're not talking about HDTV because you're gonna.

398
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:26,540
Rym: it's almost impossible to take advantage of HDTV via a computer.

399
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,008
Scott: No, it's incredibly easy to take.

400
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:29,495
Scott: It's the easiest way to do it.

401
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:30,380
Rym: Here's the problem with it.

402
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,323
Rym: Oh, here's the thing.

403
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:36,299
Rym: you can get it to work on TVs, but the HDTV standard changes so much.

404
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:44,323
Scott: You realize every single HDTV that you can buy has a DVI hole HTM whatever.

405
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,208
Scott: no a DVI hole.

406
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:50,877
Scott: as in you take a DVI cable and connect your video card directly to the television Really?

407
00:27:52,241 --> 00:28:00,312
Rym: There's got my work who's like super into movies and he has multiple computers hooked up to his TV And he said that that didn't work Really?

408
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:04,113
Scott: Yeah My dad has a Sony Sony.

409
00:28:04,153 --> 00:28:07,322
Scott: That's like the worst you could possibly get HDTV.

410
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:08,066
Scott: it's just.

411
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:16,900
Scott: it's a CRT, you know WG a one of those and I took a computer with a DVI cable and plugged it right into the TV and it worked perfect really bad.

412
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,468
Scott: I had no effort whatsoever.

413
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:27,940
Scott: So well if you're willing to spend an extra 500 bucks We know the rule is if you buy an HDTV make sure it has a DVI hole and not just an HD.

414
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:36,518
Scott: Whatever HDMI, I think any one of those DRM tolls or a component, you know component holes You can't really get component out as video works just as well.

415
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:36,700
Scott: though.

416
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:42,326
Rym: Now if you want a PVR with HDTV or anything like that There's basically one option.

417
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,574
Rym: you got to get a somewhat expensive special card.

418
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,200
Scott: Well, it's a hundred and seventy dollars.

419
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:54,460
Scott: it's readily available and it's called the HD 3000. you can go to PC HD TV comm and buy this thing now.

420
00:28:54,761 --> 00:29:00,500
Scott: There are probably other things you can buy but this is the one that is a guaranteed to work with Linux 100%.

421
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,780
Rym: Yep, just now Scott was reading off the feature list of it and it's pretty robust.

422
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:10,025
Scott: It's basically a TiVo on a card that goes into PCI slot and it's even compatible with the HD 2000 card.

423
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:11,294
Scott: is the previous version?

424
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:12,019
Scott: that wasn't HD?

425
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:17,959
Scott: Well, I guess it was kind of HD But it wasn't as awesome and like if you have an Nvidia card to go with it.

426
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:28,354
Scott: they kind of work in tandem and you can get a whole bunch of these cards if you need multiple tuners if you're not Like that and it supports pretty much Linux perfectly and HD perfectly.

427
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:30,520
Rym: Ooh, wait a minute tandem with my Nvidia card.

428
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:31,517
Rym: Does it use those cool?

429
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:35,667
Rym: On Labeled special connectors on my video card or anything.

430
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:40,200
Rym: No every Nvidia card I've ever had has multiple connectors internally for ribbon cables.

431
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,082
Rym: That don't go anywhere.

432
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:47,280
Scott: All it will do is use the power of the Nvidia GPU in order to play the HD TV smoothly.

433
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,565
Scott: Oh, that's all it means.

434
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,815
Rym: that's understandable because HD is a lot of data.

435
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:55,472
Rym: Yeah All right, though at least in terms of what we're gonna talk about.

436
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,739
Rym: We don't have any HD whatsoever in this house.

437
00:29:58,101 --> 00:30:01,360
Scott: Nope, but I know all about it or enough about it more than most people.

438
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:04,794
Scott: Yeah, most people who have HD don't even set it up, right?

439
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:17,740
Rym: Yeah the only there's one guy I know and he's at my work and basically his whole life has become movies and He has a hell of a setup from what I can gather and he know as far as I can tell he knows everything about it.

440
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:20,959
Rym: He's got like multiple computers hooked up to his TV.

441
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:26,240
Rym: He's got like multiple cable providers in HD and Netflix and he's gonna get blu-ray right away.

442
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,480
Scott: Whoa, I didn't think anyone was gonna get blue right away.

443
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,100
Rym: I mean like when it's 400 bucks not right away the first one when there's no blu-ray DVDs out yet.

444
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:40,800
Scott: Yeah, actually they're gonna be if the private blu-ray and HD DVDs before their players.

445
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:48,429
Rym: Actually, oh there was just an article on it recently where they were talking about that and they delayed blu-ray partly because that way There would be DVDs out for it first.

446
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,320
Scott: I think who knows who cares?

447
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,306
Rym: All I know is the list of blu-ray.

448
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:56,079
Rym: DVDs are not movies that will take advantage of blu-ray at all.

449
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,788
Scott: Anyway back to computers plugged into the television.

450
00:30:59,888 --> 00:31:00,049
Rym: Yep.

451
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,393
Rym: We use as video.

452
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,138
Scott: Yeah as video is simple.

453
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:11,261
Rym: It works It's not a problem and honestly for I mean most things you download off the internet are not the highest of quality because they're compressed somewhat.

454
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:16,457
Scott: the thing is the thing what you're gonna do with your computer if it's like a video watching type of thing.

455
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:28,300
Scott: even if you download an HD quality video the s video can probably more than handle it and For other things you do with your computer your computer is probably gonna be at a higher resolution than your TV can ever handle.

456
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,380
Scott: I mean, you know your computer can beat the TV HD resolution by like a million miles.

457
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,508
Rym: Yeah, so be ready when you're setting up your desktop.

458
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:47,060
Rym: if you don't use myth TV or anything to make all the fonts big keyboard shortcuts and or a wireless keyboard Yeah, make sure you have a wireless keyboard and mouse of some sort.

459
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,280
Scott: We just bought a little logitech one for 40 bucks because we were suffering with the wired ones.

460
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,238
Rym: Yeah, we had a wireless one that had a range of about one inch.

461
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:04,366
Rym: now We've got one that can actually reach across the room, which is yeah It's a good feeling to sit on your couch with a mouse on your lap and a keyboard sitting next to it Picking a movie that you downloaded off bit torrent.

462
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:09,566
Scott: It's actually a pretty light nice and keyboard - I expected it to be crappier But it was pretty cool.

463
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:16,253
Scott: Yeah, if you want to if you want to splurge Logitech makes the de novo media controller keyboard and mouse setup.

464
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:23,915
Scott: I would not pay money for that thing 200 something bucks, but damn it has all the buttons you need to control shit.

465
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:24,858
Rym: If someone gave me one.

466
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:25,520
Rym: I wouldn't complain.

467
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:27,308
Scott: Yeah, it's it's pretty cool.

468
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,860
Scott: It's definitely the thing you buy if you're rich.

469
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:31,962
Rym: Alright.

470
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:38,616
Rym: now hardware wise the last real thing is if you're gonna buy a new computer at least for this or even if you have One around think about what kind of case you have it in.

471
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,448
Scott: Smaller the better and quieter the better.

472
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:44,660
Rym: Yeah, I mean I could put my computer down next to the TV.

473
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,640
Rym: My computer is a giant hulking monstrosity.

474
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:58,579
Scott: Yeah, I can't think we can stress enough that you need a living room computer to be quiet more than anything else because if you're watching a movie and the whole time this is That's no good.

475
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,137
Rym: Also the fact that you're gonna want to leave it on all the time because booting the computer every time you want to watch Something's just a pain in the ass.

476
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:15,480
Scott: Yeah until we have computers that have like solid-state hard drives and they boot up instantly You're gonna want to be leaving this thing on all the time Which means once again you want it quiet and you're gonna want it not to be so power hungry.

477
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,716
Scott: So don't put a whole bunch of drives in it.

478
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:28,420
Scott: Just you know Ideally, you would have all your videos and things stored somewhere else on your local network either on your computer Or if you have you know out server somewhere on a server.

479
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:36,739
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to fill your living room computer up with hard drives because then you have to listen to them in your living Room, but if you must, you know put them in there.

480
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:45,500
Rym: In fact, honestly, especially if you're putting an older computer down there And it's not serial ATA but a 5400 rpm drive in there those things are actually really quiet.

481
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:49,180
Scott: Yeah, just put like a like a 20 gig old drive in there.

482
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,559
Scott: It doesn't have to be fast or anything is you're barely gonna be using it.

483
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,799
Rym: Yeah, the drive we threw on ours actually has a broken spot in it.

484
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:59,398
Scott: Yeah, we store a few videos on there, but that's just because we don't have a storage array set up yet.

485
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,819
Rym: Yep Yeah, we're working on that.

486
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:16,985
Rym: Yeah And as for the case if you're building a new one at least go micro ATX because that way it's a tiny little motherboard and There are computer cases that are basically the size and shape of a DVD player Mm-hmm, and you can just put it there and it'll just be like another thing on your rec sitting above your DVD player and under Your xbox.

487
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,539
Scott: Well, you won't even need a DVD player.

488
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:22,753
Rym: I prefer watching DVDs on a DVD player.

489
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:26,696
Scott: I Don't see it if your computer plays DVDs just fine.

490
00:34:26,717 --> 00:34:27,260
Scott: What's the difference?

491
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,545
Rym: Well, yeah, if it does but it's just the usability and the ease of the fact that the DVD player just works automatically No matter what all the time.

492
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:35,100
Scott: Oh, that's why myth TV is one of the things that handles that.

493
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,847
Rym: Yeah, but we don't have myth TV going yet.

494
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:41,686
Scott: So of course and if you are smart and you use Linux properly It's not difficult.

495
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:47,889
Scott: If you buy a DVD ROM from the store right to go in a computer It's set to region free by default.

496
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:57,879
Scott: as soon as you put a DVD into it Let's say I put a region one DVD into it and I you know, I play it in Windows It will automatically set the DVD player to region one.

497
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:03,340
Rym: Yeah, a lot of them have a grace period of like five DVDs and then it'll stop changing things like that.

498
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,059
Scott: Yeah, then let's say I put a region two DVD into it.

499
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:10,160
Scott: It'll ask me in Windows if I want to change my region to region two.

500
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,142
Scott: And if I say yes that there's a physical thing in the drive that breaks and there are maybe five of those things that can Break.

501
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,811
Rym: Yeah, there's all sorts of different methods.

502
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,520
Rym: Don't try to open your drive and figure it out.

503
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,425
Scott: No, you can't figure you can't do it.

504
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:23,388
Rym: Sometimes it's physical.

505
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:27,740
Rym: Sometimes it's an unflashable firmware for all for all purposes.

506
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,270
Scott: It's undoable.

507
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:30,880
Scott: once it's broken you're done.

508
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,794
Scott: So you'll have like five chances to change your region and then once you've changed it five times You're left with the last region or maybe your drive will even stop working.

509
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:39,940
Rym: So you see that dialogue.

510
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,096
Rym: Don't think you've broken the horrible encryption and you can just change regions.

511
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,240
Rym: Your time is numbered.

512
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:51,900
Scott: Yeah, so what you want to do is if you use Linux and never use Windows Linux won't automatically change your region.

513
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,650
Scott: It'll just leave it at region zero.

514
00:35:53,892 --> 00:35:54,375
Scott: if you never.

515
00:35:54,395 --> 00:36:00,340
Scott: you know If you never had Windows and the drives region was never changed it's a brand new drive.

516
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,629
Scott: You'll be able to keep it region free forever.

517
00:36:03,513 --> 00:36:18,450
Scott: Of course, there is a program for Linux I think called region set or DVD region set that you can get and it very reliably at least in my experience Allows you to change to whatever region you want Of course, but of course it will break the things because it has to.

518
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:27,980
Scott: so if you accidentally say buy a drive Boot Windows watch a bunch of region 1 DVDs you decide you want to go to Linux and never go back to Windows ever again.

519
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:37,816
Scott: you can go to Linux change your drive to region free and then Never go back to Windows again because it'll set your region back to who knows now sound cards you.

520
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,204
Rym: it basically depends on what kind Of setup you've got.

521
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:44,184
Rym: if you don't have surround sound or receiver It doesn't matter.

522
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:48,180
Rym: any sound card in the world that fits in your computer will work just fine.

523
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:58,940
Scott: yep, what you're gonna want to do in that case is Take a Cable that on one end is a headphone plug just like the kind you have on your earbud headphones you put into your iPod.

524
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:00,040
Rym: We're being simple here.

525
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,204
Rym: if you know what they're actually called whatever this is for people who don't know you know, You're not listening to this

526
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:22,580
Scott: and on the other end of the cable will be a red and a white plug and you're gonna want to take the headphone plug and put it into the sound card on the computer and you're going to take the red and the white plugs and put them on to the Audio input on the television next to the video input from the that comes out of the computer.

527
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:30,156
Rym: Now generally just adjust all the volume on the computer to whatever set level sounds good and never touch it again and always change The volume via the TV.

528
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:35,211
Scott: Yeah That's the general idea with sound is that you want to all.

529
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:42,080
Scott: the sound comes from somewhere and eventually ends up Close to at some central point really close to the speakers.

530
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,340
Scott: So if you're using your television speakers, the closest point to those speakers is the TV volume.

531
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:54,784
Scott: So adjust every other volume to something and leave it and never touch it and then only use the TV volume Just like podcasting.

532
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:59,237
Rym: here Scott and I are set to two different volumes and then the final volume the mix.

533
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:04,116
Rym: the knob that I'm poking At all the time while we talk is just one knob at the end right before it goes to the computer.

534
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,929
Rym: Yep So I mean it's real simple.

535
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:14,102
Rym: if you don't have surround sound or if you have a receiver But you don't care about it do the same thing and just plug it into the receiver on whatever input Mm-hmm.

536
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,419
Rym: Now if you want to do surround sound it it's trickier.

537
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:24,200
Scott: I am like an expert on this because I spent maybe five years figuring out how surround sound and Linux work.

538
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:30,580
Scott: Yeah, he really did and all the different things about it and all this crazy batshit surround sound crap.

539
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,960
Rym: All I've learned from listening to him complain about this is that it's a pain in the ass.

540
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,198
Scott: Alright, um, let me tell you a couple things.

541
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:49,309
Scott: number one If you're gonna use Windows because if you're not if you're not gonna use Linux on your you know computer living room PC You can use that Windows Media Center But it's actually honestly really good.

542
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,620
Rym: if you don't care about paying for it and you don't care that it's Windows Yeah, if you don't care about paying for it, you don't care that it's Windows.

543
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,336
Scott: You don't care that it is DRM and you don't care that you'll only play like region 1 DVDs.

544
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:00,822
Scott: go use it Why not?

545
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:01,949
Scott: It's really easy.

546
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,711
Scott: You don't have to spend a bunch of time Like don't think we're being condescending here really.

547
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:07,535
Rym: it's that easy.

548
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:08,679
Rym: and if you don't care go for it.

549
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,907
Scott: Yeah, but I gotta warn you one thing.

550
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:13,957
Scott: It will require a better computer than a Linux setup.

551
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,250
Rym: Well, yes You'll probably end up buying a new computer.

552
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,004
Rym: Anyway, if you do that, yep They're actually.

553
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,428
Scott: they sell computers in the store.

554
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:21,912
Scott: Windows Media Center computers.

555
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,340
Scott: buy one and if you have money go for it.

556
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:25,063
Scott: They work.

557
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,333
Scott: people seem to like them and that's so bad.

558
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:29,060
Scott: You know, it's like a TiVo alternative.

559
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:31,980
Rym: Yep, because there's a guy at work who kept saying he wanted to do something like that.

560
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,047
Rym: So I kept telling him use not myth.

561
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,572
Rym: it makes making myth TV easy.

562
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,740
Rym: Well, yeah, we'll go we'll get into that.

563
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:39,230
Scott: Yeah, we'll get into that today.

564
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:40,419
Rym: I remember he came back to me.

565
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,440
Rym: Well, I'll tell the whole story another day, but suffice to say he ended up buying one of those Windows Media Center things.

566
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,699
Scott: Yeah, they work all good.

567
00:39:48,423 --> 00:39:51,780
Scott: Anyway surround sound in Windows surround sound will work.

568
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:58,043
Scott: If you buy a sound card that supports surround sound and plug the speakers into it properly It'll work.

569
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:06,359
Scott: The thing is if you want to Route audio from say your DVD player your VCR, etc.

570
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,102
Scott: Etc.

571
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:14,900
Scott: into the computer and then out of the sound card of the computer to the speakers and a little trouble there You're better off routing everything to a receiver.

572
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:18,559
Scott: Yeah You need to if you buy a receiver to do your surround sound.

573
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:23,253
Scott: Well now your computer doesn't really need a surround sound video card.

574
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:25,138
Scott: It just needs a video car sound.

575
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:25,920
Scott: car sound card.

576
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:28,600
Scott: It doesn't need a surround sound sound card.

577
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,159
Scott: It just needs a sound card with digital out preferably optical out but SPDIF out also works.

578
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:41,220
Rym: Yep I mean, we're not gonna get into the details of how surround sound works, but consider that the word logic appears in doubly pro logic.

579
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:48,259
Rym: yeah, there is logic there that can determine what the surround sound should be and Data is put to that in various ways.

580
00:40:49,164 --> 00:41:00,240
Scott: The only thing I can say is if you want surround sound number one Anything more than five point one surround sound is stupid because you're never gonna find DVD that has six point one or seven point one surround.

581
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,917
Scott: It's just silly.

582
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,692
Scott: 5.1 surround is the only surround.

583
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,947
Rym: Yeah We're not even kidding all these extra surround sound.

584
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:08,094
Rym: things are just scams for Best Buy to sell you.

585
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:10,908
Scott: they're mostly scams to sell extra Speakers to gamers.

586
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:11,413
Rym: Yeah.

587
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:19,100
Scott: All right number two What you want to if you're gonna go for surround sound you get the speakers are the most important thing.

588
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:29,719
Scott: So buy the best speakers you can Afford, you know as long as they're not crazy Randy audiophile silliness, you know You'll be able to tell because they'll advertise a bunch of things that don't sound right.

589
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,620
Rym: Yeah, I'd say as a general baseline if you don't know what you need don't spend more than three or four hundred dollars.

590
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:45,754
Scott: Yeah, I spent two hundred dollars on my Logitech Z 5500 and that those are a good choice for any not incredibly large room.

591
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:46,896
Scott: They're perfect.

592
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,424
Scott: home theater desk Surround it's.

593
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:50,388
Scott: it's perfect surround.

594
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:53,580
Rym: So yeah, I will note that his subwoofer is bigger than my monitor.

595
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,350
Scott: Yeah, it was bigger than I thought it was gonna be.

596
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,200
Rym: Well, no, yeah, it's slightly bigger than my monitor.

597
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,613
Rym: I think volume wise who knows my monitor is fucking huge though.

598
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:04,425
Scott: Maybe it's equal to your monitor Bigger who knows?

599
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:05,955
Rym: Yeah, we'll measure.

600
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:06,680
Scott: Yeah, we will.

601
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:09,500
Rym: But now one if you're if you're cheap.

602
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:15,351
Rym: I know a lot of people listen to GeekNights are in college and when we were in college We were poor and we have poor.

603
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:16,375
Rym: it's not even surround sound.

604
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:17,460
Rym: It's the poor man's receiver.

605
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,055
Rym: Go to Kmart or Target whatever and you know those crap.

606
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,080
Rym: Oh stereos.

607
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,535
Rym: They sell mm-hmm that come with like two speakers and they're always big and rice looking.

608
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:28,020
Rym: Yep buy one of those.

609
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,450
Rym: They're like 80 bucks at most usually a lot less.

610
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,258
Scott: make sure it has RCA in.

611
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,391
Rym: yeah The little red and a little white thing on the back.

612
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:41,389
Rym: Yeah the one I talked about before Yep, and just plug all of your stuff into that Mm-hmm, and you know what?

613
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,796
Rym: It's not the greatest sound but for watching a TV It's usually a hell of a lot better than what's on the TV itself.

614
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:50,632
Scott: speaker wise Yeah I mean cheap TVs usually have one little speaker.

615
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:55,712
Scott: slightly better TVs have Two speakers and they're usually not the greatest speakers in the world.

616
00:42:55,793 --> 00:43:00,120
Rym: if your TV has good speakers on it That TV cost more money than my computer.

617
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:08,121
Scott: Yeah and usually the really good TVs don't have speakers like the really good computer monitors don't have speakers and only crap computer monitors have speakers on Them.

618
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:09,355
Scott: it's like that.

619
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:21,267
Scott: But yeah, if you're gonna do surround sound what you're gonna do is you're gonna If you really want it you're gonna pay for equipment that has either an optical input or an SPDIF input.

620
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:32,520
Scott: then you're gonna get a sound card that has optical output or SPDIF output and Take the wire from the sound card to the speaker or receiver and it'll probably just work normally.

621
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:35,720
Rym: But if you want all the surround to work, you're gonna have to listen to another episode.

622
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,405
Rym: We do well Scott will explain all that in Linux or read like the near book size Guide.

623
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,073
Scott: I'm in the middle of writing.

624
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,219
Scott: that's taking a long time.

625
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:59,600
Scott: Yeah, yeah I'm writing a whole giant guide about PC audio specifically with Linux and specifically with surround sound So that everyone can learn from my five or six years of journeying to get stupid speakers to work in Linux.

626
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:04,920
Rym: Yeah, I gave up pretty much right away and I've always just dumped with a subwoofer and left and right.

627
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,256
Scott: I solved my problem with money.

628
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:08,709
Scott: It's a good thing.

629
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,458
Scott: I got plenty of it.

630
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:15,747
Rym: but anyway, you'll get the sound set up somehow and After that just get stuff and watch it.

631
00:44:16,148 --> 00:44:21,064
Scott: Yeah, load up your bit torrents download your TV shows and Run M player.

632
00:44:21,104 --> 00:44:25,180
Rym: and I mean, I remember we set this up and at first we didn't use it that much.

633
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,907
Rym: It was just this computer that was sitting there.

634
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,092
Rym: It was always on.

635
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:29,960
Scott: well, that's because we couldn't really get it to work.

636
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,640
Scott: We were switching out video cards and stuff.

637
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:37,353
Rym: Yeah, well because of ATI and then we didn't have a network drop to it for the longest time and we originally just wanted to Use it to play DDR.

638
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:44,838
Rym: Yep, until we discovered that the floor in our living room is not the most structurally sound item.

639
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,865
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean, it'll hold us up.

640
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:49,356
Rym: It won't hold us up if we're jumping around like monkeys.

641
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:50,059
Scott: No, no.

642
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:55,760
Rym: So we couldn't play DDR and the box sat there for a while every now that we had played emulated games on it.

643
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:57,746
Scott: Yeah for emulated games.

644
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:04,429
Scott: I recommend you buy a USB hub, which we didn't buy but that's okay And that's you know, like one with four ports.

645
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:11,579
Scott: so you can bring four USB ports right out to the front Where people are sitting and then just get USB game pads and plug them in.

646
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:15,320
Rym: I highly recommend though you'll have trouble getting to work in Linux.

647
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,969
Rym: Sometimes like saying makes things where you can.

648
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,220
Rym: you can connect an old Super Nintendo controller to a USB.

649
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:32,419
Scott: Yeah, there are all sorts of things you can buy to plug in actual NES SNES PlayStation controllers directly or you know convert them to USB and then plug them into the computer.

650
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,259
Rym: now We'd really like to say buy the Xbox 360 PC controller But we haven't actually found one.

651
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:43,900
Scott: Well, there is one in Circuit City that no one's bought but I'm afraid to buy that particular one because it's too much money.

652
00:45:44,302 --> 00:45:47,640
Rym: Yeah, but it looks like it'll be a good thing if it ever comes down in price.

653
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:48,806
Scott: There is there is.

654
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:58,522
Scott: for anyone who doesn't know you can buy an Xbox 360 controller that is designed to work with a computer as opposed to working with an Xbox 360.

655
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,920
Scott: You can probably buy them online pretty easily buying them in a store.

656
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,065
Scott: They're hard to find they.

657
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:27,040
Scott: they come in a similar package to an Xbox 360 controller only instead of the green and white cardboard this red Microsoft Windows e cardboard and it has USB plug and I've read that people have definitely gotten it to work a hundred percent in Linux by doing You know adding the things in the kernel and such and it's not credibly difficult But not easy for people don't know what they're doing in Linux.

658
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:32,760
Rym: Now if any of you have this controller or know someone who does let us know we're really curious about it.

659
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:37,560
Scott: Yeah, I'm definitely looking to buy one because the problem is a lot of PC game pads are just crappy.

660
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,903
Rym: Yeah I mean I the.

661
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:43,960
Rym: the standard right now seems to be the gamepad Pro the gravis gamepad Pro USB.

662
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,894
Scott: Now the gravis gamepad period has been the PC standard for a long time.

663
00:46:47,914 --> 00:46:48,034
Rym: Now.

664
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:49,660
Rym: I submit that it is terrible.

665
00:46:50,705 --> 00:46:51,540
Scott: It's not great.

666
00:46:51,660 --> 00:47:03,510
Rym: The reason is and it really seems to only affect old-school Nintendo games That if you hit right you very often hit down and right a little bit instead Which will destroy you because then Mario ducks instead of running.

667
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:10,450
Scott: Yeah, it's very it's it works And it works easily like it's guaranteed to just work period.

668
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:13,920
Scott: the problem is it's not so precise and it's controlling.

669
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:20,240
Scott: So if you're playing any game, especially old emulated games that requires precision handling you are going to die.

670
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:22,486
Rym: Now also we mentioned DDR.

671
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:28,919
Rym: if you want to play DDR with step mania on this computer one Make sure you don't have neighbors downstairs.

672
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:31,670
Scott: Make sure the basement is a good place.

673
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,160
Scott: If you have a furnished basement, you can't do better than that.

674
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:41,312
Rym: Yeah, we're actually thinking this summer We'll just tilt the TV a bit and play on our deck because we have a big sliding door there and then a deck That's big might maybe work.

675
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:49,900
Rym: Yeah, I think it will but anyway You're gonna need to connect their DDR pads to the computer somehow and this is a problem that has vexed me for ages.

676
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:51,004
Rym: It is not.

677
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:54,117
Rym: basically you'll see things in the store that claim to do it.

678
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:54,900
Rym: They lie.

679
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:56,584
Rym: They almost all lie.

680
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:06,339
Rym: if you want a thing that works go to the step mania forums or the DDR DR freak forums and look and see what those people recommend.

681
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:10,735
Scott: Yeah for converting PlayStation to USB.

682
00:48:10,996 --> 00:48:12,120
Scott: There are plenty of things that work.

683
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:19,240
Scott: The problem is they do not support hitting two arrows at the same time because you know who hits two arrows at the same time.

684
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:23,387
Scott: Well DDR people hit two arrows at the same time And even then a lot of them.

685
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:26,180
Rym: you have to put them in a special mode to make them work with dance pads.

686
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:29,258
Scott: Yeah, there's a special like code you have to press in.

687
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:35,906
Rym: usually It's like hold left and right at the same time or hold X and over at the same time for like three seconds And then hit start like that.

688
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:39,300
Scott: I recommend you buy a dance pad that has USB on it automatically.

689
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,414
Rym: Yes, the the new red octane ignition pad has USB on it and it's good.

690
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:43,836
Rym: It works.

691
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:44,478
Scott: Yep.

692
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,760
Scott: I have it It works just fine.

693
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:50,259
Rym: I bought my ignition pad a year and a half before Scott did and that would did not exist.

694
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:50,440
Rym: yet.

695
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,925
Rym: So mine does not have USB.

696
00:48:52,205 --> 00:48:52,968
Scott: No, it does not.

697
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:56,820
Rym: It has Xbox which should be USB, but it doesn't output the same signal.

698
00:48:57,162 --> 00:48:58,287
Rym: No, well the same signal.

699
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,056
Rym: It doesn't output the same key presses.

700
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:01,961
Rym: Mm-hmm It's.

701
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:08,340
Scott: it's generally a bad idea to try to get older PS, you know PlayStation dance pads to work on a computer.

702
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,605
Rym: Just buy a dance pad that has USB.

703
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:15,759
Rym: Now surprisingly the dance pads that plug into parallel ports work fairly Well, the problem is you will never find one of those again.

704
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,268
Scott: Nope, they don't exist anymore.

705
00:49:17,428 --> 00:49:19,500
Rym: Unless if you see one for sale don't buy it.

706
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,106
Rym: It's probably either used or has been moldering in a warehouse for the past Thousand years.

707
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:28,568
Scott: if you're big into DDR and you're really gonna play it You should probably just buy a dance pad.

708
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:34,356
Scott: Anyway, if you don't already have one if you already have one Hey crackhead, if you're such a crackhead, how come you don't own a crack pipe?

709
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:35,320
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

710
00:49:35,461 --> 00:49:37,228
Scott: Well, maybe they're just getting into DDR.

711
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:46,980
Rym: Yeah, I gotta link to the party though when we got into DDR We basically had those crap Oh thin rubbery plastic dance mats duct tape to the floor in our apartment semi-permanently.

712
00:49:47,181 --> 00:49:48,448
Scott: I think we've told the story before.

713
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:49,575
Rym: Yeah, we'll tell it again.

714
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:54,160
Scott: All right But anyway, other than that, that's all you need for a living room computer.

715
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:57,649
Rym: I mean don't don't let the feature creep creep in.

716
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,060
Rym: don't try to use it for other stuff because it's just gonna be a pain.

717
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:04,500
Rym: Think about what you want this computer for and then do whatever you want.

718
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:06,730
Rym: If you want to watch movies set up to watch movies.

719
00:50:07,252 --> 00:50:09,862
Rym: if you want to play games set up to play games Mm-hmm.

720
00:50:10,566 --> 00:50:23,800
Scott: I mean you could try to be all cool and maybe like Have a laptop and have a docking station next to the TV and you put the laptop in the docking station and the laptop Doubles as the you know living room computer and it's also your laptop.

721
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:27,620
Scott: But you're just gonna clutter up your laptop with a bunch of living room stuff.

722
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:30,992
Rym: Also, don't expect to surf the web on this thing often.

723
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:32,940
Rym: It's great for Google video.

724
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:37,480
Rym: One of our favorite pastimes is typing words like explosion in and just sitting around having a grand old time.

725
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:42,760
Rym: But as for surfing the web with all of its texts not so good.

726
00:50:43,661 --> 00:50:45,968
Scott: Yeah, I mean one thing you're gonna want to learn.

727
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:54,012
Scott: if you don't know it already if you're using Firefox or a lot of other programs Control plus and control minus well control equals.

728
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:54,574
Scott: technically.

729
00:50:55,256 --> 00:50:59,489
Scott: if you press those buttons You can make the font bigger and smaller now even better.

730
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,571
Rym: if you use opera opera does it one step better and actually zooms in And out including the images.

731
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:05,236
Rym: Mm-hmm.

732
00:51:06,242 --> 00:51:11,040
Rym: I actually really recommend opera if you're gonna have a PC hooked up to the computer and you expect to use a web browser at.

733
00:51:11,662 --> 00:51:16,719
Scott: Opera seems to actually be the best browser for anything except a desktop computer.

734
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:20,980
Scott: Yeah Well, I think they're putting it on the DS opera on the DS opera on the palm pilot.

735
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:24,496
Scott: Opera on the TV is the way to go but on a normal computer.

736
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:27,200
Rym: It's all Firefox I guess I'm glad that I mean, I like opera.

737
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,962
Rym: I don't use it, but I like it and I'm glad that they seem to have found their niche Like.

738
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:32,368
Rym: this is the thing that opera is good at.

739
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:33,834
Rym: that makes it different from Firefox.

740
00:51:34,156 --> 00:51:36,684
Scott: Mm-hmm Speaking of Firefox.
