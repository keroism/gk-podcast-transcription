00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,288
Rym: It's Tuesday March 28th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:17,600
Rym: Tonight, we talk about Starfarers of Catan and Galactic Civilizations 2.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,596
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:19,788
Scott: Pund.

5
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,044
Rym: I say it, Pund.

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,573
Rym: I see you people in the forum seem to disagree on that.

7
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:28,940
Rym: I have a feeling that the word evolved separately in many different areas.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,909
Scott: Yeah, that seems to be the logic.

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,740
Scott: I mean, you know, one guy sees- that's what happens to the internet!

10
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:42,796
Scott: One guy does something, it spreads to internet-enabled people in different areas, and then it spreads from those internet-enabled people to their circle of friends.

11
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:43,339
Scott: You know, like a web!

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,220
Scott: A web.

13
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:52,405
Rym: Because I actually remember when we were at RIT and we always said Pund, like everyone did, and then the freshmen.

14
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:53,450
Rym: We call them the freshmen.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,145
Rym: They're actually almost graduated by now, but we still call them the freshmen.

16
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,940
Rym: But when they got to RIT, they said Pund, which just sounded weird.

17
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,415
Scott: Well, because on the internet, before now, when we have Skype, most people did things by text.

18
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:15,760
Scott: So, one guy types P-W-N-3-D or something, and everyone in that game has a different pronunciation in their mind, and then who knows what it really is.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,440
Scott: So when nerds actually start getting together physically and talking, and one guy says Pund, another guy says Pund, another guy says Pund.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,875
Rym: Hoedown!

21
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:24,660
Scott: Hootenanny.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,379
Scott: Hoedown Hootenanny!

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,160
Scott: Hoedown Hootenanny Hootenanny Hootenanny Hootenanny Hootenanny.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,780
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, it's video game day, and we've got two video game day newses.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,239
Rym: So, World of Warcraft, you all know that I'd rather dislike it, but-- Yeah, we can't stop talking about it.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,160
Rym: Because it always makes news, and once again, it's made news.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,680
Rym: Now, there's this guy, and he made some sort of unofficial strategy guide to World of Warcraft.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,727
Scott: Strategy.

29
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:51,760
Scott: Play a lot.

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:55,940
Rym: Well, like, he gave advice on where to level and how to level and various things about the game.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,220
Scott: Places where other people aren't, and the monsters aren't going to kill you.

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,660
Rym: Now, instead of publishing this as a book, he published it as a book on eBay.

33
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:05,639
Rym: No big deal.

34
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,070
Rym: And you think, "Alright, you sell him, I think, $15 a pop.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,013
Rym: I think that's a cool thing.

36
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:11,699
Rym: I think he's a nice entrepreneurial-type

37
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:11,960
Rym: person.".

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,522
Scott: Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:18,099
Scott: Most people go to just-- they write a one in text, they put it on GameFAQs, you know, "This guy made a real book, so

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,180
Scott: hey.".

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,060
Rym: And I point out that he didn't steal anything, he didn't even use any intellectual property.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,840
Rym: I mean, he didn't reveal storylines, he only used a few screenshots that are clearly fair use.

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:40,120
Rym: And he has a huge disclaimer in the front of the book and the back explaining that he has not affiliated in any way with World of Warcraft or any of the companies involved, and that the guide is entirely unofficial and unacknowledged.

44
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:40,953
Scott: Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,808
Rym: Despite this, Blizzard, the Vendee et

46
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:44,109
Rym: al.,

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:52,380
Rym: have proceeded to send takedown notices to him and to eBay, to threaten to file suit under all sorts of things like the DMCA, and trademark infringement.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,282
Scott: Wow.

49
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,629
Scott: Alright, so, well, okay.

50
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,860
Scott: Trademark infringement, I can understand, see.

51
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,160
Scott: 'Cause let's say I wanted to write a book about the history of some football team, right?

52
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,300
Rym: You don't need permission.

53
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,540
Scott: I don't, but however, if I use, like, the logos of the football team, or if I use any statistics, they can get you.

54
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,520
Rym: Well, statistics, no, because statistics, as long as they are gathered, are a fact, and facts cannot be held by IP laws like that.

55
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:22,139
Scott: Uh, they're actually, all the sports statistics are held by these companies, or these two companies, or something like that.

56
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,520
Scott: It's weird.

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Rym: Yeah, but if that ever really got challenged in court, I don't think it would last.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,084
Scott: Anyway, that's not the point.

59
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:32,100
Scott: The point is, the trademark of the, you can't put the World of Warcraft logo.

60
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,720
Scott: You gotta say World of Warcraft TM and all that business.

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,400
Rym: Yeah, but you can do it, as long as you properly attribute it to the original trademark owner.

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:39,841
Rym: Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,900
Scott: Like, you can write a book about how McDonald's sucks, you know?

64
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,205
Rym: Yeah, I mean, this guy did that.

65
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:48,400
Rym: In my opinion, his guide is no different, and he even uses this example in his lawsuit.

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,600
Rym: His book is no different than someone writing a book about how to use Microsoft Word.

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,080
Scott: Yeah, basically.

68
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,640
Rym: And because this is a game, and because Blizzard is evil and stupid, they've decided to crush him under the weight of their legal system and their lawyers.

69
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:05,180
Rym: And he fought back, and he's suing them, and we'll see what comes of it.

70
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,440
Scott: He's probably gonna win, because if he doesn't, well, say goodbye to a lot of the computer books.

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,340
Rym: Say goodbye to every computer book ever written.

72
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:12,730
Scott: Say goodbye to a lot of books.

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,960
Scott: Say goodbye to a lot of free speech.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,541
Rym: Yeah.

75
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:22,499
Rym: And for all of you out there who play World of Warcraft, a nice little dig I've got for you is that, if you're still playing, you're supporting a company who does something like this.

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,860
Scott: Yeah, you're giving money to someone who is squelching free speech, and in exchange, they're twiddling some bits in a database whenever you click.

77
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:33,767
Scott: That's all it is.

78
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,400
Scott: You click, and a number changes.

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,400
Scott: And you're paying them money for the privilege of clicking and letting numbers change.

80
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,851
Scott: Oh, wait, you get a chat room too, but those are free.

81
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:43,900
Scott: You can get them from IRC for nothing.

82
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:49,259
Rym: Well, if you play IRC in one window and have Progress Quest going in the other window, and you call yourself the same thing in both of them.

83
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,584
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

84
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,800
Scott: I'm level 50... I'm almost level 60 in Progress Quest.

85
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:55,773
Rym: Ah.

86
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:56,599
Rym: What class are you again?

87
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,974
Scott: I am a... I forget.

88
00:04:59,014 --> 00:04:59,800
Scott: An Ur-Paladin.

89
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:00,336
Scott: Uh-huh.

90
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:04,240
Scott: And I think my race is like something... Enchanted Motorcycle.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,529
Scott: Great.

92
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:05,216
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,040
Rym: It sounds very Kingdom Alothing.

94
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:08,669
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't... I don't care.

95
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,606
Scott: I just let it... It runs in the system tray, and I hardly ever look at it.

96
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,236
Scott: I look at it like in the morning.

97
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:13,880
Scott: Anyway.

98
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,600
Scott: Whether you know it or not, Final Fantasy XII is out in Japan.

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,723
Scott: 12.

100
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:24,552
Scott: As in, I consider VI to be the best one.

101
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:28,364
Scott: There have been two times that many, if you don't count X2.

102
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,391
Scott: So, in fact, it's kind of like XIII.

103
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:36,600
Scott: And XI, I guess... Well, count it as XII, because XI's an MMO, and X2 was a real game, kinda.

104
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:41,779
Scott: Anything higher than VI, you know, kinda higher than VII is definitely sucky.

105
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,804
Rym: Well, no, no.

106
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:43,329
Rym: Just different.

107
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,340
Rym: They're not the same kind of game.

108
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:44,881
Scott: Yeah.

109
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:45,322
Scott: Anyway.

110
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:46,628
Scott: So, XII.

111
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,656
Scott: XII is this weird thing.

112
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:52,695
Scott: I've been reading about it, and I sent you probably the best article on the internet about it.

113
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,379
Scott: Of course, it's IGN, so what do you want?

114
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:03,295
Rym: Yeah, I've been seeing general sorts of brouhaha where people say that this betrayed the core of Final Fantasy, and other people said that it's not even a Final Fantasy game.

115
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:08,420
Rym: But some of the really old school people said it goes back to the good roots of what it should be, and no one agrees.

116
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,216
Scott: Let me tell you, from what I've read, this is my interpretation of what the words I have seen on the internet.

117
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,720
Rym: Yeah, we haven't actually played the game.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,623
Scott: No, I have not.

119
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,331
Scott: And it's in Japanese, so I don't see the point.

120
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,045
Scott: Number one, it still has the crazy FMVs and the crazy plot.

121
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,894
Scott: that's just as good as any other Final Fantasy game.

122
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:25,737
Scott: Hooray.

123
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,663
Scott: Nothing has changed in this department.

124
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,793
Scott: So if you only play for the plot, go for you.

125
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:37,819
Scott: Number two, it's got the item, magic, whatever system seems to have this weird new thing with, like, licenses.

126
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:45,140
Scott: Like, if you want to use a sword, you need to get a sword license, and then get a sword, and then you give the sword license to the character, and then the character can have the sword.

127
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,260
Rym: Yeah, but every Final Fantasy after seven or so has had something weird like that.

128
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,313
Scott: Yeah, it's just, that's their weird thing.

129
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:52,260
Scott: I'm just explaining what it is.

130
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,340
Rym: Yeah, everyone has a weird thing.

131
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,578
Scott: Now, the thing that seems to be getting the most attention is the combat system.

132
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,580
Scott: Now, let me just say my opinion on, if you don't know it already, on current, average RPG combat systems.

133
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,132
Rym: I think we can sum it up very succinctly.

134
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,820
Rym: We don't have time for that shit anymore.

135
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,767
Scott: Yeah, okay, this is what I want to do.

136
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:23,583
Scott: As I'm walking around exploring a dungeon, the fun part of the game, I want to, every, say, ten or so steps in the dungeon, meet an encounter where I have to push A repeatedly to make a number go up and continue doing the fun part.

137
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:24,627
Scott: Yeah, that's great.

138
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:25,752
Scott: That's just terrific.

139
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,000
Scott: That hasn't changed in forever.

140
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:37,452
Rym: Now, I didn't mind it so much when I was young, but the combat was fun back then, and by the time I got tedious, I'd already moved on, and I had just invented free time to spend playing these games.

141
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:41,459
Rym: No, not so much, and I just get annoyed when I have to fight more often than I wanted to.

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,484
Scott: So, the new Final Fantasy XII combat, from what I've read and from what I've seen, works kinda like this.

143
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:52,620
Scott: You have a bunch of characters, and you set AI on them.

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,029
Scott: Now, the AI isn't like other AIs, where you set, like, you know, "Okay, you attack a lot, and you defend a lot, and you heal a

145
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:00,270
Scott: lot.".

146
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,456
Scott: It's not simple like that.

147
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:19,004
Scott: It's, you set things called "gambits" on the characters, where you can say, you lay out very specific strategies, like, "You rush in and attack, and when your HP is low, run back, and, you know, you, you know, cast this spell, but when the HP is low, cast your healing

148
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:19,607
Scott: spell.".

149
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:24,169
Rym: Like an extremely advanced version of the Secret of Mana AI.

150
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,740
Rym: Extremely advanced and specific.

151
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,679
Scott: Yeah, you tell everyone exactly, pretty much almost exactly what to do.

152
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,144
Scott: Then, you kinda point your characters in a direction and go, and they just constantly fight.

153
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:43,275
Scott: Like, you just point them north, and they'll start walking north, and as you encounter bad guys, they'll go over and fight them.

154
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:49,300
Scott: It'll look like, it looks like a bunch of people running through terrain while fighting bad guys.

155
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,392
Scott: You know, it's pretty cinematic and whatnot.

156
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:52,519
Rym: It sounds really badass.

157
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,111
Scott: The problem with this is, well, let's forget the problem.

158
00:08:56,392 --> 00:09:10,980
Scott: One more thing about it is that you get this, too, this passive mode and active mode, and it's basically the old active and wait business, where in the passive mode, if you pause to change something, the fighting will stop, and in active mode, the fighting will continue if you go to the menu.

159
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,700
Rym: I played every Final Fantasy that had that option in passive mode.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,240
Scott: I always played with wait, as opposed to active, so yeah, it's the same thing.

161
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:24,846
Scott: Anyway, the thing people are complaining about is, is that once you set up the AI, you don't really do anything.

162
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:28,806
Scott: You just kinda point forward and go, and your guys do everything on their own.

163
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:29,790
Scott: You don't have to touch anything.

164
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:39,654
Scott: Now, on the one hand, that makes me really happy, because I hate having to push A a million times to continue, and it's, you know, it gets past the annoying parts of the game.

165
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:43,525
Scott: On the other hand, so what's the game?

166
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:44,951
Scott: You're not doing anything.

167
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:50,093
Rym: Well, I guess it depends on how often you have to change up the strategy or how long these sequences are.

168
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:52,484
Rym: I mean, is it a game of walk around and talk to people?

169
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,934
Rym: Is it a game of find the secrets in the dungeon?

170
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:59,859
Rym: Is it a game of make the party that'll make it through the dangerous area and pick the right path to do it?

171
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:05,422
Scott: We don't quite know yet, because I haven't played it, and I've only read a few sparse writings on the internet.

172
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,634
Rym: Yeah, well, it's on, what, the PlayStation 2?

173
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:07,815
Scott: Yep.

174
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:12,840
Rym: Well, we're probably gonna get a PlayStation 2 whenever the 3 comes out, so maybe we'll pick it up when it comes out over here.

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,870
Scott: The other thing, there are two other things.

176
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,002
Scott: Number one, you don't get gold from enemies anymore.

177
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,920
Scott: All you do is find gold and treasure, and then you can sell treasure to get gold.

178
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,260
Scott: When you're in towns, you can't just walk around talking to people, like in the olden days.

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,057
Scott: Some people will talk to you, and some people won't talk to you, and if someone's gonna talk to you, they'll have a little bubble above their head that says, "I will talk to

180
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:32,178
Scott: you.".

181
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,892
Scott: So you don't just walk up to random people and say,

182
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:35,154
Scott: "Hey.".

183
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,221
Scott: They'll just be like, "Who the hell are you

184
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:36,663
Scott: going?".

185
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,663
Rym: Well, it seems to me that in original old Final Fantasies, you didn't walk up to people and say,

186
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:40,884
Rym: "Hey.".

187
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,958
Rym: You walk up to people, and they would just tell you a sentence.

188
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:44,400
Scott: Yep.

189
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,813
Rym: And if you talk to them again, they would tell you the same sentence again.

190
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,462
Rym: Sometimes that sentence would change.

191
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:54,168
Scott: I think the reason they've done this is because they wanted to add people to the town who weren't, who didn't have text.

192
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,738
Scott: That way they could make more highly populated areas.

193
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,642
Rym: Which is a good idea.

194
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:58,846
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

195
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:06,694
Scott: But yeah, it seems like on the one hand, they tried to appease people like me by making combat less tedious, which pissed off all the people.

196
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:11,451
Scott: Literally, I think I saw a guy who said, "Man, I want to push buttons.

197
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,176
Scott: I don't want my combat to just

198
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:13,638
Scott: happen.".

199
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:15,586
Scott: I'm like, "Okay, so you want to push A a million

200
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:16,028
Scott: times.".

201
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,870
Rym: Yeah, I was always the kind of gamer, even when I liked these games, because I freaking love Final Fantasy IV.

202
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,843
Rym: Whenever I could, I would just hold down A to B to combat.

203
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:24,244
Scott: Yep.

204
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:29,443
Rym: I actually unequipped Rose's arrows most of the time so that I could just hold down A and not waste my arrows.

205
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:30,486
Scott: Wow.

206
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:31,588
Scott: Yeah.

207
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,450
Scott: Crazy.

208
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:41,637
Scott: Yeah, but at the same time, it's kind of appeasing people like me and pissing off the Final Fantasy crazies who like the combat bullshit.

209
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:47,160
Scott: It doesn't really make me want to play it any more than the other ones because, you know, there's no game there.

210
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,083
Rym: Well, there might be.

211
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,610
Rym: I mean, we have to play it and actually see.

212
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:51,735
Scott: There might be.

213
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:56,354
Scott: I still have to play it, sure, but I'm really not interested in playing it.

214
00:11:56,374 --> 00:12:04,048
Scott: I'm just interested in looking at it, you know, because it's like normally if they came out with a Final Fantasy and it was just like all the others, I wouldn't even want to look at it.

215
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,461
Scott: Now, because they changed something, I just want to see it.

216
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:07,742
Rym: Maybe I'll pick it up.

217
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:08,724
Scott: All right, all you.

218
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:18,138
Rym: All right, so things of the day.

219
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:26,727
Rym: Now, I have a non-video game one, though it's cell phone, so it's all kind of related, but I think Scott's thing of the day more than makes up for that.

220
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:27,531
Scott: Yeah, it does.

221
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:28,978
Scott: It's sort of a double whammy.

222
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,204
Scott: I could have split it up, but I didn't.

223
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:36,591
Rym: Yeah, we saved his for part two because I think it's the far greater thing of the day, but mine is very interesting nonetheless.

224
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:50,195
Rym: Now, it has come to my attention over the last several months that the great majority of India, the nation of India, are basically Luddites or people who have absolutely no understanding of technology.

225
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:53,107
Rym: They seem to be generally superstitious people.

226
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:57,506
Scott: But wait, isn't this the country that sends all its people to America to learn about technology?

227
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,197
Rym: There are a lot of smart people in India, in the cities.

228
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:08,427
Rym: Now, basically what's been happening recently, and there have been countless stories similar to this on FARC, but this one caught my eye.

229
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:18,597
Rym: Apparently, someone is calling cell phones in eastern India with 11 or 12 or 14 digit numbers instead of the 10 digit numbers they're used to.

230
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,066
Rym: And these numbers are invalid, so you can't call them back.

231
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,055
Rym: And they're calling them devil numbers.

232
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:32,412
Rym: And they, a lot of people now believe that these phone numbers, if someone calls you and you answer it, you'll get sick or your family will die or something horrible will happen.

233
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:33,214
Rym: What?

234
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,418
Rym: Yeah.

235
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:34,900
Scott: What?

236
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:41,403
Rym: Like, this is widespread and the leaders of various cities and areas out there are trying to calm people down.

237
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:46,258
Scott: So wait, how are these large phone numbers show up in the first place?

238
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,904
Rym: Oh, I don't know, they're looking into that.

239
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,440
Scott: Okay, so it's like a weird technology problem or something?

240
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:55,197
Rym: Well, it could have been international calls, but, and it still might be.

241
00:13:55,217 --> 00:14:02,846
Rym: The thing is, the authorities believe that this is an effort by someone who plans to sell antivirus for cell phones in the future to scare people.

242
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:03,890
Rym: Could be.

243
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,094
Rym: Because if you answer, a lot of times, you'll get a person who says like, "Your family will die," or- Oh, really?

244
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:11,416
Rym: Yeah.

245
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,725
Rym: Or at least that's what they've been saying.

246
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:17,020
Rym: There's been no actual evidence that anything has happened at all.

247
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,226
Scott: So it could just be a wacky rumor?

248
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:32,120
Rym: It's crazy rumors, but one guy who was interviewed, I think in the article I linked to, actually said that he answered one of these calls, and a guy told him that his cell phone could blow up if he receives calls from these numbers.

249
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,314
Rym: So he turned his cell phone off because he was afraid his phone would blow up.

250
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:36,580
Scott: Wow, what an idiot.

251
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,643
Rym: Yeah.

252
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:44,675
Rym: The best quote was some guy who seems to be some sort of authority over there, basically keeps saying over and over again, "This is all rubbish.

253
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,016
Rym: It's all

254
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:45,398
Rym: rubbish.".

255
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,374
Scott: Well, at least the authorities in India seem to be intelligent.

256
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,619
Rym: Yeah, they investigated it.

257
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,529
Rym: They believed everyone.

258
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,957
Rym: They said, "All right, well, we'll check it out,".

259
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,645
Rym: and they went out there and they couldn't find anything.

260
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:56,368
Rym: Nothing at all.

261
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:04,097
Scott: And they come up with a somewhat reasonable explanation that's plausible, such as virus guy trying to make an antivirus.

262
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,492
Rym: But no one believes it, and there's general mass hysteria in these areas.

263
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,120
Scott: It's almost the opposite of our country.

264
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,110
Scott: Well, not exactly the opposite, but where there are smart people and they're trying to tell the government to do smart things, the government's all stupid.

265
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,928
Scott: In India, the government's all smart and the people hate it because they're all stupid.

266
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,138
Rym: Why don't we trade governments with India?

267
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,524
Rym: I think we'd get along a lot better.

268
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,291
Scott: Dude, that'd be awesome.

269
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:25,998
Scott: Totally awesome.

270
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,491
Scott: All right, so this is probably an amazing thing of the day.

271
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:38,417
Rym: Now, remember way, way back when my thing of the day was like 15 seconds of video from one of those Philips CDI Zelda games?

272
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:44,841
Scott: Yeah, if you don't remember, or if you didn't listen to this old episode or whatever, I'll explain this to you once again.

273
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:49,557
Scott: There was a video game system known as the Philips CDI, made by Philips.

274
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,661
Scott: They're still around.

275
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,544
Scott: They make DVD players.

276
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,612
Rym: It was a collaboration with Nintendo.

277
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:53,772
Rym: Well, no.

278
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,800
Rym: Well, it was going to be.

279
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,286
Rym: Nintendo jumped out of that deal.

280
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,133
Scott: No, you totally have it wrong.

281
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:06,347
Scott: Philips was going to do some CD stuff for the SNES.

282
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:06,788
Scott: Yep.

283
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:10,298
Scott: Until then, Sony was going to do some CD stuff for the SNES.

284
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,225
Scott: However, both of them, it was like Philips was going to do it and they dropped out, and then Sony was going to do it and they dropped out.

285
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,439
Scott: When Philips dropped out, they took the remnants and made the CDI.

286
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,033
Scott: When Sony dropped out, they took the remnants and made the PlayStation.

287
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:26,647
Rym: Well, the thing was they had the right to use Nintendo franchises.

288
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:35,019
Scott: No, out of some weird contract that Philips had with Nintendo, they still retained the right to make like two Zelda games or three Zelda games.

289
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,426
Rym: The Zelda franchise, they had the right to.

290
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,360
Scott: I don't know, but they don't have it anymore, so it's not a big deal.

291
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,822
Rym: Yeah, they made the three games they could make and then they were done and then the console disappeared.

292
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:51,589
Scott: So there are three Zelda games for this system called the Philips CDI that exists that almost no one has played and no one wants to play.

293
00:16:52,532 --> 00:17:01,463
Scott: Thanks to the magic of the internet, the animated openings and endings to two of these games are now available for your viewing displeasure.

294
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:06,099
Rym: Now, was it you who said that these games apparently look like Swedish animated porn?

295
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,144
Scott: No, I think it was the internet that said they look like European animated porn, and yeah, they do.

296
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:15,842
Rym: What scares me the most is that the ends of the two games are pretty much identical.

297
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,992
Scott: Yeah, and Ganon's exactly identical.

298
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:19,974
Scott: Ganon's actually funny.

299
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:23,286
Rym: Yeah, he almost says the exact same thing in both of the endings too.

300
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,576
Scott: You bring light to my lair, you will die!

301
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,579
Scott: No, it burns!

302
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,027
Scott: Yeah, it's hilarious.

303
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:38,063
Scott: If you know anything about Zelda and you watch this, you'll pee your pants.

304
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:47,081
Rym: Yeah, I mean, most people have, I mean, I played two of these games in a Sears where they had a Philips CDI on display and they were trying to sell it when I was a little kid.

305
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,551
Rym: And way, way back, I totally forgot about that.

306
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:59,588
Rym: And I had this memory in my skull of playing a weird game where you were Zelda, and I could never find any reference to it, I didn't know what it was, until the internet appeared.

307
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:00,350
Scott: Yep.

308
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:07,036
Scott: The one thing I remembered about the Philips CDI is something that it was hard to find but was validated was the roller controller.

309
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,642
Scott: It has this controller.

310
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,773
Scott: you can get with a giant yellow ball that you kind of roll.

311
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,700
Scott: It's weird, but it exists.

312
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,251
Rym: I'd never actually seen that controller, it was a normal controller.

313
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,436
Scott: That's all I remembered about.

314
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:19,163
Scott: the Philips CDI was that controller.

315
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,010
Rym: I wonder if any games even use that controller.

316
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,123
Scott: Whenever someone said Philips CDI, I just thought of that controller.

317
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:26,977
Scott: And then when I looked for Philips CDI, I didn't see that controller.

318
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:27,721
Scott: And I was like, "What the hell is

319
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,042
Scott: that?".

320
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:28,543
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:32,274
Scott: And then I found the controller and I was no longer insane.

322
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:39,034
Rym: So, let this be a lesson to Nintendo to never let anyone else ever get a hold of your intellectual property ever.

323
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,822
Scott: Yeah, um, yeah.

324
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:44,451
Rym: I mean, I don't know what the deal was, why.

325
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:47,140
Rym: Nintendo must have signed a stupid contract.

326
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:50,210
Scott: No, don't even ask about it, alright?

327
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:55,712
Rym: Actually, I read a story a long time ago that explained the contract and why Philips had the right, but I don't remember now.

328
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,782
Rym: If I can find it again, it'll be a thing of the day.

329
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,032
Scott: Remember, this was the stupid era of Nintendo.

330
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:13,689
Scott: Towards the end of the SNES days, if they didn't mess- if they weren't stupid at that time, there wouldn't be any Xboxes or PlayStations or anything because all the Final Fantasies would have been on the next Nintendo that was powered by CDs and it would have all been amazing.

331
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:22,599
Rym: Yep, because, I mean, there were some- and all that fiasco happened where, you know, Final Fantasy was on the PlayStation.

332
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:23,564
Scott: Yeah, think about it.

333
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:32,886
Scott: If that one point in history was different, we wouldn't have had Mario 64, we would have had Mario 32, and it would have had PlayStation 3D graphics and all kinds of craziness.

334
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:33,891
Scott: The whole world would be different.

335
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:35,700
Rym: I don't think Microsoft would have had a chance.

336
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,421
Scott: Nothing.

337
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:38,631
Scott: Nintendo would have just blown everyone away.

338
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:43,118
Scott: Final Fantasy VII would have been that other game that we've seen, like, two screenshots from and that's it.

339
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,361
Rym: Hehehehe.

340
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:45,023
Scott: Yep.

341
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:49,620
Rym: So anyway, it's, uh, gaming day, and we've got two games to review.

342
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:50,722
Scott: Hooray!

343
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:56,981
Scott: I've played, uh- well, I downloaded somewhat legitimately and played- Somewhat.

344
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:57,784
Scott: Somewhat.

345
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:07,776
Scott: Uh, Galactic Civilizations 2, which is sort of like- it's a sequel, obviously, to Galactic Civilizations 1, but it's basically Master of Orion 5.

346
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:20,683
Rym: Yep, and not too long ago, Scott and I hung out with a couple of, uh, geeks/nerds in the basement, in a basement lab, like a creepy kind of place in Vassar College, and we played Starfarers of Catan for the first time.

347
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:23,892
Scott: Which is, uh, settlers, but in space.

348
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:27,463
Rym: So, both- And with- with rocket ships and such.

349
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:27,965
Scott: Yep.

350
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,553
Rym: Alright, so let's do, uh, Starfarers first.

351
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:31,175
Scott: Alright.

352
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:42,650
Rym: Now, if any of you have never played a Catan game, you know, Settlers of Catan, Starfarers of Catan, Seafarers of Catan, Kids of Catan, Settlers of Canaan.

353
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,317
Rym: Yeah, Cities and Knights of Catan.

354
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:46,781
Scott: Yeah, you get the idea.

355
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:53,871
Rym: Yeah, they're all- they're basically- these are like the introductory- everyone who's hooked on German board games probably played this game first.

356
00:20:54,413 --> 00:21:00,543
Scott: You can play Settlers on the internet in, like, ten different places, the best of which is actually Microsoft's version, but I don't think it's very free.

357
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:01,306
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:08,772
Rym: Now, to go over it very, very briefly, Settlers games are basically along the lines of you have colonies or towns or something.

359
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:11,784
Rym: You put them out there, they generate resources from the map.

360
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,894
Rym: You need resources to build more things.

361
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:15,842
Rym: You can trade resources with other players.

362
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:17,650
Rym: First one to build X things wins.

363
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:23,652
Rym: Now, Settlers games, well Catan games, are all usually very fun, but they're all fairly broken.

364
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:34,860
Rym: At least, I'd say most of them are broken in the sense that once everyone knows how to play, and once everyone plays well, it's no longer a game of skill, it's just a game of luck because everyone makes the exact perfect decision every round.

365
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:41,709
Scott: Yeah, basically, there's dice rolling, and that's the first thing that happens in anyone's turn, is you roll dice to see who gets resources.

366
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:47,494
Scott: Now, if your numbers keep coming up, then you're probably going to do a lot better than someone whose numbers don't keep coming up.

367
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:51,111
Scott: And everyone knows the odds of all the different numbers coming up.

368
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,840
Scott: I mean, it's 2d6, it's obvious.

369
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,945
Scott: I mean, 6s and 8s come up the most.

370
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:59,923
Scott: Well, 7s come up the most, but there are no 7s because that's the way the game works.

371
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:07,175
Scott: So, you know, everyone tries to put their guys on the 6s and the 8s, unless someone's stupid, and if someone's stupid, well, then they lose.

372
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:16,532
Scott: But, you know, it always turns out where, like, 5s and 10s come up all too much, and I'm never on 5 and 10, and because of that I lose, even though I have plenty of guys on 6 and 8.

373
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:23,020
Scott: If everyone plays optimally, and everyone knows what they're doing, it's all the random dice, and it's kind of bleh.

374
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,280
Rym: Now, the best thing about a Settler's Game, though, is that even experienced players can enjoy a Settler's Game that they haven't played often, or they haven't played before.

375
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:33,439
Scott: We've never played Starfarers before, this is our first time ever.

376
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,760
Rym: And I can describe Starfarers in just a very short, short sentence.

377
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,550
Rym: "Pirates come and fuck you at every turn.

378
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,217
Rym: The world consists of nothing but

379
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:44,739
Rym: pirates.".

380
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:45,970
Scott: Well, universe.

381
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:46,698
Scott: Galaxy.

382
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:48,054
Rym: Uh, yeah.

383
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,841
Scott: Yeah.

384
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:53,620
Scott: Basically, there are these cards, and you want these cards to get turned over.

385
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,120
Rym: But it's always just pirates.

386
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,280
Scott: Yeah, you turn over the card, and let's pretend that one of the cards is turned over, and I have to read the card to Rym.

387
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,580
Rym: Alright, that means that the card is going to affect me, and he's just reading it, so I don't know how it works.

388
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,121
Scott: Right.

389
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,296
Scott: So, every card is basically the sequence of logic.

390
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:23,800
Scott: Like, you propose, you read what the card says, then the player makes a decision, and then you follow that path on the card based on the decision they made, and read the next thing, and eventually you arrive at a result of what happens in the game based on the player's decisions.

391
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,778
Rym: Almost every one of them starts with, "You run afoul of space

392
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:28,220
Rym: pirates.".

393
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:28,811
Scott: Alright, you ready?

394
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:29,219
Scott: Let's do it.

395
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,014
Rym: Alright, alright.

396
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,406
Scott: Uh, okay Rym.

397
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,678
Scott: I got the card here.

398
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,991
Scott: You run afoul of space pirates.

399
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,560
Scott: They demand tribute.

400
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,318
Scott: Give them gold, give them three resource points to go away, or not?

401
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:41,590
Rym: Uh, no.

402
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,179
Rym: Fuck them.

403
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,460
Scott: The space pirates attack you and take all your resource cards.

404
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,120
Rym: Bastards.

405
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,440
Scott: But gain one, uh, hero discy, fame disc.

406
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,434
Scott: Because you stood up for, uh...

407
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,100
Rym: Yeah, I mean, the cards are actually a really neat mechanic.

408
00:23:56,383 --> 00:24:01,560
Rym: It becomes broken when you've played the game enough to where you know all the cards, and you know how they all work.

409
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,856
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, uh, it's sort of like this double-edged sword.

410
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:11,686
Scott: On the one hand, the cards aren't very varied, because if, you know, if they were varied, they might be more interesting.

411
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,335
Scott: Like, "Ooh, this is a different kind of card,

412
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:13,737
Scott: hooray!".

413
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:21,060
Scott: But at the same time, if they were all varied, then as soon as you heard the beginning of them, you'd know exactly what the card was if you had played before.

414
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,105
Scott: So the fact that there are, like, ten cards that start with "Pirates,".

415
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:29,620
Scott: you don't know which of the ten cards it is, so there's still your gambling when you make your decision.

416
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,580
Rym: Now, the other interesting aspect of the game, aside from these cards, are the spaceships.

417
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,740
Scott: The spaceships are awesome.

418
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,780
Rym: These are probably the most enduring icon of this game.

419
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,740
Rym: Every player gets a giant, well-designed plastic spaceship.

420
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,280
Rym: The spaceship has places on it to stick various kinds of upgrades that you get throughout the game.

421
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:56,860
Rym: In addition, the spaceship is filled with multi-colored balls, and when you shake the spaceship up and then put it down, two of those balls become visible, and that is how you roll.

422
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,520
Scott: Yep, well, it's not how you roll the dice for resources, but it is how you roll to see how well your spaceship does every round.

423
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,632
Rym: Yep, and just various tests in the game.

424
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:06,800
Rym: It's also how cards appear.

425
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,460
Scott: Yep, it's usually fighting against other players.

426
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,320
Rym: Now, the basic game is just like any Settlers game.

427
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,600
Rym: You start on some planets, you want to colonize more planets.

428
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,560
Rym: Some planets have crap on them, you've got to get the crap off before you can put your guys there.

429
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:28,779
Scott: I hate that, because it's like, you can get somewhere and colonize it, but it has this terrible, like, block on it, and you can't get the block off because you don't have enough other stuff.

430
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
Rym: Yep, and of course, there's pirates about.

431
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:33,035
Scott: Arrrrrrr.

432
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:46,380
Rym: Now, honestly, even though the game is broken just like every other Catan game is, if you have a bunch of friends who like German board games and have never played Starfares of Catan before, it's well worth it to get them all together and play that game a few times.

433
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,559
Scott: This is the kind of game where if you're at a convention or something and you see the game there, just pick, and you've never played it, pick it up and do it.

434
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Scott: But I wouldn't recommend you buy it, because it's kind of big and expensive.

435
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,559
Rym: Yeah, convince someone else to buy it.

436
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,260
Scott: Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

437
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,587
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,600
Scott: Because they'll play it like one or two times, and then the bottom of the spaceship seems to break.

439
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,460
Scott: Like, the little things that hold the boosters on seem to break, so you'd feel really bad if it was your spaceship's breaking, but if it's someone else's, who cares?

440
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,140
Rym: Now, the one thing about the game is the way it's designed, it's very hard to run away with the game.

441
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:35,880
Scott: Yeah, like in the original Settlers, plain old Settlers, you can frickin, if you build a couple cities and some settlements before other people do, or you go at just the right time and they keep rolling your number, you can just get 10 points and everyone else can't do anything.

442
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:43,860
Rym: Yeah, this game basically has a lot of Mario Kart kind of elastics in there that'll hold a front player's back and back player's front, just a little bit.

443
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,158
Scott: Yeah, like I was doing pretty poorly, and then all of a sudden, who knows, I'm in second place, and then, uh, I didn't do so well, but...

444
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:59,646
Rym: Yeah, and meanwhile, I was in last place for a while, but meanwhile, everyone's colonizing, I have craps, I just made a couple ships and I sent them off into the far reaches of space and forgot about them.

445
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:01,800
Rym: Like, everyone was ignoring me because I was losing.

446
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:13,220
Rym: And those ships eventually made it to the planets on the other side of the board, I colonized them, I got one victory point away from winning, then I sat there almost winning and failing over and over again until someone else won.

447
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:24,544
Scott: Yeah, my problem was two of my ships during the game just, like, went to go colonize places, and then when they got there, couldn't actually colonize, or someone else, like, jumped right in front of me.

448
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:36,740
Scott: So I ended up with these ships that were trying to do something, but for, like, I could have had, like, you know, four ships worth of stuff, but in the end I had two ships that didn't do anything because they couldn't get anywhere fast enough.

449
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:46,420
Rym: The game also has a really cool alien science kind of thing where you can go off and talk to aliens, and you get victory points, and two, you get technology from them.

450
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:50,420
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are these, what, four or five alien spots on the board?

451
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,716
Rym: Just things like, now your boosters are faster, or, etc.

452
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:59,120
Scott: Yeah, you go to them and you trade goods with them, and I think there are five spots for each alien, and there are five cards.

453
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:04,900
Rym: Yeah, and whoever has, you can control the aliens, whoever controls the aliens gets two extra victory points, kind of like longest road.

454
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:15,449
Scott: Yeah, and each alien has a different kind of bonus, like, one of them has, like, bonuses to your ship, and one of them has bonuses to your resources, and one of them has, like, the cheating bonus.

455
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,020
Scott: that kind of unbalances the game.

456
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,472
Rym: Yep.

457
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,050
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,260
Scott: So you just, you know, you try to trade with those aliens to get stuff, and whatever.

459
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,600
Rym: But it was a fun game.

460
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:30,040
Rym: If anything, it's in the old style of German board game, in that high production values, lots of little bits.

461
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,720
Scott: Yeah, it's more the family type of game than the hardcore type of game, I would say.

462
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:44,139
Rym: Once again, like Scott said, it's a great game to get people into games like this at a con, or to get the creepy old guy with a lot of money to buy and then play it with him.

463
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:52,020
Scott: Oh yeah, this, if you got a family too, they'll love this, because they'll just love, anyone will love playing with the spaceships, no matter how hard the game itself actually is.

464
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:58,180
Rym: And of course, it's a thousand times more intellectually stimulating than Monopoly or Life.

465
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,760
Scott: Yeah, Life.

466
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:03,400
Scott: I heard the greatest quote about the game of Life on this board game podcast.

467
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,597
Scott: He said, "The worst game in the world with the best spinner in the

468
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:06,919
Scott: world.".

469
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:12,120
Rym: Actually, my parents, when I was young, we used to play Life like once a month, like a thing.

470
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:17,939
Rym: And all I remember is that I learned how to get exactly whatever number I wanted, no matter what with that spinner.

471
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Scott: Best spinner in the world.

472
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:21,039
Rym: Yeah, they were none too pleased with that.

473
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,100
Scott: We had to put graphite on our spinner to get it all lubricated and such.

474
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:27,399
Scott: It was a nice trick.

475
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,180
Scott: That thing was, they would literally fly, like, zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

476
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,659
Scott: It was great.

477
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
Scott: Anyway, so, Galactic Civilizations 2.

478
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,140
Scott: Well, I could talk a long time about this game.

479
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,438
Rym: Yeah, I didn't actually play it.

480
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,059
Scott: All right, so, if you've ever played a Master of Orion space conquest game, this is another one of those.

481
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:46,886
Rym: Great.

482
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:52,580
Scott: Um, it does a few things better than previous versions.

483
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,859
Scott: Obviously, there's some updated graphics, et cetera, et cetera.

484
00:29:56,542 --> 00:30:01,820
Scott: New Alien Race is fancy looking spaceships, blah blah blah blah blah.

485
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,556
Scott: All that good stuff.

486
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,480
Scott: Is there a reason to play this instead of Master of Orion 2, besides the fact that it works more easily on modern computers?

487
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:11,998
Scott: Yes and no.

488
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,140
Scott: The first problem I had with this game was that I couldn't really figure out how it worked.

489
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,719
Scott: Maybe that's because I don't have the manual.

490
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,619
Scott: That, I think, had a lot to do with it.

491
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,134
Rym: I wonder why you don't have the manual, Mr.

492
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:24,100
Rym: Pirate McPirate?

493
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,020
Scott: Uh, there was that story, they wanted everyone to pirate it.

494
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,797
Scott: And I pirated it before- No, no, no, no.

495
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,139
Scott: That was before I saw the story that said, "No, we actually

496
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:33,320
Scott: don't.".

497
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:38,440
Rym: Um, I think it was obvious because the people who wanted you to pirate were, in fact, Star Force.

498
00:30:38,742 --> 00:30:39,340
Scott: Oh, it doesn't matter.

499
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:41,960
Rym: The hated evil of all the internet.

500
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,920
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter because I deleted it now.

501
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:45,480
Scott: I don't need to play this game anymore.

502
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:48,840
Rym: So they still didn't get any money.

503
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:49,718
Scott: No.

504
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,140
Scott: Which probably is fine if the game uses- So it didn't really matter.

505
00:30:55,501 --> 00:31:00,079
Rym: Yeah, if the game's as mediocre as you seem to say it was, then- Well, it's not that it's mediocre.

506
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,700
Scott: It's a really good space conquest game, if you really like space conquest games.

507
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,280
Scott: The problem, I think, is in me that I can't deal with the tedium of micromanagement anymore.

508
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,580
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I've had this problem, like I've mentioned, I've been playing Civ 2 a lot lately.

509
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:14,859
Rym: Just because I love that old game.

510
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,640
Rym: And I can't, like, it's actually painful to play on anything other than the smallest map.

511
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,380
Rym: Because with the small map, you know, I expand.

512
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:25,020
Rym: And then everyone expands.

513
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,260
Rym: And then there's just a game of, you know, manage my little civilization.

514
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,180
Rym: On the large maps, it's the game of, there's a giant island over there.

515
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,919
Rym: And no one knows it's there but me.

516
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:40,360
Rym: All I'd have to do is put settlers on it and send it over there and colonize the whole island and- But in order to do that, you have to push so many buttons.

517
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,820
Rym: It's just like, fuck it, I'll let the Aztecs have that island, whatever.

518
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:45,699
Rym: It's not worth it to me.

519
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,360
Scott: I don't want to push all the buttons necessary in order to get that island.

520
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:50,280
Rym: Yep, yep.

521
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:51,199
Scott: Even though I could.

522
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,360
Scott: It's like, I could win, I just don't want to push the button to make me win.

523
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,219
Scott: Because I'd have to push it so many times.

524
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Rym: But yet you don't want the game to just have a win button because then it's not fun.

525
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:01,673
Scott: Yep.

526
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:08,700
Scott: So, like every other civilization type game, basically what you're doing when you play is you're controlling a bunch of sliders.

527
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:17,600
Scott: And there's like sliders for each planet, sliders for the whole civilization, sliders for spaceships, and they all affect each other.

528
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:19,339
Scott: But it's kind of hard to tell how.

529
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:23,320
Scott: Like sometimes it's obvious, like, oh, if I do this, then that will happen.

530
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:30,040
Scott: But sometimes it's like, alright, how does this affect the big picture from down here on this little old planet?

531
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,120
Rym: Is there anything in it like the civilopedia that tells you exactly what everything does?

532
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,980
Scott: Oh, there's text on every single thing in the game to tell you what it does.

533
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,736
Rym: Did you read it?

534
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,286
Rym: Yep.

535
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,720
Scott: But sometimes it's not, uh, like you can tell, okay, this will increase my manufacturing by two.

536
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:49,572
Scott: How much is two, you know?

537
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,160
Scott: It's like, um, will that build it this much faster?

538
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,460
Scott: Will it, would it be faster to just build something before the factory?

539
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:58,760
Scott: And you have to end up doing all this annoying math.

540
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,860
Scott: And you get like all these different numbers all over the place.

541
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:13,430
Scott: And it's like they made it lighter than something like Master of Orion 2 or 3, which is pretty heavy, but they didn't make it light enough as to where it's like.

542
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:15,160
Scott: really just an abstract game.

543
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:19,600
Scott: The other problem I have is there are three winning conditions.

544
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,420
Scott: There's the research winning condition, the military, and the cultural one.

545
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:28,900
Scott: The cultural one is the one I like to go for, because all you really have to do is build a lot of stuff.

546
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:37,980
Scott: You know, you just build like, uh, all these entertainment facilities, and then your borders just slowly expand without you having to do anything.

547
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:42,860
Scott: All you do is have planets and build stuff on them and keep building stuff.

548
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:46,980
Scott: And eventually you'll just conquer the galaxy without doing anything, except building.

549
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:51,560
Scott: If you want to do the research one, well it's pretty similar.

550
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,499
Scott: You just have to go around and micromanage all your planets to maximize research, and then just keep researching until you win.

551
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:01,119
Scott: And you want to trade a lot of research if you do that also.

552
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,764
Scott: The military one, see this is the one that's always a problem, is the.

553
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:09,500
Scott: the fun way to play is military, because you fly spaceships at each other and they shoot.

554
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:12,620
Scott: I actually didn't experience combat once.

555
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,755
Scott: Not once.

556
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,385
Rym: Wow.

557
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:20,659
Rym: No matter how peaceful a game I ever try to play in Civ 2, it always ends up with like, the Zulus coming in with tanks.

558
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:27,679
Scott: Well you see, I always researched the technologies that added to my diplomacy, and I gave myself a diplomacy bonus when I customized my race.

559
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,820
Scott: So because I'm playing against the computer, they'll do whatever I say.

560
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:31,591
Rym: Uh-huh.

561
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:39,659
Scott: I can see this being a problem in multiplayer, because diplomacy points don't mean shit, and there's so many buildings- You know what happened?

562
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,976
Rym: Rym's tanks would come in.

563
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:57,620
Scott: There's so many buildings that just, and stuff in the game that gives you diplomacy points, that, you know, it's such a key part of the strategy, that the multiplayer I think would just break it, unless they like, maybe you could use diplomacy points to force other people's hands.

564
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,860
Rym: Well I mean, I just use Civ 2 because I consider it one of the best games of this type ever.

565
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,019
Rym: And because I haven't played Civ 4, which people have said is better, but I don't know.

566
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:17,400
Rym: But in that game, even in the multiplayer, like say you have the Great Wall, or some sort of high diplomacy, the game would actually force other people to offer peace, or a ceasefire, or things like that.

567
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,359
Rym: It would force their hand.

568
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,120
Scott: Yeah, but Shoukei, a guy agrees to peace.

569
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,859
Scott: He can still break the peace and shoot you.

570
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,699
Rym: Yeah, unless the game decides to not let him do that for X turns, or has penalties for doing so.

571
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:28,371
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,080
Rym: Maybe your government gets overthrown, maybe some aliens appear and kill you, I don't know.

573
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:46,440
Scott: That is one thing I really liked in this game, is once you get past the initial stages, you get to Republic and Democratic type of governments, and what'll happen is every turn is a week, right, in game time.

574
00:35:47,501 --> 00:36:13,300
Scott: Every so often, there'll be an election, and you'll actually see, you know, if you don't have enough influence, which is one of the sliders that you can't control directly, you just build things to increase influence, if you don't have enough influence over your people, then you'll get voted out of your government, and you can see they'll actually do an election with a picture of a parliament or whatever, and the voting, and what percent of the voting you got.

575
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:14,539
Rym: What happens if you get voted out?

576
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,860
Rym: Do you just overthrow the government and come back, or what?

577
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,239
Scott: Actually, what I think happens is if you are voted favorably, you get a bonus.

578
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,520
Scott: Like, I was always voted favorably.

579
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,500
Scott: I had the majority party, like, all the time, so I got a plus 20 to my economic bonus.

580
00:36:31,103 --> 00:36:34,501
Scott: If I would have been voted down, I would have had, like, a minus 20.

581
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:39,820
Rym: Wait, so all we'd have to do if we lived in that world is always vote for whoever's in office, and then the economy's just booming?

582
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:52,040
Scott: Yes, but the problem is that, from a game perspective, it's if you want to be a democracy, you have the chance to get a bonus if you keep your influence up.

583
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:57,380
Scott: If you don't pick democracy, you can forget influence, but other people might be getting a bonus.

584
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,360
Scott: But on the other hand, if you choose democracy and don't keep the influence up, you're gonna get a minus.

585
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:02,989
Rym: Huh.

586
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,979
Scott: There are other cool things that happen, like, a lot of games have random events, like, this happened, you know, what do you do?

587
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,100
Scott: Or it's like, this happened, your people die.

588
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:17,499
Scott: In this game, it's this happened, and it gives you three choices.

589
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,200
Scott: The three choices are usually, like, evil, good, and yin yang, you know, and they'll have different effects.

590
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,619
Scott: Like, your people are protesting, what do you do?

591
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:27,658
Scott: Shoot them.

592
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,200
Scott: Yeah, it's like, freedom of speech, well, then you're gonna have, you know, this effect.

593
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,438
Scott: Uh, yin yang, no effect.

594
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,239
Scott: Or, uh, evil, you shoot them.

595
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,919
Scott: And then there's another effect for that.

596
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,270
Rym: Ha ha.

597
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:47,240
Scott: But, like, if you do the evil thing, the evil thing, like, might increase research, but at the same time, the people won't like you, and you'll lose influence.

598
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:48,239
Scott: That sort of thing.

599
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:48,646
Rym: Huh.

600
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:55,640
Scott: And the third thing is, every once in a while, every single race in the galaxy will meet and vote on some sort of galactic law.

601
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,980
Rym: I always thought this was a really cool part of the game from what Scott was telling me earlier.

602
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:03,596
Scott: Yeah, like, every so often, it'll say, "Next week, the galactic whatever

603
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:03,879
Scott: meets."

604
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:04,920
Scott: I forget what it's called.

605
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:13,059
Scott: And you'll see every alien race, and everyone gets votes based on population, so if you have the biggest population in the galaxy, you're gonna have the most votes.

606
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,520
Scott: And, like, we're talking tens of thousands of votes here.

607
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,840
Rym: Now, can you choose to ignore, uh, intergalactic law?

608
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,380
Scott: Uh, I don't know, 'cause I never really ran into any of these laws.

609
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:24,057
Rym: Uh huh.

610
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:30,720
Scott: But there will be something such as, you know, uh, transports are very vulnerable in this war-ridden galaxy.

611
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,320
Scott: Currently, the law says you can't have any guns on transport ships.

612
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:39,179
Scott: These are ships that carry goods and services, you know, on the trade routes.

613
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,234
Scott: It'll be like, "Should we allow guns on transport ships, and if so, how

614
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:44,520
Scott: many?".

615
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:49,040
Scott: And you'll have like four choices, like zero, one, three, and five.

616
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:50,498
Scott: And then you choose.

617
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,479
Scott: And then whatever the races of the galaxy decide will become law.

618
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:57,560
Scott: And this happens, and the law will last for like x years.

619
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,900
Scott: Or, it'll say how long the law will last.

620
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,620
Scott: Sometimes the laws are permanent, sometimes they're a year, sometimes they're two years, who knows.

621
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,048
Rym: Huh.

622
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:20,320
Scott: And it's kinda interesting, because it's like the rules of the game change game to game, you know, it's like, there are only so many trade routes you can make to other, uh, you know, it's like, trade routes are kinda like caravans in Civ 2, only you can't keep sending them.

623
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:32,559
Scott: It's like, you create a trade route, physically, you can see the routes on the map, they're colored lines, going from planet to planet, and, you know, they just constantly create money for you, but you can only have so many of them.

624
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Scott: But, how many you can have depends on a lot of factors.

625
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:42,358
Scott: So it's like, I tried to build as many as I can just to have lots of money, and then I used the money to just buy stuff, instead of building it.

626
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:44,760
Scott: 'Cause I wanted to get the game over with.

627
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:45,399
Scott: Yeah.

628
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,219
Scott: It seemed to work.

629
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:54,676
Scott: But, basically the game is, if you wanna play a space civilization game, this is the one right now.

630
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,400
Scott: But, I still kinda like Master of Orion 2 better.

631
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:10,479
Scott: Also, I haven't played the combat in this, but the feeling I'm getting is that, if you want to do the military, you have to micromanage to all hell, and customize little spaceships, and all kinds of crazy shit.

632
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,560
Rym: Man, that would be awesome.

633
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,020
Rym: You know, 15 years ago when I had free time.

634
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:14,694
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:28,438
Scott: But, um, basically if you like space civilization games, I don't think you can afford to miss this if you, but if you're just kinda casual, you probably shouldn't play space civilization games at all.

636
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:34,840
Scott: Or if you do, play one that's a little more abstract and easier.

637
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,058
Rym: I can't think of any.

638
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:36,618
Scott: No.

639
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:37,116
Rym: If any.

640
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,700
Scott: Star Control, but Star Control is a slightly different kind of game.

641
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,500
Scott: It's more like a space adventure game, even though you do build colonies and such.

642
00:40:46,161 --> 00:41:15,059
Rym: So, that's pretty much it for today, but I'd like to say that way back, well not way back, but when we went to UberCon where we talked up Burning Wheel, and we said we'd do an episode sometime in the future, and, you know, interviews with maybe Luke Crane and all that sort of thing, and we haven't done that yet, but I'll just tell you all who may be wondering that we're all making characters and reading the books, and playing around with Burning Wheel to make sure we know it, and we'll probably do an episode on it real soon, the next time we have all our friends over, we're gonna try to run a one-off of the game on our own.

643
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,079
Scott: Holy crap.

644
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,539
Rym: Without help from the Luke-ski.

645
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,800
Scott: Yeah, we'll see how much that works.

646
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,077
Rym: We'll see if we can do it.

647
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,177
Scott: I don't know.

648
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,600
Scott: It might take like a tag team effort.

649
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,340
Rym: It might.

650
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,710
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

651
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,349
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

652
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,149
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

653
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,210
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

654
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,148
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

655
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,798
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com, and if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

656
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,250
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

657
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:08,070
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
