00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,632
Rym: It's Wednesday August 30th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:20,380
Rym: We bring you the secret panel from Otakon 2006 meaning the webcomics roundtable that we've recorded in the Renaissance Hotel on Saturday night.

3
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,716
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:28,755
Rym: So there's something I gotta get off of my chest things that are boobs hurt in this community.

5
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,279
Rym: more so now is that?

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,700
Scott: How long are we gonna carry on with this inside joke that is impossible to share with the world?

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,011
Rym: Because it may someday be shared with the world Let's try to make some progress in that area actually though.

8
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:43,596
Rym: I do have something I get off my chest.

9
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:55,832
Rym: I would like to say that Protein supplements and protein bars are perhaps the vilest Constructions known to man, that's why I don't eat them good.

10
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:58,540
Rym: fucking God do those things not taste good?

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,932
Scott: Well, I mean what tastes good in the world?

12
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,259
Scott: ready sugar.

13
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,548
Rym: There's ice all right and fat.

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,932
Scott: that's what tastes good.

15
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,436
Scott: protein does not taste good.

16
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:09,680
Scott: protein doesn't taste like anything.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,985
Rym: No protein can taste good.

18
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:11,668
Rym: protein.

19
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,559
Rym: you realize Scott is a very broad category of things.

20
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:20,140
Scott: Yeah, but you know the proteins are generally a collection of amino acids.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,598
Rym: I've got some of the best tasting meats are extremely lean and have very little fat in them at all.

22
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:26,485
Scott: Yeah, but without.

23
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:27,127
Rym: so what do you think?

24
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,311
Scott: without any fat the me?

25
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,699
Rym: so uh so what do you think is in those meats?

26
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,236
Rym: Meat okay, and what does meat made out of?

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,722
Brian: Meat?

28
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,864
Rym: yes, yes meat is made out of protein Among other things.

29
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:43,433
Scott: yeah, then how come they don't make a meat bar that tastes good.

30
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:44,777
Rym: You know what they do.

31
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:45,479
Rym: It's called jerky.

32
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,609
Scott: Haha, then why are you eating a nasty ass protein bar?

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,116
Rym: because I needed more protein.

34
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,760
Rym: see the thing is more jerky.

35
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:54,583
Rym: See that.

36
00:01:54,623 --> 00:02:07,399
Rym: the thing is just that my diet for most of my life has not been Inconducive to any sort of Non-aerobic exercise because I tend to eat a lot of carbohydrates and very little else.

37
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,579
Scott: Well, that's what the food pyramid says to eat.

38
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:19,719
Rym: Yeah Which means that I've been my scrawny self for a long time and now I need a little bit of protein because I'm trying to Lift a few weights, but do you want to be like a muscle man?

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,250
Rym: No I just want to stay in shape for Basically my entire body is in shape as in.

40
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,087
Rym: no just my legs are in shape and the rest of my body was kind of weak You know running and biking and all that.

41
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,649
Scott: so what do you?

42
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,914
Rym: so let's I always feel funny because I got my tiny little like 10-pound freeways, and then there's Pete who could probably just bench-press me.

43
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,480
Scott: all right, so let's say you're not weak anymore.

44
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,164
Scott: What do you?

45
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,840
Scott: what are you gonna do with your newfound strength powers?

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,245
Scott: You're gonna go become spider-man.

47
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:46,919
Rym: You know how much time I'll save by opening doors more quickly?

48
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,846
Scott: okay, that's Less time than you spent lifting weights.

49
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:53,591
Rym: I believe I don't.

50
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:59,297
Rym: this is another inside joke, but I'll open the hell out-of-doors That's for sure.

51
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:06,070
Rym: The only thing I wanted to say is that protein bars and protein supplements taste like assholes.

52
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:20,439
Scott: It is a general rule of thumb that 90% of foods that say they are nutritional or advertise themselves to being nutritional taste like ass or have no flavor at all and In the book of Scott that means they should not be eaten.

53
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:30,600
Rym: but anyway We're gonna go real light on the news and the things the day today because we are finally going to air the Secret panel that we ran at Otakon 2006.

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,904
Scott: you

55
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:47,760
Rym: see we generally if you listen to our coverage of Otakon or fast karate for the gentleman's coverage of Otakon or anime world orders coverage of Otakon You might have gotten the impression that many of us did not particularly care for the vast majority of the panels that happened at Otakon?

56
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,649
Scott: Yeah, of course again, you can't blame Otakon for that.

57
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,191
Rym: Oh, not at all.

58
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,281
Scott: Well, you can blame them a tiny bit for not Caring.

59
00:03:55,301 --> 00:04:01,427
Rym: Otakon's panels despite their problems were not as bad as the panels at lesser cons We attended.

60
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:02,720
Scott: that is definitely true.

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,950
Rym: Yeah, we you can listen to our old con reports to get all that.

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:17,349
Scott: but the point is that in general at pretty much every anime convention that we know of that we've been to and many of our Accomplices have been to Panels are like accomplices.

63
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:17,851
Rym: I like that.

64
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,082
Rym: Although you should have said maybe henchmen cohorts I don't know.

65
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,315
Scott: panels are sucking lately in general overall.

66
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,500
Scott: There are still good panels.

67
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,419
Scott: There is still absolutely terrible panels, but the average is going down.

68
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,076
Rym: So what we did is well actually what I did because Scott actually was out.

69
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,160
Rym: I think you were watching a terrible.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,173
Scott: I was watching some terrible ass movies.

71
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:36,294
Rym: Yeah.

72
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:37,260
Rym: Well Scott was doing that.

73
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:44,337
Rym: I was getting myself nice and drunk and then all the webcomic artists I know and the webcomic artist friends of the webcomic artists.

74
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,547
Rym: I know Ended up in our hotel room.

75
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,500
Rym: So I decided alright, I'm gonna do that thing.

76
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:57,945
Rym: I said I do that I didn't think I'd actually do and Actually sit them all down with microphones and kind of interview all of them and it turned into what I think is a pretty good Panel,

77
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:02,973
Scott: I think That the had the advantage of alcohol which normal panels do not have.

78
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:07,000
Scott: I think alcohol while I don't drink It would make every panel more interesting.

79
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:11,616
Rym: See the thing is you really couldn't tell that anyone had been drinking.

80
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:16,699
Rym: if you listen to it though I have not listened to all of it and I will say that Conrad is like that.

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,569
Rym: Anyway, regardless of the amount of alcohol in him.

82
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,813
Scott: I guess that's absolutely true.

83
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,944
Scott: I Haven't listened to.

84
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,395
Scott: I listen to the end because I showed up for the end of it.

85
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:27,359
Scott: Yep, but that's it.

86
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:33,180
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to the roundtable you help me run where you kind of just sabotage the whole thing.

87
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,286
Scott: I was mad tired.

88
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,713
Scott: I wasn't sabotaging on purpose.

89
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:36,880
Scott: I was trying to do good.

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,840
Rym: Well, the funny thing is in this one that we're gonna play.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,640
Rym: You know on this episode you can really hear My voice pretty much in the final throes of it dying because my voice is squeaking all over the place.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,717
Rym: And as you all know, we both lost our voices on Sunday.

93
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,535
Rym: Yeah Okay, I blame podcasting.

94
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,950
Rym: Oh So anyway to keep it brief in the news.

95
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,460
Rym: the anime manga comics web comics news.

96
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,907
Rym: My news is very brief very to the point.

97
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:05,339
Rym: death note volume 7 came out in English.

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,589
Scott: now It's been out in Japanese for a long time.

99
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,499
Rym: This would not normally be news.

100
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:22,600
Rym: However, for those of you who have read it You will know why I'm bringing this up as news and for those of you who haven't I will simply say that when you read Death note 7 be prepared to read the whole thing in one go and be prepared.

101
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:27,880
Scott: Death note 7 is perhaps the most important and best volume of death note.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,314
Scott: well, it contains the most important and best chapters of death note.

103
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:34,845
Scott: in my opinion it also begins the turning point.

104
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:46,319
Scott: that sort of starts phase 2 where the manga changes gears from being one thing to being another thing and I'll reserve my opinions of phase 2 for another time.

105
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:52,724
Scott: But let it be known that there are two moments in the manga that are basically Tremendously important.

106
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:56,595
Rym: if you thought some of that stuff with penber early on was a big deal.

107
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,480
Rym: You haven't seen anything.

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Scott: Yes, and both of these moments receive double dual page spreads.

109
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:15,235
Scott: The first moment should be very early on in the ma in volume 7 and the second moment should be much later on in volume 7. now the first one is my favorite and the second one is the most important.

110
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:26,716
Rym: see the second one was a Moment when I realized that there was a character in this manga that I had been a little Sympathetic to and I kind of liked and I didn't like that character anymore.

111
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:35,167
Scott: after that point all Yeah, the first part was when I realized that You know that my favorite one cuz.

112
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:38,317
Rym: well true that part too because then you realize oh I didn't.

113
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:55,193
Scott: oh It was like OMG OMG doo-doo-doo double page spread and then the next page it's like oh Yeah, you can tell we I've been wanting to talk about this since what?

114
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:02,113
Rym: over a year ago when we read this yeah And it's finally out in English meaning sometime in the near future.

115
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:03,799
Rym: We are going to do a show on death note.

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,420
Scott: We will do a show on the first half of death note with spoilers spoilers.

117
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:13,797
Rym: I got some things that I got to get off of my chest things that are hurting this community more.

118
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:22,169
Scott: So now Okay speaking of manga and other comics I don't know how long this has been on the internet.

119
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:40,573
Scott: Oh, it's only been on the internet since August 18 2006. cool this is a list of the 2005 so last year comics and graphic novel bestsellers from one to a hundred and Number one is full metal alchemist volume one.

120
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:44,086
Rym: This is in English, by the way You're not gonna read the whole freaking.

121
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:48,520
Scott: Oh, I'm not but basically it's Naruto Naruto Naruto Sin City Star Wars.

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:58,183
Scott: And then the whole rest of the list is Naruto Sin City fruit basket Star Wars Kenshin Dn angel inu yasha And death note.

123
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:03,940
Rym: now, of course the ultimate question here is how many underwear pervert aka superhero comics?

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,495
Scott: Yeah, because I mean look this is the hundred best-selling graphic novels and comics in the u.s.

125
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:18,884
Scott: In the year of 2005 and the top of it is completely dominated by manga except for Sin City and Star Wars and There is some scattered.

126
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:26,550
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes is about and I think one far side and maybe a peanut now Way at the bottom way at the bottom.

127
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,735
Scott: number 99 is our crumb.

128
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:34,755
Scott: Okay, and there's some Calvin and Hobbes down there, but number 66 is the first.

129
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,559
Scott: so there are 65 manga and other stuff.

130
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:46,717
Scott: Number 66 is Batman hush volume 2 the best-selling underwear pervert comic or graphic novel of the year.

131
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:56,098
Scott: number 48 was Attack of the deranged mutant killer monster show goons that sold better than every single underwear.

132
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:01,883
Scott: pervert 63 was Warcraft the Sunwell trilogy 1.

133
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,131
Scott: God God from Tokyo pop.

134
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,960
Scott: it sold better than every underwear pervert.

135
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,850
Scott: What yugioh number one sold better than every underwear pervert?

136
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:16,058
Rym: Yeah, you know mega Tokyo volume 3.

137
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:24,380
Scott: Oh Outsold every single underwear pervert except that single Batman beat it by two spots on the list.

138
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:25,891
Rym: you know what this means?

139
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:36,009
Rym: it means that the Not the comic industry in regards to underwear perverts aka superheroes or super - heroes Isn't doing so well.

140
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,358
Rym: No, no.

141
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:52,740
Rym: And I think the way to sum it up is that when we went to free comic book day to get our free comic books The proprietor of the comic book shop We went to seem somewhat angry that we were not willing to purchase his underwear pervert comics that we just wanted our free.

142
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,444
Scott: No, here's the best thing ready.

143
00:10:54,725 --> 00:11:05,914
Scott: The second underwear pervert on the list is Batman hush volume 1 at number 76. the third Underwear pervert is Batman Dark Knight Returns, which is actually really good.

144
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,600
Scott: It's Batman written by the Sin City guy.

145
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,168
Scott: I have it and it's damn good.

146
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:18,261
Scott: You should read it, but it's number 85. and The only other underwear pervert on the entire list is 89 Watchmen Watchmen.

147
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:30,927
Scott: perhaps the greatest underwear pervert comic ever was outsold by mega Tokyo volume 3 Warcraft something volume 1 and A whole shit ton of manga.

148
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:40,536
Rym: I hate to say it, but it makes me really happy partly because I really don't like underwear pervert comics in general and I'm kind of glad that I'm not alone in this sentiment.

149
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:46,800
Rym: and too though It makes me a little sad that Watchmen really needs to be widely read because Watchmen is excellent.

150
00:11:47,282 --> 00:12:01,080
Scott: Yeah, the general problem I have is that you know There's a whole genre of comics that involve underwear perverts and as in any genre Some of them are damn good like Watchmen and Batman Dark Knight Returns.

151
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,184
Rym: I don't think the word some.

152
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,353
Rym: I think the word one would suffice.

153
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,417
Scott: No, there are a few.

154
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:06,220
Rym: Oh three.

155
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:12,421
Scott: There are more than three but not many percentage wise less than 1%.

156
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:16,860
Scott: Yet the comics they have stores stores dead.

157
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:30,540
Scott: They have an entire distribution company dedicated to one genre in one medium and in the United States There is an entire medium that is dominated by one genre and a better selling.

158
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,664
Scott: Uh Genre in the medium.

159
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:39,884
Scott: I guess manga is not a genre, but it's a. it's a subset of a medium of you know graphic Whatever.

160
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:39,985
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,669
Scott: Yeah is Kicking its ass yet.

162
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,900
Scott: The market won't change.

163
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:52,200
Scott: They're still dominating the comic book store with superheroes if they were cat if they were smart at all.

164
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,824
Scott: Look at these numbers.

165
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:59,500
Scott: if you were going by what sells you wouldn't you would cancel every freaking superhero book.

166
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:12,744
Rym: Well that leads right into the things of the day because God's thing of the day is quite Underwear pervert II.

167
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,373
Scott: Yeah, you know, it sure does piss me off.

168
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:19,748
Scott: Those combo companies do not make Economically wise decisions.

169
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,080
Scott: that would benefit my entertainment anyway.

170
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:30,300
Scott: Yeah, but here's a good example of what's wrong with underwear pervert comics and why they're not so great.

171
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:33,488
Scott: This guy did a pretty cool thing on his blog.

172
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,855
Scott: he took Watchmen a great comic.

173
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:42,154
Scott: we just talked about it two seconds ago and He redid the cover and four pages of Watchmen.

174
00:13:42,234 --> 00:14:00,000
Scott: He redid all the text in The style of writing that is known to be fit Stan Lee with you know random bolding of words and Crazy made-up words and that this precisely what I hate about underwear pervert comics.

175
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:08,442
Scott: yep, so he takes a great underwear pervert comic that doesn't have the things that are hated and he adds the hated things and It just.

176
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:16,738
Scott: it really just shows you Like if you didn't if you don't notice it reading a normal underwear pervert comic you look at this and you go.

177
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,953
Scott: Oh That's why they're stupid.

178
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:19,740
Scott: look at that.

179
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,440
Rym: You know the bowling wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't that they bolded random words instead of useful words or words that made sense.

180
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:38,059
Scott: But this just shows how they took the standard of what superhero comics are took it and merged it with the greatest pinnacle of superhero comics and it turns to crap.

181
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,741
Scott: and It's just.

182
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,688
Scott: the concept is just so perfect.

183
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:42,972
Scott: It's golden you.

184
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,095
Scott: I got you got to look at it.

185
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:51,980
Rym: Yeah, it's especially Special to me after you might have heard my rant on another podcast a while ago about the balding.

186
00:14:52,321 --> 00:15:03,040
Rym: Yep, because I was unable to finish reading a comic recently because the balding just bothered me so much I couldn't force myself to read and that was just the balding let alone the writing style and other.

187
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,480
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even get to the plot or the characters of the writing or the art or anything.

188
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,865
Rym: The balding alone stopped me.

189
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,630
Rym: All right, you know what.

190
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,940
Rym: now I'm gonna actually pass on having a thing of the day today.

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,163
Scott: Well, you suck cuz.

192
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:32,520
Rym: I didn't have anything particularly relevant to anime manga comics web comics and I don't want to Start another trend of having super super long episodes because we I think we tried to wean ourselves off of that just before Otakon Mmm, plus I have to do a whole bunch of editing to make this thing listenable before it goes up.

193
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:36,918
Scott: The problem is it's hard not to make a long episode when we're playing a record pre-recorded bit.

194
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,399
Rym: Yeah Anyway, I hope you all enjoy it.

195
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,980
Rym: They talk about a wide variety of topics and they introduce themselves, so I won't bother reintroducing them before.

196
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,816
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna have to download this and listen to it.

197
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:58,360
Rym: So we're here at Otakon 2006 with a variety of slightly drunk to completely drunk web comic artist web comic aficionados anime fans general ne'er-do-wells and Conrad.

198
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:05,019
Rym: So, I guess everyone who's here could introduce themselves so we can at least tell whose voice is whose.

199
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,500
Rym: I am Of course Rym your favorite host of GeekNights.

200
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,274
Brian: My name is Brian Carroll.

201
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:10,020
Brian: I do instant classic.

202
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,247
Mookie: My name is Mookie.

203
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:15,200
Mookie: I am the writer and artist of a Dominic Deegan Oracle for hire.

204
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,446
Aido: I am my I'm aido.

205
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,200
Aido: I do a comic called fallen.

206
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:23,149
Cat: Hi, I'm cat.

207
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,319
Cat: I actually do nothing.

208
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:26,565
Connor: My name is Connor krailing.

209
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:32,198
Connor: I have no discernible skills or talents, but I was invited here tonight to talk to you about things Good things.

210
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:39,812
Laram: My name is Laram Lancaster, and I used to take part in committee But now I just simply feature in it.

211
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:47,280
Rym: So we're not doing anything particularly Big here, but I guess I'd like to get impressions of Otakon the artist Ally the con in general.

212
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,468
Rym: I mean some of you go to more cons than others.

213
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:54,151
Rym: So I guess I won't direct this to anyone in particular first, but How was Otakon?

214
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:54,717
Rym: Why are you here?

215
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:05,008
Mookie: well Otakon is the biggest convention of the year for a lot of us here on the East Coast and speaking personally And someone who makes a living off of his webcomic.

216
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:08,039
Mookie: This is where most of my income usually comes in.

217
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:20,148
Mookie: So as this as in every year I have a fabulous time because most of the people who don't go to any convention Most people who go to only one convention a year come to this one.

218
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,116
Mookie: You just meet everybody whether you want to or not.

219
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,403
Brian: I Agree with that.

220
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,608
Brian: It's also my biggest convention.

221
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:34,771
Brian: I do about two or three a year and Although I don't usually have that much of a big representation here I usually use it to meet up with my friends webcomic friends people.

222
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:42,039
Brian: I only see about two or three times a year themselves We talk fascism communism the whole nine yards food.

223
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:47,680
Rym: This is actually my third con and I still don't know why I go but I'm here and it's a good time.

224
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,318
Rym: I see people and I do things.

225
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,294
Rym: So most of you spend your time in the artist alley.

226
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,760
Rym: I take it at the convention, that's true.

227
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:57,920
Rym: Now, how is that?

228
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:05,599
Rym: I mean the artist alley tends to be a very eclectic collection of artists of all different stripes ranging from complete fan artists to totally original works.

229
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,340
Rym: What do you guys do in the artist alley aside from obviously selling art, I mean do you promote yourselves?

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,506
Rym: Do you just socialize?

231
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,351
Rym: is it networking?

232
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,316
Rym: What is the artist alley?

233
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:14,839
Rym: Why are you there?

234
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,373
Mookie: The artist alley is so fascinating because it is so many different things.

235
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:27,706
Mookie: once it is all those things people promoting themselves original artwork fan artwork and networking and you don't really have to do.

236
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:28,228
Mookie: you don't really.

237
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:34,784
Mookie: you don't really have to really go out of your way to do any of the more socialist parts of it because Fascinatingly enough.

238
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:40,530
Mookie: It always seems just come to you because the artist alley By nature is just so diverse.

239
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,830
Brian: I think this is actually interesting because Me and Mookie earned different sides of the coin with artists alley.

240
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:52,050
Brian: people will go to artist alley seeking out Mookie Whereas I am looking for promotion myself.

241
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,845
Brian: So whereas Mookie, I don't think you're really Promoting yourself.

242
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,790
Brian: You're already promoted.

243
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:03,831
Brian: You're more there for the Public Yeah, and I'm there for the promotion.

244
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,560
Brian: so I think that's interesting on two sides.

245
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:10,580
Rym: So in terms of self-promotion Does it ever feel awkward trying to promote yourself?

246
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,864
Rym: I mean, there's a fine line between selling something you do and you know be coming off as a person who's trying to sell something You do.

247
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,440
Rym: do you walk that fine line?

248
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,655
Rym: Do you ever like you're giving us feel to someone and you just feel awkward while you're doing it?

249
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:23,779
Rym: or you wonder if maybe you?

250
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,657
Rym: Overstepped a line or something?

251
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:37,012
Brian: Well in terms of the actual line I'll just answer It's I'm kind of like it's not really like a carnival where you know I'm on the dunking booth shouting at people to go hit me down.

252
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,060
Brian: Hand me three dollars and throw a ball at my target.

253
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:45,738
Brian: it's um, I Guess the line is crossed between if you seek them out or if they seek you out like my my display.

254
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,646
Brian: this year I spent a long time on it.

255
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:52,436
Brian: So be I was bringing people to it and Therefore I can promote myself that way.

256
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,434
Mookie: There I mean some people I think are a little too aggressive.

257
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:03,938
Mookie: in the artist Sally I mean my first year ever at Otakon I was next to a guy Who wasn't doing so?

258
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:04,140
Mookie: well?

259
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:14,279
Mookie: so he would literally yell at people who were walking across walking even remotely near his table and Saying you come here you come here and they would drink they would.

260
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,079
Mookie: Because a lot of geeks are very shy and when someone's yelling them to do something, they'll probably do it.

261
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,192
Mookie: So you had them flyers.

262
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:22,060
Rym: do any of you ever go?

263
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,500
Rym: I mean, this is obviously an anime convention which tend to be very broad-based.

264
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,283
Rym: Do you ever work at?

265
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:31,179
Rym: art might not just miss work, but do other convention maybe comic centered conventions or other?

266
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,247
Rym: Types of conventions.

267
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,655
Rym: Are there any different from anime conventions?

268
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:35,360
Rym: You even go to them?

269
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:39,219
Mookie: I go to I I go to one every year.

270
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,280
Mookie: That's more of a sci-fi more sci-fi fantasy and almost Ren fair centered icon on Long Island.

271
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:55,647
Mookie: The the sci-fi fans are much different much different than the anime fans there are much more Selective in what they spend their money on.

272
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:58,818
Mookie: they're a lot less willing to show you how enthusiastic they are.

273
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,052
Mookie: A lot of few of them like I feel like they some of them.

274
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,640
Mookie: they can look down their nose at you.

275
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,020
Mookie: But the anime fans are starting to creep in.

276
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,842
Mookie: a Lot of them start.

277
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:25,431
Mookie: anime fans are starting to creep into that convention too and whereas anime fans are tend to be very Enthusiastic and open and almost accepting of new things the older school sci-fi fans Are more pushing them away, and I don't I think they should be.

278
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,936
Mookie: I think they should be more accepting.

279
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,180
Mookie: another convention I went to was Wizard World Boston Which I failed at miserably.

280
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:44,723
Mookie: Wizard World Boston had a bunch of comic fans And it was so strange because there was one guy dressed up the entire weekend as the Green Lantern and these people at this Convention flipped

281
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:45,606
Rym: wait so

282
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,050
Mookie: one guy in costume,

283
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,680
Rym: so he was dressed up as the Green Lantern for all three days.

284
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:52,740
Mookie: No one day, okay, okay?

285
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,399
Mookie: One guy just showed up one day and drew an immense crowd because everyone's making a huge deal.

286
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,540
Mookie: look There's somebody in costume at an anime convention.

287
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,918
Rym: How often do you see that?

288
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,673
Rym: No, I went to Philly Wizard World.

289
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,965
Rym: as opposed to a Philly Wizard World I emphasize the wrong syllables there.

290
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:16,959
Rym: Philly Wizard World was a scary convention that we devoted a great deal of coverage to.

291
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:20,760
Mookie: I went to Wizard World Boston.

292
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,718
Rym: They're basically the same thing as far as I can tell.

293
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:32,079
Rym: yeah just different locations and we ran into the situation where anime cons you know I pull out a microphone I try to interview someone and The ten fangirls around will run over in.

294
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,195
Rym: Oh interview me next year.

295
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:33,520
Rym: oh my god.

296
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:38,827
Rym: At Philly Wizard World I Couldn't get anyone to interview with me.

297
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:48,059
Rym: I'd like even without the microphones in my pocket I'm just some dude at the con and I walk up and I try to ask someone like like hey How you doing, and they just look at me with this look of who are you and why are you talking to me?

298
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,782
Mookie: Very different crowd.

299
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:56,300
Mookie: I prefer the anime crowds tenfold to the Comic Con so not Comic Con comic book convention crowds.

300
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,331
Rym: So How is the social atmosphere in the artist alley?

301
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:01,880
Rym: I mean obviously you all I?

302
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:09,620
Rym: Noticed that people who come for the artist alley tend to stay in the artist alley most of the con and yet Enjoy themselves immensely and I all the best stories from conventions.

303
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,979
Rym: I hear things that happen in the artist alley late at night when the crazies come out.

304
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:17,220
Aido: Yeah, I I'm in in for the the social aspect of the artist alley.

305
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,640
Aido: I really couldn't care less if I made money because the money is really secondary to me.

306
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,959
Aido: it's just mostly meeting people who I know on the internet and Being able to meet other webcomic people.

307
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,071
Brian: Actually, I have an interesting story about that.

308
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:39,294
Brian: I Shouldn't have even attempted to do this But I was fighting with Kinko's today And I just so happened to meet an artist from the artist alley who I had no idea who it was.

309
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:49,000
Brian: at the Kinko's just they were also messing up his work, so we kind of had that common interest and He was having his stuff printed down.

310
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,039
Brian: We just he saw my badge had artists written on it And we just kind of struck up a conversation in terms of what's going on.

311
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,415
Brian: So like that kind of social it's very very friendly, you know everyone's very accepting.

312
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,664
Brian: even though he didn't know my work I didn't know his.

313
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:06,003
Brian: I'm not that much into anime, and he was an anime artist But it we still had.

314
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,069
Brian: you know it was very very social environment.

315
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:17,314
Rym: so to change directions entirely for a moment now All of you are at an anime con right now, so I guess if you do enjoy anime What was the first anime you ever saw like?

316
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:17,999
Rym: what was it that?

317
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:26,971
Rym: Got you into this either into anime as a fan or into the subculture of anime as in you're going to conventions now on a regular Basis, okay, I'm gonna say this for the record.

318
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:32,774
Rym: I do not really enjoy anime I I used to when I was in seventh and eighth grade, but I remember in sixth grade.

319
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,420
Rym: my gateway drug was Pokemon.

320
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:41,542
Rym: I watched it when I was 12 years old, and I wanted to be that For me.

321
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:46,659
Connor: um I used to deliver my papers early on my paper route so I could get home and watch Dragon Ball Z.

322
00:24:49,621 --> 00:25:03,400
Aido: My dad is Japanese, and I grew up on Doraemon and The original Dragon Ball on Unsubtitled untranslated, I would just watch it with my dad, and he would translate it for me at key points.

323
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:17,060
Brian: actually Every morning in middle school when I lived in Florida Dragon Ball Z came on at about 6 30 in the morning, and I will admit this right here.

324
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,305
Brian: I've never admitted to anybody.

325
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:25,140
Brian: I watched very several several several episodes of Dragon Ball Z Not even knowing what it was and I don't regret it.

326
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,630
Rym: I Have been dating this boy

327
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:31,925
Aido: for two and a half years And I never knew that

328
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,068
Mookie: for the record his

329
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:33,730
Connor: power level

330
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,452
Rym: is above

331
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:34,934
Brian: 1 million.

332
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,077
Brian: This is the best place.

333
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,345
Brian: kind of You're dead to me.

334
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,152
Brian: the internet to kind of my.

335
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,400
Brian: we can see my face and my shame.

336
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:45,375
Laram: My gateway drug was one of the stranger ones.

337
00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:52,396
Laram: it was Evangelion Because if you if you sink your teeth into Evangelion, and you like it you're.

338
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:58,460
Laram: you're smooth into anime But if you find Evangelion, and you hate it you get turned off forever.

339
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:03,720
Laram: It's one of those hit-or-miss ones because it's just so crazy and creepy and strange.

340
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:10,160
Aido: My I like the Doraemon where they found the dinosaur egg, and then they raised the dinosaur.

341
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,760
Rym: What that was oddly specific?

342
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,704
Connor: Yes, Ava was crap.

343
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:23,253
Mookie: my my summer going into my freshman year of high school the sci-fi channel did their weekend festival of anime Which comprised of three films.

344
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:24,080
Mookie: I watched them twice.

345
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:28,919
Mookie: It was robot carnival lens man and vampire hunter D.

346
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:33,296
Rym: You realize that we that is the exact same thing.

347
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:38,374
Rym: that was the first anime I ever saw robot carnival robot carnival lens man vampire hunter D's.

348
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,180
Mookie: watch the same festival on the sci-fi.

349
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:40,983
Rym: I think we did.

350
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:41,946
Rym: I was in fourth grade.

351
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:42,889
Mookie: Oh my god.

352
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,210
Mookie: I was.

353
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,013
Mookie: I was gonna go.

354
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,077
Rym: how old are you?

355
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:53,045
Mookie: I'm only 24 Nike boobily mushrooms, I'm older than you Mustache.

356
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,044
Rym: I look like I'm 30 haha.

357
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,525
Rym: Alright, so in terms of you know anime fan I'm coming to Otakon.

358
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:00,973
Rym: now many of you go to other con state.

359
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:02,320
Rym: ConnectiCon is a big example.

360
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:08,820
Rym: How does Otakon compare to the other conventions in terms of how they treat the webcomic artist or the artist how they run the artist?

361
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,194
Rym: Alley how much you enjoy going to the convention and how much business you do.

362
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,860
Rym: a lot of topics there?

363
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,065
Rym: But I hope we'll get some good.

364
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,815
Mookie: I think ConnectiCon is the best example.

365
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:26,005
Mookie: I think of a. I think ConnectiCon is like the Boston of Conventions in my opinion.

366
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,612
Mookie: It's the biggest little convention.

367
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,580
Mookie: I've ever been to the people there.

368
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:43,276
Mookie: I mean the convention is growing and it's getting big, but it still has the feel To me at least of a really small Personable convention, I think that's the lure of a. I think that's the lure to it for a lot of people.

369
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,746
Mookie: not to mention that It is Amazingly friendly to web comics.

370
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,211
Mookie: a big convention like this.

371
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:48,853
Mookie: Yes.

372
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:53,828
Mookie: It is amazingly good for business Amazingly good for sales and exposure, but it is.

373
00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:00,496
Mookie: it is in my opinion a lot less personable Just for the sheer size.

374
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:03,027
Brian: What kind of has to be in that case?

375
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:08,640
Brian: So yeah, that's not really blaming anybody It's just it's just a numbers thing.

376
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:15,720
Mookie: Big it's like a big corporation can't be as people friendly as say like Joe's diner down the street.

377
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:20,985
Brian: Well, I mean I live in Hartford.

378
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:25,659
Brian: So I mean ConnectiCon is a very very kind of no-brainer con for me is very stress-free.

379
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:30,272
Brian: No, I mean me knowing the people who run it personally.

380
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:39,840
Brian: I've kind of taken my own personal, you know I've had my fingerprint on ConnectiCon itself, you know They let me run my film festival now, which we just had our first year of and we're gonna have it next year as well.

381
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:46,060
Brian: so And along with that, I mean, I'm helping a lot of the other people who are not local to the area.

382
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,287
Brian: I help them around stuff like that.

383
00:28:47,790 --> 00:29:00,176
Brian: So in terms of the con I'm not sure how much of me being a local person factors into that but Otakon is definitely a lot bigger a lot more stranger in a strange town kind of thing.

384
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:05,313
Mookie: I Think we should take this time to introduce someone just walked in to the room.

385
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:07,380
Mookie: Well, actually we should let him introduce himself, I suppose.

386
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,800
Garth: Well, why would you go and do something silly like that?

387
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:23,880
Garth: No, no seriously, all right, I'm not actually Grom that's just Mookie's, you know thing.

388
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:27,285
Garth: My name is actually Garth.

389
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:33,180
Garth: the last name is Graham, but if you spell it funny without like the second a you do get in fact Grom.

390
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:52,789
Garth: Yes, exactly And I as everyone in the room, I think knows but people listening don't I do the webcomic community About the ConnectiCon thing Garth and I attended two cons one con just before ConnectiCon and one con and then ConnectiCon itself.

391
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,747
Laram: and This kind of goes back to your question about the comic-con thing.

392
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:56,509
Laram: Is that?

393
00:29:56,589 --> 00:30:03,489
Laram: our first convention as community was wizard con Philly Last year and So we had.

394
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:12,000
Laram: we had attended Webcomic we'd attended conventions as guests as attendees, but we'd never been behind the table yet.

395
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:26,500
Laram: And so going to wizard con Philly Straight up as a comic convention and then coming to ConnectiCon It was a very stark contrast between the two and who we met who we talked to who came to talk to us.

396
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:37,919
Laram: And I definitely agree with the two people that have already talked about how How small and and how familiar the people ConnectiCon were versus the bigger?

397
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:50,720
Laram: The bigger con that is is wizard con as well as the the crowd and the people that you meet there Since this is a free-form and this also kind of touches on the larger versus smaller conventions.

398
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,106
Garth: There was something asked about at comic-con.

399
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,590
Garth: Was there that I missed?

400
00:30:57,337 --> 00:31:02,272
Rym: we were talking about Philly Wizard world and the other wizard world and how different they are from anime conventions.

401
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,496
Garth: Oh, yes.

402
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:04,038
Garth: Okay.

403
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,333
Garth: Yeah Yeah, two different worlds.

404
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:12,379
Garth: completely Comic books are not the same as manga basically how shell-shocked.

405
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:18,673
Aido: comic-book fans and sci-fi fans are versus anime fans and how personable.

406
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,119
Aido: and if anime fans tend to be over.

407
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,199
Aido: comic-book fans and sci-fi fans who kind of tend to stay away from each other They're citing the comic-book fans are in sci-fi as well are very.

408
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:41,211
Garth: they're very into themselves very into their their work not their work, but the Their interests and nothing else.

409
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,336
Garth: There's less of a community.

410
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,786
Garth: I think going on there It's very very people.

411
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:47,939
Garth: look at the merchandise and look at the comics whatever they happen to be.

412
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,979
Garth: You know the con for and that's about as far as it goes.

413
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,886
Rym: Well, I guess why do you think that is?

414
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:57,020
Rym: why is the science fiction and American comic not so much the indie comic?

415
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,951
Rym: But the old, you know, we like to call them underwear perverts But the superhero comics versus indie comics and webcomics.

416
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:09,972
Rym: and why are the communities so different despite the fact that they have many Similarities in terms of what they actually are?

417
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:11,379
Brian: I could take a stab at this one.

418
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:16,756
Brian: I think it has to do with just the for which ones cater towards which audiences.

419
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:20,652
Brian: I mean the anime Community seems to be centered around.

420
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,526
Brian: I Mean, I'm not gonna this.

421
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,044
Brian: I don't mean this to sound insulting But a lot of this.

422
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:44,195
Brian: a lot of the anime culture comes from online and comes from the younger crowd as well And a lot of that caters towards just inhibition in general and I think with sci-fi being more of I guess a personal interest and People who like sci-fi usually tend to meet in real life not on the internet.

423
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:54,200
Brian: not it's just I mean This is just me kind of shooting the brie and a lot of this right phrase, but it's like Anime community just seems to be built on inhibition in general.

424
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,580
Brian: So with that inhibition comes a lot of shared passion and a lot of common interests.

425
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:07,124
Brian: I mean this is coming from someone who doesn't even have the common interests But I see the passion in them and I respect the passion, you know, like any other Sci-fi fans.

426
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:14,264
Mookie: I think it's almost like a code word between them and they're very careful about I think who they let into the club So to speak.

427
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:22,340
Mookie: so I think a lot of them are very guarded against a lot of these Youngsters so speak Who are just running?

428
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:32,485
Mookie: blindly Enthusiastically towards anything new and cool-looking whereas they have always been very careful as to what they choose what they Tend to like.

429
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,072
Mookie: and I think it's just.

430
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:50,660
Mookie: I think it's just generational really I think if the at if the sci-fi fantasy crowd became a little more accepting of the anime crowd, I think Maybe a whole new sort of convention would be born a hybrid almost a sci-fi anime convention.

431
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,679
Rym: I'm surprised our friend Conrad hasn't chimed in with something about 4chan at this point.

432
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,074
Brian: I I have nothing to say about 4chan.

433
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:01,604
Rym: I Like.

434
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:10,420
Connor: three years ago when I was a freshman in college I discovered this website off a link to a very from a very Questionable webcomic that I was reading at the time called the lounge.

435
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,094
Rym: I thought you're gonna say questionable content make some kind of joke.

436
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,284
Rym: No, no No It was very.

437
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:24,860
Connor: it was a very questionable webcomic that I read during high school and I found a link off of it and I started Visiting it because back in the day it used to be funny and now it's a pile of crap and I've disowned it entirely.

438
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,246
Rym: Now what exactly is 4chan?

439
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:31,679
Rym: I've been I've been studying it like and I I would say I don't know.

440
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,818
Rym: I like Jane Goodall among the Apes.

441
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,833
Garth: It's where images go to die.

442
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:39,987
Garth: Well, no, not really.

443
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:43,257
Garth: they just get shared around in a giant pile, but what kind of images?

444
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:45,849
Rym: that's why that's why Everything mostly pornographic.

445
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,047
Rym: Oh, I mean, I guess the way I would go with this Is that like you all are very savage.

446
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,494
Rym: the internet, you know webcomics and such.

447
00:34:51,534 --> 00:35:02,108
Rym: but you know FARC calm or versus slash dot and how like there's levels of how contiguous the conversations are and how much Someone who is not into the crowd can follow them.

448
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:06,562
Rym: and like someone who doesn't know about FARC culture could not read FARC and understand It easily.

449
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:09,272
Rym: 4chan is beyond even my.

450
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,560
Rym: I have no idea what these kids are talking about.

451
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,139
Rym: It's like a foreign language and now I know how my grandparents feel about computers.

452
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:19,380
Connor: Be fair some of the boards on 4chan aren't terrible boards.

453
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:26,775
Connor: I do visit wallpapers occasionally to grab you know Fresh wallpapers when I need them and technology can be an actually useful source of information.

454
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:27,598
Brian: read it for the articles.

455
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:33,386
Mookie: Generally, you know I've entered a slash s every now and then.

456
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:39,169
Connor: no but but the popular boards are all crap because they're just over completely overpopulated With 13 year olds.

457
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,018
Connor: I can't deal with it.

458
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,235
Rym: Well, so the popular things are crap, but if something's obscure then it's suddenly cool.

459
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:48,433
Connor: No, no No, because 13 year olds don't care about technology and they don't care about wallpapers.

460
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:50,519
Connor: They just care about posting up their favorite porn image.

461
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,599
Garth: Yes, you can the internet is for porn.

462
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,486
Garth: Oh Come on.

463
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:02,994
Garth: I was gonna try and start a musical here, but fail on me.

464
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,840
Rym: You guys you think any of us can drink?

465
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:11,497
Rym: Oh, yeah I've been in a musical born I can sing Bob Seger because he uses exactly three notes.

466
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:15,099
Brian: Nice I've been in the Cradle Rock.

467
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,670
Brian: Don't judge me That's about unions.

468
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,119
Brian: What's wrong with that?

469
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,313
Connor: Did anybody else notice that the panel sucked this year?

470
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:30,871
Rym: Yes I think to say about the bukkake panel.

471
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,019
Rym: That was like the most popular panel.

472
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:35,020
Rym: What was all right?

473
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:39,597
Rym: That was an unfortunately named panel that would not have been allowed to have that name and people noticed it.

474
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,380
Rym: do-it-yourself.

475
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:49,620
Rym: bukkake is just a hentai drawing panel that they called it something controversial in order to get people to show up kind of like how 4chan staged a fake fight at their panel last year.

476
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:54,098
Garth: Nice didn't they have a hentai drawing panel?

477
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:56,365
Rym: There were multiple hentai.

478
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,169
Connor: it was last night at 10 p.m.

479
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,094
Connor: And I was in attendance to that panel.

480
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:07,755
Aido: one of our friends won a prize For what the best hentai know the scariest dick what what?

481
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:11,980
Rym: wait a minute as in The one they drew a skip the scary.

482
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:18,719
Rym: Okay I was going to ask the one with which they were equipped by whatever being may or may not have created them or the one that They constructed out of his drawing.

483
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,772
Brian: I was in person a hence.

484
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:21,519
Brian: I was drawn.

485
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,935
Brian: This is crossing a line.

486
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:29,580
Rym: I would think Well, I guess in terms of panels, what do you guys think of panels and anime cons?

487
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,316
Rym: I mean, it seems that panels are generally used.

488
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,020
Rym: what comes in general?

489
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:39,739
Rym: They're generally supposed to be at least the way most kind of seem to see them as fans trying to Show something off or do something.

490
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:41,686
Rym: Should they be more controlled?

491
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:44,957
Rym: should only people who know what they're talking about or experts be allowed on these panels?

492
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:45,700
Rym: should it be anyone?

493
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,899
Rym: Should they be more strict more loose?

494
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,060
Rym: Because obviously a lot of people agree that the panels are generally not so good these days and what can be done about that?

495
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,945
Rym: I mean you many of you speak on panels.

496
00:37:54,985 --> 00:38:07,250
Laram: So I think that one of the best examples of a finely done panel is heroes and villains Done by someone in this room Because he knows what he's talking about.

497
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:18,780
Laram: He draws from everywhere good bad, he doesn't just talk about his own stuff and Then he opens it up and and does point-counter point with people in the audience.

498
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,205
Laram: That's what panels should be.

499
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:21,189
Laram: panels are not.

500
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,755
Laram: just look what I've done.

501
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:23,840
Laram: I'm really cool.

502
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:34,859
Laram: It's supposed to be a level of discussion based on Shared information and so you lay forth the information ahead of time and then you discuss it.

503
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:36,369
Mookie: I'm gonna kiss.

504
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:39,949
Mookie: you fall in the mouth, you know he's talking about my writing.

505
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:48,760
Mookie: unique heroes and memorable villains panel and Panels are magnificent in what they are in what they can achieve for you.

506
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:53,040
Mookie: That heroes and villains panel for me at least has gained me a ton of new readers.

507
00:38:53,881 --> 00:39:07,560
Mookie: People have come up to me afterwards and says I don't know what you're due, but I'm going to find out now because Because I loved your panel It's a great way for people who are just getting started in web comics or anything to get some exposure and some FaceTime.

508
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:26,540
Mookie: Ideally They are I think a boon to conventions and one of the real drawing points because conventions that are just a big dealers room Like wizard world Yeah, any of those many any of those dealers any of those conventions that are just a big dealers room that have no panels.

509
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:27,957
Mookie: No one likes them.

510
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:33,200
Mookie: But there are very good examples of bad panels and I'll let the assembly take care of that.

511
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,852
Rym: Someone has been waiting with bated breath to speak on this time.

512
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,078
Brian: Yeah, I'm just way too opinion.

513
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:42,334
Brian: Mookie Your keyboard there was ideally because like obviously you're this is gonna be one of those.

514
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:43,999
Rym: This is why communism fails speeches.

515
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:49,098
Rym: Panels are great on paper, but the computer is my friend.

516
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:56,191
Brian: I've attended Mookie's panel twice and it is the ideal panel.

517
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,275
Brian: It's a person.

518
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,263
Mookie: I'm not saying I'm gonna be blush I'm really.

519
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,258
Brian: I'm not saying this wonderful panel.

520
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:08,200
Brian: I'm not saying this to complement you but well, I mean it is an informative panel.

521
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:12,320
Brian: it speaks on personal experience and while other people it's.

522
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:16,290
Brian: It's information that's being shared about a subject.

523
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,300
Brian: The problem is is that I'm my very little knowledge of panels.

524
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,146
Brian: I've attended a few I've been on it.

525
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,940
Brian: I've attended the webcomic ones both in the audience and on the stage.

526
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:30,618
Brian: This year the webcomic panel, which I've only heard rumors of.

527
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:36,323
Brian: I didn't actually attend it, but there was only There was.

528
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,389
Brian: well, here's I heard that there was.

529
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:48,237
Brian: only in seeing the schedule - there's only one person actually on the panel who had Anything to do with a webcomic and that was Matt Boyd from Matt call who doesn't really like to talk that much.

530
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:56,470
Brian: So That he I know I heard Ian ran But Ian made a run for it.

531
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:14,656
Brian: I don't know how many other people were on this panel But there were at least three including him and one of them um is a webcomic critic which Which you really can't have because it's just no more than a Fanboy talking about a medium which he really doesn't understand anything about.

532
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:30,536
Brian: so And especially with webcomics which are you know idealistic and just so self-congratulatory as it is You know You you need some people to actually have some sort of criticism and who know things about storytelling I'd love to see Mookie actually take control of that panel as well.

533
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,915
Brian: Although he kind of does it already.

534
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:38,488
Brian: but Well for anyone What they're talking about being the panelists.

535
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:56,666
Rym: for anyone in our forums who have witnessed the epic arguments that have occurred in the forums of The front row crew forum the the fact that we agree almost entirely on this point is amazing because I've been to numerous panels recently where I or someone I know is actually an expert on the subject that they're talking about and People do pet like.

536
00:41:56,686 --> 00:42:05,380
Rym: there's a panel on the Nintendo new system though We and the person doing it didn't really know anything about the way didn't really wasn't a Nintendo expert or anything.

537
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:19,820
Rym: they were just some dude who decided to run a panel about something they thought was cool and they didn't know anything and they just kind of rambled on stage or The come this panels where people don't know what they're talking about But the audience always assumes that anyone up on the stage with a microphone knows what they're talking about.

538
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,220
Brian: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that a lot of people just like the idea that they're panelists.

539
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,228
Brian: They don't even care about the panel itself.

540
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,373
Rym: I like the fact that I'm a panel.

541
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:28,423
Brian: Well, you know, you're talking about, you know It helps.

542
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:35,317
Rym: I mean Usually yeah, I guess I would honestly really like to see panels be more.

543
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:42,700
Rym: I guess I don't want to say credentials because I'd hate to Get to that point where you need to prove that you know what you're talking about to get on a panel.

544
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,900
Rym: But maybe some sort of you know show something a panel you've done before or can tell if you you know what you're doing.

545
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,181
Brian: You're not.

546
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,926
Rym: so you think that you'd think that.

547
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:54,520
Rym: I do think that ideally most of the most panelists aren't the person who's running the panels.

548
00:42:54,641 --> 00:43:02,093
Brian: Never meets anyone involved in the panel until the day the panel The audience the audience is gonna know that the guy upstage is cold bullshit.

549
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:03,699
Rym: No, you know, the audience have no idea.

550
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:04,723
Brian: I don't have.

551
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:06,873
Mookie: that much depends on how confident the guy is.

552
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:07,355
Brian: That's true.

553
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,340
Brian: Well, yeah, it's confident.

554
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:11,100
Rym: I mean, I don't want to rag on the geeks be guy because he's a cool guy.

555
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:18,377
Rym: we've we've got on his show and he's been on our show, but Though this Nintendo revolution we panel he did he didn't know anything about.

556
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:19,200
Rym: he was kind of talking.

557
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:28,380
Rym: okay, the audience were asking him the kind of questions that you would ask at like a Nintendo press conference as though he would know the Answers and he kind of BS half of them.

558
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:34,605
Rym: But the audience really does think whoever's up on the panel is just an expert and they're there by the grace of whatever gods Run the panel, huh?

559
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:39,407
Mookie: I'd like to say I mean just kind of Segueing a little bit and maybe a little.

560
00:43:39,788 --> 00:43:42,700
Mookie: I'd like to just I guess throw out to the assembly.

561
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:47,390
Mookie: I guess I'm growing just generally distaste.

562
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:48,817
Mookie: I'm sorry.

563
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:56,316
Mookie: I Have a growing distaste for general web comics panels in general, honestly I agree entirely.

564
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:57,080
Rym: web comics are.

565
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,175
Rym: they're not necessarily a fully mature medium But they're out there.

566
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:02,807
Rym: It's not like you need to explain to people what a webcomic is.

567
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:03,530
Mookie: Well, no, it's not.

568
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,538
Mookie: It's not that.

569
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:09,300
Mookie: it's that when anime conventions law or any conventions.

570
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:15,119
Mookie: lump all the web comics guests together and Put them on a hey meet your favorite web comics guests.

571
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:22,519
Mookie: the last few that I have been on with the exception of Well, I guess maybe one a few years ago have been terrible.

572
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:27,251
Mookie: and it's not because the people who are on the panel are terrible People.

573
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,381
Mookie: what ends up happening is it becomes very unfocused.

574
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:44,836
Mookie: it because and and I'm gonna sound so elitist by saying this and I really don't mean it but a lot of the veteran webcomics get mixed in with the newcomer webcomics and a lot of the veteran webcomic errs know to keep their answers kind of

575
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:45,479
Brian: brief

576
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:52,491
Mookie: and This is no fault of the people who are just getting started in webcomics who want to get their faces out who want to say Something.

577
00:44:52,531 --> 00:45:10,987
Mookie: that's memorable, but when one person asks a question that could be answered in under a minute By one person up there, but of course everyone wants to chime in if you've never been on a panel before So the same question gets answered the same way over the next half an hour.

578
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:16,410
Rym: So, how do you all feel about say having professional moderators at panels like that?

579
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:22,842
Rym: do you think someone who is actually there to cut people off or Direct the conversation aside from people are on the panel.

580
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,930
Mookie: I think that's I think it's a great idea.

581
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:35,443
Mookie: It was tried this year at the uber webcomic panel at ConnectiCon but it It just kind of got a little out of control because there were more panelists than then.

582
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:37,250
Mookie: I think is healthy.

583
00:45:39,212 --> 00:45:48,535
Garth: It's always sad and I've noticed this at a lot of webcomic panels that I've been on, you know, the general webcomic panel that we kind of been all talking about is that they're More often than not.

584
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,590
Garth: it seems to be that there are more panelists than people in the audience.

585
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,037
Brian: Plus you what you're talking about.

586
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:57,389
Brian: adding an editor to web comics.

587
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:04,139
Garth: That's against everything we stand exactly.

588
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:07,430
Brian: that's what it has to be disorderly for this to work.

589
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:10,485
Rym: The web comics is an ideal Brian.

590
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:15,575
Connor: You're a madman a Speaking strictly as a panel goer.

591
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:20,330
Connor: I would rather see panels better distributed and better organized rather than seeing a moderator.

592
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:26,374
Connor: I would rather see as Mookie stated veteran webcomic artists to get like with veterans and Beginners with beginners.

593
00:46:26,735 --> 00:46:33,280
Connor: that way people can pick who they want to see pick what answers they want to know rather than having a man Stand in the middle and try to sort it out while it's going on.

594
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,630
Rym: I'm talking more in terms of panels that exist.

595
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,930
Rym: I mean there are people who know their stuff, but they're not good public speakers.

596
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:42,505
Rym: There are people who like a wonderful show or a wonderful comic and they just they can't.

597
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:43,950
Rym: they don't know how to massage a crowd.

598
00:46:44,111 --> 00:46:45,315
Rym: And I'm talking about more.

599
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:55,290
Rym: have someone who know like professionals who know what they're doing to direct the conversation So that people who have something to say can get it out without Sounding dumb even when they're obviously not dumb.

600
00:46:55,371 --> 00:47:01,670
Rym: They just don't know how to deal with a crowd or with You know a situation where someone who's loud takes over a panel because there's no moderator to shut them up.

601
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:02,835
Mookie: I absolutely agree with that.

602
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:12,027
Mookie: some people who are just all talk and no substance Can easily overshadow one of the most brilliant writers who just gets really nervous and fun of everyone.

603
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:14,235
Mookie: the reason why he does his work In front of a webcomic.

604
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:17,570
Mookie: I'm sorry behind a computer screen is because maybe he is afraid of crowds.

605
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,084
Mookie: So I agree with you completely on that.

606
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:37,226
Laram: One of the things that Connecticut did not this past year, but two years ago was they had their meet-and-greets with Two or three comics at a time and the interesting thing about that was Is that you could say hey?

607
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:48,413
Laram: I want to go see Dominic Deegan and Mac Hall and Vg cats all in one panel, and then you know that you're only dealing with that small group of people with only those small Questions.

608
00:47:48,634 --> 00:48:05,590
Laram: now I realize I just picked very strange combination but instead of having 50 people on a stage when you ask what's your inspiration and Have everybody answer you could at least you could do and it would feel strange in with 50 people on stage to ask.

609
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,537
Laram: so Mac Hall What do you think about this?

610
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:12,188
Rym: and have nobody else be able to answer that question?

611
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:12,690
Rym: yeah?

612
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,750
Laram: It could move faster, but you would feel as a questioner from the from the audience.

613
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,412
Laram: You would feel

614
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:19,617
Rym: rude to everyone

615
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,323
Laram: else on the panel to ask

616
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:23,310
Mookie: that that format did not work for me.

617
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:25,697
Mookie: I they they paired me up a kinetic.

618
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,101
Mookie: that was a very noble idea.

619
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:29,669
Mookie: that ConnectiCon did to pair up webcomics.

620
00:48:30,151 --> 00:48:36,961
Mookie: I got paired up with Tim Buckley of control alt delete and Brian Clevenger of 8-bit theater two very good friends of mine by the way.

621
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:44,363
Mookie: I love them both to death, but the that year The questions were all to the questions that were asked.

622
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:48,643
Mookie: to quote the three of us They answered and by the time they got to me.

623
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:56,343
Mookie: by the time I opened my mouth someone else was already asking with those two guys another question, so I was the third wheel.

624
00:48:57,655 --> 00:49:00,249
Brian: See that's interesting because that that format actually worked out for me.

625
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:02,858
Brian: You were paired up with two other people.

626
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:06,679
Brian: I was paired up with one other person and Yeah, but that was purely purely by luck.

627
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:07,202
Brian: Well.

628
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:08,830
Brian: It was by luck, but it did work out.

629
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,168
Brian: I mean well also and it done them to that what?

630
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:17,239
Brian: Happened two years ago was that they had all the groupings of webcomics And then they had their uber webcomic panel.

631
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,920
Brian: so all the meet-and-greet stuff got all the stupid You know random questions that are always asked.

632
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:26,237
Brian: it got them all out of the way with all the smaller Inspiration all those.

633
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,629
Garth: what's your favorite fruit?

634
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:28,653
Brian: that's why.

635
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:32,190
Brian: that's why two years ago the uber webcomic panel was great because

636
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:33,217
Rym: All of the

637
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:44,498
Brian: bad questions were covered out of the way and then all the important ones were done at the uber panel, and I was paired up with Scott ransomware of eg cats and It was one other person And it was a very controlled environment.

638
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:50,040
Brian: everyone was there for them, but I'm It was by pure luck that it worked out for me.

639
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,190
Brian: Just because Scott's kind of a shy guy.

640
00:49:53,479 --> 00:50:10,724
Brian: I'm not Conversation turned to me stuff like that, but I mean I think it would work that kind of format Just if you tweaked that and not just rely all on the uber webcam panel Especially because the webcam panel is repeated the same in every convention.

641
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:12,330
Brian: It's all this the same questions.

642
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:13,777
Rym: Yeah, that was the thing I've noticed.

643
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:18,379
Rym: the most is that I mean if you have a generic panel It's just we are webcomic artists.

644
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,209
Rym: people always ask the same questions no matter what.

645
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:25,224
Rym: How do you feel more about having the webcomic panel where that's the webcomic panel?

646
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:34,548
Rym: our topic at this convention is Blah about webcomics or blah about whatever and then it's just kind of more round table kind of like this only with a lot less alcohol.

647
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:36,960
Garth: I'm actually yeah, that sounds like fun.

648
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,201
Garth: Well.

649
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:42,303
Mookie: Yeah, because we all everyone All this alcohol, but I'm the only one with a glass of wine.

650
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:45,715
Rym: so honestly everyone here Yeah, all right I love drinks and Conrad.

651
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:51,194
Rym: as the conversation went on everyone was so into it that they all kind of just put their drinks down And did forgot about it.

652
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,481
Mookie: I think you're right where to represent.

653
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:56,250
Rym: I'm gonna say I drank steadily throughout this entire conversation.

654
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:01,364
Mookie: Anything to make the general webcomics panels more focused.

655
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:02,368
Mookie: I am all for.

656
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:05,968
Brian: yeah I think if the topics were good because a lot of me the topics are kind of limited.

657
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:16,729
Brian: also There are more time because the last thing I would want to see is a webcomic a panel where the topic is like promotion You know because for an audience obviously they don't care about the promotion.

658
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:22,369
Rym: I mean what if it's a audience of aspiring webcomic artists, that's true It depends on your audience.

659
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:29,181
Brian: But I mean I guess that would be the best one for I don't know Otakon because there'd be a lot more Much bigger pool to choose from.

660
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:30,390
Brian: the topics were good.

661
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,507
Rym: You can have a panel about anything at Otakon and people would go to it.

662
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:37,690
Laram: I think an interesting thing would be to group the webcomics.

663
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:53,508
Laram: I made a weird list a minute ago, but if you group the webcomic Genres sort of like by people who do One-shot-a-day joke strips you did people who were maintaining a high in-depth storyline.

664
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,793
Laram: if you grouped if you if if and when

665
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:57,554
Rym: you in

666
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:01,439
Laram: as as the the convention staff if you were to control

667
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:01,519
Brian: and

668
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,618
Laram: And with with some level of finesse hopefully

669
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,420
Mookie: who was

670
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,459
Laram: at the panel what the topic would be you could sort of move the conversation along like you're saying

671
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:13,539
Rym: and

672
00:52:15,983 --> 00:52:17,007
Laram: And maybe you wouldn't need

673
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,734
Rym: an uberwebcomic panel or

674
00:52:19,156 --> 00:52:21,422
Laram: maybe you could Deal

675
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:21,642
Rym: with

676
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:26,799
Laram: those groups of people individually throughout and just say okay for one question for this

677
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:28,243
Scott: Audience

678
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:30,471
Laram: so you don't have one question for 50 people.

679
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:35,677
Laram: you have one question for 20 people and then you have the next question for 20 people and then you have the next question like that.

680
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:37,041
Rym: I don't You would.

681
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:43,020
Laram: you'd have to really work at it, and I haven't put in enough time or thought into how it would work out.

682
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,546
Laram: I'm just making up ideas.

683
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:48,840
Brian: I think people just have to stop looking at webcomics as a concrete thing.

684
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:50,084
Brian: I mean if we're gonna.

685
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:55,562
Brian: It's just people see webcomics, and that's I Don't know.

686
00:52:55,582 --> 00:52:56,890
Brian: I was trying to say like that.

687
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:59,263
Brian: They say like seeing baseball It's just a sport.

688
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,014
Brian: so it's like they use that to cover all sports.

689
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,889
Brian: so a Webcomic is a webcomic is a webcomic doesn't quite work.

690
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,700
Rym: Yeah, I mean as a as a completely non webcomic artists.

691
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:19,800
Rym: to me my perspective That's the genre that's it I Mean.

692
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:30,752
Rym: I guess my perspective purely as a fan of webcomics and a friend of webcomic artists seems to be that the general webcomics panel Existed when webcomics were a new thing and people were like what's this all about.

693
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,880
Rym: or oh my god my all the webcomic artists.

694
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,218
Rym: I love her there, and it's just amazing and they can ask these questions and now it seems like it's just an unnecessary thing.

695
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:42,720
Rym: like now Podcasting is kind of new and a podcasting panel Seems like it has a great draw.

696
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Rym: But two years from now if people are still doing generic podcasting panels They would be I think just as I don't want to use the word useless, but useless as generic webcomic panel.

697
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,251
Brian: Well, yeah, you think of it like if you were to have an anime convention.

698
00:53:55,411 --> 00:54:06,955
Garth: Just one panel that just says anime panel And that's it To explain to all the people coming to the anime convention what anime is.

699
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:08,680
Garth: yes right exactly what influences?

700
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:16,058
Aido: to watch anime Same thing and especially at a convention like ConnectiCon that seems to have made his claim to fame.

701
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,028
Aido: being The webcomic friendly convention.

702
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:26,820
Brian: having a generic webcomics panel seems kind of useless Because they've gotten away almost gotten away from the webcomic catering.

703
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:31,059
Brian: They had the webcomic catering when they were doing the several panels grouping people together.

704
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,573
Brian: now It's just the one big you know panel, but they invite all of us.

705
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:35,556
Brian: Oh well.

706
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,480
Brian: I live in Hartford.

707
00:54:39,663 --> 00:54:41,838
Brian: I Still want them to pay my plane fare.

708
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:47,373
Brian: I'll drive to Bradley Airport have them swing me around in the air.

709
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:49,360
Brian: land me get a cab right?

710
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:55,289
Rym: No, you just go to the airport hang out in the lounge for four hours Grab you by the ankles, and I'll swing you around in the air.

711
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,651
Mookie: How's that?

712
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,715
Brian: That's cool.

713
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,004
Brian: I'd go to Connecticut for that Sexy.

714
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:01,099
Brian: let's have you give me a band.

715
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:28,440
Laram: I Actually had a brief conversation with with Matt Daigle the con chair of ConnectiCon earlier And he said that this year was a very strange year for scheduling Because a lot of people were either not showing up Friday Because they couldn't get off work Or they had to leave before Sunday even started so they could get back or something along those lines.

716
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:36,520
Laram: So it was very strange To try to arrange things that I mean even guests that were showing up.

717
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:44,773
Laram: We're asking questions through email of well if I buy a three-day pass do I get a discount if I'm not gonna be there Friday or something like that?

718
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:58,140
Laram: and He he was very confused by it because they hadn't had this issue in other years And they could split things up across multiple days whereas in this convention It seemed like Saturday was the main King day.

719
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,896
Rym: Well actually in terms of I mean I go to like every freaking convention now and in terms of the convention.

720
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:23,540
Rym: I guess industry Smaller conventions are for most people a one-day affair and as we saw with the New York Comic Con debacle when it just collapsed under its own weight Because the fact that they didn't expect people to show up and everyone in the world showed up Saturday Unless a con is large like Katsucon oda khan even kind of and ConnectiCon is getting there.

721
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,318
Rym: They're very close to being the I guess big con category.

722
00:56:26,379 --> 00:56:27,563
Rym: that It's very.

723
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:34,100
Rym: people won't take a vacation day from work to go to the con all three days And it really is economical to go one day.

724
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:43,955
Rym: So all the cons that aren't an oda khan are having a huge problem with the fact that they have more people Saturday than and All the other days combined, but if they put programming on Friday a lot of people don't show up to it.

725
00:56:43,975 --> 00:56:49,840
Rym: I Don't know if there's an answer to that other than become a bigger con or that is a bigger problem.

726
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:57,044
Mookie: I think more for like the the fall and winter conventions as opposed to the summer conventions Friday programming.

727
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:01,379
Mookie: for obviously summer conventions don't aren't hassled as much because people are out of school.

728
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:13,579
Mookie: A couple of conventions are smart enough to start their programming on Friday at like five or six o'clock in the at night Because that's when people are out of work and out of school out of class.

729
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:16,035
Mookie: And I've gone through the lines.

730
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:26,192
Mookie: Yeah So it's it's seasonal size and I guess Look, I'm basically run out of questions.

731
00:57:26,212 --> 00:57:27,299
Rym: You guys want to wrap up I can.

732
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:38,072

00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:45,224
Garth: I hated it.

736
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,610
Brian: I hated the term before.

737
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:50,284
Rym: Yeah, the problem with it is that so many people, you know, they hear.

738
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,187
Rym: Oh you have a radio show.

739

761
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:43,120
Laram: That one really impressed me As opposed to one of the movies that I think is one of the best Even though it bored the heck out of me in places.

762
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:47,039
Laram: 2001 was put together really really well.

763
00:59:48,679 --> 01:00:03,632
Laram: I last saw it several years ago, and so I don't necessarily have the The analysis and and and the strength of mind to really remember it But at the time I thought it was well put together.

Rym: It is in one of our hotel rooms Laundry everywhere.

837
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:19,210
Mookie: My favorite movie ever made is the adventures of Baron munchausen by Terry Gilliam.

838
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:31,269
Mookie: It's such a wonderful fantasy that just eschews most all reality and just tells the and tells of the immense power of Storytelling even if it's a total lie.

839
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:38,310
Mookie: But who knows I just love Baron munchausen for the adventure that it takes me on and that I just can leave reality behind.

840
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:40,277
Mookie: One of the best movies.

841
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,387
Mookie: I think ever made was the Iron Giant.

842
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:51,487
Mookie: If you had a small bit of clapping at I that movie is such a tearjerker even though It's not a very sad ending.

843
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:52,212
Mookie: I cried.

844
01:05:52,554 --> 01:05:53,420
Mookie: Oh, yeah, I cry.

845
01:05:53,560 --> 01:06:04,978
Mookie: I think every time I watch a movie I cry a little earlier into the movie, so I think eventually I'll just cry with a opening credits roll It to you, and you'll start yeah, or just say Mookie the Iron Joe.

846
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:10,124

01:06:33,427 --> 01:07:04,027
Aido: at this particular moment in time with my whimsical nature my favorite movie has to be everything is illuminated Which is which is an excellent excellent film with excellent excellent music if you ever ever have the chance to see it I. it's a very really really whimsical movie, and I kind of love it to death, and it's beautifully shot and Probably I Because I'm dating Brian Carroll.

856
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:06,957
Aido: I have to say citizen Kane is the best movie ever made.

857
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:11,016
Aido: but But in my personal opinion.

858
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:19,736
Aido: I think That in my world the best movie ever made is wings of desire Which I don't think anyone in this room has seen except for myself.

859
01:07:20,258 --> 01:07:25,580
Aido: in retrospect It was actually a huge probably should have been a huge influence of my comic.

860
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:33,809
Aido: It was eventually made into a horrible horrible American remake called City of Angels which I hope none of you have seen.

861
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:38,468
Aido: I hate Nicolas Cage.

862

Rym: I eventually would have done something.

864
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:53,702
Rym: it was somewhat like that song almost No, I don't believe you.

865
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:58,530
Rym: well It would have been as close as my voice is gonna get after three days of shouting at all of my friends.

01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:01,013
Aido: Wings of desire.

867

01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:09,584
Garth: I Have this horrible curse of filling in everything that movies or stories or books or anything leaves out.

869
01:08:09,925 --> 01:08:22,850
Garth: so I take I go I go Like latch on to the parts those shining jewels in all the crap that I that are awesome And I build up what should have been instead of what is and I ignore that.

870
01:08:23,471 --> 01:08:30,640
Garth: So I think I would actually really really like this movie that I did not know City of Angels was based on as City of Angels was actually kind of enjoyable.

871
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:31,968
Laram: actually I have seen it.

872
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,033
Laram: They showed it.

873
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:44,078
Laram: they showed it to us in architecture so that we would know Where that movie came from because they had a film series that they were showing us great classics And that was one of them.

874
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:45,607
Aido: It was made like the 80s.

875
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:57,048
Rym: Well not to rush you but garage band for anyone who doesn't use max is Somewhat terrible and we don't have more than about 10 more minutes of recording before it arbitrarily decides to stop.

881
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:22,010

882
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,843

883
01:09:26,384 --> 01:09:29,553

886
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:44,491

01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:47,420
Garth: The even tastier when they're when you're dead.
