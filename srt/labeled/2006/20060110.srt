00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,650
Rym: It's Tuesday January 10th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,940
Rym: We talk about retro Atari classics weird worlds and civilization, too.

3
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:20,318
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:27,287
Rym: So I had the interesting experience of me and my co-worker Upstaging high-level tech support today.

5
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,435
Scott: It's not hard to upstage tech support.

6
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:30,796
Rym: Well.

7
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,500
Rym: This isn't like normal tech support.

8
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,244
Rym: This is like privileged Calling that.

9
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:37,814
Rym: like the developers or the highest level of.

10
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:48,208
Rym: we will debug your problem with our Application and then if need be write a personal fix that we will send to you specifically to patch your program All right, or if you find a real problem.

11
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:51,940
Rym: We'll you know make a service pack that addresses that okay?

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:03,580
Rym: So I've been on and off the phone and sending emails or as they call them an IBM notes because they use Lotus Notes to this guy for a number of weeks and I'm not getting anywhere with him.

13
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:10,524
Rym: He just keeps asking for information and I keep eliminating all the things that he's trying to say this are the problem when it's obvious to me that they're not the Problem.

14
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:11,820
Rym: and finally I get sick of it.

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,720
Rym: So me my co-worker do some investigating on our own and we found the problem and solved it great.

16
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,951
Rym: So I called him back, and I was like all right tell you what.

17
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:27,979
Rym: here's what the problem is blah blah blah, so Wow Yeah, I don't know.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,440
Rym: I mean this was like the highest level in like.

19
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:34,970
Rym: Imagine if you called Microsoft and eventually they pushed you through to Bill Gates, and he was just like I don't know.

20
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,157
Scott: Well, he doesn't know I don't expect them to

21
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:55,197
Rym: yeah But say they say you had a problem with like a part of Windows and you had like the the platinum gold ultra whatever service plan and you got to the developer who actually wrote the specific code you're having a problem with and he was Just like I don't know Well, and then you solved this problem for him.

22
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:04,249
Scott: See the thing about Microsoft is that there they have like a different person writing different pieces And you can never figure out who wrote which piece.

23
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:12,720
Scott: and I remember reading stories on the internet about some guy who had like a Problem with some weird thing and he went running around Microsoft looking for people and it was undocumented.

24
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:16,560
Scott: Apis, and you know it's just craziness when you get with giant applications.

25
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:26,538
Rym: But I mean it was because usually when I have a problem like this with like a real software And I really need you know assistance Eventually, I'll get through to someone who knows the answer and fixes it.

26
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:30,539
Rym: for me It was really kind of a shock to realize that I had hit the end of the line.

27
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:38,400
Scott: Well, maybe it was just like someone got replaced And that wasn't actually the guy who wrote it it was just a replacement.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,584
Rym: Well to not really.

29
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:40,427
Rym: I mean this.

30
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,615
Rym: probably wasn't the developer who did that part.

31
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,140
Rym: He's just a support guy for it.

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,011
Rym: But suffice to say there are a lot of people are having issues with this software.

33
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:56,019
Rym: It's not just me and You can usually get more help it seems by asking other people like me who had trouble and just fix it on their own.

34
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,319
Rym: They only get by calling the people who make the stupid thing.

35
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,012
Scott: Open source wins again.

36
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,138
Rym: Yeah, open source wins awesome.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,116
Scott: so Apple has this magic power of dominating the news with basically no effort whatsoever.

38
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:13,400
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's cool.

39
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:19,939
Rym: I share my office with this cool Korean guy and normally is real quiet And I'm real quiet, and I do my thing and he does this thing.

40
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,903
Rym: But today was the day when Mac stuff was coming out so all day He's.

41
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,140
Rym: he's like he turned to me.

42
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,983
Rym: He'd be like cuz.

43
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,572
Rym: he had a little like text feed look like a little RSS thing.

44
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:33,055
Rym: they just kept updating whenever like anything was Said at this Mac thing and he turned to me.

45
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,820
Rym: He'd be like Bob of lie and tell Bob a lot.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,584
Rym: I was like yeah, I just saw cuz I was watching something similar at the same time And then later I I went because I wanted to see how much something was gonna cost and I went to the Apple store And I saw that note.

47
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:46,829
Rym: they're like the Apple store is down.

48
00:03:46,909 --> 00:04:00,734
Rym: that note always comes up whenever Steve jobs is on stage and I was like crap and I turn to look and I see that he has just hit the exact same thing and he turns to me and I'm like Yeah, everyone's like oh the store is down.

49
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,580
Scott: that means new products.

50
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:06,777
Scott: You know that's how they can because sometimes people would be like is he even gonna announce anything?

51
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:07,720
Scott: is anything gonna happen?

52
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,640
Scott: They didn't even know if keynotes are gonna happen.

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,587
Scott: It was so secret and they'd be like up.

54
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:12,310
Scott: the store went down.

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,980
Scott: something's gonna happen or all the store hasn't gone down.

56
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,803
Scott: Nothing's going on.

57
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:16,204
Scott: go home.

58
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,714
Rym: Yeah, but there are some pretty big news.

59
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:24,579
Scott: all right the biggest news today Is the MacBook Pro Apple MacBook Pro.

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:24,760
Scott: well?

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,074
Scott: They're not calling it the PowerBook anymore because it's not based on.

62
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:31,360
Scott: it's not based on PowerPC But it's still basically a PowerBook.

63
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:43,155
Scott: So it's got an Intel core duo processor instead of a g5 and it's wicked fast Yeah, and a pile of RAM and all the goodies you'd expect.

64
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:59,128
Scott: basically you can either spend $2,000 to get like a half gig of RAM and 80 gig hard drive And you know a pretty substantial perfect laptop, or you can spend $2,500 and get the god mother God raper laptop.

65
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:04,824
Rym: I mean honestly I mean I'm kind of in the market to buy a new computer But I really want to spend money.

66
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:12,500
Rym: if I had a couple grand lying around one of these would have been pre-ordered already And then I will be checking the post office every day to see if it had been shipped.

67
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,380
Scott: Yeah, it's it's pretty badass, and I feel sorry for anyone who just bought a PowerBook.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Scott: Yeah, yeah, the only thing that pissed me off is it only comes in I think a 15-inch widescreen.

69
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:25,425
Rym: Yeah, you wanted a little 12-inch II.

70
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:28,155
Scott: if there was a 12-inch one of these for 1500 I'd have it already.

71
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:30,832
Scott: I would have clicked order.

72
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:31,739
Scott: do we shut up?

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,151
Rym: I mean this thing's got gigabit ethernet built in a backlit keyboard.

74
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,740
Rym: You know all the cool little fancy Apple backlit keyboard.

75
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,049
Rym: It's got an Apple remote.

76
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,740
Scott: Oh yeah, the remotes a big thing.

77
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,776
Rym: It's got a fast radio like a really fast radion DVI out giant ass.

78
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,180
Rym: hard drive DVD burner.

79
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,691
Rym: Wow, yeah burner dual layer DVD burner in a laptop.

80
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,477
Scott: Well laptops have those nowadays.

81
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:54,500
Scott: You're a little behind the times.

82
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,979
Rym: Yeah, I'm a little behind the times, but it's just awesome, and it's so thin.

83
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:04,695
Scott: Yep, it's basically Badass PowerBook plus everything and it since it has the x86 processor.

84
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:05,980
Scott: It's been confirmed.

85
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,978
Scott: You can do crazy Linux and Windows on it.

86
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:10,719
Scott: Can't beat that.

87
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:16,240
Scott: Yeah, and dual booting on a laptop is way more convenient than on a desktop because you turn it on and off all the time.

88
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:25,499
Scott: You know you turn it off put it in the bag take it out turn it on and usually when you turn it on It's a you're carrying it around somewhere, and you're gonna use it for a specific thing when you turn it on.

89
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:28,511
Scott: So dual booting is really just.

90
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:32,329
Scott: there's no inconvenience to it whatsoever Yep, and honestly it's fast enough to where.

91
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,820
Rym: if I got a thing like this it could be my primary workstation.

92
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:38,400
Rym: Yeah, it would just be my only computer, but I wanted to play counter-strike.

93
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,876
Rym: I just plug a USB keyboard and mouse and do it and go nuts.

94
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,001
Scott: yep That'll be it.

95
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:44,505
Scott: then of course it has the awesome screen of now.

96
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:47,150
Rym: so there's one complaint that some people had with it.

97
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,729
Rym: It doesn't have a PCMC.

98
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:50,372
Rym: I a slot.

99
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,309
Scott: I Say, what are you gonna put in that slot?

100
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,372
Rym: Yeah, and to which I had one Kind of useful answer is probably the only answer I could think of.

101
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,453
Rym: if you have a token ring network You need a slot to put a token ring card in.

102
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:05,864
Scott: I actually thought of something else Is at work.

103
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:11,987
Scott: we have these Verizon PCMC a cards to get on the evdu net wireless network Cellular networks.

104
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:16,913
Scott: you know when you're on the train or something you might go on the internet And there's no normal wireless about.

105
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:18,039
Scott: but you know what?

106
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,628
Scott: That's kind of an old busted way of doing things.

107
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:25,186
Scott: in the modern way is to use your Bluetooth to connect to your cell phone And it has the Bluetooth.

108
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,430
Scott: so you don't really.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:34,701
Rym: it has this thing called an express card slot Which I don't know much about but it looks like it's kind of Apple's replacement for PCMC Ia.

110
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:37,879
Rym: for if you really need to add something yeah, I don't know enough about that.

111
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:44,458
Rym: Yeah, and I was trying to follow a link right now to talk about it But every link I clicked on is broken, so we'll have to talk about that another day.

112
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:50,040
Scott: well So there's the new MacBook and now there's a. they did the iMac again.

113
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:56,580
Rym: They just keep updating this iMac all over the place, and you know what the Intel iMac is just as badass as the Intel laptop.

114
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,049
Scott: Yep, it's basically the Intel laptop only.

115
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,595
Scott: it stands up, and you can't.

116
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:06,463
Scott: you can carry it around with you But it's the same design as the existing g5 iMac Only.

117
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:10,099
Scott: it has the core duo processor and the ATI video card and all that.

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,288
Scott: oh There's a 17 and 20 inch ones.

119
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:17,100
Scott: So you get a bigger screen with the iMac and then a bigger hard drive.

120
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:31,230
Scott: It doesn't cost much more than the previous iteration of a car yeah, and it caused less than the the MacBook $1,300 for the 17 inch and $1,700 for the badass one.

121
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:39,554
Scott: yeah, so if you don't need to carry your computer around But you want everything that the MacBook has iMac, and you know what honestly it's.

122
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,100
Rym: these things aren't that big.

123
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,854
Rym: You could probably just carry it around just not.

124
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:43,620
Rym: you can carry it around.

125
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,307
Scott: You just can't like use it on the train.

126
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,837
Scott: you can just bring it from house to house though easily.

127
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:49,843
Scott: yep All right.

128
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,680
Scott: next thing they've got is oh this is I don't know what to think about this.

129
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:04,067
Scott: They got this iPod radio remote control, so it's a wire that goes to your iPod nano or new iPod and At the it comes out a little wire.

130
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:07,480
Scott: at the end of the wire is a little the same control.

131
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,178
Scott: That's on a shuffle.

132
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:12,700
Scott: So you can kind of control the iPod without actually taking it out of your pocket.

133
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,280
Scott: You can just fiddle on with a little wheel on this wire, but the main thing is that it's an FM receiver.

134
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:23,497
Scott: It's also an FM receiver, so if you look at the screen on your iPod You can like listen to radio stations.

135
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:29,200
Rym: now I see no use for this for me because I don't really listen to the radio other than I listen NPR occasionally.

136
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,999
Rym: But I can download most of that yeah.

137
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:39,887
Rym: But uh a lot of people have complained for a long time that the iPod didn't have FM support and that even the crappiest crap mp3 players that FM tuners.

138
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:47,399
Scott: well the thing is is that it is true that even the crappiest of crap players from Southeast Asia have had FM tuners in them.

139
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:53,967
Scott: But the thing is is that I think the reason they ever put it in the iPod is because it's not really necessary And they don't want you.

140
00:09:54,068 --> 00:10:01,640
Scott: the other thing is they don't want you listening to stuff On the radio because that means you're not listening to the stuff you bought on the iTunes music store.

141
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,004
Rym: Yeah, though.

142
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:03,447
Rym: There's nothing.

143
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:04,655
Rym: listen to on the radio anyway.

144
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,340
Scott: That's for sure.

145
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,294
Rym: I mean, I don't want to sound like a bastard, but radio is dead.

146
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,603
Rym: Yeah, all I don't think it's dead You're wrong.

147
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:13,373
Scott: I listen to on my iPod mostly as podcasts and things.

148
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:18,398
Scott: so this is really not so useful for me I mean and the remote control functionality isn't worth the money like.

149
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:21,600
Rym: honestly I've been listening to the radio a bit for the last month or so.

150
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,817
Rym: That's just because the CD player in my car isn't working.

151
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:25,440
Rym: That's probably the only.

152
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:30,863
Rym: That is probably the single factor in the fact that I've listened to more radio in the last month than the rest of my life Combined.

153
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:35,699
Scott: well, I'm gonna get a new car soon, and it'll have a working CD player But I'm probably just gonna use the iPod in the car.

154
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:40,560
Rym: Yeah, for you probably want to get a car that has some sort of RCA input or a dock built into it.

155
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,407
Scott: I'm gonna get something cool like that for sure.

156
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:45,440
Rym: yeah, you know what we'll go shopping cuz I need a new car stereo.

157
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,547
Scott: alright Let's see the next thing they came out with.

158
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:53,120
Rym: oh, there's this little bundly thing that comes with a bunch of stuff for your nano.

159
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:54,803
Scott: Yeah, well no.

160
00:10:54,883 --> 00:11:08,254
Scott: It's see it's an iPod AV connection kit, so it's a. there's an iPod dock and for the normal the video iPod a USB cable a remote control and a thing to plug.

161
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:16,260
Scott: so basically what you would do is you would download Videos from the iTunes music store or buy TV episodes and put them on your video iPod.

162
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:28,808
Scott: Then you would put your video iPod in this dock That's connected to your TV, and you could control it with this remote control to change the video control the video on the screen That's alright.

163
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:37,860
Scott: If you're the kind of person who's Buying videos on the iTunes you know store and putting them on your video iPod thing is this bundle is a hundred bucks.

164
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,899
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's about right.

165
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:42,747
Rym: Not really that exciting.

166
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:58,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean the default iPod Earbuds are kind of crummy, so they charging $50 for some in-ear ones which are much better and You get the little lanyard so you can hang the nano around your neck and it's held on by the headphones.

167
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:07,089
Scott: It's actually a pretty you know clever when you look at it But it's still not much better than the earbuds that come with it.

168
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:07,730
Scott: It's not even.

169
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:08,974
Rym: that is like 50 bucks.

170
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:18,240
Scott: Yeah, so I spent You know like a hundred something on the extra quality headphones where there's you know no way I could damage my hearing.

171
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:23,780
Rym: Yeah, I think that was much better And I got to say I'm in the market real soon to probably just get a nano or something.

172
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,638
Rym: I'll probably also get some nice in-ear non hearing damaging headphones.

173
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:39,219
Scott: yep oh The last thing they came out with is a bunch of new software and I don't know I didn't read all the details of the software cuz just wasn't worth my time because I'm not gonna get it.

174
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:51,998
Scott: yep, anytime soon, but what it comes down to is You're gonna be able to Podcast photo cast and blog and all that stuff real easily and in a real slick fashion.

175
00:12:52,118 --> 00:13:03,154
Scott: if you use a Mac Like you'll see a photo and you'll just drag it somewhere and you'll blog it and then you'll photo cast it And then it'll just make RSS feeds and put them in iTunes stores and do everything for you

176
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:14,160
Rym: because I like I've said a lot I'm kind of in the market for a new computer and The fact that GarageBand is so awesome is really pushing me toward Mac in a way that I've never been pushed before

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:22,568
Scott: Especially since you know the number one thing we need right now is a computer for podcasting action Podcasting then you know well, I

178
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,680
Rym: got it pretty down with all the free utilities and Linux.

179
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,680
Rym: Yeah, GarageBand has a lot of nice little features.

180
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,940
Scott: They added even like a bunch of sound effects and like bumper musics and things to GarageBand to make it easier for you.

181
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:38,600
Rym: Of course, you don't want to use those because that means every crap podcast in the world is gonna have all those then.

182
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:46,180
Scott: Yeah, but they added a feature to where you know They already have some so it's not so hard to add more and it's easy to use them once they're in there.

183
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,213
Scott: Yeah, you see how they made a space.

184
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:57,536
Scott: They made a space for It's like they created an area where you can put bumper musics and sound effects And they put they just fill the area up a little bit for you, you know.

185
00:13:57,617 --> 00:14:05,677
Scott: in case you know There's something in there that's sort of generic that no one will notice that you're just using the ones that are default And then you put your own in and that's how you know.

186
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:08,491
Scott: It's better than right now where you don't have a space for it.

187
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:08,933
Rym: Yep.

188
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,218
Scott: I Think that's all the Apple news.

189
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:21,249
Rym: So things of the day Garfield isn't funny anymore.

190
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:28,853
Scott: Well Garfield hasn't been funny since I think the TV show and Garfield wasn't even funny on the TV show It was that farm part.

191
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,740
Rym: Yeah, Orville pig or whatever.

192
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,205
Rym: His name was Orson Orson pig.

193
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:32,987
Scott: It was the duck.

194
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:33,529
Scott: That was funny.

195
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:36,063
Rym: Now I kind of like Sheldon the guy in the shell.

196
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:56,149
Scott: Oh Anyway, so some guy made this awesome awesome web program where he's basically got a whole bunch of single frames of Garfield comics in a database or something and It randomly selects three of them and makes a new Garfield comic.

197
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:04,550
Rym: The sad thing is that three random frames from a large swatch of Garfield is usually more entertaining than actual Garfield.

198
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:09,383
Scott: Actually, it's can be incredibly entertaining compared to regular Garfield.

199
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:14,777
Scott: I mean even if it comes up with something that's complete nonsense It's still better than regular Garfield.

200
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:18,730
Scott: And if you really try to get something good you can get stuff that's hilarious.

201
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:19,052
Scott: Like.

202
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:22,510
Scott: we just got one that was pretty funny and I got one earlier today.

203
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,970
Scott: That was just like drop dead on the floor funny.

204
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:39,482
Scott: So if you're bored and you want some funniness You can just go play with this thing And basically what happens is you click go and it picks three frames and if you like one of the frames you can click Lock like video poker.

205
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:45,349
Scott: Yeah, and it won't Change that frame and you just keep randomizing until you get what you want.

206
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:57,297
Rym: I mean, I just don't get it because actually I was out not too long ago and I stumbled across a newspaper which I picked up and flipped through until I found the comics and They're terrible Most of them.

207
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:57,478
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:06,788
Rym: Yeah It's cuz when you have to appeal to such a wide swath of humanity, but it doesn't actually appeal to that wide swath It's just inoffensive to them.

209
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:15,638
Scott: well, remember that um there was that thing in Britain where they had to figure out the funniest joke and It was like a joke that would make everyone in the world go.

210
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:25,249
Scott: Hey, hey, hey, you know, it wasn't a joke that would make anyone Roll over on the floor It's just a joke that would make everyone Chuck a little tiny bit.

211
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,920
Rym: Yeah, the thing is like family circus.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,770
Rym: I can't see anyone chuckling even a little.

213
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:32,480
Scott: The ones with a little lie the dotted line.

214
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,545
Scott: I think we talked about this before.

215
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:34,027
Rym: Yeah, we did.

216
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:34,510
Scott: All right.

217
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:39,164
Rym: So, uh point is is cool You've all seen goatse.

218
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:43,243
Rym: goatse is probably if the internet had a flag.

219
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:54,290
Scott: That's probably what's on it Internet the United States of Internet, it's just a big goatse.

220
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,853
Rym: On the very least it's the flag of fortune That's for sure.

221
00:16:58,295 --> 00:16:59,961
Rym: But uh, I guess I'll link to it.

222
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:02,068
Rym: if you've never seen goatse I'll warn you that.

223
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,635
Scott: well Just link to the Wikipedia.

224
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:07,108
Scott: It's it's where people tend to do these days because goatse is not safe for work.

225
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,867
Rym: Go see is a horrible picture.

226
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,167
Rym: I'm sure you've all seen it.

227
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:22,037
Rym: There are now worse things out there like lemon party and top girl but goatse was the first one to catch on because it had a funny domain name and If you actually went into the site it had Odd stuff down there.

228
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,150
Rym: There's just this horrible picture very horrible.

229
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:34,646
Rym: well, I'm sure a lot of people remember the first time they ever experienced it and Someone has decided to go around showing it to people who didn't know what it was and photographing their reactions.

230
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:35,790
Scott: It's great.

231
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,090
Rym: Um, I think my favorite ones are one.

232
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,460
Rym: There's one guy who's not taken aback at all, but he just kind of looking at it in a pondering way.

233
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,630
Rym: I More taken aback than I expected.

234
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,983
Scott: Well, cuz you know, he doesn't do weird freaky stuff.

235
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:52,486
Scott: He just does.

236
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,410
Scott: no he just does chicks.

237
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,895
Scott: He doesn't do weird stuff like that.

238
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:59,310
Scott: So he's a porn star doesn't mean he's not you know, he likes looking at goatse.

239
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,541
Rym: Well, he seems like a cool guy because he was on.

240
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:07,669
Rym: if any of you watch Penn and Teller's bullshit They did a bit on how all those pills that say they make your penis longer don't work.

241
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:13,250
Rym: And they had Ron Jeremy on the show and he was talking about yeah, mine's big but whatever blah blah blah.

242
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,125
Scott: Yeah, he's not so weird.

243
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:25,670
Rym: no no But I got a little amusing anecdote regarding goatse Because when we were sophomores in college Scott had never seen goatse for more than like a nanosecond.

244
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:32,292
Scott: Well, I knew what it was and I knew I didn't want to look at it But he had avoided it like the plague and avoided it very skillfully I might add.

245
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:37,115
Rym: I try numerous times to get him to see it and failed and just ended up having to see it myself haha.

246
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:42,910
Rym: So one day I got up before he did and I decided that I was going to end this once and for all.

247
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:49,423
Rym: so I whipped out my Coloring jet and I printed a full 8 inch by 11 inch.

248
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,189
Scott: There should be laws of a printing goatse.

249
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:51,831
Scott: well There's.

250
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:54,520
Rym: there's another printing goatse story, but I'll do this one first.

251
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,369
Rym: I printed out a full glossy full color goatse and I taped it to his orange juice.

252
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:09,110
Scott: I saw it as soon as I opened the fridge and I. but I did see it and I managed but I did manage to quickly But I did see it there.

253
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,281
Rym: I just remember sitting on my computer and I hear he gets up.

254
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,910
Rym: like he always does he stumbles into the kitchen.

255
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:14,000
Rym: I heard the fridge open.

256
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,569
Rym: then I hear ah What the hell Rym?

257
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,590
Scott: Yeah, it's about right of course.

258
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,335
Rym: uh we got someone else later.

259
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:29,350
Rym: cuz the next time we moved out of the apartment and we moved back in and RIT the school we went to has a giant giant land.

260
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:33,025
Rym: So we plugged into the land and we're like resetting up our computers and everything.

261
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,189
Rym: and we look and we see that Some guy has a printer shared.

262
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,444
Scott: So the right thing to do is to print goatse out of his printer.

263
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:40,947
Scott: Yes.

264
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:46,203
Scott: Yes I mean only a decent human being could do something like that.

265
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,410
Rym: I mean to have done otherwise would have been a crime.

266
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,127
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

267
00:19:53,713 --> 00:20:01,785
Rym: So today is gaming day And we've got two new games and one really really old game to talk about.

268
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:02,266
Rym: Yeah.

269
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:03,570
Scott: Well the two new games.

270
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,720
Scott: I'm the only one who's played them.

271
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,798
Rym: I Saw the first one you're gonna talk about.

272
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:08,681
Scott: All right.

273
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:10,147
Rym: Well, I have something to say about it.

274
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,137
Scott: What the Atari one?

275
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:13,002
Rym: Yeah the Atari one.

276
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:13,546
Scott: All right.

277
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,930
Scott: Well Media play is going out of business.

278
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:20,746
Scott: So we went over there and I was looking at the DS selection because who can pass up 40% off a DS game?

279
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:27,229
Scott: Right, and the only thing that looked like it was worth spending my money on was retro Atari.

280
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,797
Scott: now Usually I shy away from these games.

281
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:36,549
Scott: I mean the best ones are those Midway classics for the GameCube surround castle to stay alive.

282
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,190
Scott: Good job blue commander.

283
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,357
Scott: But anyway The this one has let's see.

284
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,102
Scott: I think 10 games in it.

285
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,932
Scott: All right, and a lot of these are games I like.

286
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:54,221
Scott: so I figured what could be wrong.

287
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,310
Scott: So I'm gonna talk about each game in it just real quick.

288
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:04,350
Scott: Oh also each game has two modes a retro mode and a remix mode aka normal and stupid.

289
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,553
Scott: Yeah It's basically Clatt.

290
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:15,324
Scott: retro mode is what the original game look like maybe slightly updated so that you know You can see on the DS screen the the remix mode.

291
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:17,070
Scott: Basically, they make the game look stupid.

292
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,359
Scott: So, you know that it looks all redone.

293
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,403
Scott: They just change the graphics.

294
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:23,049
Scott: the game plays the same but it looks dumb.

295
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,000
Scott: You and a few of them involve these weird characters.

296
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,205
Scott: I don't even know what the hell's going on.

297
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:30,755
Scott: But anyway Asteroids is in there.

298
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,668
Scott: It's still as hard as the original asteroids.

299
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,558
Scott: good It's it's the same game.

300
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:37,428
Scott: There's nothing really wrong with that.

301
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,935
Scott: Breakout is in there.

302
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,302
Scott: I love breakout.

303
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:42,770
Scott: It's a pretty good breakout.

304
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:50,565
Scott: the one thing about it though, is that If you want you can control it with the stylus by you.

305
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:50,806
Scott: you.

306
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:56,770
Scott: basically this is little Circle at the bottom of the screen and you kind of grab it and drag it back and forth with the stylus.

307
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,215
Rym: Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

308
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,741
Rym: I played that in my web browser.

309
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:02,050
Scott: It's not a very good way to control breakout.

310
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:05,826
Scott: I mean you have to keep the stylus like on this circle if you like.

311
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,408
Scott: go up too high You'll you'll lose it and that's not good.

312
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:12,005
Scott: They should have just said, you know, put it anywhere on the bottom screen.

313
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,109
Scott: What do you need this little knob for?

314
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,275
Scott: I think just bad programming Centipedes on there.

315
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,079
Scott: I love centipede.

316
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:19,748
Scott: That's all I got to say about that.

317
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:22,298
Scott: All right, gravatar is on there.

318
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,345
Scott: I have no clue how to play gravatar.

319
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,156
Scott: I can't get it to work for I just can't play this game.

320
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:29,888
Scott: It's total crap remix or otherwise stylus.

321
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:30,270
Scott: I don't know.

322
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,258
Rym: There's like the first time I tried to play bubbles.

323
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,986
Scott: I just have no clue how to play that game.

324
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:34,528
Scott: forget about it.

325
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,497
Scott: Lunar Landers on there.

326
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:50,782
Scott: I don't know if you played lunar lander, basically You have this little rocket, you know like the thing that land on the moon with the thing that touches down that Neil Armstrong comes out of and you have to control Various rockets on it to keep it for you know floating nicely.

327
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,544
Scott: and then there are.

328
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,510
Rym: there are numerous versions of this game all over.

329
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,770
Rym: Yeah, and you one we're referring to is the real one.

330
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,514
Scott: Yeah, this is where you want.

331
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,290
Scott: you basically have this thing and they throw it into basically this.

332
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:07,243
Scott: you know pixelated terrain and You have to make it land nicely on a flat surface and there's a few flat surfaces.

333
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:13,627
Scott: Usually it's really hard and In certain versions of lunar lander, I think the Atari one in the arcade one.

334
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,210
Scott: I can do it.

335
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,921
Scott: I can land the lander pretty well on this one.

336
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:18,850
Scott: I haven't gotten it to land yet and I gave up trying.

337
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,170
Scott: All right, perhaps the best thing in this whole collection is missile command.

338
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,770
Scott: Now I like missile command and a lot of other people like missile command.

339
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:33,214
Scott: That's the one where the missiles come from the sky and you defend the cities by shooting Explosives at the missiles.

340
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:37,366
Rym: I still have the original missile command cartridge for the Atari 2600 the Atari.

341
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:38,610
Scott: the Atari version was terrible.

342
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:39,553
Scott: It was fine.

343
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:44,290
Scott: No the arcades where it's at because you get the four you get the little tiny buttons one for each missile shooter.

344
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:45,229
Scott: But yeah, yeah.

345
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:51,864
Scott: Anyway, this is perhaps the best missile command ever because you play with the stylus So you just touch the screen and that's where you shoot.

346
00:23:52,328 --> 00:24:00,919
Scott: It's great I don't know why anyone no one ever thought of that before But is perhaps the best Missile command implementation in existence.

347
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:06,236
Scott: So if you like missile command you have to get this Especially if it's real cheap.

348
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:11,393
Scott: I mean it was 20 bucks and then 40% off cheap cheap cheap Pong is in there.

349
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,139
Rym: This is a travesty.

350
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,724
Scott: It's pretty much a travesty.

351
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,710
Scott: I mean, it's pretty much Pong.

352
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,721
Scott: I mean except you're not going left to right you're going up to down.

353
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:26,098
Scott: Well, you're on the down and they're on the up and Uses the dual screens of the DS.

354
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,090
Scott: so it's not quite the same proportion as the original Pong.

355
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:34,687
Scott: but if you want to play multiplayer, you need another cartridge.

356
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:40,063
Rym: now, I Point out that Mario Kart does not require another cartridge to play.

357
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:44,890
Scott: but they cario frickin car But they couldn't get Pong to play on one cartridge.

358
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:54,190
Rym: See it's obvious to me that they either didn't look at the dev kit They got and just didn't know or more likely they wanted to sell twice as many cartridges.

359
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:55,848
Scott: No I don't think it's either one of those.

360
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:13,489
Scott: What this looks like to me is someone just got a DS dev kit and to you know to practice DS coding they just implemented a bunch of Atari games for it and then they said hey if we add like a few hundred more Dollars of development, you know to this then we'll be able to sell it as something cheap and make money off of it.

361
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:17,210
Scott: So they did and they didn't actually care about making it good.

362
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,509
Scott: They just cared about making it good enough to sell.

363
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:25,570
Scott: You know, this is like it's like the lowest crappiest thing that Nintendo will allow you to sell for one of their systems.

364
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,518
Scott: Let's see the other games sprint.

365
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:29,563
Scott: That's that racing game.

366
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:33,035
Scott: It's just hard and not fun Tempest.

367
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:37,293
Scott: Oh Tempest pisses me off on this because I Like tempest.

368
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:42,237
Scott: that's the one where you go around the edge of the circle and you shoot into the middle To shoot the other spaceships.

369
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,729
Scott: Oh, yeah, you can only control this one with the stylus.

370
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:50,801
Scott: really Like there's no way to control it with the arrows.

371
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:54,973
Scott: Okay, so it's pretty much impossible to play Like.

372
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,402
Scott: well, it just sucks.

373
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,400
Scott: Oh The last one the last one is good.

374
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,719
Rym: It's warlords warlords If you've never played it is a absolutely fan fucking tastic.

375
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,710
Rym: like for four player one verse one verse one verse one free-for-all.

376
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,294
Rym: Awesome game.

377
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:10,863
Scott: Yeah, you can play it with the.

378
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:12,572
Scott: you can use the stylus But you don't have to.

379
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,119
Scott: you can use the arrows and it's just.

380
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,244
Scott: it's better with the arrows.

381
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:19,390
Scott: think of it like versus breakout with four people.

382
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,573
Scott: so there's a you.

383
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:23,822
Scott: each person has a corner and each person has a little knobbly.

384
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:28,013
Scott: that goes around the edges of their square corner and It's a big plus.

385
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:38,250
Scott: and this little bouncy fireball bounces around in the plus area And you try to block it from hitting the blocks in your corner and try to hit the other people's blocks.

386
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:41,542
Rym: I used to play it for player on the Atari back in the day.

387
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:42,566
Rym: I still have it.

388
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:43,590
Rym: It's awesome.

389
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:48,394
Scott: It's really awesome and it's for the DS but the multiplayer again You need another cartridge.

390
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:49,037
Scott: It sucks.

391
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,148
Scott: I don't even know if you can actually play warlords multiplayer, huh?

392
00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:00,228
Scott: Pretty much they put multiplayer on here But it's it's pretty much worthless because no one ever is gonna have more than one cartridge of this in any one place.

393
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,612
Scott: Great All right.

394
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:04,699
Rym: So we got two more games to talk about.

395
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:13,535
Scott: Yeah, the other game that I got just recently actually taiko recommended it and It was a PC game.

396
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,123
Scott: so anyone who's gonna start talking about how?

397
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,130
Scott: Oh Scott said there were no good PC games?

398
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,230
Scott: Well, this PC game will run probably on like a 486 so you can stop talking about that now.

399
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:25,537
Rym: Yeah won't run in wine though, so I can't play.

400
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,242
Scott: it almost runs in wine.

401
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:29,850
Rym: So yeah, yeah almost in wine doesn't count for shit.

402
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,223
Scott: Yeah, I mean it shows up and it's about.

403
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:36,849
Scott: it's working perfectly But you can't actually move the mouse in the window because there's some sort of weird bug.

404
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:44,049
Scott: But anyway, it's called weird worlds and it looks a lot like Master of Orion if you've ever played Master of Orion.

405
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:55,149
Scott: and but it's not a giant epic space development game it's a Sort of an exploring high score getting cut type of game.

406
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,134
Scott: You can add there.

407
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:04,352
Scott: your choices are basically you can play the science game the pirate game or the commander game and the science Game.

408
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:12,449
Scott: what you want to do is you want to fly around the galaxy collecting like Artifacts and scientific things and you want to explore black holes and that sort of thing.

409
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:18,384
Scott: the pirate game you want to go around collecting big money items and then bring them back.

410
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:25,167
Scott: and the commander game you want to basically explore and discover alien races and blow people up with your missiles.

411
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,974
Scott: and It's really fun.

412
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:35,580
Scott: like, you know you go around and there's a lot of item management But it's not difficult item management like an RPG.

413
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,190
Scott: It's like, oh look, I found a better gun.

414
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:48,030
Scott: Oh, look, I found a thing that lets me move around the galaxy faster, you know And you only have so many years of game time, you know before you you're done and you have to go back and retire.

415
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:52,405
Scott: So it's like can I do how much more can I do in this time?

416
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:53,590
Scott: Will that make my score go up?

417
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,989
Scott: Will it make my score go down?

418
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,205
Scott: What ship should I put this item in which they want an item?

419
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:00,129
Scott: What should I give them?

420
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,776
Scott: Where should I go next?

421
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:04,526
Scott: You know all the should I engage this combat?

422
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:05,430
Scott: Should I run away?

423
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,301
Scott: It gets really fun.

424
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:20,382
Scott: Thing is when I got I got bored of it for a while But then I rediscovered like the hidden secretness of the game like there's items that do crazy stuff But you don't realize and it changes like the whole game.

425
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:21,527
Scott: It's really it's.

426
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:22,169
Scott: it's pretty cool.

427
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:25,286
Rym: Yeah, I don't have much to say about it since I haven't really played it.

428
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,453
Scott: Yeah Basically it was.

429
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:31,990
Scott: there's a free demo which you can all play and the demo actually kept me occupied for a while.

430
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:37,273
Scott: but then I actually paid 25 bucks and got the full version and I'm not sad.

431
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:39,842
Scott: and even if I do eventually get bored of it.

432
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:40,905
Scott: I can mod it.

433
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,176
Scott: It comes a little mod kit and Modding a space exploration game.

434
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:46,620
Scott: That's gonna be way cool.

435
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:48,125
Scott: I'm gonna come up with something great.

436
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:48,927
Scott: That's for sure.

437
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:50,847
Scott: Yeah All right.

438
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:56,330
Rym: So since I haven't played any new games, I've actually been playing an old game quite a bit lately.

439
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:00,154
Scott: remember civilization - How could you not?

440
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:02,108
Rym: it's probably one of my favorite games ever.

441
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,743
Rym: It's right up there with the old quest for glory games and you have a fighter.

442
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:15,198
Rym: So civilization - in case any of you were you know living under rocks or just never heard of a video game before Sid Myers made this game called civilization.

443
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,367
Scott: Wait before that you made colonization.

444
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,808
Rym: Yes, and Basically the sieve games now?

445
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:25,867
Rym: Well the civilization games because there was a game called sieve which had nothing to do with Sid Myers.

446
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:26,550
Scott: I didn't know that.

447
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,094
Rym: Yeah, it's just this crap game.

448
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,899
Rym: Don't even don't don't get me started.

449
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:43,869
Rym: Okay, these games are basically they start you out at like prehistoric caveman times and you build a tiny little village and You control the destiny of this civilization up until like beyond our modern days.

450
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:51,690
Rym: Yep, it's a. it's a large epic civilization building game that has paid pretty much infinite possibilities.

451
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:53,749
Rym: The replay value is infinites.

452
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:57,790
Scott: That's the number one thing I like about civilization Is it you know?

453
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,598
Scott: There's so many ways to win which is?

454
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:04,290
Scott: I've heard interviews as Sid Meyer where he talks about it And I was pretty much is nodding my head the whole time.

455
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,763
Scott: It's like you can win by building a spaceship.

456
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,270
Scott: You can win by conquering the world.

457
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,090
Scott: You can win in the newer civilizations with culture.

458
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:23,310
Scott: You can win by you know doing all sorts of different, you know things and It's way cool because no one strategy is like the best strategy for winning.

459
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:27,855
Scott: It's pretty much if you play well enough and you know what you're doing You'll win no matter what.

460
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:32,913
Scott: but you get to choose which way you're gonna win so you can make it more fun each time you Play and

461
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:40,808
Rym: also just the the way the game works because usually you play in a randomized map or you can even play on like Real maps like a map of the actual earth and then you play on it.

462
00:31:41,653 --> 00:32:00,449
Rym: But it seems that even though it's just a eyes you're playing against personalities develop and the game always progresses like I've always seemed to end up where I'll be playing and Through no fault of my own the game will just end up where there's me as a superpower and then there's other superpower And there's a big cold war and all these little states like bickering and underneath us.

463
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:03,482
Scott: Yeah, it's just cool how that turns out.

464
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,631
Scott: I think it's partially because of the program.

465
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:09,552
Scott: personalities of the different Nations.

466
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:10,935
Rym: it's always the freakin zulus.

467
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:12,800
Scott: Yeah zulus are pretty dangerous.

468
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,354
Scott: Gandhi is usually dangerous.

469
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:18,741
Rym: Yeah, for some reason Gandhi's really a war monger.

470
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:22,050
Rym: He'll just steal your stuff plunder your villages kill your men women.

471
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:26,067
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why I mean he was such a nice guy, but it's civilization.

472
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:26,750
Scott: He's a bastard.

473
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:28,977
Rym: Actually, I'm a big fan of the Carthaginians.

474
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,067
Scott: I always play as either Babylon or Persia.

475
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,190
Scott: Nah, Persia You know, you got it.

476
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,310
Scott: You got to play the civilizations that no longer exist.

477
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:42,376
Scott: So that way when you get stealth bombers, you can be like, ah, this shouldn't be This shouldn't be.

478
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:43,180
Scott: I mean,

479
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:54,909
Rym: I've had so many good times in that games I used to play when I was in like high school Literally, I'd stay up at night like on the phone with people until 3 or 4 in the morning Just playing Civ 2 and independently that like chatting with people on ICQ or on the phone.

480
00:32:55,592 --> 00:33:08,244
Scott: Mmm, I would just stay up all night playing Civ 2 and till I built the entire Spaceship as with as many parts as I possibly could and then taking off Yep, or I just I just colonize a world as far flung as I could cities everywhere.

481
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:11,309
Scott: I Never did that.

482
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:18,709
Scott: But sometimes I would do like these slow Methodical wars and I would fill my entire island with fanatics just to make sure no one could get me.

483
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:25,754
Rym: My favorite was the nukes that I always build like missile silos or I'd use a bug in the game You could fortify.

484
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:30,192
Rym: you could basically put an air unit somewhere and just leave it there and it would never run out of fuel or Disappear.

485
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:32,240
Rym: so I had a cold war.

486
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,545
Rym: I actually set up nuke like nukes nuclear missiles And I just set them all up off the coast of Asia waiting for Russia to.

487
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:46,284
Scott: you know, give me any shit mmm Nukes are always sort of this if you actually use them in the game like for strategy.

488
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:51,529
Scott: They were kind of like Stabbing yourself and then the other guy gets stabbed, too.

489
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:57,067
Rym: Yep, the game actually it handled nuclear diplomacy and just the whole nuclear weapons thing.

490
00:33:57,127 --> 00:34:00,154
Scott: very realistically Am I realistic?

491
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:04,409
Rym: well as realistically as a simple game like that can in terms of how people react to it.

492
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,136
Rym: Because basically you could.

493
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:14,310
Rym: there's one you can develop the Manhattan Project which gives you nuclear weapons But then it doesn't just give them to you it gives them to everyone.

494
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:22,629
Rym: So there's always this point at which anyone who has enough science could research it But no one wants to because then everyone else is gonna get it, too.

495
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:27,989
Rym: But then eventually some bastard decides he wants it and he does it and then everyone arms.

496
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:33,610
Rym: But there's always some nation that doesn't have like missile technology so they can't really use it and it gets crazy.

497
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,690
Scott: Well, it doesn't actually give you the nukes immediately.

498
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:40,790
Scott: It's like it unlocks the ability to research nukes for everybody.

499
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:50,875
Scott: So it's like if you get Manhattan Project, then you can research nukes right away but other people might take longer and they'll be like don't threaten me with your nukes or You have.

500
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:51,277
Scott: you're lucky.

501
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,081
Scott: you have those nukes.

502
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,775
Scott: I'll do whatever you say We have them.

503
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,430
Rym: Yeah nukes work a lot like the Great Wall of China works early in the game.

504
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:04,790
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the same Like effect as far as the foreign policy is concerned.

505
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,540
Rym: There's so many funny little things in the game.

506
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,808
Rym: like you have to pick a government.

507
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:09,753
Rym: you can have Revolution.

508
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:12,449
Rym: sometimes your people were revolt on their own and change the government for you.

509
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:20,593
Rym: But if you pick democracy every time you start a war Your Senate will always just yell at you and then vote you down and stop the war like you'll be.

510
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:29,069
Rym: you'll have troops outside of the enemy city's capital and you're laying siege to it and you're all set to plunder and Suddenly the Senate's like, alright, you can't have a war anymore and they take all your troops away.

511
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:35,190
Scott: Well, sometimes it'll be the opposite like someone will declare war on you and normally you wouldn't want to declare war.

512
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:38,769
Scott: You might want to make peace and the Senate be like no we got to kill those guys.

513
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:44,189
Rym: Of course Usually what I do when that happens is I overthrow my own government install some sort of fundamentalist nutbag dictator.

514
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:55,930
Scott: Yeah I usually play the game where I go monarchy and then I go for a public democracy to get all the science and Then if there's a if I need to build stuff, I'll use communism.

515
00:35:56,653 --> 00:36:05,059
Scott: But then as soon as I get the end and there's no more science left and I've built enough stuff fundamentalism the game has a nice funny jab at just that.

516
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,912
Rym: one of the government's is fundamentalism and Fundamentalism.

517
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:13,710
Rym: your people are always happy no matter what and they give you tons of money in the form of tides.

518
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,629
Rym: But your science rate the rate at which you develop science is cut in half.

519
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,355
Rym: Yep, huh?

520
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,050
Scott: Basically because but it once you reach the end of the game you don't need more science.

521
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,198
Scott: So it's fine to be fundamentalist.

522
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,302
Scott: You don't get that penalty.

523
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:30,956
Scott: and then you get this new unit You can produce.

524
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:32,490
Rym: the fanatic fanatics are great.

525
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,774
Rym: They cause nothing to maintain.

526
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:38,250
Rym: you think they're cheap to build and basically they just stand there and make a mess.

527
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:39,394
Scott: Yeah, you can just.

528
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:44,150
Scott: basically what I do is I'll build like a bunch of self bombers and cruise missiles.

529
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:51,490
Scott: And if anyone makes trouble, I send all the cruise missiles and self bombers over there to destroy all of their military units.

530
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:58,062
Scott: And then the fanatics invade the city and take it over and there's not much you can do about it Especially if the fanatics come by train.

531
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:01,059
Scott: Yeah They're just unstoppable.

532
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:12,645
Rym: I Mean basically we could go on and on about this game for hours But suffice to say if you've never played civil as a civilization game I highly recommend you download Civ 2 because it's abandonware.

533
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:13,669
Rym: You can just pick it up.

534
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,750
Scott: Well, actually that's technically an illegal link, but the guy still has it up and no one's bothered him.

535
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,874
Rym: So yes, you know what?

536
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,219
Rym: It's abandonware enough for me.

537
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,768
Rym: Yeah, this is a fantastic game.

538
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:27,250
Scott: They'll warn you It's not like it matters because you could buy it for five bucks in the store.

539
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:29,437
Rym: Yep, and Civ 3 played a bit.

540
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:29,959
Rym: It's good.

541
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,210
Rym: and Civ 4 which has just come out as supposedly like awesome.

542
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:34,657
Scott: Yeah, we'll have to see about that.

543
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:35,280
Scott: We don't know yet.

544
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,270
Rym: Yeah, cuz once again, I can't run it in Linux.

545
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:40,823
Scott: Yeah, but you know get any of the civilization games.

546
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:41,887
Scott: I mean even civilization.

547
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:44,060
Scott: one is good Yeah, not as good as two.

548
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:48,570
Rym: two is like, you know Considered two to be like the ultimate civilization game.

549
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,524
Rym: Yeah and three was good but a lot of people had complaints about it.

550
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:55,890
Rym: and they say that four Takes all the good from three and all the good from two and mashes them together.

551
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,406
Scott: And they say that four actually has multiplayer.

552
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:03,688
Scott: that makes sense Even though I don't know the specifics of that because the multiplayer in two and three really doesn't work out so well.

553
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:13,871
Rym: and That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
