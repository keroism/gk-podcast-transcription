1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,587
Scott: It's Tuesday October 3rd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:17,848
Scott: We talk about Capcom classics mini-mix and Def Con.

3
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:21,128
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,741
Rym: So today I did something that I haven't done for a long time.

5
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,246
Rym: Maybe if you're real good about myself.

6
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,028
Rym: I'm a big man.

7
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,009
Rym: now I killed Hitler again.

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:31,477
Scott: Wait a minute.

9
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:32,381
Scott: Wait a minute.

10
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,150
Scott: Hitler was dead before you were born.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,873
Rym: Yeah, I know.

12
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:35,856
Rym: and kept.

13
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:48,906
Rym: commander kilft brought him back and then He killed the guy after busting out of some lightning and then I shot him in the face after he said damn you So you didn't go to work?

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,173
Scott: You went to Germany instead.

15
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,163
Rym: see well I beat a game that I love.

16
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:56,129
Rym: I beat bionic commando again.

17
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,806
Rym: Uh-huh now unlike other times.

18
00:00:58,846 --> 00:00:59,309
Rym: I've beaten it.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,230
Rym: I beat it in a straight shot on a non emulated fully legitimate.

20
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,850
Scott: No possible way to cheat medium, but so wait when you were a kid you never beat it on the NES.

21
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,450
Rym: Oh, I did, but I didn't beat it that quickly.

22
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,124
Rym: Aha, I mean usually I'd save up.

23
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:19,310
Rym: my nine continues And then I'd spend like six of them on the last two stages.

24
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:22,304
Rym: Falling in the fire over and over and over and over again.

25
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:23,470
Scott: That's a good strategy.

26
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,099
Scott: Falling in the fire sure way to win.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,889
Rym: Yeah, well if I keep stacking up the bodies.

28
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:36,580
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I had Megaman 2 on a on a cartridge for the GBA or the DS I would beat it just as easily.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,750
Scott: so yeah, there's some games.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,942
Scott: You just you know you never fail to beat him.

31
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:45,042
Rym: once you know once you're the master I wonder we had to look up how long those games are cuz.

32
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,046
Rym: that's something stupid.

33
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,154
Rym: we could do with a con Megaman 2 vs.

34
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:48,816
Rym: Bionic commando.

35
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:49,678
Rym: who beats it first?

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,430
Scott: yeah races, and you know single-player platformers.

37
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:58,450
Rym: Yeah, especially if you're playing two different games that happen to have similar lengths or something crazy like that.

38
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,620
Scott: Yeah, this actually reminds me of something.

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,670
Scott: is that a long time ago?

40
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:03,587
Scott: You may not know.

41
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:10,509
Scott: But the Megaman games for the NES and the SNES and whatever are different from the Megaman games of the Gameboy.

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,393
Rym: You don't say.

43
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:14,746
Scott: yeah, Megaman 2 and 3 for the Gameboy and other.

44
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,074
Scott: there are other Gameboy Megaman's are not.

45
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:21,407
Scott: it's the same as Megaman 2 and Megaman 3 for the NES.

46
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,310
Scott: They're different games.

47
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:26,129
Scott: Yeah, not they have some of the same bosses, but they're different games mostly.

48
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,802
Rym: yeah It's not just different like oh, they're in olive and brown instead of color.

49
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,226
Rym: They're actually different games.

50
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:48,108
Scott: Yeah, so Capcom you know they released Megaman mix which is you know Megaman anniversary edition Which all the Megaman's then they had a Megaman X which had all the Megaman X's But they haven't released the supposedly going to be released Megaman Gameboy mix.

51
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,844
Rym: well Scott Why haven't they released this wonderful gem that we've been waiting for for all these years?

52
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:58,445
Scott: well a long time ago Some talking about you know they lost code or something like that.

53
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:05,424
Scott: and yeah Whatever the thing is is hey couldn't they just get the cartridge?

54
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,250
Scott: cuz I mean I've seen cartridges around.

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,930
Scott: They're not you know super common, but they exist.

56
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:19,610
Scott: I'm pretty sure there's one at the GameStop or the EB or whatever across the river Yeah, and just rip the ROM out of it and put it on a Gameboy advanced cartridge with an emulator.

57
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:20,976
Rym: You know what I'll bet.

58
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:28,570
Rym: the answer to that is simply that that's probably the most rational Intelligent and expedient way to solve this problem, so of course no one would do it.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,658
Scott: I just want to point out the Capcom released Capcom classics mini mix for the GVA.

60
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:39,819
Scott: that has three games in it, and they haven't released the Megaman mix Games three games.

61
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:43,728
Scott: Yes, that is how many games not five Five is right out.

62
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,764
Rym: But before we move on to the you know news the video game news.

63
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:54,509
Rym: since it is video game day I would like to say do the thing I've been doing for the last two weeks And it'll end at the end of this week.

64
00:03:54,931 --> 00:04:03,678
Rym: We are going to be this weekend October 6th 7th and 8th in Utica, New York for Citacon S I T a con.

65
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:16,410
Rym: it is an anime and gaming convention that mostly anime mostly anime But there's gonna be pretty much 24/7 gaming video gaming mostly, but some also a little bit of role-playing gaming Yeah, also the fact that we're going to be bringing some German gaming.

66
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:31,890
Rym: We are definitely going to be breaking out some gaming of the GeekNights' fashion, so if you live anywhere within about 400 miles of Utica, New York I highly recommend you come because regardless of this convention Which is a first-run convention it could be hit or miss.

67
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:37,390
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna pretend that is it's automatically gonna be awesome because I don't know I'm optimistic.

68
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:44,122
Rym: I think it'll be a good con, but I can guarantee 100% you got the front row crew backing this up.

69
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,314
Rym: there will be awesome to be had At this con.

70
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:47,696
Scott: wait a minute.

71
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:49,604
Scott: how much of the front row crew is backing this up?

72
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:50,608
Scott: you and me and that's it.

73
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,720
Scott: well We're pretty much everyone else copped out and they want to go.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,065
Rym: the whole crew bailed on us.

75
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,490
Scott: Yeah, what the hell guys?

76
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,690
Scott: What the hell to their convention right there?

77
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,676
Scott: And you all bailed to their credit.

78
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,870
Rym: one of the people who is not coming is not coming because a relative died.

79
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,240
Rym: Another one is getting some rather horrible dental surgery.

80
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,630
Rym: No one else could get off work and some people live in, Texas.

81
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:17,317
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I'm just saying that you know They could have come on Saturday for free.

82
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:17,618
Scott: What it is.

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,084
Rym: Well, they'd have to drive there.

84
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,850
Scott: Yeah, it's relatively free.

85
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,011
Scott: Come.

86
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:27,030
Scott: a compared compared to what you're gonna get out of this convention, you know as to what it cost to get there.

87
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,955
Scott: Come on, come on.

88
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:34,030
Rym: I mean that I don't think you guys understand just how much we're gonna be pulling at this con.

89
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:43,341
Rym: I mean if you have never been around us and seen the kind of hijinks we pull whenever social order breaks down I think that we are besides the con chair himself.

90
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,969
Scott: We are doing more at this convention than anyone else.

91
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,520
Rym: I mean in addition to the events, we're running sanctioned.

92
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:54,281
Rym: You will not understand the magnitude of the unsanctioned events We're gonna be running at this car.

93
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:59,190
Scott: I mean at the bare minimum We're gonna be in the artists alley making an evil ruckus at bare minimum.

94
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,350
Scott: But as soon as got artists alley closes watch us bust out crazy games.

95
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,950
Scott: Watch us bust into the gaming room and set up impromptu video game tournaments.

96
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,868
Scott: Watch us run around yelling and screaming and grabbing people and making mischief.

97
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:20,710
Rym: Yep Plus while the front row crew is gonna be there We're gonna have Dave and Joel from fast karate for the gentlemen, my favorite rust hurricane related podcast.

98
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,422
Rym: I gotta stop making these rust hurricane jokes.

99
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,050
Scott: I know but they can't.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,437
Rym: Turcane what's?

101
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,967
Rym: uh, what's Megaman week against?

102
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,260
Rym: Ross hurricane Really?

103
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,338
Scott: Yeah No, he's kind of equally weak.

104
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:45,722
Rym: you can't defend against ten Ross hurricanes, okay, there we go Though also as a total aside before we get into the actual video game stuff.

105
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:54,404
Rym: to all the people out there kind of question You know, hey if you guys ever seen homestar runner, the answer is yes We are well aware of home star runner.

106
00:06:54,444 --> 00:07:00,887
Rym: great chair up there We uh slice we were watching them home star runners back when there were only ten strong bad emails.

107
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,534
Rym: home style Home star.

108
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,810
Scott: my favorite character home star is by far the best character cuz he is indeed.

109
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:18,476
Rym: All I'd like to say is that while home star is awesome It played itself out for us.

110
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:21,686
Rym: I'll pretty much four years ago.

111
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:26,190
Scott: Oh the crap All right, let's get crazy good nuts.

112
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,889
Rym: Okay with the video game news.

113
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,035
Rym: We'll start with Scott cuz.

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,728
Rym: my name isn't actually video game related at all.

115
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:32,190
Rym: You suck.

116
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:41,835
Scott: Anyway, so last year Activision made a study about video game advertising and everyone said hey Activision sponsored that study.

117
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,677
Scott: We can't trust it.

118
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:42,838
Rym: Now.

119
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:51,014
Rym: You might remember Activision from such classic hits as pitfall river raid mech warrior 2 Yeah.

120
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,622
Rym: Yeah, so two decades ago.

121
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:53,990
Rym: They were a great game company.

122
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:58,828
Scott: Well, they're a game publisher and they publish some good games and they publish some bad games.

123
00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,450
Scott: and what do you want?

124
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,830
Scott: I can't recall the fact that they've stuck around since the Atari days and they're still here is pretty impressed.

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,413
Scott: You know why?

126
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,729
Rym: because there are people who buy games like BMX xxx.

127
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,266
Rym: Yeah, I guess that is the reason people like activists can continue to exist.

128
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,633
Scott: Yeah, that's fine You know.

129
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,690
Scott: at least you got to respect the fact that you know.

130
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:28,046
Scott: A company like Atari is now just like a part of another company that gets bought and sold and traded around Activism Spanish hall Activision is still its own company owned by no one at least.

131
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:28,890
Scott: I'm pretty sure they are.

132
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,786
Rym: So yeah, our listeners will probably correct us.

133
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:35,505
Scott: if Scott is wrong I'm pretty sure that they're just their own game publisher owned by no one.

134
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:40,921
Scott: So Yeah, they put out a study about game advertising and no one trusted it.

135
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:46,101
Scott: So now com score media metrics Confirms the earlier findings.

136
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:50,221
Rym: I still think that you study That's a really funny name for a for a place that does study.

137
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,570
Scott: all the companies that do studies have names like that.

138
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,541
Rym: here's the thing is a lot of the ones that have the really long names like that are more or less study for hire and I'm real dubious.

139
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,289
Rym: If anything they do.

140
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:10,810
Scott: Anyway, the study says and this is the reason I believe it is because the numbers make sense Is that heavy gamers people who play at least 16 hours of video games a week?

141
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,379
Rym: There's probably a joke about heavy gamers and fat game.

142
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,310
Scott: Yeah something they were the most receptive to in-game advertising.

143
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:48,457
Scott: By most receptive they mean that 37% only 37% of heavy gamers agreed that the inclusion of ads makes games more realistic and in terms of light and medium gamers only 27% of them agreed that advertising makes games more realistic which means that 63% of hardcore gamers and 73% of hardcore gamers do not agree that Realistic, you know ads make games more realistic.

144
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:48,638
Scott: Now.

145
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:50,282
Rym: I got a question about this up.

146
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,187
Rym: Why did they need a study?

147
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,339
Rym: Yeah, that's Common fucking sense.

148
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,989
Scott: Well, you know when they first.

149
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:11,850
Scott: the topic of in-game Advertising has been pretty hot in the past six months to a year or so and when it first came up I thought you know ads in games aren't necessarily bad when they match the real world.

150
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,419
Scott: I mean it makes a lot.

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,170
Scott: it really takes you out of a game.

152
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,110
Scott: Sometimes you need to drive down a highway in a game and the billboard says like, you know bake Oh something something and make up some phony product name.

153
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,973
Scott: That's so phony.

154
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:30,019
Scott: you just sticks out like a sore thumb and kind of ruins the you know, the atmosphere Yeah, and I gotta say even in movies.

155
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:37,830
Rym: I always hated it when someone was drinking, you know Unlabeled soda because Pepsi and Coke wouldn't let him use the logo, but at the same time, you know all that BS.

156
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,485
Rym: Yeah, exactly what I'm talking about, you know, I mean sometimes a guy drinks a dr.

157
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,569
Scott: Pepper let him pick his dr.

158
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:42,850
Scott: Pepper.

159
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:49,449
Scott: Yeah and there have been a lot of games in the past that have had in-game advertising like Ninja Turtles 2 had all those Pizza Hot ads.

160
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,340
Scott: but those Pizza Hot ads made sense because well the Ninja Turtles ate pizza and They were just billboards on the wall in the game.

161
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,926
Scott: They didn't stick out like sore thumbs.

162
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:58,870
Scott: They didn't ruin the game.

163
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,070
Rym: Yeah, I mean if I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and there's real billboards, I'd have no problem with that.

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,308
Scott: In fact, I just uncovered the Ninja Turtles 2 arcade version for the NES.

165
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,614
Scott: Oh Instruction book recently.

166
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:16,231
Scott: on the back of it is a coupon for a free personal pan pizza that expired in 1991 1991.

167
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:29,901
Scott: I think in 2011 20 years after that coupon expired I'm gonna go to a Pizza Hut and try to use the coupon with some sort of hidden HD camera And if YouTube still exists, we're gonna YouTube that at business.

168
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,370
Scott: Yeah, maybe we should just use it now while we still can.

169
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:33,053
Scott: I don't know.

170
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:35,687
Rym: Yeah now the problem I have with the study is that they really.

171
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:39,010
Rym: I mean It seems like they just asked if you let like ads in games or not.

172
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,134
Rym: But I mean it.

173
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:47,138
Rym: the context of the ad and the way the ad is used matters a lot more Than any other issue at stake here.

174
00:11:47,719 --> 00:12:01,657
Rym: Yeah, and also the article goes on to talk about how Actually, this advertising generates a grand total of one to two dollars of profit per title sold Mmm, now they also make the point.

175
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:08,169
Scott: if you compare that to the number of people who aren't gonna buy the game because of ads You're probably gonna end up losing money not making money.

176
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:17,769
Rym: Well, they also point out if that's all it makes why not have an advertising version and then a non advertising version for a dollar fifty more?

177
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,421
Rym: Hey, see which one people buying up.

178
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,510
Rym: Maybe it didn't need the advertising one at all.

179
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,209
Scott: Yeah, maybe I think that you know.

180
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:32,590
Scott: The problem here is that if people put ads in games that were tasteful and correct No one would even notice or complain.

181
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:42,243
Scott: Maybe some you know blog would notice and write a thing about it and most people would go and like if you went into a Bar in a game and the neon signs said bud Coors and Miller.

182
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:43,547
Scott: No one would you know it?

183
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,810
Scott: that's how bars look.

184
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,780
Scott: That's how every bar in the country is like that.

185
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,207
Scott: You know, that's just fine.

186
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:48,670
Scott: Who cares?

187
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,016
Rym: All right counterpoint.

188
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:58,910
Rym: not not that I agree with this, but here's why One all these companies and in general, this is a big problem with IP law that I think should be rectified.

189
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:09,770
Rym: I am of the mind that if you create an advertisement That is shown publicly and published that it should be able to be used in any medium by anyone for any purpose.

190
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:16,990
Rym: Because now you have a situation where a company has you know, they're advertising copy out there billboard something.

191
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:23,050
Rym: But if you're filming a movie and that billboard is in that movie the or that guy's drinking that kind of soda.

192
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:24,858
Rym: You can't do that.

193
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,770
Rym: The company usually won't let you do it without permission.

194
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:35,670
Rym: So instead in whenever you're gonna have a product placement, you know They say drink a can of soda instead of just having it be whatever kind of soda they had in the fridge.

195
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:45,994
Rym: They have to go and you know say Pepsi Will you pay us to let your product be featured and it ends up being a product placement instead of just a product that happened To be used.

196
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:51,519
Scott: Yeah, but regardless of what's going on behind the scenes, you know It's all about when you're playing a video game.

197
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,704
Scott: You want to stay immersed.

198
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:55,397
Scott: You don't want to be taken out of the game Just like when you're watching a movie.

199
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,254
Scott: you want to be taken into the movie, you know We're like.

200
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,912
Scott: you don't even see the people sitting in front of you like, you know the.

201
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,684
Scott: the movie takes up your whole brain, you know, your full attention is in it.

202
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,109
Scott: and that's where you are.

203
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,778
Scott: and You know a fake product can sometimes take you out of that.

204
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:14,430
Scott: but so can you know the obtrusive placement of a real product?

205
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,149
Scott: It has to be toned down.

206
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,653
Scott: Realistic placements of real products or you know, usually tone down places are to keep you immersed, you know, yeah I mean good.

207
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:24,837
Rym: I'm playing counter-strike.

208
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,945
Rym: There's a sprite machine bad.

209
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,230
Rym: I'm playing counter-strike.

210
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:32,264
Rym: There's an ad for World of Warcraft and blazoned on the wall in the middle of the.

211
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,810
Scott: that's exactly what I was gonna say.

212
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:34,844
Scott: Is that you know?

213
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:39,929
Scott: If there was proper in-game advertising, I wouldn't give a shit because I wouldn't even notice it.

214
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:45,250
Scott: But there's a lot of all the in-game advertising that's going on now seems to be bullshit.

215
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,890
Scott: For example, I was playing planetside a long time ago.

216
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,558
Scott: Remember I complained about it and whatever.

217
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:58,930
Scott: in the ready rooms in planetside I think probably because I was playing for free and not paying any money There were these giant castrol GTX ads on the walls.

218
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:00,549
Rym: That's just silly.

219
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:06,590
Scott: It is just silly has no place in that world where they probably don't even need oil and definitely don't need castrol GTX.

220
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:08,337
Scott: And why would they pull me?

221
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,064
Rym: a gamer could make that argument?

222
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:16,530
Scott: I know but Why are there giant ads for the product when you can't even choose products in the game?

223
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,445
Scott: The ads are in the teleportation rooms.

224
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,049
Scott: I mean, come on.

225
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,496
Rym: I think part of the reason should

226
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,042
Scott: they at least be in the vehicle Bay

227
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:30,143
Rym: when it comes to realistic games Would be simply that if the ads in a generally realistic game are in

228
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:30,705
Scott: the same

229
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:36,527
Rym: manner and placement of ads in the real World people would ignore them because people ignore ads in the real world.

230
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,070
Scott: That's true.

231
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:49,650
Scott: Yeah, because a lot of the ads in video games are scooby-doo-ified where they stick out, you know You'll have all these really high-resolution textures and then you'll have this JPEG That's really just slapped on on a wall somewhere.

232
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,701
Rym: I mean worse is like a bright color.

233
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:53,330
Scott: the lighting doesn't affect it.

234
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,559
Scott: You know your bullet marks don't appear on it.

235
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,809
Rym: It's you know, of course if the bullet marks appeared I would be drawing penises in bullet on every ad I saw.

236
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:04,520
Scott: You know your flamethrower doesn't burn it.

237
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,510
Scott: It has to act like everything else in the game.

238
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,447
Scott: It can't be scooby-doo or else it doesn't work.

239
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:14,950
Rym: However, the advertisers usually won't go for that because they don't want their you know logo to be defiled in any way.

240
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:20,810
Scott: They want full total control and they're only making one $2 per copy of the game.

241
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,619
Rym: So so why is it even an issue?

242
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:23,564
Rym: why even bother?

243
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:24,609
Scott: why I have this study?

244
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:32,049
Rym: Because they were trying to sell the viability of advertising in their games to advertisers that they could make money.

245
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:36,843
Rym: Yeah See, everyone always forgets that the advertiser.

246
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:45,190
Rym: It's not the kind of industry you think You are the product being sold by the person who makes the thing to the advertisers.

247
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,246
Rym: You're selling your eyes to the advertisers.

248
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,050
Rym: You're the commodity.

249
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:50,715
Rym: They are the customer.

250
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:53,603
Rym: so they're not trying to please you in this sense.

251
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:58,277
Rym: They're trying to please the advertiser Regardless of what you actually do.

252
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:03,210
Scott: Yeah, they've already got your eyeballs, you know that they're trying to collect your eyeballs.

253
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,056
Scott: They got ice cream scoops.

254
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:08,849
Scott: They pluck them out of your head and then they sell them to somebody.

255
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,425
Rym: You know, I saw a movie once where someone did that.

256
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:15,865
Rym: Yeah Well, they took someone's eye out with a teaspoon and then they took their other eye out with the teaspoon.

257
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,069
Rym: and it happened in Russia.

258
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:18,885
Rym: No idea they already dead.

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,473
Scott: no Okay, enough of that.

260
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:22,840
Scott: I was in my news.

261
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:23,704
Scott: What's your news my news?

262
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,630
Rym: I was in like fifth grade.

263
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,369
Rym: I don't remember anything about the news.

264
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,267
Rym: If any remembers a movie in Russia where a guy gets his eyeballs scooped out with a teaspoon.

265
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:32,110
Scott: What's rooms news?

266
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:33,982
Rym: Why you don't like the eyeball scooping?

267
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:34,648
Scott: Not really?

268
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,950
Rym: No All right, my news will be quick because I don't want to get into too much depth about this.

269
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:45,066
Rym: But New Jersey has had some problems lately, you know, they're in debt because the government is.

270
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,610
Scott: when does New Jersey not have problems?

271
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,570
Rym: Actually, you know people you have Jersey a bad rap.

272
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:54,422
Rym: But once you get past, you know The Newark Jersey City like the area right next to New York.

273
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,289
Rym: the rest of Jersey's not like that.

274
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,036
Scott: Yeah, I know the problem.

275
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:09,250
Scott: The only good thing I can say about New Jersey is that it has boardwalks It has a six flags and it has more comic book stores per square foot than any other state.

276
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:11,958
Rym: No, no, they got cheap gas - all right cheap gas.

277
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,550
Scott: Yes, but it's full serve only so that kind of balances out.

278
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,590
Rym: Yeah, I still don't get full serve.

279
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:23,227
Rym: I mean I see why Jersey does it but I don't like other people pumping my gas.

280
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,315
Rym: Yeah, me either I mean I just kind of.

281
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,430
Rym: in fact, I accidentally today I went to get gas down in the Bronx, right?

282
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,081
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I pull into the gas station and the gas is like 235 a gallon.

283
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:34,674
Rym: All right I'm like hot dams.

284
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:41,149
Rym: I pull in and I start to get out and the guy points up and it says full and I look Around and I realize the whole thing is full service.

285
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:45,663
Rym: Huh and it was weird because it was not New Jersey, yeah, you could.

286
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,650
Scott: there there are full services outside of New Jersey.

287
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,356
Rym: Here's the thing.

288
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,009
Rym: That's the first one I've ever seen.

289
00:18:50,271 --> 00:19:00,733
Scott: I've never had full service outside of New Jersey in my life usually in Connecticut at least You know, most of the gas pumps are like you go to a gas station and one of them will say full and the rest Say so.

290
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,925
Scott: Oh, yeah, you know those old people will go up to the full.

291
00:19:03,086 --> 00:19:03,770
Rym: see where I grew up.

292
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,270
Rym: You know in sterling heights in Detroit.

293
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:09,425
Scott: Oh, you know in Rochester in RIT right next to RIT at that coastal.

294
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,710
Scott: That was all also the mechanic.

295
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,094
Scott: You know that place?

296
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,426
Scott: Yeah, that was a full service only gas station.

297
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,150
Rym: I never went there.

298
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,479
Scott: I know I never went there for gas.

299
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,184
Scott: I went there for my kids.

300
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,632
Rym: It was more expensive I know.

301
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:23,350
Rym: well, no, it's actually cheaper usually but it wasn't cheaper than the place up Scottsville Road a bit.

302
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:31,278
Rym: Anyway, no one cares about that No one cares, but where I grew up every service station had the full service sign But no one actually had full service.

303
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,462
Rym: those signs were just legacy.

304
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:36,020
Rym: if you pulled up and sat there No one would do anything.

305
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,770
Rym: They just stare at you Yeah, which every now and then would happen when some out of stator was driving around.

306
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:53,101
Rym: Yeah, anyway now New Jersey has decided that the best way to get rid of their four point five billion dollar debt Not spend four point five billion dollars on crap.

307
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,947
Rym: Well, the thing is they've already spent it.

308
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,730
Rym: They can't undo it.

309
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,633
Rym: It's not a deficit.

310
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,255
Rym: It's a debt.

311
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,362
Scott: get taxes from people.

312
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,670
Scott: All right, New Jersey has very high property taxes.

313
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,190
Rym: Yeah, it's some of the highest in the country and as a result, they have some of the best schools in the country.

314
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,170
Scott: Yeah and take the money that you don't have to spend on crap and pay off your debt.

315
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,569
Rym: Yeah, but then the government shuts down.

316
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:13,373
Rym: Now here's the thing.

317
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:19,110
Rym: They're the way they're handling this aside from writing a billion parking and speeding tickets everywhere.

318
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,150
Rym: So watch out if you're traveling in Jersey.

319
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:31,908
Rym: But they've decided to one raise the sales tax to seven percent and more importantly Expand the things that sales tax covers.

320
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:40,817
Rym: now you have to pay sales tax on health club memberships security alarms tanning storage space and iTunes music store downloads.

321
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:41,580
Scott: Wait a minute.

322
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:42,022
Scott: Wait a minute.

323
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:47,038
Scott: all those other things I can understand perfectly And I don't know why people weren't paying sales tax on those things before.

324
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,174
Scott: but iTunes music store downloads now one Apple Probably.

325
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,449
Rym: I don't know the deal but they I'll bet they want nothing to do with this.

326
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:56,761
Scott: No, they got nothing to do with

327
00:20:56,802 --> 00:21:09,676
Rym: it, which means that the way Jersey is going to have to enforce this is that you'll have to declare your iTunes music downloads on your tax forms as like a use tax or something and They'll get you if you don't pay it.

328
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,588
Scott: Nah, I just pay the minimum because I'm a wuss.

329
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,993
Rym: now Yeah, I pay them.

330
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:18,065
Rym: Of course the minimum for my income is like a couple bucks.

331
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:18,828
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,068
Rym: Yeah Plus I didn't buy so much online last year.

333
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,678
Scott: It's really so.

334
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:25,050
Scott: eventually someone's gonna have to fix this problem.

335
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:37,370
Scott: Perhaps I think with a federal law because there's a lot of state border crossings going on here with the Internet's That you know finally seals the deal on how we pay sales tax on things online.

336
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,810
Rym: You know if I buy a bunch of stuff on you realize that if you go to a different County and buy something.

337
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:51,611
Rym: Technically you have to pay a use tax because you would have paid the piddly point whatever percent sales tax from the county you lived In.

338
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:57,999
Rym: yeah, but because you left the county you lived in and went to another county to buy something You're somehow ripping off your County.

339
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,210
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about tax law.

340
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:00,814
Scott: No, we're not.

341
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:02,829
Scott: but I'm just saying someone has to fix it.

342
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:09,730
Scott: Sometimes is a problem that's going to eventually jump up and bite everyone in the ass when we're thinking about these more important things.

343
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:18,842
Scott: yeah, it's like after we saw this terrorism bullshit and this DRM and freedom bullshit and Those days are behind us and it's that and it's good times again.

344
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,170
Scott: This is gonna be the problem that comes up next.

345
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:34,770
Rym: Yeah I mean just generally tax sales tax law and use tax enforcement in general because use tax was never enforced Until state started running out of money and then suddenly they started trying to enforce it, but it's impossible to enforce.

346
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:43,887
Rym: So instead of enforcing it, right and having you actually pay it They make you pay a minimum penalty and that way you're basically paying the extortions.

347
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:44,850
Scott: I don't know if it's a penalty.

348
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:53,699
Rym: It's basically you pay an amount of money in order to be protected from having to pay what you actually owe Even though you probably owe less than that minimum.

349
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,430
Scott: Yeah, it's just too much effort to figure it out.

350
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,890
Rym: Here's my other issue about this because we could do a whole show about this stupid thing.

351
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,261
Rym: Now you buy something from iTunes, right?

352
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,370
Rym: It's a DRM file.

353
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,036
Rym: Now do you really own it?

354
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:10,341
Rym: What did you just purchase?

355
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,650
Rym: Are you purchasing a license to listen to that music?

356
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,316
Rym: Are you purchasing the music itself?

357
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:15,843
Rym: Are you purchasing the file?

358
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,330
Rym: How is this going to be taxed?

359
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,999
Rym: What if I give it to someone else?

360
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,070
Rym: do I what if I sell it to someone else?

361
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,680
Rym: What if I trade it with someone else?

362
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,330
Rym: if you start taxing this shit?

363
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,610
Rym: There are so many ramifications that I'm sure John Corzine has never even heard of.

364
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:37,534
Scott: Yeah, I mean he's probably trying to jam his envelope into a tube speaking of which I was gonna use it as news But it's not much to say about it.

365
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,921
Scott: But today is day against DRM.

366
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:44,773
Rym: So, uh, yeah DRM bad Yep so Fire.

367
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:51,535
Scott: but I guess since you know today is already over because most people listen to this the day after as opposed to at night Like they should be listening to it.

368
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,530
Rym: Yeah, cuz everyone, you know is gonna listen to our podcast at 11 o'clock at night.

369
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,535
Scott: Hey in some parts of the world.

370
00:23:57,856 --> 00:23:59,099
Scott: It is 11 o'clock a.m.

371
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,520
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:06,204
Rym: Hey to all of our overseas listeners, especially Australia You are probably the most represented overseas place.

373
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:07,229
Rym: We have yep.

374
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,390
Rym: So and I urge all of you to fly out here and hang out with us.

375
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:19,343
Scott: Yeah, and if you think that your country is has more people listening to us than Australia does then go to frapper Our frapper map and put your stuff there.

376
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:20,710
Rym: Yeah, I want to see a battle.

377
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:23,090
Rym: I want to see if the Australians are really on top or not.

378
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:30,925
Rym: Yeah, but yes, if it's true if Australians are the biggest non-us listener base we have I'll buy a bottle of Foster's and break it for you.

379
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:36,664
Scott: Yeah Anyway, yeah today's anti DRM day day against DRM.

380
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:38,209
Scott: do something against DRM.

381
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,297
Rym: I pirated some music.

382
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:48,237
Scott: Yeah, if you go to defective by design dot org You'll see all the things people have done today or yesterday depending on what day you listen.

383
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:59,247
Rym: things of the day things of the day.

384
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:09,885
Rym: Okay Yeah, I've been fiddling around with music as you could tell from the last several episodes.

385
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:14,876
Rym: cuz I'm thinking of changing up a lot Of the music in season two of GeekNights If you have an opinion on that?

386
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,101
Rym: hit the forums, let us know.

387
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:24,591
Scott: if you are good at making music Try to make music but we want something jazzy kind of like the same kind of music we got now only different Yep.

388
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:30,848
Rym: Anyway, my thing of the day actually lets me tell a story from way back.

389
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:35,944
Rym: This was either 19 like maybe seven or 58.

390
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:38,411
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was 1998.

391
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,956
Rym: Might have been early 1999, but I think it was late.

392
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:40,699
Rym: 1998 was in high school had my car.

393
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:52,030
Rym: Me Ken and Dan, you know the core of our D&D group went to my first LAN party in Southfield, Michigan.

394
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:57,310
Rym: We crammed my Pentium 200 and their computers into my car.

395
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,674
Rym: The car is so small.

396
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:03,090
Rym: Dan had to sit with a 17 inch CRT on his lap for an hour while we drove.

397
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:10,230
Rym: No I had a cell phone with me because my parents were worried something would happen because I'd never driven somewhere like that before.

398
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,615
Rym: I mean I barely had my license.

399
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,503
Rym: Yeah, so I had this brick of a cell phone that had to be plugged into the car to use.

400
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:21,475
Rym: and we go to this LAN party and It was the first time.

401
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:26,670
Rym: I mean I had a ping of like one and I was playing action quake on a LAN.

402
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,093
Rym: It was crazy.

403
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:28,975
Rym: Like that was.

404
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:30,418
Rym: that was amazing.

405
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:37,373
Rym: I couldn't believe how awesome it was to play LAN games on a LAN Like I couldn't.

406
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,118
Rym: also we pirated everything.

407
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:43,510
Rym: everyone copied every program they had every music file they had and we all swapped.

408
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:50,030
Rym: It's what LAN parties were except this one guy who didn't have a big enough hard drive and couldn't get it all.

409
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:55,110
Scott: See if I was going to a LAN party today like that giant ones they have in Sweden Norway and shit.

410
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,066
Scott: You know where this like giant giant convention halls.

411
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:58,810
Scott: It's full of computer.

412
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,810
Rym: Yeah, were you like stake out a spot and live there for a few days?

413
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,082
Scott: You can go online and look at pictures of these things.

414
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:08,588
Scott: if I was going to one of those places I would buy a 300 gigabyte hard drive and bring it with me.

415
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:13,090
Scott: hell I might buy a NAS and bring it with me and it's perfectly empty.

416
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:19,338
Scott: I would format it with it like an XFS partition and fill it up as the week as you know the LAN party could progressed.

417
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:24,170
Rym: so my first LAN party and Towards the end of it, you know, it's winding down.

418
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:42,820
Rym: It's about four in the morning and I'm pretty much totally knocked up on jolt Cola after playing a whole bunch of action quake and weapons factory and Then they decide all right is movie time because one guy had this projector and he was playing quake on the projector Which also blew my mind back then because projectors are common now.

419
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:44,646
Rym: They were not common in the late 90s.

420
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:49,824
Rym: a Projector you could plug into your computer was this crazy expensive amazing thing.

421
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,255
Scott: It was the guys probably a rich He was.

422
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:54,742
Rym: he funded the LAN party.

423
00:27:54,782 --> 00:28:01,790
Rym: We had to pay some pittance to get in And also while we played the big games the projector showed the score the whole time.

424
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,676
Scott: But HLTV is the awesome.

425
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,145
Scott: A lot of people don't know about HLTV.

426
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,897
Scott: That wasn't HLTV I know but I'm not gonna talk about it now.

427
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,524
Rym: Okay, but that wasn't HLTV.

428
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:13,050
Rym: I know I know that was quick, too.

429
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,100
Scott: I was just reminded of the existence of HLTV, which is awesome.

430
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:16,381
Rym: Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,397
Rym: All right, so we're there and it's movie time So they're all talking.

432
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:21,421
Rym: What should we watch?

433
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:23,048
Rym: Let's watch father Frank's best.

434
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,910
Rym: Whoo And none of us have any idea what the hell this guy's talking about.

435
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:32,930
Rym: Then he starts up quick too and he loads a mod and the mod Wasn't a game mod.

436
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:44,382
Rym: It was a mod that basically played out a sitcom called father frags best within quake 2. it was the first encounter I ever had with machinima.

437
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,095
Scott: machinima.

438
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:56,949
Rym: machinima is the idea of taking games and Doing and using the games to create content like using quake 2 the engine of quake 2 to film a movie.

439
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:06,565
Rym: hmm, and Don't bother reading the Wikipedia on this if you are more interested in it because the Wikipedia article is kind of dubious and full of crap.

440
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:13,957
Rym: Maybe I'll rewrite it someday, but this is one of the earliest Well-known machinimas out there.

441
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:18,670
Rym: So you remember Scott's thing of the day yesterday the urinal thing that was machinima - what the Sims?

442
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,709
Scott: Yeah, the Sims in Sim City and whatever.

443
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:30,208
Rym: Yeah, or like there's a very very popular one - uh, you know Avenue Q The internet is for porn - World of Warcraft and is red versus blue with halo and whatever.

444
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,296
Rym: Yep Yep, that is all machinima.

445
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:37,738
Rym: And this is one of the earliest earliest Items of this.

446
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,770
Scott: Yeah is one of the first machinimas.

447
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,610
Rym: I'll warn you it's funny if you're a hardcore gamer and even then not so much.

448
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:46,413
Scott: Yeah, it's.

449
00:29:46,593 --> 00:29:47,858
Scott: it was back in the day.

450
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:50,408
Scott: It was hilarious because things like this didn't exist.

451
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:59,496
Scott: So You shouldn't watch this expecting to be laughing hysterically because unless you're super old-school, yeah, it's like that Hiyama, Kaga juichi thing.

452
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,123
Rym: Yeah, it's not that good.

453
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,690
Scott: It's more that it's like all your base are belong to us.

454
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,717
Scott: It's not funny anymore history lesson.

455
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,784
Rym: It's a museum exhibit exact watching.

456
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,630
Rym: This is seeing a piece of internet history.

457
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:17,450
Rym: Yep, however, if you need Quake 2 to play it because I looked and I didn't see any video mirrors of it.

458
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:27,959
Rym: So you basically have to install Quake 2 which is free And then install this mod and then run the mod And then this thing will play out including outtakes at the end.

459
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:31,106
Rym: Yeah, it is worth watching it is.

460
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:38,249
Scott: All right, so College humor calm has this new awesome video called Street Fighter the later years.

461
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,759
Scott: now It's actually really well done and awesome.

462
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,249
Scott: Like you think it's just gonna be corny, but it looks like you know.

463
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:48,570
Scott: If it was any better, it could be put in a real movie theater.

464
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:53,490
Rym: Yeah, I mean Scott says oh there's a Street Fighter 2 thing on College humor and I think what whatever?

465
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:58,206
Scott: Yeah, so it starts out with these two kids playing Street Fighter in an arcade.

466
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,439
Rym: Yeah, it's like Chun Li versus I know it's Zangief versus Dalsin.

467
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,142
Rym: Oh Dalsin.

468
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:02,403
Rym: Was it?

469
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,267
Scott: Yeah, I think it was.

470
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,688
Rym: I think at that fight It might have been Chun Li.

471
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,383
Scott: No, anyway, so one guy's Zangief and he's like man.

472
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,250
Scott: if this are real I could totally kick your ass.

473
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,090
Scott: He's like what if you were you or if you were a Zangief?

474
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,019
Scott: He's like no if I was Zangief right in the background.

475
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,330
Scott: now you see this janitor with a kind of looks like Zangief.

476
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,130
Scott: He starts crying.

477
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:24,470
Rym: Yeah, especially when the one kids like Zangief's a bitch.

478
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:29,490
Scott: Yeah, and you know, I'm not gonna tell you where it goes from there because what's the point of watching this?

479
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,175
Scott: But it's really well done.

480
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:35,330
Scott: It's really hilarious and there's gonna be more parts, which I can't wait for.

481
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,584
Rym: This is what the Street Fighter movies should have been.

482
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,510
Scott: I think about this.

483
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:45,617
Scott: Yeah, there was a Street Fighter movie a live-action one in the United States With Van Damme and it was ass.

484
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,021
Scott: It's famous for being ass.

485
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:47,803
Scott: I saw it in the theater.

486
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:48,425
Scott: What?

487
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:50,069
Rym: Yeah, fuck's wrong with you.

488
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,254
Scott: Oh, what do I know?

489
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:53,041
Rym: It was such a movie.

490
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,430
Scott: I knew everyone knew it was ass.

491
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,052
Scott: It was ass.

492
00:31:56,173 --> 00:32:00,390
Rym: as you like Jean-Claude Van Damme you watch fucking Bloodsport and that's it kickboxer.

493
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,890
Scott: But no Bloodsport, whatever.

494
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:09,430
Scott: Anyway, some fucking kids on College Humor have made a better movie and it's only they only did five minutes.

495
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,889
Rym: If the rest of its like this though hot damn now, we're not saying better than Street Fighter 2 the anime.

496
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:18,590
Scott: No, no, we're saying better than Street Fighter 2 the American live-action movie.

497
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:23,629
Rym: If this was a trailer for an actual movie, I would see it on opening night.

498
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,679
Scott: I would bootleg it and watch it before opening night.

499
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:27,441
Scott: And then oh, yeah.

500
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,645
Scott: Yeah wait lines.

501
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,450
Rym: I believe that part is unstated.

502
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,198
Scott: Yeah, so go and watch this.

503
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,494
Scott: if you know anything about Street Fighter at all This will be funny.

504
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:41,347
Scott: If you don't know anything about Street Fighter, it's not gonna be as funny But you'll still see how well done it is.

505
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,997
Rym: So on to the main bit.

506
00:32:44,037 --> 00:32:47,490
Rym: we're gonna go back to the original format of gaming day.

507
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:47,972
Rym: Meaning.

508
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,168
Rym: Scott and I are each going to review a separate game kind of anime world order style.

509
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,617
Rym: Holy crap I don't know.

510
00:32:53,677 --> 00:33:04,151
Scott: This is some kind of crazy trend Mmm, or maybe because we both just got into new games or maybe it's because we just have so much stuff to cover that we can't possibly cover it at the rate of one thing per Week.

511
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,785
Rym: or maybe the fact that I'm not gonna talk much about my thing.

512
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:18,518
Rym: Yeah, that could be it too Alright, so I've been waiting for this pretty much since I heard it was coming out and I bought it as soon as was reasonably possible the Capcom classics mini-mix.

513
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:27,588
Rym: It's a Game Boy Advance cartridge that has three Awesome classic games from the NES days, but Rym only cares about one of those games.

514
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:36,882
Rym: Yes effectively I paid $20 which is less than I paid when the fucking game came out for bionic commando aka Hitler no Fukkatsu.

515
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:38,170
Scott: Hitler no Fukkatsu.

516
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:47,509
Rym: now this game is Famous for one being one of the most innovative platformers in the history of early gaming.

517
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:53,634
Rym: Mmm, I mean this is it looks like a normal platformer guy gun gun shoots But here's the.

518
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:56,925
Rym: here's the gimmick guy can't jump at all.

519
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,230
Scott: He's a white man in.

520
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:08,251
Rym: Instead you've got this bionic arm and you can grab things and swing around and the game is mostly Acrobatics.

521
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:15,330
Scott: Yeah, pretty much it's all about shooting the bionic arm in the correct direction with the correct timing.

522
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:24,149
Scott: And that is how you move around in this game and the levels are complex And if you can't manipulate that bionic arm properly, you're not gonna make it very far.

523
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,909
Scott: Did I give enough innuendo with a bionic arm, I think you did okay.

524
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:31,223
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna make a joke about in the right direction.

525
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:31,603
Scott: Yep.

526
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:35,786
Scott: Yeah, right timing Yeah Manipulating the bionic arm.

527
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,056
Rym: Okay Now if you've never played this game.

528
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,864
Rym: find an M or ROM or something and play or no.

529
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,650
Scott: go buy Capcom classics mini mix.

530
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:43,214
Rym: Oh, yeah.

531
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:43,938
Rym: Yeah, I'll get to that.

532
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,668
Rym: Okay, but this game is Absolutely fantastic as in it's one of my favorite games ever.

533
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,415
Rym: Not gonna talk.

534
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:56,315
Rym: I'll do a separate show about bionic commando Because we can talk all about Hitler.

535
00:34:56,335 --> 00:35:03,342
Rym: No, that's not the point here because it also comes with Strider an equally Classic Nintendo game.

536
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,330
Scott: Strider is classic.

537
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:13,484
Scott: however it is the opinion of me and most other people that I have encountered that the Sega Genesis version of Strider is the real Strider and the NES version is kind of a.

538
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,437
Rym: I have not really played either To an extent to where I could make a judgment.

539
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:22,154
Rym: Yes, the game is pretty typically early NES game Strider.

540
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:35,565
Scott: the character is Strider here you who's a very famous character because of these games but you know He you'll often see him in like all the voting for like best video game characters and so and he has.

541
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:39,787
Scott: he's basically like a super pretty shonen boy who?

542
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:46,470
Rym: Yeah, the plot is something like there's lots of fancy swords and our friend Kane has been kidnapped.

543
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:53,602
Scott: Kill him, yeah Lots of fancy jumps and sword slashes while killing robots.

544
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:56,590
Rym: Yeah, it probably make a better anime than a game.

545
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,215
Scott: Yeah, it's a pretty good platformer.

546
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:03,430
Scott: Basically just as good as bionic commando except for the lack of innovative bionic arm manipulation.

547
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:08,227
Rym: I would say no because the controls in Strider are a lot looser than bionic commando.

548
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,968
Rym: Yeah, they are loose But I mean bionic commando is one of the tightest games out there.

549
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:17,839
Scott: But in terms of being a platforming game where you whack stuff and it blows up It's it's kind of it's in the same vein.

550
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,350
Scott: They weren't wrong to put it on the same cartridge.

551
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:25,890
Rym: Yeah, of course the third game on here is mighty final fight now, which is one of the greatest final fights.

552
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:30,150
Rym: I want to say right now in case any of you aren't really up on Japanese sensibilities.

553
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:35,569
Rym: But final fight were some fairly violent walk down the street and beat people up game.

554
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,415
Scott: Yes They're pretty much in those days.

555
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:41,488
Scott: There were two series of walk down the street beat people up games.

556
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:45,333
Scott: There was Final fight and Streets of Rage.

557
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:50,090
Scott: streets of rage is for the Genesis and stuff and final fight was for the NES and SNES.

558
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:54,305
Rym: Yep, I played final fight in the arcade a lot and I only ever played as Haggar.

559
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:55,510
Scott: Yeah streets of rage.

560
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,189
Scott: I actually think the series overall was better.

561
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:04,330
Scott: But any if you're talking about an individual game of walk down the street beat people up River City Ransom.

562
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:17,203
Rym: But besides that final fight 3 I think for the SNES that had the really hot anyway anyway to not get off track Adding mighty do final fight does not make them larger or stronger.

563
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,010
Rym: It makes them super deformed and funny.

564
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,367
Scott: That's what mighty final fight is all about.

565
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,982
Rym: mighty Final final fight is a romp.

566
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:31,444
Rym: you walk to the right Jump kicking people in the face until they die and you repeat it until you've killed everyone.

567
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:33,128
Scott: That's what that game is.

568
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:37,270
Rym: now I'm not gonna review the three games because they're classic games.

569
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,155
Rym: I mean, what am I gonna say?

570
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,729
Rym: I could review them all separately in other shows years from now.

571
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:49,638
Rym: But the actual GBA cartridge is very high quality as in it is 100% faithful to the three games.

572
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:53,850
Rym: you can't save your game, which is the only thing I actually would complain about.

573
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:56,222
Rym: You can't glitch you can't cheat.

574
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:57,850
Rym: You can't do anything.

575
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:00,156
Rym: Basically, you start the ROM.

576
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:08,240
Rym: it is identical to how it was on the Nintendo right down to the slowdowns and the glitches Except for the aspect ratio because you're on a GBA screen.

577
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,070
Rym: Yeah, but yes screen the aspect ratio has changed slightly.

578
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:12,414
Rym: That's it.

579
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:13,678
Rym: Nothing else has changed.

580
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,830
Rym: all the same cheat codes work all the same glitches work.

581
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:26,670
Rym: The games are 100% faithful to the originals Which is a little annoying in the fact that you can't save your game or suspend or anything.

582
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,595
Scott: Yeah, they can be a little annoying.

583
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:34,110
Scott: you expect those sorts of nice tees and you know remakes or re-releases of very old games.

584
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,896
Rym: Of course, it's only 20 bucks.

585
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:37,301
Scott: Yeah 20 bucks.

586
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:39,910
Scott: GBA game brand new three games.

587
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:41,719
Rym: I'd especially recommend it.

588
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,569
Rym: if you've never played bionic commando I mean that game god damn.

589
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:53,690
Rym: Now I wanted to get through that real quick because the more interesting game to talk about today is the game Scott's been playing.

590
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,623
Rym: That I will be playing as soon as I have the ability to do so.

591
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,713
Scott: Yes now I don't know.

592
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,222
Scott: I hope you've seen the movie war games.

593
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,794
Scott: if you haven't seen the movie war games What?

594
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:04,899
Scott: what the fuck's wrong with you?

595
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:06,508
Scott: What kind of what kind of geek are you?

596
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,084
Scott: You know what everyone's seen this movie and you have to see.

597
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,289
Rym: it's sort of like to play a game.

598
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,681
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like a requirement.

599
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,589
Scott: How about a nice game of chess?

600
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:18,924
Scott: It's a really classic movie and in the movie.

601
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:24,423
Scott: There's a computer whatever and At the end the computer is playing this game.

602
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,850
Scott: What's the name of the game?

603
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,798
Scott: It's like global Nuclear war nuclear war.

604
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:38,444
Rym: now aside from the fact that the game the movie war games Made hacker culture known to the masses.

605
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:43,626
Rym: that was the the Inspiration for almost all of the computer geeks out there currently.

606
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:47,349
Rym: Yeah, pretty much I mean the movie showed war dialing right away.

607
00:39:47,731 --> 00:40:03,029
Scott: Anyway, the game thermonuclear war global thermonuclear war show it was basically a map of the world That was like an outline of a map of the world and it had little pictures of missiles with lines behind them showing the trajectories of the ICB M's and the event of a global thermonuclear war.

608
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:08,770
Scott: And it would show up US would get totally blowed up in Russia would get totally blowed up, you know.

609
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,120
Rym: Yeah, I mean this is you know in movies like I don't know.

610
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:22,708
Rym: It was in the Cold War era like Doctor Strange Love one of those the big board where you see, you know Here's what the people actually doing all the big decisions are seeing and the nuclear war blah blah blah.

611
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,714
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that's the thing.

612
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:31,574
Scott: This is made by introversion software the people who brought you uplink and Darwinian I believe in uplink.

613
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:35,186
Rym: There's an easter egg where you can play global thermonuclear war.

614
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:35,567
Scott: Is there?

615
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:36,410
Scott: I don't know if there is.

616
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:38,279
Rym: I read that in multiple places.

617
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,249
Rym: Okay, I didn't play uplink enough to find it.

618
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,213
Scott: Yeah, I was never.

619
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,441
Scott: I wasn't good enough at uplink to get anywhere.

620
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,810
Scott: really I could do a few missions and then I was stuck.

621
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,990
Scott: But the point is that this company is pretty much my hope for PC gaming.

622
00:40:51,791 --> 00:41:00,305
Scott: They are the only people making innovative new PC games and they seem to specialize in taking The way things appear in movies and making them real.

623
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:03,477
Scott: like uplink is Basically a game where you hack.

624
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:07,370
Scott: you hack the same way that people in movies hack not the way people hack in real life.

625
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:16,593
Rym: Yeah you know images of people flying by while you're looking for the file and you see like the red line of the tracer program that's Tracking you down.

626
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:22,490
Scott: Yeah, so that's also a very good game uplink, but Def Con is their new game, which is super cheap.

627
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:27,395
Scott: I mean this thing is $15 on Steam for the full version $15.

628
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,210
Scott: in November, there's gonna be a Linux version.

629
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,362
Scott: You can get like you could just download the game.

630
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,306
Scott: you can download the demo.

631
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,999
Rym: Okay, it's 1750 to download it from the Def Con site.

632
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,570
Scott: Yeah, it's 1750 for the non steam version.

633
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,717
Scott: So get if you if you have steam.

634
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,226
Scott: if you got a steam account, I recommend you use the steam one.

635
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:49,029
Scott: Yep, but This is essentially what you know.

636
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:53,925
Scott: The big war map in the war room is like in a movie only a game.

637
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:57,501
Rym: I just picture, you know But I deny them my essence.

638
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:01,243
Rym: Yeah The game's creepy as fuck.

639
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:12,990
Scott: It's a pretty creepy game I gotta say because you know while the strategy and the play of the game is pretty typical for what you know A very clever RTS that you know doesn't have the same problems every other RTS.

640
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:24,963
Scott: It has this eerie kind of music and you are Nuking the hell out of the whole world and you're getting nuked and it's you know, you hear sometimes it's like really faint screaming I think and but

641
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:29,323
Rym: it's so understated like it's because it's all just kind of this like not really.

642
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:37,109
Rym: it's kind of like what the president of the United States at Least in the movies would be watching as this war went down and the DC got nuked.

643
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:42,257
Rym: Well, he's obviously in like looking glass or something Obviously, but you know be like you.

644
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:54,525
Rym: you click like you click on Tokyo and you just you know Launch ICBM and then you'd like you'll see later like in Russia like launch detected launch detected meaning that they're launching ICBMs and you don't know what's going on.

645
00:42:54,827 --> 00:43:00,050
Rym: and then you know You see your little trajectory and it hits Tokyo and it just there's a white flash not even a flash.

646
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:04,475
Rym: Just a white thing appears and it just says, you know Four million dead.

647
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:10,237
Scott: Yeah, it says like in big square letters like Tokyo 4.1 million dead.

648
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:11,260
Rym: and that's it.

649
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:14,369
Rym: Yeah, actually I love how the game is scarred.

650
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:17,230
Rym: You were scarred in the number of people you kill.

651
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:20,530
Scott: Yeah, you kill people you get points and you get killed you lose points.

652
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:26,285
Rym: Default scoring as other scoring methods unit score is effectively mega deaths.

653
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:30,918
Scott: Yeah, but The game is labeled the world's first.

654
00:43:31,118 --> 00:43:34,087
Scott: genocide them up, which is pretty hilarious.

655
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:37,663
Rym: I say But well, isn't the website I like?

656
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:38,386
Rym: kill them all?

657
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:39,110
Rym: dot-com?

658
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:43,628
Scott: Yeah, but the interesting thing about everybody dies everybody - dies.

659
00:43:43,648 --> 00:43:43,809
Scott: calm.

660
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:51,250
Scott: The reason that this game is so awesome to play is because it's an RTS that doesn't have problems of other RTS.

661
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:51,932
Scott: Is you know how?

662
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:57,630
Scott: if you play Warcraft 3 it's essentially a game of who knows what order to build the units in.

663
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:08,790
Scott: you know who can click the fastest to build the units the fastest and You know who can build a whole bunch of one unit and send them off to destroy the other guys base.

664
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:14,290
Rym: Yep, it's who figured out the click sequence that makes one more tank than the other guy to win the game.

665
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:16,050
Scott: Yeah now in DEFCON is not how it works.

666
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:21,605
Scott: Everyone gets pretty much the same amount of stuff depending on which territory you pick and all that.

667
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:25,040
Scott: but you start with stuff And that's what you get.

668
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:26,349
Scott: You don't get any more than that.

669
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:29,590
Scott: You're never gonna get more nukes or anything like that.

670
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,595
Scott: You get what you get.

671
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:36,101
Scott: you deploy it and you spend it the rest of the game Utilizing it and then it's over now.

672
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,170
Scott: The game starts at DEFCON one.

673
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:42,546
Scott: You then have a few minutes before DEFCON 2, DEFCON 3, DEFCON etc.

674
00:44:44,254 --> 00:44:46,910
Scott: Oh, no, you start game start DEFCON 5 and counts down to one.

675
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:50,888
Scott: So in DEFCON 5 that's when you're deploying stuff.

676
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,110
Scott: now You can set the speed of the game.

677
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,150
Scott: The lowest speed is real time where one second in the game is one second in real life.

678
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:03,450
Rym: Now the Wikipedia claims that people play it in full real time and they spend most of the time diplomacying.

679
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:09,110
Scott: Yeah, if they do that they're crazy because it takes three hours to play that game if you do it in real time.

680
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,262
Rym: Well, it says here they can take up to eight hours.

681
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:11,966
Rym: Oh, wow.

682
00:45:11,986 --> 00:45:17,830
Scott: That's even crazy Yeah, but the point is is that I most people don't play the game in real time.

683
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,023
Scott: At least I haven't ever played in real time all the way through.

684
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,910
Scott: you generally play at a sped up level.

685
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:31,690
Scott: Now the way the speed works is you choose a speed one, two, three or four and in a multiplayer game It goes at the lowest speed voted.

686
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:35,905
Scott: So let's say everyone wants to go at max speed but Rym wants to go at real time.

687
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:37,270
Scott: it goes at real time.

688
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:46,348
Scott: So Rym puts it in a real time does whatever he wants to do and then speeds it up again when he's done Managing whatever he wanted to manage, you know, and I think that's a pretty good system.

689
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:56,550
Scott: actually You know, but so the game goes in DEFCON 5 to 1 and in the early DEFCON's you're building stuff And then there's a boat fight and then does the nuke fight?

690
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,642
Rym: Yep, like pretty much DEFCON 5 and 4 are essentially the same.

691
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:06,850
Scott: Yeah only it doesn't matter It's just DEFCON 4 is sort of like DEFCON 3 is coming up and DEFCON 3 is when the boats fight.

692
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:09,526
Rym: Yep, conventional warfare is authorized.

693
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:14,070
Scott: Yeah, the The boat fight is pretty much where the game is decided.

694
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:25,010
Scott: I've noticed because if your boats survive to the to the later levels They will be able to prevent a lot of nukes from hitting you and they will also be able to deliver a lot of nukes.

695
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:35,770
Scott: So if you put all your boats in an ocean and win that ocean You can now have a serious advantage In terms of nukes going over that ocean, you know.

696
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,169
Scott: And then the game goes on some more and then the ICBMs go and woo.

697
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:46,250
Scott: There's just nukes everywhere and it's all about defending from the nukes and sending the nukes so that they destroy the other guy.

698
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:48,578
Rym: I really want to stress how eerie it is.

699
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,388
Rym: I mean even watching this game is a very eerie experience.

700
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:57,950
Scott: Yeah It's just the theme the music generally and how it looks and it's it's really.

701
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:06,496
Rym: They get the point across and yet at the same time there seems to be enough strategic depth and fun to make the game Incredibly interesting.

702
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:07,218
Scott: there is.

703
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,025
Scott: so it's really strategic.

704
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:15,430
Scott: like this stuff I couldn't even begin to think about like you have these the missile silos.

705
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,237
Scott: Here's an example the missile silos.

706
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:18,782
Scott: when they're not shooting missiles.

707
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:20,830
Scott: They are defending from missiles.

708
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:28,850
Scott: so and if you decide to fire a Missile everyone now knows that there's a silo there because they can detect launches.

709
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:39,268
Scott: So it's sort of like giving up your position when you fire but you're also giving up your position at when you put your defenses down and There's all sorts of other stuff like that.

710
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:48,578
Scott: It just in this radar and there's submarines and there's airplanes and it's that it's out of control But it's actually.

711
00:47:48,598 --> 00:47:51,050
Scott: there's not too many things to manage in the game.

712
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:57,493
Scott: I mean you only have three kinds of buildings and three kinds of boats and that's it It's.

713
00:47:57,654 --> 00:48:08,530
Scott: it is barely anything to manage and if you do the tutorial and you pay attention You'll pretty much be the master of doing everything in the game, but you won't have a strategy that wins at all.

714
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:09,955
Scott: You know, and let's see.

715
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:22,610
Scott: I played this game against the CPU a bunch of times and I played online Four times and the fourth time was a game with a lot of people and I did Okay, but when I played the one-on-one games, I won all three of them.

716
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:30,949
Scott: You know the one complaint I have about the game is it's hard to get a game together Like you'll go online to join a server and the guy will drop out.

717
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:34,282
Rym: This isn't a complaint against the game just the complaint against people playing.

718
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,490
Scott: Yeah, it's like you'll join you'll play against a guy.

719
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,536
Scott: He won't know what he's doing.

720
00:48:37,576 --> 00:48:41,800
Scott: He'll quit you'll see a server You'll try to connect to it and it won't work.

721
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,409
Scott: You have to quit and try another server.

722
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,270
Scott: It's.

723
00:48:44,932 --> 00:48:48,062
Scott: it's generally just sort of a pain to get a game going.

724
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:51,072
Scott: once the game is going with a reliable players You're okay.

725
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:55,670
Rym: Yeah, it seems like you really got to play with reliable people who are dedicated to at least one full game.

726
00:48:55,837 --> 00:49:05,036
Scott: Yeah I think what the ideal a situation is to find your friends and play against them and screw the people on the internet because you Can't realize playing against your friends.

727
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:08,750
Rym: one aspect of the game is that you can form alliances which are even in the game.

728
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,534
Rym: It lets you share rate.

729
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:12,710
Scott: Yeah, you can play with anywhere from two to six people.

730
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:15,809
Scott: So, you know, I played a game that was three on three.

731
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:20,890
Scott: It was three people versus three people, you know, and the Alliance is set up for the beginning and unchanged.

732
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:22,869
Scott: But you know, that's that's not the point.

733
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:30,742
Scott: but it could play a game of six, you know six individual players and You make alliances and break alliances in the game.

734
00:49:30,923 --> 00:49:32,390
Rym: Yeah, and it's an actual game mechanic.

735
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:38,070
Rym: But the thing is while you can do all the alliances you want There is no such thing as an allied victory.

736
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,872
Rym: So in the end the Alliance will end in a traitor because it has to yep It's it.

737
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:46,581
Scott: only one person wins and that's whoever gets the most kills.

738
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:55,422
Rym: so I could see spending like four hours Playing this game with all your friends with the full-on Negotiating with each other like Scott we could.

739
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,290
Rym: we have to gang up and take out cops.

740
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:02,830
Rym: Yeah, because he's a he's a renegade and that that East Asian co prosperity sphere can't stand to be there any longer.

741
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:11,670
Scott: There are lots and lots of advanced play options But I haven't even begun to explore them yet because I'm still not done with the regular play option yet.

742
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:20,026
Rym: so I guess in closing check this game out and Probably in a month or two once more people have played it and we've played it a lot.

743
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:21,130
Rym: We'll talk about it again.

744
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:24,450
Rym: Maybe a sort of final thoughts once we figured it out.

745
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,210
Scott: Well, there's a demo of the game that I urge everyone to get even if you're not gonna.

746
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,710
Scott: I mean this thing runs at a Pentium 600 megahertz processor.

747
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:32,312
Rym: You know what?

748
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:34,540
Rym: It doesn't run it with a GeForce to Linux.

749
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,226
Scott: It will in November in November.

750
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,956
Scott: There's a Linux version They'll be.

751
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:39,289
Scott: so don't worry about that.

752
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:41,719
Scott: It's another introversion.

753
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:46,037
Scott: software is very good about supporting Linux But the demo version.

754
00:50:46,438 --> 00:50:50,870
Scott: the biggest caveat of the demo version is that in a multiplayer game?

755
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:53,579
Scott: Only one player can be a demo player.

756
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,840
Scott: So if you get the demo and your friend gets to the demo You can't play against each other.

757
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:09,030
Scott: It doesn't work But you can play against me because I bought the game Just two of your friends who have the demo and me couldn't play together because there's more than one demo player.

758
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,014
Scott: Did I get that across?

759
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:11,600
Rym: I think you got it across.

760
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,363
Scott: Okay, that's.

761
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:16,324
Scott: I think that's a pretty clever way to Differentiate the demo from the full version.

762
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:19,879
Scott: Yeah Yeah, sorry Def Con is an awesome game.

763
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:25,911
Scott: If you haven't seen war games, you need to go see that movie ASAP and And Download this game.

764
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:36,027
Rym: and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
